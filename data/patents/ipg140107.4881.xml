<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to supplemental heating and cooling devices, especially for forced air heating systems in buildings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to provide auxiliary or supplemental heating devices in rooms that tend to be cooler than the rest of a home or building, or in rooms in which a higher temperature is desired. Such supplemental heaters may be placed directly in the room or may be positioned in an air duct that is adapted to supply heat from the home's standard or traditional furnace to the room.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, some of these types of devices must be manually activated and deactivated. Even if such a device is adapted to be activated automatically, the components of the device, such as a heater or a fan, etc., are typically not adapted to be activated and deactivated individually. Further, these types of devices are not adapted to also assist in cooling the room-when the temperature in the room is warmer than desired. Additionally, with respect to devices adapted to be mounted in an air duct, several safety issues and fire hazards can arise, such as overheating of the air in the duct or of the heating device itself.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The embodiments of the present invention provide an electric heating and cooling device adapted to supplement a standard or traditional furnace or cooling system that supplies heated or cooled air to a room through at least one air duct extending therefrom. The heating and cooling device is adapted to be at least partially mounted in the air duct and includes an electric heater, a fan adapted to blow air through the duct, and a housing for containing the electric heater and fan. The heating and cooling device also includes a thermostat for selecting a desired temperature in the room and detecting a temperature in the room. A control is electrically connected to the thermostat and to the electric heater and fan for activating and deactivating the electric heater and fan based on input from the thermostat. The control automatically activates the electric heater when a temperature detected in the room is lower than the desired temperature. Further, the control automatically activates the fan when the temperature detected in the room is higher or lower than the desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The heating and cooling device also includes a discharge air temperature sensor adapted to deactivate the electric heater when the temperature of air being discharged from the air duct is higher than a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 70 degrees Celsius. Additionally, a safety temperature limit switch is included to deactivate the electric heater when the temperature of the electric heater is higher than a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 111 degrees Celsius. The safety temperature limit switch is automatically reset to allow activation of the electric heater when the electric heater cools to a temperature below the limit temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Optionally, the control deactivates the electric heater and fan when the temperature detected by the thermostat in the room is higher than or equal to the desired temperature. The control may also deactivate the fan when the temperature detected in the room by the thermostat is equal to the desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to the discharge air temperature sensor and safety temperature limit switch, and in the case that these two safety devices fail to prevent overheating of the device, the heating and cooling device may include a fusible link, or thermal cut out, which physically breaks or otherwise interrupts the electric current from or between the control to the electric heater and the fan when the temperature of the electric heating and cooling device exceeds a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 1 to 5 degrees Celsius higher than that of the safety temperature limit switch, such as, for example, 113 degrees Celsius. The heating and cooling device is not operable when the fusible link is broken. Optionally, an automatically resettable temperature limit control detects radiant and/or convective heat from the heater, and may be used in place of the safety temperature limit switch and fusible link. The automatically resettable temperature limit control deactivates the electric heater when the temperature at the limit control is higher than a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 65 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Optionally, the control may comprise an electrical circuit on a circuit board. A conduit may be attached or mounted to the housing of the device for containing wiring adapted to electrically connect the electric heater and the fan to the control or circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the heating and cooling device may be connected to the air duct via a vibration insulator sleeve that includes a cylindrical hollow fabric member for absorbing sound and vibration from the device. The vibration insulator sleeve includes a coated fabric, such as vinyl or fiberglass fabric coated with silicone, polychloroprene, or chlorosulfonated polyethylene, that is looped and heat-sealed to form the cylindrical hollow fabric member. The sleeve may be flexible and axially collapsible to facilitate installation of the sleeve and the heating and cooling device in a gap in an air duct.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another embodiment of the invention, a method of heating and cooling a room is provided. The room is primarily heated by a furnace that is adapted to supply heated air to the room through at least one air duct. The method includes mounting an electric heating and cooling device in the at least one air duct, the electric heating and cooling device including an electric heater, a fan, and a housing for containing or supporting the electric heater and fan. The method further includes selectively adjusting a thermostat, which is electrically connected to or in communication with the heating and cooling device, to a temperature desired in the room, and detecting a temperature in the room. The electric heater and fan are automatically activated when the desired temperature is higher than the temperature detected in the room. The fan is also automatically activated when the desired temperature is lower than the temperature detected in the room to blow cool air, or air that is at a temperature lower than the air in the room, through the air duct into the room.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the method may include deactivating the electric heater when the desired temperature sensed by the thermostat is lower than or equal to the temperature detected in the room and deactivating the fan when the desired temperature is equal to the temperature detected in the room.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, a discharge air temperature sensor may deactivate the electric heater when a temperature of air discharged from the air duct is higher than a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 70 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, a safety temperature limit switch may deactivate the electric heater when a temperature of the electric heater exceeds a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 111 degrees Celsius. The safety temperature limit switch automatically resets to allow the electric heater to operate when the electric heater cools to a temperature below the limit temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optionally, the method may include breaking a fusible link to interrupt the electric current from a control adapted for activating and deactivating the electric heater and the fan. The fusible link is automatically broken when the electric heating and cooling device exceeds a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 113 degrees Celsius. The electric heating and cooling device is prevented from operating after the fusible link is broken, such that the fusible link must be replaced to allow the electric heating and cooling device to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, the inline duct supplemental heating and cooling device of the present invention provides heated and/or cooled air, and/or air at a temperature lower than that in the room to a room in a building that is typically cooler or warmer than the remaining rooms in the building. For example, the device provides supplemental heated air to rooms that are a great distance or remote from the furnace positioned at the end of the heating duct, or to rooms that are larger or contain a number of windows and are, therefore, more difficult to heat. Further, the electric heater and fan are adapted to be activated and deactivated individually, such that the device is adapted to operate in &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; mode to increase air circulation to assist in cooling the room when the temperature in the room is warmer than desired. Because the device is adapted to use the existing duct work of a building, additional ducts are not required. In addition, the device may include three levels of protection, i.e., three separate safety devices, to prevent overheating of heater air or the device itself, even in the case of circuit board failure. The device may be mounted to an existing air duct via a vibration insulator sleeve that is flexible and collapsible, and which absorbs sound and vibration from the device to provide quiet operation and facilitate installation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other objects, advantages, purposes and features of the present invention will become apparent upon review of the following specification in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings and the embodiments illustrated therein, a system <b>10</b> for heating and cooling or conditioning a space, such as a room in a home or other building, includes an electric heating and cooling device <b>12</b> adapted to supplement a traditional or standard furnace <b>14</b> or air conditioner <b>14</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Heating and cooling device <b>12</b> is adapted to be at least partially mounted in an air duct, such as air duct <b>16</b> of a forced air duct system, which extends from furnace <b>14</b> or a cooling unit <b>14</b>&#x2032; for transferring heated or cooled air to a room <b>22</b>. Device <b>12</b> is especially useful for rooms that may be remote from furnace <b>14</b> (or an air conditioning unit <b>14</b>&#x2032; that may be connected to and use duct system <b>16</b>) at or near the end of duct system <b>16</b>, where heating and/or cooling is/are less efficient than for rooms closer to furnace <b>14</b> and/or cooling unit <b>14</b>&#x2032;. Device <b>12</b> may also be useful for rooms that are large or that have a number of windows, which may make such rooms difficult to heat and/or cool.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, heating and cooling device <b>12</b> includes an electric heater assembly or heater <b>28</b> having a plurality of resistance type heating devices <b>29</b> and a fan <b>30</b> adapted to blow heated or cooled air from furnace <b>14</b> or cooling unit <b>14</b>&#x2032; through duct <b>16</b>. Device <b>12</b> also includes a housing <b>34</b> that contains or supports heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b> therein. A thermostat <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>) is provided for selecting a desired temperature in room <b>22</b> and detecting a temperature in room <b>22</b> and is connected to a control <b>36</b> for device <b>12</b>, as explained more fully below. Control <b>36</b> is electrically connected to thermostat <b>24</b> via a wire <b>26</b> or via a wireless connection, and to heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b>, for activating and deactivating one or more of heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b> based on input from thermostat <b>24</b>. For example, when the actual or current temperature detected in room <b>22</b> by thermostat <b>24</b> is lower than the desired temperature set on thermostat <b>24</b>, control <b>36</b> automatically activates heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b>, to blow heated air from both furnace <b>14</b> and heater <b>28</b> through duct <b>16</b> into room <b>22</b>. Control <b>36</b> also automatically activates fan <b>30</b> when the temperature detected in room <b>22</b> is higher than the desired temperature set on thermostat <b>24</b>, i.e., when heater <b>28</b> is not activated, such that fan <b>30</b> blows air through duct <b>16</b> to ventilate and cool room <b>22</b>, especially when system <b>10</b> includes an air conditioning unit <b>14</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Heating and cooling device <b>12</b> also includes safety devices to prevent overheating of both heater <b>28</b> and the air in duct <b>16</b>. Specifically, a discharge air temperature sensor <b>40</b> positioned in duct <b>16</b> downstream from fan <b>30</b> is connected to control <b>36</b> and is adapted to deactivate heater <b>28</b> when the temperature of air being discharged from duct <b>16</b> is higher than a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be set in the range of approximately 70 degrees Celsius. Discharge air temperature sensor <b>40</b> may be of the type sold under part number F1107025ACFA06E by Cantherm, having a place of business at 8415 Mountain Sights Avenue, Montreal (Quebec), H4P 2B8 Canada (http://www.cantherm.com). Heating and cooling device <b>12</b> also includes a temperature limit control or safety temperature limit switch <b>42</b> adapted to deactivate heater <b>28</b> when the temperature immediately adjacent heater <b>28</b> reaches a certain temperature that is selectively chosen as a limit temperature, which may be set in the range of approximately 111 degrees Celsius. Safety temperature limit switch <b>42</b> is adapted to automatically reset when the temperature immediately adjacent heater <b>28</b> cools to a temperature below the limit temperature, to allow or resume operation of heater <b>28</b>. Thus, safety temperature limit switch <b>42</b> is not required to be manually reset or replaced once it has been activated. Limit switch <b>42</b> may be of the type sold by Holmes, Inc., having a place of business at 1605 George Dieter #688, El Paso, Tex. 79936 (http://www.holmesproducts.com).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Housing <b>34</b> may be formed from galvanized sheet metal, polyvinyl coated ductwork or other similar material and may be formed in any suitable shape adapted to contain heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b>. Housing <b>34</b> is preferably adapted to be mounted in a standard air duct, such as a standard six inch, seven inch, or eight inch round, metal supply duct. For example, housing <b>34</b> may be formed from six inch polyvinyl coated ductwork (PCD) spiral pipe, or from any . other material adapted to withstand heat from heater <b>28</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, housing <b>34</b> is generally cylindrical and hollow, and contains open ends, such that housing <b>34</b> is adapted to allow air to flow therethrough. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, heated air flowing from furnace <b>14</b> flows through a connection corner duct <b>18</b> into duct <b>16</b>, and through housing <b>34</b> of heating and cooling device <b>12</b>, and continues to flow through duct <b>16</b> in a direction A toward supply register <b>20</b> in room <b>22</b>. Housing <b>34</b> is mounted in duct <b>16</b> such that air flows in direction A first toward heater <b>28</b> and then into fan <b>30</b> and toward supply register <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Heater <b>28</b> of heating and cooling device <b>12</b> may be any suitable heating device adapted to be mounted or at least partially positioned or contained in housing <b>34</b>. For example, heater <b>28</b> may be a selectable 500, 1000, or 1500 watt open coil, resistance type, electric heating device or assembly, which are known in the art and which may be supplied by Holmes, Inc., having a place of business at 1605 George Dieter #688, El Paso, Tex. 79936 (http://www.holmesproducts.com). Heater <b>28</b> may be a standard heating device or may be customized for optimal performance in heating and cooling device <b>12</b>,</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Fan <b>30</b> may be any suitable fan adapted to blow air through duct <b>16</b> and adapted to be at least partially mounted or positioned in housing <b>34</b>. Like heater assembly <b>28</b>, fan <b>30</b> may be customized to work with heater <b>28</b> to provide optimal performance of heating and cooling device <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, fan <b>30</b> is a variable, multi-speed circulating rotary fan having a diameter adapted to fill 90 to 95% of the diameter of housing <b>34</b>. For example, the blades of fan <b>30</b> may have a diameter of 5.5 inches when being installed in a six inch round supply duct. Fan <b>30</b> may be powered by any standard C-frame motor <b>32</b> via shaft <b>33</b> and may be of the type sold under model number FP-108CXS1 by Commonwealth, having a place a business at No. 4 Alley 6 Lane 174 HSIN-Ming Rd., Nei-Hu, Taipei, Taiwan R.O.C. (http://www.cic-commonwealth.com.tw). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, in another embodiment that will be discussed in more detail below, fan <b>130</b> comprises a tube-axial fan.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The fan of the heating and cooling device <b>12</b> is adapted to assist in both the heating and cooling of the room. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fan <b>30</b> is positioned or mounted in housing <b>34</b> to assist in blowing heated air from both heater <b>28</b> and furnace <b>14</b> through duct <b>16</b> in a direction A toward a supply register <b>20</b> in room <b>22</b>. Similarly, when a cooling unit such as air conditioning unit <b>14</b>&#x2032; is connected to duct <b>16</b>, fan <b>30</b> assists in blowing cooled air, at a temperature cooler than the temperature of the room <b>22</b>, through duct <b>16</b>. Further, fan <b>30</b> is adapted to be activated on its own, i.e., when heater <b>28</b>, furnace <b>14</b> and/or air conditioning unit <b>14</b>&#x2032; are all deactivated or when a furnace or air conditioning unit is not included in the system. For example, control <b>36</b> may cause fan <b>30</b> to automatically operate in &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; mode when the temperature detected in the room is higher than the desired temperature set on thermostat <b>24</b>, to ventilate and increase air circulation in room <b>22</b> to assist in cooling room. <b>22</b> to the desired temperature. Thus, control <b>36</b> may automatically activate fan <b>30</b> to assist the operation of either a furnace <b>14</b> or an air conditioning unit <b>14</b>&#x2032;, or may activate fan <b>30</b> to operate on its own to ventilate room <b>22</b> or improve air circulation in room <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Control <b>36</b> may be any suitable electrical control circuit, such as a circuit board, which may be specially configured or customized to control heating and cooling device <b>12</b>. As discussed above, control <b>36</b> functions to regulate the operation or the activation and deactivation of heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b> based on input from thermostat <b>24</b>, which may comprise any standard thermostat commonly known in the art, such as a 24 V.A.C. heating and/or cooling thermostat. Optionally, and to facilitate installation, a wireless thermostat may be used, such as the T8665A Chronotherm&#xae; IV Deluxe Programmable Wireless Thermostat, supplied by Honeywell, having a place of business at 1985 Douglas Drive North, Golden Valley, Minn. 55422 (www.honeywell.com/yourhome). Control <b>36</b> compares the desired temperature set on thermostat <b>24</b> with the actual or current temperature detected in room <b>22</b> and activates heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b> until the desired warmer temperature is reached, and also deactivates the heater when the temperature detected in the room is higher than or equal to the desired temperature, as discussed above. Because the fan assists in both heating and cooling or ventilating room <b>22</b>, control <b>36</b> deactivates fan <b>30</b> only when the temperature detected in the room is equal to the desired temperature set on thermostat <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Optionally, other thermostats may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, a two-stage thermostat may be used which initially activates the heating and cooling device to raise or lower the temperature of a room, and if additional heating or cooling is needed to bring that room to the desired room temperature, the thermostat activates the building's main furnace or air conditioner as needed. Optionally, two or more heating and cooling devices may be installed in different air ducts serving the same room, and controlled by a single thermostat.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which illustrates a circuit diagram of control <b>36</b>, the action of switching power from R circuit <b>48</b> to W circuit <b>50</b> will energize relay <b>1</b> (designated by numeral <b>52</b>) to switch power to the 0.5 kw terminal <b>54</b> and 1 kw terminal <b>56</b> to send power to heater <b>28</b>, assuming that all three safety limit switches are closed. Such an action would not be permitted if one of the safety limit switches is open. Simultaneously, while R circuit <b>48</b> and W circuit <b>50</b> are closed, relay <b>2</b> (designated by numeral <b>58</b>) is energized, thus switching power to the fan L<b>1</b> out terminal <b>60</b> to send power to fan <b>30</b>. Power to fan <b>30</b> may also be provided by the action of switching power from R circuit <b>48</b> to Y/G circuit <b>62</b>, which will energize relay <b>2</b> (<b>58</b>) to switch power to the fan L<b>1</b> out terminal <b>60</b> to send power to fan <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Optionally, a cover or enclosure <b>38</b> may be provided to protect the control or circuit board. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, control <b>36</b> is enclosed or contained within control enclosure <b>38</b>, which may be part number 50-1289-1, supplied by Magnecraft, having a place of business at 191 Waukegan Rd, Ste. 206, Northfield, Ill. 60093-2743 (http://www.magnecraft.com).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, in addition to the two safety devices discussed above, namely, discharge air temperature sensor <b>40</b> and safety temperature limit switch <b>42</b>, heating and cooling device <b>12</b> may also include a thermal cut-out or fusible link <b>44</b>, which, when broken, physically breaks or otherwise, interrupts the electric current from control <b>36</b> to heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b>. Fusible link <b>44</b> may be set to break when the temperature exceeds a selectively chosen limit. temperature, which may be approximately 1 to 5 degrees Celsius higher than that of the safety temperature limit switch, such as, for example, approximately 113 degrees Celsius. Fusible link <b>44</b> disables heating and cooling device <b>12</b> to prevent overheating and a possible fire hazard in the case of circuit board malfunction or failure, for example. When fusible link <b>44</b> is broken, heating and cooling device <b>12</b> is unable to operate until the broken fusible link has been replaced. Thus, unlike safety temperature limit switch <b>42</b>, fusible link <b>44</b> is not adapted to be automatically reset when heating and cooling device <b>12</b> cools to a temperature below the limit temperature. Typically, fusible link <b>44</b> is selected to interrupt the electrical current to heater <b>28</b> and fan <b>30</b> at a temperature approximately 1 to 3 degrees higher than limit switch <b>42</b> and operates as an ultimate fail-safe shut off. Fusible link <b>44</b> may be supplied by Holmes; Inc., having a place of business at 1605 George Dieter #688, El Paso, Tex. 79936 (http://www.holmesproducts.com).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, heating and cooling device <b>12</b> may include a conduit <b>46</b> adapted to contain the wiring that electrically connects the electric heater and fan to the control or circuit board. In the illustrated embodiment, conduit <b>46</b> is attached or mounted at one end to housing <b>34</b> and extends around or about housing <b>34</b> to control enclosure <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternately, in another embodiment of the invention, the wiring from the heater and the fan may lead directly from the housing into control enclosure <b>38</b>, such that an external conduit is not required. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, a heating and cooling device <b>112</b> includes a housing <b>134</b> and a control enclosure <b>138</b> that is mounted or attached thereto. Wiring from a heater <b>128</b> having electrical resistance coils <b>129</b> and a tube-axial fan <b>130</b>, which are both mounted in the housing, leads directly from housing <b>134</b> into control enclosure <b>138</b>, which houses or contains control <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Tube-axial fan <b>130</b> is different from fan <b>30</b> described above because tube-axial fan <b>130</b> is mounted in a tube or cylinder <b>132</b> to increase the efficiency of the fan. Heating and cooling device <b>112</b> may be otherwise similar to heating and cooling device <b>12</b>, described above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optionally, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, a heating and cooling device <b>212</b> is adapted to supplement a traditional or standard furnace or air conditioner and includes a fan unit <b>230</b> positioned downstream of a heater unit <b>228</b>. Fan unit <b>230</b> and heater unit <b>228</b> are positioned inside a housing <b>234</b> and controlled by a controller <b>236</b> mounted to an exterior surface of housing <b>234</b> via fasteners <b>237</b>. Optionally, a vibration insulator sleeve <b>264</b> (FIG. <b>10</b>) is coupled to one or both ends of housing <b>234</b> to facilitate mounting of device <b>212</b> to a duct and to isolate noises produced by device <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fan unit <b>230</b> includes an anti-crush ring <b>266</b> surrounding fan blades <b>268</b> to protect the fan blades from accidental damage or seizing due to improper handling prior to installation of device <b>212</b>. An electric motor <b>232</b> is supported by support members <b>266</b><i>a </i>within anti-crush ring <b>266</b>, and is operable in response to controller <b>236</b> to drive fan blades <b>268</b>. Anti-crush ring <b>266</b> may be an aluminum casting or other formed metal member that sufficiently resists accidental compression of the housing <b>234</b> in the vicinity of fan unit <b>230</b>. A discharge air temperature sensor <b>240</b> is mounted to one of support members <b>266</b><i>a </i>and functions in substantially the same way as air temperature sensor <b>40</b>, described above. Optionally, other sensors or limiters, such as a safety temperature limit switch and/or a fusible link, such as those described above, may be used to limit or prevent overheating or overvoltage conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Heater unit <b>228</b> is positioned upstream of fan unit <b>230</b>, and may function in substantially the same manner as electric heater <b>28</b>. Heater unit <b>228</b> includes a plurality of radially-arranged and spaced fins or louvers <b>229</b> with holes <b>229</b><i>a </i>for supporting a plurality of resistance type heating devices or heater wires (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, for clarity) that are substantially the same as resistance type heating devices <b>29</b>, described above, and arranged substantially as shown with reference to coils <b>129</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. By positioning heater unit <b>228</b> upstream of fan unit <b>230</b>, heater unit <b>228</b> is exposed to relatively non-turbulent air from the duct, rather than relatively turbulent air from fan blades <b>268</b>, in order to more uniformly transfer heat from the heater wires to the air that is drawn past the wires by fan unit <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A safety temperature limit switch or temperature limit control <b>244</b> is positioned on or adjacent one of fins <b>229</b> for detecting radiant heat and/or air temperature immediately downstream of the heater wires, and may serve to deactivate the heater wires if the air temperature exceeds a selected limit, such as about 65 degrees Celsius. Temperature limit control <b>244</b> may serve substantially the same function and be used in place of fusible link <b>44</b> and safety temperature limit switch <b>42</b>, whereby temperature limit control <b>244</b> interrupts the electric current from control <b>236</b> to heater unit <b>228</b> and/or fan unit <b>230</b> when excessive radiant and/or convective heat is detected, such as due to a failed fan unit <b>230</b>. Temperature limit control <b>244</b> may be a fully automatically resettable limit controller that permits resumed operation of device <b>212</b> after the temperature detected at control <b>244</b> drops to an acceptable level.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Optionally, two or more electrically isolated sets of heating wires are provided to permit selecting a desired heat output of heater unit <b>228</b>. For example, heater unit <b>228</b> may operate with only a relatively low-powered set of heater wires or only a relatively high-powered set of heater wires. The desired heater wires may be selected by installing a jumper or toggling a switch on controller <b>236</b>. Optionally, both sets of heating wires may be operated simultaneously to maximize the heat output of heater unit <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Controller <b>236</b> includes an electronic control or circuit board <b>270</b> that is mounted to housing <b>234</b> and may be electrically isolated therefrom by spacer lugs <b>272</b>. Circuit board <b>270</b> includes a low-voltage side <b>270</b><i>a </i>for receiving signals from a thermostat and for handling controller functions, and a high-voltage side <b>270</b><i>b </i>for handling the heater and fan power. High-voltage side <b>270</b><i>b </i>is separated from low-voltage side <b>270</b><i>a </i>by a plate or riser <b>274</b> that physically separates the sides to reduce or prevent damage to the low-voltage side <b>270</b><i>a </i>caused by accidental electrical contact with the high-voltage side <b>270</b><i>b</i>. A cover or enclosure <b>238</b> surrounds circuit board <b>270</b> and further protects it from outside physical and electrical damage.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Vibration insulator sleeve <b>264</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) isolates air ducts, such as air duct <b>16</b>, from vibration and noises generated by heating and cooling device <b>212</b> and facilitates installation of device <b>264</b> into an air duct. Sleeve <b>264</b> includes a hollow cylinder <b>276</b> of fabric and a coupling ring <b>278</b> on either end of the fabric cylinder <b>276</b>. Fabric cylinder <b>276</b> may be fabricated from a sheet of vinyl or fiberglass fabric coated with silicone, chlorosulfonated polyethylene (such as Hypalon&#xae;); or polychloroprene (such as Neoprene&#xae;), for example, such as a Hardcast&#xae; brand flexible duct connectors, available from Carlisle Coatings and Waterproofing Inc., having a place of business at 900 Hensley Lane, Wylie, Tex. 75098 (http://www.hardcast.com). Fabric cylinder <b>276</b> is generally compliant and resilient to absorb much of the vibration and noise produced by heating and cooling device <b>212</b> and to provide quieter operation, and may be used on either side (i.e., one or both sides) of the device to maximize the sound and vibration isolation. In addition, fabric cylinder <b>276</b> is axially compressible to reduce the length or axial dimension of the device <b>212</b> when it is equipped with one or more sleeves <b>264</b>, to facilitate installation and removal of device <b>212</b> from an air duct. Fabric cylinder <b>276</b> may have sufficient resilience to extend itself axially when compressive loads are released.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Fabric cylinder <b>276</b> is formed by rolling the fabric into a cylindrical shape so that two opposed edge portions overlap, and heat-sealing the edge portions together to form a substantially air-tight seam. Coupling rings <b>278</b> are joined to the ends of fabric cylinder <b>276</b> such as by crimping a portion of each ring onto the fabric, or by gluing, riveting, or the like. When used in conjunction with heating and cooling device <b>212</b>, one of rings <b>278</b> of sleeve <b>264</b> may be slid and telescoped into or over housing <b>234</b> and fastened or joined to the housing <b>234</b> via a rivetless joint, rivets or other fasteners, welding, or the like, and the other ring <b>278</b> joined to the air duct in a similar manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">OPERATION AND METHOD</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A method of heating and cooling a room will now be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The room is primarily heated by a furnace <b>14</b> connected to at least one forced air duct <b>16</b> adapted to transfer heat from the furnace <b>14</b> into the room <b>22</b>. The method includes mounting an electric heating and cooling device <b>12</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>212</b> in the at least one air duct <b>16</b>. The electric heating and cooling device includes an electric heater <b>28</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>228</b>, a fan <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, and a housing <b>34</b>, <b>134</b>, <b>234</b> for containing the electric heater and the fan, as discussed above. The method also includes selectively adjusting a thermostat <b>24</b> to a temperature desired in the room and detecting a current or actual temperature in the room.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When heating and cooling device <b>212</b> is equipped with one or more sleeves <b>264</b>, the device <b>212</b> may be installed in a gap in an existing air duct by axially compressing fabric cylinder <b>276</b> until the outermost rings <b>278</b> are positioned in the gap between open ends of the air duct. Device <b>212</b> is inserted into the gap, and fabric cylinder <b>276</b> is released so that the outermost rings <b>278</b> are urged into or over the open ends of the air duct. Rings <b>278</b> are then fastened to the air duct and electrical connections are made to controller <b>236</b> to complete the installation of the heating and cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the method, electric heater <b>28</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>228</b> and/or fan <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> operate automatically via control <b>36</b> in response to input from thermostat <b>24</b> to assist in either heating or cooling the room. For example, the electric heater and the fan are automatically activated when the temperature detected in the room is lower than the desired temperature, to blow heated air generated by the electric heater and the furnace to the room through the air duct. The fan is also automatically activated when the temperature detected in the room is higher than the desired temperature, to blow air through duct <b>16</b> to ventilate or increase air circulation through the room. Optionally, when duct <b>16</b> is connected to an air conditioning unit, fan <b>30</b> may be automatically activated to blow cooled air from the air conditioning unit, which is at a temperature cooler than that of the room, through the air duct to assist in cooling the room. Additionally, fan <b>30</b> may draw cooler air from other rooms in the house and the air ducts that feed them, in order to assist in cooling the room.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, electric heater <b>28</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>228</b> may be automatically deactivated when the actual temperature detected in the room is higher than or equal to the desired temperature in the room. Because fan <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> assists in both heating and cooling or ventilating the room, as discussed above, the fan may be automatically deactivated only when the temperature set on the thermostat is equal to the temperature detected in the room.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The method preferably includes the activation of safety mechanisms to prevent overheating of the heating and cooling device and the room to which it is connected. For example, a discharge air temperature sensor may be activated to deactivate electric heater <b>28</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>228</b> when the temperature of air being discharged from the electric heating and cooling device is higher than a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 70 degrees Celsius. Additionally, a safety temperature limit switch may be activated to deactivate the electric heater when the temperature of the electric heater exceeds a selectively chosen limit temperature, such as 111 degrees Celsius. The safety temperature limit switch automatically resets to allow the electric heater to operate when the electric heater cools to a temperature below the designated or chosen temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method may also include connecting a fusible link in the electrical circuit to interrupt the electric current from the control to the electric heater and the fan when the electric heating and cooling device exceeds a selectively chosen limit temperature, which may be approximately 113 degrees Celsius. Once the fusible link is broken, the heating and cooling device is unable to operate. Accordingly, the method may include replacing the fusible link to again operate the electric heating and cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When heating and cooling device <b>212</b> is equipped with one or more sleeves <b>264</b>, the device <b>212</b> may be installed in a gap in an existing air duct by axially compressing fabric cylinder <b>276</b> until the outermost rings <b>278</b> are positioned in the gap between open ends of the air duct. Device <b>212</b> is inserted into the gap, and fabric cylinder <b>276</b> is released so that the outermost rings <b>278</b> are urged into or over the open ends of the air duct. Rings <b>278</b> are then fastened to the air duct and electrical connections are made to controller <b>236</b> to complete the installation of the heating and cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, the embodiments presented herein provide an electric heating and cooling device adapted to supplement a home's traditional heating and/or cooling system. The device provides supplemental heated air to a room that is difficult to heat and is adapted to assist an air conditioning unit in providing cooled air to a room that is typically warmer than the rest of the rooms in a building. Further, the device is adapted to operate in &#x201c;fan only&#x201d; mode to ventilate a room when the temperature in the room is warmer than desired. Installation of the device is simplified in that the device is adapted to be mounted in the existing duct work of a home, such that additional ducts are not required. In addition, the device includes three separate safety devices to prevent overheating.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Changes and modifications to the specifically described embodiments may be carried out without departing from the principles of the present invention, which is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims as interpreted according to the principles of patent law including the doctrine of equivalents.</p>

<claim-text>positioning an electric heating and cooling device in-line with the air duct, the electric heating and cooling device including a heater and an electric fan disposed in a fluid passageway defined by a housing;</claim-text>
<claim-text>directing substantially all of the air passing from the furnace or the cooling unit through the air duct through the fluid passageway, the heater, and the fan;</claim-text>
<claim-text>selectively adjusting a thermostat that is in communication with the heating and cooling device to a temperature desired in the room;</claim-text>
<claim-text>detecting a temperature in the room with the thermostat;</claim-text>
<claim-text>automatically activating the heater and the fan when the temperature detected in the room is detected by the thermostat as being lower than a threshold minimum temperature corresponding to the desired temperature;</claim-text>
<claim-text>automatically activating the fan, without activating the heater, when the temperature detected in the room is higher than a threshold maximum temperature corresponding to the desired temperature, to propel air through the air duct that is at a cooler temperature than the temperature detected in the room by the thermostat.</claim-text>
