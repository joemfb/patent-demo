<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An airbag is an inflatable structure located in a vehicle that is provided with an inflation gas to cushion a vehicle occupant when the vehicle is involved in a crash of sufficient severity that the deployment of the airbag is deemed necessary. Airbags are most often made of fabric usually woven nylon or polyester; plastic film airbags has been proposed. An inflation gas may be provided by a device that burns a solid substance to generate the inflation gas, or heats gas stored in the inflator, whereby the hot inflation gas could damage the fabric of the airbag or the threads with which the airbag is stitched together. The potential problem is especially bothersome in the case of a side curtain airbag because of the large volume of gas required to inflate such a large device and that a side curtain airbag is often required to remain inflated for a longer time than airbags at other locations in a vehicle during a rollover of the vehicle. Another means employed for protecting the airbag fabric from excessively hot inflation gas is to provide a metal shield as a part of the inflator, but this can be costly and add weight to an airbag assembly. One means that has been employed for protecting the airbag fabric from excessively hot inflation gas is to provide an extra layer or layers of fabric folded onto itself and attached to the airbag fabric at a seam of the airbag fabric, but this additional folded fabric especially when it becomes distorted can impair the placement of a portion of an inflator within the layers of fabric. This added fabric might even disrupt the flow of inflation gas into the airbag. What is needed is a lightweight and effective fabric heat shield that retains a desired shape prior to and during the process of mating a portion of an inflator with the airbag and heat shield.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown an exemplary airbag <b>10</b> according to a first aspect of the present invention comprising a fabric component <b>11</b> defining at least one inflatable chamber <b>12</b>. The exemplary airbag of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an airbag of the type commonly referred to in the field of airbag technology as a side curtain airbag, but it should be appreciated the present invention may apply to other types of airbags including front impact airbags, knee airbags, side airbags and airbags employed with inflatable seatbelts. The fabric component <b>11</b> may for example comprise either two fabric sheets placed side by side and attached to one another by sewing, adhesives, welding or any other suitable means. Alternatively, the fabric component may comprise a single fabric sheet folded over onto itself to form two layers which are then attached to one another by sewing, adhesives, welding or any other suitable means. In yet another alternative fabric component suitable yarns may be knitted or woven together to form an integral, fabric component defining at least one inflatable chamber as well as the opening (inlet). It is understood the fabric component may have a structure wherein portions <b>13</b>-<b>17</b> of the fabric component are not inflatable to reduce the amount of inflation gas required to inflate the airbag and cause the airbag to assume a desired shape and dimensions when the airbag is inflated. The airbag may further include means for mounting the air bag to structural components of a vehicle, such as mounting tabs <b>19</b>. The exemplary airbag <b>10</b> is provided with an opening <b>20</b> for receiving an inflation gas.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged fragmentary view of a portion of the airbag <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the opening, inlet or neck <b>20</b> in the airbag for receiving an inflation gas. A tubular heat shield <b>30</b> is inserted within the opening (inlet) <b>20</b>. The function of the tubular heat shield <b>30</b> is to at least reduce the possibility of damage to the fabric component <b>11</b> of the airbag by heat generated by inflator <b>40</b>. As seem more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the inflator <b>40</b> is received in an internal passage <b>22</b> formed by multiple layers of the tubular heat shield <b>30</b>. As used herein and in the claim the term &#x201c;inflator&#x201d; is understood to have its common meaning in the airbag technology of a source of inflation gas for inflating an airbag. An inflator used in the practice of the present invention may have any suitable structure, including pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators that provide a mixture of stored gas and gas generated by burning a suitable pyrotechnic composition.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side elevation view of an exemplary tubular heat shield <b>30</b> according to one aspect of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a sheet of a flexible material <b>32</b> that is used to fabricate the tubular heat shield. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross section of the tubular heat shield <b>30</b> at line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The tubular heat shield <b>30</b> comprises a sheet <b>32</b> of a flexible material rolled to form a tube <b>21</b> and fixed to the fabric component of the airbag inside the airbag adjacent the opening <b>20</b>. The flexible material of the tubular heat shield may be selected from a group of materials comprising fabrics, polymers, metals and metal alloys. The tubular heat shield has two ends <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>. The end <b>33</b> of is provided with a series of circumferentially spaced apart tabs <b>36</b> defining slots or openings <b>38</b>. When the tube <b>21</b> is formed the slots <b>38</b> and tabs <b>36</b> respectively overlap. It is understood that the sheet <b>32</b> of flexible material comprising the tubular heat shield should have dimensions suitable to mate with the fabric component of the airbag and the exterior of the inflator in a functional manner to form a seal with the exterior of the inflator and interior of the fabric component of the airbag, and that the drawings are not to scale. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, four tabs <b>36</b> and three slots <b>38</b> are shows. It is inferred in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is an option, that the number of slots and tabs and be greater or less than that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, but not an absolute necessity, a first step in fabricating a tubular heat shield <b>30</b> is to fold over the tabs <b>36</b> of the sheet of flexible material on themselves and to tack the folded-over portions down as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> using stitching <b>37</b>. Of course the folded-over portions of the tabs may be tacked in place using any suitable means including, for example, adhesives and welding. Folding the tabs over on themselves makes them stiffer and less likely to be displaced when the inflator is received in the passageway <b>22</b> of the tubular heat shield. The dimensions of the tabs, both folded over and unfolded, as well as the size of the spaces <b>38</b> between what will become circumferentially next adjacent tabs in the completed tubular heat shield, can be varied in accordance with good engineering practice. Also, as an option, the layers at end <b>34</b> of the tube can also be secured by stitches <b>37</b><i>a</i>, practice has shown this is a requirement . . . . Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the flexible material is rolled into a tubular shape with more than one layer, preferably at least two layers, of the flexible material, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in cross section. Care should be taken that the tabs of each layer of fabric are circumferentially aligned with the tabs of every other layer of fabric as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As can be appreciated, the rolled tube is formed of many layers and in one configuration the ends of the piece of material <b>32</b> overlap. In the preferred embodiment, this overlapped portion is positioned at the bottom of the tube <b>21</b> and when inserted in the opening <b>20</b>, the overlapped portion is located at the bottom of the opening. As can be appreciated, this overlapped portion has an increased number of layers compared to the rest of the tube and is stiffer than the rest of the tube. As inflation gas pass through the tube into the air bag, the tube <b>21</b> have a tendency to lift upward, by positioning the overlapped region at the lowest point reduces this tendency to move upward. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the tubular heat shield is inserted into the fabric component of the airbag through the opening <b>20</b> in the airbag intended to allow inflation gas to be introduced into at least one inflation chamber of the airbag. When the tubular heat shield is in the intended operating location inside the airbag, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 10</figref>, the tubular heat shield is secured in its operative position by a suitable means for attachment such as stitching <b>45</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. At least a portion of the inflator <b>40</b> may then be received in the passage <b>22</b> in the tubular heat shield as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</figref>. In this embodiment of the invention the inserted end of the inflator with gas exit ports <b>41</b>, is preferably position about 25 mm from end <b>34</b> of the tube. A clamping member <b>46</b> will often be used located adjacent at least one exterior surface of the airbag to clamp the fabric component <b>11</b> of the airbag and the tubular heat shield <b>30</b> to secure the airbag and the tubular heat shield to the inflator <b>40</b>. It is desirable to have a gas tight seal around the inflator in the region of the opening <b>20</b> in the airbag to prevent inflation gas from escaping from the airbag in that region of the airbag assembly. It is understood that heat from the operation of the inflator may potentially damage portions of the fabric component of the airbag disposed nearest the inflator, and the tubular heat shield is intended to prevent or minimize such damage that could breach the integrity of the seal around the inflator and allow inflation gas to escape from the airbag in an unintended manner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As pointed out above, the tubular heat shield comprises a flexible material selected from a group of materials consisting of fabrics, polymers, metals and metal alloys. Inasmuch as the most common fabric used in the fabrication of airbags is a polyamide, such as a nylon or polyester, it is anticipated that a preferred flexible material for the tubular heat shield will also be a polyamide or polyester. While polymers, metals and metal alloys may have a good resistance to damage by the heat generated by an inflator during activation of the inflator, when the flexible material is a nylon fabric it is desirable to fortify the flexible material against heat damage. To achieve such a structure a side of the flexible material that comprises the tubular heat shield is coated with a heat resistant compound and the flexible material is rolled to form a tube with the side of the flexible material that is coated with the heat resistant compound located nearest the passage of the tubular heat shield. It is further contemplated that wherein the flexible material that comprises the tubular heat shield has first and second sides, both sides are coated with a heat resistant compound, the first side of the flexible material being coated with a larger amount of the heat resistant compound per square meter than the second side of the flexible material, and the flexible material is rolled to form a tube with the first side of the flexible material located nearest the passage of the tubular heat shield. It is contemplated that if the base fabric comprising the tubular heat shield is a nylon or polyester fabric silicone is a good example of a heat resistant compound with which base fabric may be coated to impart improved resistance of the base fabric to damage by the heat generated when the inflator is activated. Reference is briefly made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>which shows the material <b>32</b> coated with coating material <b>32</b><i>a </i>of a first thickness on one side and with coating material <b>32</b><i>b </i>of a second thickness on the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, and then to the alternative embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>. If a slit <b>200</b> was formed in the bottom of the tubular heat shield <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the resulting heat shield <b>210</b> will have the shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Instead of cutting a notch, such as a V-shape slit <b>200</b> into the tubular heat shield <b>30</b>, a plurality of staged slits <b>212</b> could first be formed in the fabric <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The resulting fabric configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. If the fabric <b>32</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> were rolled, the heat shield of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> would be created in this alternate manner. Reference is briefly made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> which illustrates this alternate tubular heat shield <b>200</b> positioned upon inflator <b>40</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, slit <b>200</b> is positioned toward the bottom of inflator <b>40</b> so that some inflation gas flows into the airbag in an axial manner (see arrow <b>220</b>) and some of the inflation gas enters the airbag with a downward component of flow through the slit <b>200</b>. In this embodiment the slit is located about 100-125 mm from the inserted end of the inflator <b>40</b>.</p>
