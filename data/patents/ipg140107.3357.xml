<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/944,990, filed on Nov. 12, 2010 by Theodore J. Christopher. The content of this prior application is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This document relates to a turbine, for example, that rotates to generate electrical power from fluid flow.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some turbine systems generate electrical power in response to rotation of a turbine. For example, numerous wind turbine systems attempt to harvest the wind energy from air flow over a set of wind turbine blades, which drive the wind turbine blades to rotate about axis and thereby drive an internal generator to output electrical energy. In another example, conventional hydro turbine systems seek to convert energy from water currents in rivers or tidal currents in oceans or seas into electrical energy.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some embodiments of a turbine system described herein provide a turbine that rotates in response to off-axis fluid flow, such as water flowing in a generally horizontal direction that is generally perpendicular to a vertical axis of rotation. The turbine system can employ a synergistic combination of fluid dynamics principals to harvest the kinetic energy in flowing water or other fluid for conversion into mechanically rotary motion. For example, the turbine system can provide a vertical-axis turbine formed as a unitary structure that, in response to the off-axis fluid flow, rotates in one direction regardless of the direction of the fluid flow (which can be useful when harvesting energy from tidal currents in an ocean environment). In particular embodiments, the vertical-axis turbine is configured to provide enhanced efficiency even in slow-moving fluid flow (such as a slow stream or river).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a turbine system may include a turbine that rotates about a central axis in response to fluid flowing toward the turbine in a flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the central axis. The shape of the turbine can contribute to a synergistic combination of fluid dynamics principals to drive the rotary motion of the turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Particular embodiments described herein include a turbine for use in an electrical generation system. The turbine may comprise a vertical-axis turbine that rotates about a vertical axis in response to fluid flowing toward the turbine in a flow direction which is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis. The vertical-axis turbine may include a central upper dome surface at least partially defined by a bell-shaped curve in a vertical cross-sectional plane. Also, the vertical-axis turbine may include a plurality of upwardly protruding fins that each extend from an outer region proximate to an outer periphery of the vertical axis turbine toward the central upper dome surface. Each of the fins may terminate at a vertical height below an uppermost region of the central upper dome surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a turbine system for generating electrical power may include a vertical-axis turbine. The vertical-axis turbine may include a plurality of fins formed as a unitary structure with a centrally located, convexly curved upward facing surface. The vertical-axis turbine may rotate about a vertical axis in a first direction about a vertical axis both in response to fluid flowing over the turbine in a first flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis and in response to fluid flowing over the turbine in a second opposite flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, a turbine system for generating electrical power may include a vertical-axis turbine that is configured to rotate about a vertical axis in response to fluid flowing toward the turbine in a flow direction which is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis. The vertical-axis turbine may include an uppermost surface region defined by an upwardly facing convex curvature centered about the vertical axis. The system may also comprise a base structure positioned below the vertical-axis turbine to remain generally stationary during rotation of the vertical-axis turbine. The system may further comprise an electrical generator positioned between the vertical-axis turbine and the base structure so as to generate electrical power in response to the rotation of the vertical-axis turbine relative to the base structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Particular embodiments described herein may include a method of using a turbine system for generating electrical power from underwater current flow. The method may include positioning a vertical-axis turbine underwater such that a vertical axis of rotation of the vertical-axis turbine is arranged generally perpendicularly to water flow. The vertical-axis turbine may include a continuously solid upward facing surface that includes a central upper dome surface and a plurality of upwardly protruding fins that each extend from an outer region proximate to an outer periphery of the vertical axis turbine toward the central upper dome surface. The method may also include generating electrical power in response to rotation of the vertical-axis turbine caused by water flowing over the central upper dome surface and interacting with the plurality of upwardly protruding fins.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some embodiments described herein include a method of manufacturing a turbine system for use in generating electrical power. The method may include molding a vertical-axis turbine. For example, the vertical-axis turbine may be molded such that a plurality of fins of the turbine are formed as a unitary structure with a centrally located, convexly curved uppermost surface of the turbine. The method may also include mounting the vertical-axis turbine to base structure such that the vertical-axis turbine is configured to rotate about a vertical axis relative to the base structure in response to fluid flowing toward the turbine in a flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other embodiments described herein may provide one or more of the following benefits. First, some embodiments of the turbine system can include a turbine that employs synergistic combination of fluid dynamics principals to harness the kinetic energy in flowing water or other fluid for conversion into mechanically rotary motion. This mechanical rotary motion can be used, for example, to drive a rotor shaft of a permanent magnet generator for purposes of generating electrical power, or alternatively, to drive a pump system that urges hydraulic fluid through a remotely located (e.g., onshore) electric generator machine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Second, the turbine system can employ a turbine having a novel shape that advantageously harnesses the kinetic energy of the flowing water or other fluid from both the Newtonian forces acting upon the fins and also from a pressure recovery effect as the water or other fluid flows over an upper dome surface and down along the downstream side of turbine. For example, the turbine can include an upper convex surface centrally located about the vertical axis which is at least partially defined by a bell-shaped contour in a vertical cross-section plane. This bell-shaped contour contributes to the pressure recovery effect as fluid flows over the upper convex surface in a direction that is transverse to the vertical axis. This bell-shaped contour enables the upper convex surface to controls and maintains laminar flow over the body of the turbine. Also, the turbine includes a set of upwardly projecting fins that are configured to harness and redirect the water or other fluid flowing over the upstream portion of the turbine (thereby contributing Newtonian forces to the rotational motion) as well as harnessing the water or other fluid flowing to the downstream portion (e.g., flowing over the upper convex surface of the turbine and down the bell-shaped contour). In addition, the fins are configured to control the flowing fluid path over the main body of the turbine and direct the fluid towards different areas at different times based on their orientation to the flow of the current. Further, in some circumstances, the fins may be configured to manage the turbulent flow off the main body of the turbine by way of vortex generation, which can instruct the non-laminar flow around the turbine to organize around these vortexes and thereby reduce the effects of drag or other inefficiencies during operation of the turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Third, the turbine system can be configured to generate significant levels of electrical power even in slow-moving fluid flow (such as a slow stream or river). Moreover, the turbine can be configured with a relatively low vertical profile compared to an outer diameter of the turbine, which enables the turbine to rotate about the vertical axis with significant power even when the water depth is relatively shallow (e.g., less than the diameter of the turbine). In some circumstances, the turbine can be configured to having a main body that is about 7.9 feet in diameter (centered about the vertical axis of rotation) and can be used to generate mechanical rotary motion that is sufficient to produce, for example, electrical power even when submerged in generally horizontal water current of a slow river or stream. In other embodiments, the turbine can be configured to having a main body that is about 12 feet in diameter (centered about the vertical axis of rotation) and can be used to generate mechanical rotary motion that is sufficient to produce, for example, electrical power when submerged in ocean tidal currents that flow generally perpendicularly to the vertical axis. In some portable embodiments, the turbine can be configured to having a main body that is about 4 to about 8 inches diameter (centered about the vertical axis of rotation) and can transported in a backpack or with military equipment to provide a portable power generator for use in a river or stream. Accordingly, the turbine may rotate at a speed that is generally safe for fish or other marine life while the turbine system harvests a safe and renewable energy source.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Fourth, the turbine system can be constructed in a manner that causes the turbine to rotate in a consistent rotational direction about the vertical axis both when exposed to fluid flow approaching from a first flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis and when exposed to a second flow direction that is opposite to the first flow direction. In such embodiments, the turbine system can be advantageously submerged along the floor of an ocean or sea that is subject to tidal currents. For example, some embodiments of the turbine system can be configured to produce mechanical rotary motion in one direction about the vertical axis (for purposes of generating electrical power) both when exposed to the tidal currents during hide tide and when exposed to the tidal currents during low tide. In such circumstances, the turbine system is not required to employ multiple turbine blade structures that rotate in opposite directions (e.g., one blade structure for high tide currents and another blade structure for low tide currents).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Fifth, as described in more detail below, the turbine can be constructed as a unitary structure such that all of the fins and the upper convex surface are formed as a low maintenance, single-piece structure, which is particularly beneficial for ocean and river applications in which the turbine system is fully submerged. In certain embodiments, the turbine can be formed as a unitary structure as part of a molding process that collective forms the main body of the turbine including the upper convex surface and the fins. Such a molding process may be useful in forming a turbine in which the entire upper face (including the upper convex surface, the plurality of upwardly protruding fins, and the channel base surfaces between neighboring fins is free of apertures or other openings. In some preferred embodiments, the turbine has a continuously solid upward facing surface that extends to a circular border at the outer periphery of the turbine. Optionally, a drive shaft can be integrally molded with the main body of the turbine such that the drive shaft extends downwardly from a lower face of the molded turbine body. Accordingly, the turbine can be efficiently and reproducibly manufactured in a low cost manner that may significantly reduce the number of components and the corresponding assembly time.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Like reference symbols in the various drawings indicate like elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, some embodiments of a turbine system <b>100</b> can include a turbine <b>110</b> that is configured to rotate about a vertical axis <b>115</b> in response to off-axis fluid flow, such as fluid flow <b>50</b> approaching the turbine <b>110</b> from a direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the turbine system <b>100</b> can be equipped with the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> that generates mechanical rotary motion <b>116</b> to produce electrical power in response to water flowing in a river, stream, ocean, sea, or other body of water having currents. In the depicted embodiment, the turbine <b>110</b> is formed as a unitary structure that, in response to the off-axis fluid flow <b>50</b>, can be configured to provide enhanced efficiency for electrical power generation even in slow-moving fluid flow (such as a slow stream, river, or tidal current).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The turbine system can also include a base structure <b>150</b> positioned below the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b>, which is secured to the floor <b>60</b> below the surface <b>40</b> of the body of water in which the turbine <b>110</b> is fully submerged. As such, the base structure <b>150</b> is configured to remain generally stationary during rotation of the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, the base structure includes a pedestal structure <b>152</b> having a plurality of anchors <b>153</b> that are driven into the floor <b>60</b> of the body of water so as to anchor the position of the turbine system <b>100</b>. The base structure <b>154</b> may also include a lower housing shell <b>154</b> that is positioned oppositely from the turbine <b>110</b> such that an interior space is at least partially defined between the turbine <b>110</b> and the base structure <b>150</b>. As described in more detail below, some embodiments of the turbine system <b>100</b> may include permanent magnet generator (or, alternatively, a hydraulic pump system) housed in the interior space between the turbine <b>100</b> and the base structure <b>150</b>. In such circumstances, the components of the turbine system <b>100</b> can be constructed in a manner that conserves space and provides a relatively low profile to operate in a shallow depth of a body of water.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At least one line <b>156</b> (e.g., an electrical cable line or a pipe line) may extend from the base structure <b>150</b> toward a non-submerged electronics system <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The line <b>156</b> may output electrical current generated from a permanent magnet generator (described in more detail below) coupled to the base structure <b>150</b> to the non-submerged electronics system <b>160</b>. In this embodiment, the electronics system is position at an onshore location, but it should be understood that in alternative embodiments, the electronics system may be located on an above-surface platform constructed over the surface <b>40</b> of the water. The electronics system <b>160</b> can include an inverter and transmission system that is configured to condition the electrical power from the line <b>156</b> for output to an external grid system. For example, the electronics system <b>160</b> can be configured to output the electrical power as three-phase 120V AC power that is transmitted to the external power grid. In some alternative embodiments, the electronics system <b>160</b> may house the electric generator (such that there is no generator coupled to the base structure <b>150</b> under the surface <b>40</b>) so as to provide simplified maintenance. In those circumstances, the line <b>156</b> can be configured to provide pressurized fluid path (e.g., hydraulic fluid) that is pumped to the electronics system <b>160</b> by the power of the mechanical rotary motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. From there, the hydraulic fluid can drive a rotor of the electric generator (housed by the electronics system <b>16</b>) to rotate and thereby generate electric power. In any of these scenarios, the turbine <b>110</b> can be used to generate the mechanically rotary motion <b>116</b> that is sufficient to produce electrical power even when submerged in relatively slow moving water current.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> may include a centrally located upper convex surface <b>120</b> and a plurality of upwardly protruding fins <b>130</b>. In this embodiment, the upper convex surface <b>120</b> is at least partially defined by a bell-shaped curve in a vertical cross-sectional plane (refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) such that the upper convex surface has a generally dome shape at its apex. Each of the fins <b>130</b> extends from an outer region <b>111</b> of the turbine (e.g., at or near the outer diameter of the turbine body as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and towards centrally located upper convex surface <b>120</b>. As described in more detail below, in this embodiment each of the fins <b>130</b> terminate at a vertical height below an uppermost region of the upper convex surface <b>120</b>. Accordingly, the upper convex surface <b>120</b> in this embodiment rises above the terminal ends of each fin <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the plurality of fins <b>130</b> are arranged such that the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> is urged to rotate in the rotational direction <b>116</b> about the vertical axis <b>115</b> in response to the fluid flow <b>50</b> traveling in a first flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b> (e.g., flowing from left to right as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and from bottom to top as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). However, it should be understood from the description herein that the arrangement of the fins <b>130</b> likewise causes the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> to rotate in the same rotational direction <b>116</b> in response to the fluid flow <b>50</b> traveling in a second opposite flow direction that is also generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b>. In other words, the turbine <b>110</b> would be urged to rotate in the same rotational direction <b>116</b> even if the fluid flow <b>50</b> was traveling opposite to that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> (e.g., if it was flowing from right to left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and from top to bottom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thus, the fins <b>130</b> of the turbine are arranged such that vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> that rotates in the rotational direction <b>116</b> about the vertical axis <b>115</b> both in response to fluid flowing over the turbine in a first flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis and in response to fluid flowing over the turbine in a second opposite flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the shape of the upper convex surface <b>120</b> and the upwardly extending fins <b>130</b> contribute to a synergistic combination of Newtonian forces and a pressure recovery effect to drive the rotary motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>, which can advantageously provide significant rotational power even in relatively slow fluid flow. For example, when the turbine <b>110</b> is submersed into the fluid <b>50</b> (e.g., water flow in this embodiments), the fluid <b>50</b> is directed to flow into one or more channels <b>125</b> between neighboring fins <b>130</b> at an upstream portion <b>112</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> and over the top of the upper convex surface <b>120</b>. Each of the channels includes a base surface <b>126</b> that leads to the upper convex surface <b>120</b>. As described in more detail below, each base surface <b>126</b> of the channels <b>125</b> may be at least partially defined by the bell-shaped contour in the vertical cross-section of the turbine <b>110</b>. Thus, while the fluid <b>50</b> flowing through the channels <b>125</b> is redirected by the fins <b>130</b> (thereby providing Newtonian forces that urge the rotation of the turbine <b>110</b>), the fluid is also traversing upward along the bell-shaped contour of the base surfaces <b>126</b> of the channels <b>125</b> toward upper convex surface <b>120</b> (thereby staging for a pressure recovery effect along the downstream portion <b>114</b>). From there, the fluid <b>50</b> is directed down the upper convex surface <b>120</b> and into one or more of the channels <b>125</b> at a downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. As the fluid <b>50</b> moves in this path from the upper convex surface <b>120</b> to the downstream portion <b>114</b>, a pressure recovery effect is induced to develop a high pressure region (refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) along the downstream portion <b>114</b> that contributes significant power to act upon the respective fin <b>130</b> and rotate the turbine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, some embodiments of the turbine system <b>100</b> can be constructed so that one or more components are positioned in a sealed housing <b>140</b> between the turbine <b>110</b> and the base structure <b>150</b>. The sealing housing <b>140</b> may be used to house components that facilitate the conversion of the mechanical rotary motion <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>) of the turbine <b>110</b> into electrical power. In this embodiment, the turbine <b>110</b> is mounted at the uppermost part of the turbine system <b>100</b> so that the fluid <b>50</b> is merited to flow over the upper convex surface <b>120</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>) while the base structure <b>150</b> is anchored to the ground <b>60</b> under the surface <b>40</b>. The turbine <b>110</b> can be formed as a single-piece component such that all of the fins <b>130</b>, the channel base surfaces <b>126</b>, and the upper convex surface <b>120</b> are molded as a single unitary structure. In some embodiments, the drive shaft <b>135</b> may be integrally molded with the turbine <b>110</b> so that the drive shaft <b>135</b> fixedly extends from a lower face of the turbine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the base structure <b>150</b> may include a number of components that are assembled together. For example, the pedestal structure <b>152</b> can include the plurality of anchors <b>153</b> that extend downwardly therefrom so that the anchors can reside in the ground while the pedestal structure <b>152</b> is positioned on the floor <b>60</b> of the body of water. The base structure <b>150</b> may also include a bearing member <b>155</b> that receives an end of the drive shaft <b>135</b> (opposite from the end that is mounted to the turbine <b>110</b>). A collar seal <b>153</b> of the base structure <b>150</b> can fit over the bearing member <b>155</b> so as to provide a seal with the lower housing shell <b>154</b>. It should be understood from the description herein that, in alternative embodiments, the turbine <b>110</b> can be rotatably mounted to a base structure having a different size, shape, or anchoring technique.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sealed housing <b>140</b> can be mounted between the lower housing shell <b>154</b> of the base structure <b>150</b> and the turbine <b>110</b> so as to utilize the interior space between the turbine <b>110</b> and the base structure <b>150</b>. In some cases, this configuration of the turbine system <b>100</b> can be used to achieve a relatively low profile or vertical height of the turbine system <b>100</b> so that it can operate in a shallow depth of a body of water. The seal housing <b>140</b> can include first and second shells <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> that are sealed together to enclose a number of components, such as a permanent magnet generator <b>145</b> and a gear system <b>146</b>. The gear system <b>146</b> may comprise a planetary gear system or another gear arrangement that converts the rotational motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> (and the drive shaft <b>135</b> mounted thereto) into a higher rotational speed for the rotor of the permanent magnet generator <b>145</b>. The permanent magnet generator <b>145</b> may include a rotator that rotates inside a stator (e.g., having conductive coils arranged in slots) so that the rotation of the rotor induces electrical current in the coils of the stator. This generated current can be output via the line <b>156</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the electronic system <b>160</b> onshore or on a platform. It should be understood that alternative embodiments of the permanent magnet generator (having different internal components or a different size and shape) can be employed in the turbine system <b>100</b>. The drive shaft <b>135</b> extends downwardly from the lower face of the turbine <b>110</b>, through the sealed housing <b>140</b>, and to the bearing member <b>155</b> of the base structure <b>150</b>. The sealed housing <b>140</b> can be equipped with bearing seals <b>143</b> at the apertures of the first and second shells <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> so as to provide a watertight seal along the portion of the drive shaft <b>135</b> that passes through the sealed housing <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some alternative embodiments, the structure <b>145</b> inside the sealed housing <b>140</b> may be a pump system rather than a permanent magnet generator. For example, in some embodiments, the non-submerged electronics system <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>) may house the electric generator (such that there is no generator coupled to the base structure <b>150</b>) so as to provide convenient access to the generator for maintenance or repair purposes. In those circumstances, the structure <b>145</b> inside the sealed housing <b>140</b> can include a pump system that forces hydraulic fluid through a pipeline (e.g., such as line <b>156</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to the electronics system <b>160</b> by the power of the mechanical rotary motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. From there, the hydraulic fluid can drive a rotor of the electric generator (housed by the electronics system <b>160</b>) to rotate and thereby generate electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref>, the shape of the structures on the upper face of the turbine <b>110</b> contribute to a synergistic combination of Newtonian forces and a pressure recovery effect to drive the rotary motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. The upper face of the turbine <b>110</b> can include the centrally located upper convex surface <b>120</b>, the plurality of upwardly protruding fins <b>130</b>, and the channels <b>125</b> (with channel base surfaces <b>126</b>) defined between neighboring fins <b>130</b>. In this embodiment, the turbine comprises five fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>that protrude upwardly to a vertical height greater than the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. As described in more detail below, when the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>rotate to different positions about the vertical axis <b>115</b>, each fin <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>is configured to capture fluid flowing over the upper face of the turbine <b>110</b>, redirecting the fluid along a path different from the ambient fluid flow, and inducing a high pressure region <b>138</b> on the downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. In particular, the high pressure region <b>138</b> is generally formed in a channel on a first side of a respective fin at a downstream position (find <b>130</b><i>d </i>in the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and a low pressure region <b>139</b> is formed on a second opposite side of the respective fin.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The turbine <b>110</b> in this embodiment has an upper face defined by the centrally located upper convex surface <b>120</b>, the plurality of upwardly protruding fins <b>130</b>, and the channel base surfaces <b>126</b> (between the neighboring fins <b>130</b>). Accordingly, in this embodiment, the entire upper face of the turbine <b>110</b> is free of apertures or other openings such that turbine <b>110</b> has a continuously solid upward facing surface that extends to a circular border at the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> may have a diameter of about 5 feet or greater, about 7 feet to about 20 feet, and preferably about 7.9 feet for river or stream applications and preferably about 12 feet for some ocean applications. In some portable embodiments, the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> may have a diameter of about 4 inches to about 12 inches, preferably about 6 inches for simplified transport in a backpack or with military soldier equipment to provide a portable power generator for temporary use in a river or stream (e.g., to provide electrical power for communication equipment or other gear).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref>, in this embodiment, all of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are positioned radially inward of the circular border at the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>, and all of the fins also protrude upwardly to a vertical height above the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. Each of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>may have a substantially identical shape and size, and may include a convex face <b>132</b> and an oppositely disposed concave face <b>133</b>. The convex face <b>132</b> of each fin <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>intersects with the oppositely disposed concave face <b>133</b> along a curved ridge that extends toward the centrally located upper convex surface <b>120</b>. In operation, the convex surface <b>132</b> may have a hydrofoil shape that reduces drag as water flows over the convex surface <b>132</b>, while the concave surface <b>133</b> is configured to capture and redirect the fluid flow <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are arranged such that vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> that rotates in the rotational direction <b>116</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>) about the vertical axis <b>115</b> both in response to fluid flowing over the turbine <b>110</b> in a first flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b> and in response to fluid flowing over the turbine in a second opposite flow direction that is also generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the plurality of fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are positioned to be non-symmetric about the vertical axis. For example, in this embodiment each of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>is curved along the length extending from the outer fin region that is proximate to the outer periphery <b>111</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> toward the central upper convex surface <b>120</b>, and concave face <b>133</b> of each fin <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>terminates in a non-radial direction that extends toward an adjacent fin and away from the vertical axis <b>115</b>. In one illustrative example, the concave face <b>133</b> of the fin <b>130</b><i>a </i>extends away from the outer periphery <b>111</b> and toward the central upper convex surface <b>120</b>, but the concave face <b>133</b> terminates in a direction that points toward the adjacent fin <b>130</b><i>b </i>(not in a radial direction toward the central vertical axis <b>115</b>). It should be understood that, in alternative embodiments, the turbine <b>110</b> may comprise fins <b>130</b> that are symmetrically positioned about the vertical axis <b>115</b>, for example, the turbine may comprise four fins <b>130</b> that are positioned symmetrically about the vertical axis <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The shape of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>can be configured to harness the fluid flow <b>50</b> that approaches each respective fin <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>on the upstream portion <b>112</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. Moreover, the shape of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>is also configured to harness the fluid flow a second time as the fluid flow <b>50</b> travels over the upper convex surface <b>120</b> and down the bell-shaped contour on the downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. In some flow conditions, the shape of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>may contribute to vortex generation above the turbine <b>110</b> that adds yet another benefit for harnessing the kinetic energy of the fluid flow <b>50</b>. In some circumstances, the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>can manage turbulent flow off the turbine body by way of vortex generation (refer to each vortex <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), which urges or instructs the non-laminar flow around the rotating turbine <b>110</b> to organize around these vortexes and thereby reduces the drag upon the turbine <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in this embodiment the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are configured to generate at least one vortex <b>116</b> that is transverse to the vertical axis <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> in response fluid flow <b>50</b> that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref>, in this embodiment of the turbine <b>110</b>, the centrally located upper convex surface <b>120</b> is symmetric about the vertical axis <b>115</b>. The upper convex surface <b>120</b> may be defined by the bell-shaped contour in a vertical cross-section (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) so that the surface <b>120</b> serves as a dome <b>120</b> that guides the fluid flow <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref>, each of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>terminate (refer to termination point <b>136</b>) at a vertical height <b>128</b> that is below an uppermost region (including the apex) of the central upper convex surface <b>120</b>. This structural relationship between the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>and the upper convex surface <b>120</b> may cause the turbine <b>110</b> may operate more efficiently (reducing effects of drag) because the fluid flow <b>50</b> passing through the channel <b>125</b> toward the upper convex surface <b>120</b> is able to pass over the uppermost region of the convex surface <b>120</b> without interference from the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. Also in some embodiments, the upper most region (including the apex) of the central upper convex surface <b>120</b> has a vertical height <b>121</b> that is greater than all of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. For example, the maximum vertical height of each of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>may be less than the vertical height <b>121</b> of the upper convex surface (refer to dimension <b>129</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref>). Here again, this structural relationship between the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>and the upper convex surface <b>120</b> may provide improved efficiency for the turbine <b>110</b> in some circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, in some embodiments, the upper convex surface <b>120</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> represents that structure along the upper face having the greatest vertical height. This configuration may provide for simplified breaking of the turbine during removal for maintenance or repair purposes. For example, in some circumstances, the turbine <b>110</b> may automatically cease rotating when the upper convex surface <b>120</b> is elevated above the surface <b>40</b> of the water (even as the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are exposed to the fluid flow <b>50</b> below the surface <b>40</b>). Accordingly, the structures along the upper face of the turbine <b>110</b> can provide improved efficiency for the turbine <b>110</b> when the turbine is submerged while also providing improved safety when turbine <b>110</b> is not fully submerged (e.g., when the upper convex surface <b>120</b> is above the fluid surface <b>40</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the upper convex surface <b>120</b> and the channel base surfaces <b>126</b> (between the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>) are defined by the bell-shaped contour <b>122</b> in a vertical cross-sectional plane. It should be understood that, in this embodiment, the bell-shaped contour <b>122</b> is present in any vertical cross-sectional plane along the vertical axis <b>115</b>. Accordingly, in this embodiment the upper convex surface <b>120</b> provides a dome at the uppermost region of the turbine <b>110</b> that smoothly transitions into the channel base surfaces <b>126</b> between the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. Thus, in particular embodiments, the bell-shape contour <b>122</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may serve as a &#x201c;base shape&#x201d; that is interrupted by the fins that protrude upwardly from the base shape. As described in more detail below, the curved contour <b>122</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> in the vertical cross-section facilitates the pressure recovery effect that enables the turbine <b>110</b> to capture the kinetic energy from directional changes to the fluid flow more than once.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, some embodiments of a method <b>200</b> to manufacture a turbine system (such as the turbine system <b>100</b>) can include a molding operation to form the turbine. For example, the method <b>200</b> may include the operation <b>210</b> of molding a vertical-axis turbine such as the turbine <b>110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-11</figref>. In such circumstances, all components of the turbine <b>110</b> (including the upper convex surface <b>120</b>, the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, and the base surfaces <b>126</b> between the fins) may be molded as unitary structure. For example, a female master mold can receive a moldable polymer or composite material (such as a synthetic polymer (Nylon, Mylar),a fiber reinforced polymer (fiberglass, Kevlar) or carbon fiber reinforced plastic (carbon fiber)) to thereby formed the depicted upper face of the turbine <b>110</b> in an efficient manner. In some embodiments, the drive shaft <b>135</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be integrally molded with the turbine <b>110</b> so that the drive shaft <b>135</b> is fixed to the turbine <b>110</b> and extends downwardly from a lower face <b>119</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of the turbine. In one example, the drive shaft <b>135</b> may comprise a rigid metallic shaft that is retained in a selected position adjacent to the female mold during the molding process. As such, the moldable polymer or composite material that is used to form the turbine <b>110</b> can engage with and affixed to one end of the drive shaft <b>135</b> during the molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The method may also include one of the optional operations <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>. For example, in operation <b>220</b>, an electrical generator such as the permanent magnet generator <b>145</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be mounted for positioning between the turbine <b>110</b> and the base structure <b>150</b>. As previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this operation <b>220</b> may include positioning the generator <b>145</b> in the housing shells <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> that are mounted over the lower housing shell <b>154</b> of the base structure <b>150</b>. In another example, the operation <b>230</b> may include mounting a pump mechanism for positioning between the turbine <b>110</b> and the base structure <b>150</b>. As previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this operation <b>230</b> may include positioning the pump mechanism in the housing shells <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> that are mounted over the lower housing shell <b>154</b> of the base structure <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the method <b>200</b> also includes mounting the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> to the base structure <b>150</b> such that the turbine <b>110</b> is configured to rotate relative to the base structure <b>150</b>. For example, the turbine <b>110</b> may rotate about the vertical axis <b>115</b> relative to the base structure <b>150</b> in response to fluid flowing toward the turbine <b>110</b> in a flow direction that is generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b>. Also, the method <b>200</b> can include the operation <b>250</b> of preparing the base structure <b>150</b> (with the vertical-axis turbine mounted thereto) for anchoring into a floor <b>60</b> of a body of water. As previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the base structure <b>150</b> can be equipped with a number of anchors <b>153</b> that are configured to secure the position of the turbine system <b>100</b> when it is positioned in a river, stream, ocean, or other body of water having water currents.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A-C</figref>, in use, the turbine system <b>100</b> can advantageously harness the energy from fluid flow in a manner that generates significant levels of electrical power even in relatively slow moving currents. In particular, the shape of the turbine <b>110</b> can provide a synergistic combination of Newtonian forces and a pressure recovery effect to drive the rotary motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. As such, the vertical-axis turbine <b>110</b> enables the turbine <b>110</b> to capture the kinetic energy from directional changes to the fluid flow more than once as the fluid flows over the upper face of the turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the fluid flow <b>50</b> can advanced toward the upstream portion <b>112</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> such that a portion of the fluid <b>50</b> is urged into the channel <b>125</b> at the upstream portion <b>112</b> (e.g., the channel <b>125</b> between the fins <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>e </i>in this example). The shape of the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>and the bell-shaped contour <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) that at least partially defines the surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>126</b> can serve to manage or otherwise control the fluid flow through a number of intense directional changes along the upper face of the turbine <b>110</b>. Here, the fluid <b>50</b> that is directed to flow into the channel <b>125</b> between the neighboring fins <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>e </i>acts upon at least the concave face <b>133</b> of the fin <b>130</b><i>a </i>so as to create Newtonian forces that urge the rotational motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. Thus, the fluid flow <b>50</b> acts upon the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>in a first instance when the fluid flow <b>50</b> passes along the upstream portion of the turbine <b>112</b>. Each of the channels includes a respective base surface <b>126</b> that leads to the upper convex surface <b>120</b>. Accordingly, when the fluid flow <b>50</b> advances along the channel <b>125</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the neighboring fins <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>e </i>serve to direct the fluid toward the upper convex surface <b>120</b>. Also, in some circumstances, a secondary flow may enter another channel along the upstream portion <b>112</b> to act upon the concave surface of at least on fin (refer to the dotted line flow arrow acting upon fin <b>130</b><i>b</i>) to further urge rotation of the turbine <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, while the fluid <b>50</b> flowing through the channels <b>125</b> along the upstream portion <b>112</b> is redirected by the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>(thereby providing Newtonian forces that urge the rotation of the turbine <b>110</b>), the fluid <b>50</b> is also traversing upward along the bell-shaped contour <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the base surfaces <b>126</b> of the channels <b>125</b> toward upper convex surface <b>120</b>. This direction change of the fluid flow <b>50</b> stages the fluid for a pressure recovery effect along the downstream portion <b>114</b>. Thus, the fluid flow <b>50</b> exits from the channel <b>125</b> along the upstream portion and travels over the top of the upper convex surface <b>120</b>. At this stage, the fluid flow <b>50</b> begins its downward path along the bell-shaped contour <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) into one or more channels <b>125</b> along the downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. It should be understood that, in particular flow conditions, some fluid flow may pass over the convex surfaces of one or more fins (refer to the dotted line flow arrows passing over fins <b>130</b><i>c </i>and <b>130</b><i>d</i>) during rotation of the turbine <b>110</b>, yet the turbine <b>110</b> can continue to rotate in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, while fluid <b>50</b> is directed down the upper convex surface <b>120</b> and into one or more of the channels <b>125</b> at the downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>, the fluid again acts upon the concave surfaces of the respective fins (fins <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c </i>in this depicted embodiment). Thus, these fins <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c </i>at the downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine <b>110</b> again capture a directional change of the fluid flow to provide a second instance of Newtonian forces that urge the rotational motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>. Moreover, as the fluid <b>50</b> moves in this path from the upper convex surface <b>120</b> to the downstream portion <b>114</b>, a pressure recovery effect is induced in one or more of the channels <b>125</b> to develop the high pressure region <b>138</b> (refer also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) along the downstream portion <b>114</b> that contributes even greater power to act upon the respective fins <b>130</b><i>b </i>and <b>130</b><i>c </i>at the downstream portion <b>114</b> of the turbine. Thus, the shape of the turbine <b>110</b> (including the fins <b>130</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, the upper convex surface <b>120</b>, and the bell-shaped contour <b>122</b>) may contribute to a synergistic combination of Newtonian forces and a pressure recovery effect to drive the rotary motion <b>116</b> of the turbine <b>110</b>, which can advantageously provide significant rotational power even in relatively slow water currents.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, the turbine <b>110</b> can be configured to having the upper face that is about 7.9 feet in diameter (centered about the vertical axis of rotation) and can be used to generate mechanically rotary motion that is sufficient to produce significant levels of electrical power even when submerged in generally horizontal water current of a slow river or stream. In some embodiments, when the turbine system <b>100</b> (having the turbine <b>110</b> of about 7.9 feet in diameter) is submerged in a slow river or stream having a current of about 2 knots, the turbine may rotate at a speed of about 3.5 rpms while also generating mechanical rotary motion with significant shaft horsepower (e.g., sufficient to produce, for example, significant levels of electrical power or pumping power). Also, when the turbine system <b>100</b> (having the turbine <b>110</b> of about 7.9 feet in diameter) is submerged in a more moderate current of about 6 knots the turbine may rotate at a safe speed of about 11 rpms while also generating mechanical rotary motion with significant shaft horsepower (e.g., sufficient to produce, for example, significant levels of electrical power or pumping power). At these rotational speeds, the turbine <b>110</b> is believe to be generally safe for fish or other marine life while the turbine <b>110</b> operates to generate renewable energy in a river, stream, or ocean environment. In another example, the turbine <b>110</b> can be configured to having a main body that is about 12 feet in diameter (centered about the vertical axis of rotation) and can be used to generate mechanical rotary motion with significant shaft horsepower (e.g., sufficient to produce, for example, significant levels of electrical power) when submerged in ocean tidal currents flowing generally perpendicular to the vertical axis <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, when the turbine system <b>100</b> (having the turbine <b>110</b> of about 12 feet in diameter) is submerged in ocean tidal currents, the turbine <b>110</b> may rotate at a speed that is safe for fish and other marine life while also generating mechanically rotary motion that is believed to be sufficient to produce significant levels of electrical power.</p>
