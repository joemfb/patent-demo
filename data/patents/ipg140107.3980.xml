<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a liquid crystal display (LCD) according to a first embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the LCD <b>100</b> may include a liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b>, a backlight unit <b>120</b>, cover <b>130</b>, housing <b>135</b>, a driving unit <b>140</b>, and a back case <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b>, on which an image may be displayed, may include a first and second substrates <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> attached to face a liquid crystal layer interposed therebetween. A plurality of scan lines and a plurality of data lines may cross in a matrix form to define a plurality of pixels on the first substrate <b>111</b> called a thin film transistor (TFT) array substrate. Each pixel may include a TFT to turn the pixel on or off and a pixel electrode to electrically connect the TFT. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color filters corresponding to the plurality of pixels and black matrixes surrounding the color filters and covering non-display elements such as the scan lines, the data lines, and the TFTs may be formed on the second substrate <b>112</b> called a color filter substrate.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b> and the backlight unit <b>120</b> may be modularized through the cover <b>130</b> and the housing <b>135</b>. The cover <b>130</b> may be positioned on the front surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b>, and may be a top cover shaped as a rectangular frame that may cover an upper surface and a side surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b>. A front surface of the cover <b>130</b> may be open to allow displaying of an image generated on the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The housing <b>135</b> may be positioned on a rear surface of the backlight unit <b>120</b> and may include a bottom plate <b>135</b><i>a </i>and a supporting plate <b>135</b><i>b</i>. The bottom plate <b>135</b><i>a </i>may be a bottom cover, to which the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b> and the backlight unit <b>120</b> are coupled, that may serve as a base for the LCD <b>100</b>. The bottom plate <b>135</b><i>a </i>may be shaped as a single rectangular plate. The supporting plate <b>135</b><i>b </i>may support and couple the cover <b>130</b> and the bottom plate <b>135</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The driving unit <b>140</b> may be disposed on one surface of the housing <b>135</b> positioned on the rear surface of the backlight unit <b>120</b>. The driving unit <b>140</b> may include a driving controller <b>141</b>, a main board <b>142</b>, and a power supply unit <b>143</b>.

The power supply unit <b>143</b> may provide power to the liquid crystal display panel <b>110</b> and the backlight unit <b>120</b>. The driving unit <b>140</b> may be coupled to the housing <b>135</b> by using a driving unit chassis <b>145</b>. The driving unit <b>140</b> may be covered by the back case <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate a backlight unit according to the first embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the backlight unit <b>200</b> may include an optical assembly <b>210</b> and an optical sheet <b>250</b>. The optical assembly <b>210</b> may include a first layer <b>215</b>, a plurality of light sources <b>217</b>, a reflective layer <b>220</b>, a second layer <b>230</b>, and a diffusion plate <b>240</b>. The plurality of light sources <b>217</b> may be formed on the first layer <b>215</b>, and the second layer <b>230</b> may be disposed on the first layer <b>215</b> to cover the plurality of light sources <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first layer <b>215</b> may be a board (or substrate) on which the plurality of light sources <b>217</b> may be mounted. An electrode pattern may be formed on the first layer <b>215</b> in order to connect an adapter that may supply power and the light sources <b>217</b>. For example, a carbon nano-tube (CNT) electrode pattern for connecting the light sources <b>217</b> and the adapter may be formed on an upper surface of the substrate. The first layer <b>215</b> may be a PCB formed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), glass, polycarbonate (PC), silicon (Si), or other appropriate materials on which the plurality of light sources <b>217</b> may be mounted. The first layer <b>215</b> may also be formed as a film.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The light sources <b>217</b> may be one of a light emitting diode (LED) chip and an LED package including at least one LED chip. In this embodiment, simply for ease of explanation, light sources <b>217</b> will be described herein as having an LED package.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The LED package constituting the light sources <b>217</b> may be classified into a top view type LED package and a side view type LED package depending on the direction of a light emission surface. The light sources <b>217</b> may be configured by using at least one of a top view type LED package in which a light emission surface may be formed toward the upper side and a side view type LED package in which the light emission surface may be formed toward the side. When the light sources <b>217</b> are the side view type LED package, the light emission surface of each of the plurality of light sources <b>217</b> may be disposed on the side, and the plurality of light sources <b>217</b> may emit light in a lateral direction, for example, in the direction in which the first layer <b>215</b> or the reflective layer <b>220</b> extends. Thus, the thickness of the second layer <b>230</b> formed on the light sources <b>217</b> may be reduced, making the backlight unit <b>200</b> and the LCD <b>100</b> thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light sources <b>217</b> may be color LEDs that may emit at least one of red, blue, and green colors, or white LEDs. The colored LEDs may include at least one of red LEDs, blue LEDs, and green LEDs. Accordingly, the disposition and color of light emitted from the LEDs may be variably modified.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second layer <b>230</b> may be disposed on the first layer <b>215</b> and may cover the plurality of light sources <b>217</b>. The second layer <b>230</b> may allow light emitted from the light sources <b>217</b> to transmit therethrough and spread the light, whereby the light emitted from the light sources <b>217</b> may be uniformly provided to the liquid crystal display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The reflective layer <b>220</b> may reflect light emitted from the light sources <b>217</b> and may be positioned on the first layer <b>215</b>. The reflective layer <b>220</b> may be formed on an area of the first layer <b>215</b>, other than the area where the light sources <b>217</b> are formed. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reflective layer <b>220</b> may include recesses corresponding to the light sources <b>217</b> in which the light sources <b>217</b> may be positioned. The reflective layer <b>220</b> may reflect light emitted from the light sources <b>217</b> and reflect again light totally reflected from the boundary of the second layer <b>230</b> to further increase the area of light dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The reflective layer <b>220</b> may contain at least one of metal or a metal oxide, a reflective material. For example, the reflective layer <b>220</b> may be formed of metal or metal oxide having a high reflectance, for example, aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), gold (Au), titanium dioxide (TiO2), or other appropriate reflective materials. The reflective layer <b>220</b> may be formed by depositing or coating the metal or metal oxide on the first layer <b>215</b> or by printing metal ink on the first layer <b>215</b>. Here, a vacuum deposition method, for example, a thermal deposition method, an evaporation method, a sputtering method, or other appropriate deposition methods may be used as the deposition method. Further, a printing method, a gravure coating method, a silk screen method, or other appropriate methods may be used as the coating or printing method.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second layer <b>230</b> on the first layer <b>215</b> may be formed of a light-transmissive material, for example, a silicon or acrylic resin. However, the second layer <b>230</b> is not limited thereto and may be formed of various other resins. In order to allow the backlight unit <b>200</b> to have a uniform luminance in diffusing light emitted from the light sources <b>217</b>, the second layer <b>230</b> may be formed of a resin having a refractive index of about 1.4 to 1.6. For example, the second layer <b>230</b> may be formed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polycarbonate (Pr), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polyepoxy (PE), silicon, acryl, or other appropriate materials.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second layer <b>230</b> may include a polymer resin having an adhesive property so as to be firmly and tightly attached to the light sources <b>217</b> and the reflective layer <b>220</b>. For example, the second layer <b>230</b> may be formed of acryl group, urethane group, epoxy group, and melamine group such as unsaturated polyester, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, n-butyl methyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, hydroxyl ethyl methacrylate, hydroxyl propyl methacrylate, hydroxyl ethyl acrylate, acrylamide, methylol acrylamide, glycidyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate polymer, copolymer, terpolymer, other appropriate materials.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second layer <b>230</b> may be formed by coating a liquid or gel phase resin on the first layer <b>215</b> having the plurality of light sources <b>217</b> and the reflective layer <b>220</b> formed thereon, and then hardening the resin. Alternatively, the second layer <b>230</b> may be formed by coating a resin on a support sheet, partially hardening the resin, and then bonding the same to the first layer <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The diffusion plate <b>240</b> may be formed on the second layer <b>230</b> that may allow light emitted from the light sources <b>217</b> to be diffused upward. The diffusion plate <b>240</b> may be bonded to the second layer <b>230</b> using an additional adhesive member.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4K</figref> illustrate an optical sheet according to the first embodiment. The optical sheet <b>250</b> may be positioned on the foregoing optical assembly <b>210</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the optical sheet <b>250</b> according to this embodiment may be a diffusion sheet that may diffuse light outputted from the light sources or a prism sheet that may concentrate light.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The optical sheet <b>250</b> may include a plurality of holes or slots <b>251</b> on at least one side such that the optical sheet <b>250</b> may be coupled to the cover <b>130</b> or the housing <b>135</b>. The optical sheet <b>250</b> may have a rectangular shape, and the plurality of holes <b>251</b> may be positioned on the upper side <b>255</b> and lower side <b>256</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b>. Here, the upper side <b>255</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b> may correspond to an upper side of the LCD when assembled and positioned to stand or mounted for use. Likewise, the lower side <b>256</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b> may correspond to a lower side of the LCD.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The holes <b>251</b> may be formed at protrusions or tabs <b>252</b> protruded from at least one side of the optical sheet <b>250</b>, for example, at the upper side <b>255</b> and the lower side <b>256</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b>. The protrusions <b>252</b> may subsequently be coupled with the cover <b>130</b> or the housing <b>135</b>, and may be formed such that they protrude from one side of the optical sheet <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The holes <b>251</b> formed at the protrusions <b>252</b> may have various shapes including a polygonal shape, a triangular shape, a circular shape, a quadrangular shape, or other appropriate shapes. Also, the protrusions <b>252</b> may have various shapes that allow the protrusions <b>252</b> to be easily coupled with the cover <b>130</b> or the housing <b>135</b>. For example, the portions of the protrusions <b>252</b> in contact with the cover <b>130</b> or the housing <b>135</b> may have a large quadrangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The plurality of holes <b>251</b> may be formed such that a number of holes <b>251</b> formed on one of the plurality of sides of the optical sheet <b>250</b> is less than a number of holes <b>251</b> formed on another of the plurality of sides of the optical sheet <b>250</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the number of holes <b>251</b> formed on the upper side <b>255</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b> may be greater than the number of holes <b>251</b> formed on the lower side <b>256</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b>. As discussed above, the upper side <b>255</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b> may correspond to the upper side of the LCD when the LCD is assembled. In order to prevent the optical sheet <b>250</b> from sagging due to the weight of the LCD components when assembled, a greater number of holes <b>251</b> may be formed on the upper side <b>255</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A plurality of holes <b>251</b> may also be formed on the sides of the optical sheet <b>250</b> which face each other. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref>, the plurality of holes <b>251</b> may be positioned on the upper side <b>255</b> and the lower side <b>256</b> of the optical sheet <b>250</b> which face each other.

Thus, because the light source assemblies <b>540</b> that implement light in an edge manner are formed on the entire lower surface of the bottom plate <b>510</b>, they may function as a backlight unit that provides light in a direct manner.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the optical sheet <b>560</b> may be positioned on the plurality of light source assemblies <b>540</b> formed on the lower surface of the bottom plate <b>510</b>.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The optical sheet <b>560</b> may be mounted on the plurality of light source assemblies <b>540</b> and may be coupled to the fixing part <b>520</b> formed on the side wall of the bottom plate <b>510</b>.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Accordingly, as the holes <b>565</b> of the optical sheet <b>560</b> may be coupled to the fixing parts <b>520</b> formed on the side wall of the bottom plate <b>510</b>, the optical sheet <b>560</b> may be fixed to the bottom plate <b>510</b>. Thus, the optical sheet <b>560</b> may be prevented from being deformed as it contracts or expands due to heat generated from the light sources <b>542</b> of the optical assembly <b>540</b>. Therefore, light uniformity of the backlight unit may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a direct type backlight unit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a backlight unit <b>600</b> may include a bottom plate <b>610</b>, a reflective plate <b>620</b>, light sources <b>630</b>, a diffusion plate <b>650</b>, and an optical sheet <b>650</b>. The reflective plate <b>620</b> may be positioned on the entire inner surface of the bottom plate <b>610</b> and may serve to reflect light emitted from the light sources <b>630</b> upwards. The light sources <b>630</b> may be a CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp), an HCFL (hot cathode fluorescent lamp), an EEFL (extended electrode fluorescent lamp), or other appropriate light source. A plurality of light sources may be positioned to be separated at predescribed intervals. The diffusion plate <b>640</b> may serve to diffuse linear light emitted from the light sources <b>630</b> and may change it into surface-type light. The optical sheet <b>650</b> may be positioned at an upper side of the diffusion plate <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The direct type backlight unit <b>600</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may use a plurality of lamps having a large diameter as light sources, and may cause increase in the thickness of the space within the bottom plate <b>610</b> in which the light sources <b>630</b> are disposed. This may result in an increase in the thickness of the backlight unit <b>600</b>. Accordingly, because there may be a relatively large space between the light sources <b>630</b> and the optical sheet <b>650</b>, heat generated by the light sources <b>630</b> may be prevented from being transferred to the optical sheet <b>650</b>. Thus, the optical sheet <b>650</b> may be protected from being deformed by the heat by the light sources <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Meanwhile, the backlight units according to the first and second embodiments may be configured to have the light source assemblies including very small LED light sources. For example, in the backlight unit according to the first embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second layer <b>230</b> may be positioned to cover the light sources <b>217</b>, the diffusion plate <b>240</b> may be formed contiguously on the second layer <b>230</b>, and the optical sheet <b>250</b> may be positioned on the diffusion plate <b>240</b>. Further, in the backlight unit according to the second embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the light sources <b>542</b> and the light guide plates <b>543</b> may be formed, and then the optical sheet <b>560</b> may be disposed on the light guide plates <b>543</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, the backlight units according to the first and second embodiments may have a relatively thin structure as they may use very small LED light sources. Thus, the space between the LED light sources and the optical sheet may be very narrow. Heat discharged from the light sources, therefore, may be directly transferred to the optical sheet. In particular, in case of the backlight unit according to the first embodiment, there may not be sufficient space for releasing heat that is generated by the LED light sources. This may result in deformation of the optical sheet formed of a resin material as it contracts or expands due to the heat generated by the light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Thus, in order to overcome this problem, in the first and second embodiments, the plurality of holes may be formed on the optical sheet and coupled to the plurality of fixing parts that may be formed on the bottom plate. Accordingly, a margin, allowing for thermal expansion of the optical sheet due to heat generated by the light sources, may be created between the holes and the fixing parts, thereby preventing possible creases in the optical sheet. Also, as the optical sheet contracts, the fixing parts may serve to apply tension to the optical sheet to prevent the optical sheet from contracting. Thus, deformation of the optical sheet may be prevented.</p>

In this embodiment, simply for ease of explanation, the light sources <b>742</b> will be described as being an LED package. The LED package constituting the light sources <b>742</b> may be classified into a top view type LED package and a side view type LED package depending on the direction of a light emission surface. The light sources <b>742</b> according to this embodiment may be configured by using at least one of the top view type LED package in which a light emission surface may be formed toward the upper side and the side view type LED package in which the light emission surface may be formed toward the lateral side.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A light guide plate <b>743</b> may be disposed in a direction in which light may be emitted from the light sources <b>742</b> and may serve to widely spread light formed incident from the light sources <b>742</b>. A reflective plate <b>744</b> may be disposed at a lower portion of the light guide plate <b>743</b> to reflect upwards light which may be reflected downward from the light guide plate <b>743</b>. The optical assembly <b>740</b> including the first layer <b>741</b> and the light sources <b>742</b> may be positioned on the side of the bottom plate <b>710</b> as a backlight unit implementing light in an edge manner.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The optical sheet <b>760</b> may be positioned on the light guide plate <b>743</b>. The optical sheet <b>760</b> may be a diffusion sheet that may diffuse light or a prism sheet that may concentrate light. A plurality of optical sheets may be formed. The optical sheet <b>760</b> may be mounted on the light guide plate <b>760</b> and may be coupled to the fixing part <b>720</b> formed on the side wall of the bottom plate <b>710</b>. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4K</figref> according to the first embodiment as described above, the optical sheet <b>760</b> may include a plurality of holes <b>765</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> according to the first embodiment as described above, the bottom plate <b>710</b> may include a plurality of fixing parts <b>720</b>. Accordingly, as the holes <b>765</b> of the optical sheet <b>760</b> may be coupled to the fixing parts <b>720</b> formed on the side wall of the bottom plate <b>710</b>, the optical sheet <b>760</b> may be fixed to the bottom plate <b>710</b>. Thus, deformation of the optical sheet <b>760</b> may be prevented as it contracts or expands due to heat generated from the light sources <b>742</b> of the optical assembly <b>740</b>. Accordingly, light uniformity of the backlight unit may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an edge type backlight unit. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a backlight unit <b>800</b> may include a bottom plate <b>810</b>, a reflective plate <b>820</b>, light sources <b>830</b>, a light guide plate <b>840</b>, and an optical sheet <b>850</b>. The reflective plate <b>820</b> may be positioned on an entire inner surface of the bottom plate <b>810</b> to serve to reflect upwards light emitted from the light sources <b>830</b>. The light sources <b>830</b> may be a CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent lamp), an HCFL (hot cathode fluorescent lamp), an EEFL (extended electrode fluorescent lamp), or other appropriate light sources. The light sources <b>830</b> may be disposed at one side of the bottom plate <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The light guide plate <b>840</b> may be positioned on the side portion of the light sources <b>830</b> and on the entire surface of the bottom plate <b>810</b>. The light guide plate <b>840</b> may also serve to reflect light emitted from the light sources <b>830</b> to change it into a surface-type light. The optical sheet <b>850</b> may be positioned at an upper side of the light guide plate <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The edge type backlight unit <b>800</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may use a plurality of lamps as light sources having a large diameter increasing the relative thickness of the space within the bottom plate <b>810</b> in which the light sources <b>830</b> are disposed. This may result in an increase in the overall thickness of the backlight unit <b>800</b>. Accordingly, because there may be relatively large space between the light sources <b>830</b> and the optical sheet <b>850</b>, heat generated by the light sources <b>830</b> may be prevented from being transferred to the optical sheet <b>850</b>. The optical sheet <b>850</b> may thus be protected from being deformed by the heat generated by the light sources <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Meanwhile, the backlight unit according to the third embodiment may be configured to have the light source assemblies including very small LED light sources. For example, the backlight unit according to the third exemplary embodiment of the invention may have a relatively thin structure in which the very small LED light sources may be used. Thus, the space between the LED light sources and the optical sheet may be very narrow. Accordingly, heat discharged from the light sources may be directly transferred to the optical sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Also, in order to emit light with an equal luminance as that of the fluorescent lamp light sources, a large amount of current may be required by the LED light sources. In this case, as the applied current increases the amount of heat generated by the LED may also increase. Then, the optical sheets that are formed of a resin material may be deformed and may contract or expand due to heat emitted from the light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Thus, in the edge type backlight unit according to the third embodiment, a plurality of holes may be formed at the optical sheet and a plurality of fixing parts may be formed at the bottom plate, wherein the holes of the optical sheet and the fixing parts of the bottom plate may be coupled to each other. Accordingly, a margin allowing for thermal expansion of the optical sheet due to heat generated by the light sources may be created between the holes and the fixing parts, thereby preventing possible creases in the optical sheet. Also, as the optical sheet contracts, the fixing parts may serve to apply tension to the optical sheet to prevent the optical sheet from contracting. Thus, deformation of the optical sheet may be prevented.</p>
