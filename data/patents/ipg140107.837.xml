<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is directed generally to gas turbine engines, and more particularly to wear indication systems for turbine systems in gas turbine engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, gas turbine engines include a compressor for compressing air, a combustor for mixing the compressed air with fuel and igniting the mixture, and a turbine blade assembly for producing power. The compressor and turbine assemblies are formed of blades attached to a rotor interspersed with stationary stator vanes. The compressor and turbine assemblies include blades extending radially outward therefrom that are cooled with internal cooling systems and are collected into rows. Vanes extend radially inward and are collected into rows that are positioned between the rows of compressor and turbine assemblies. The stationary vane assemblies include seal arrangements with the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During operation, a seal holder attached to a stator vane tends to move upstream due to the pressure load acting in an upstream direction. The pressure load acts upstream because of a pressure difference between leading and trailing edges of the stator vane. During turbine engine operation as the compressor diaphragm outer hook wears, the upstream gap between the stator vane and the upstream rotor disk gradually reduces over time. As the stator vane moves toward the rotor disk, the gap reduces in size, and the seal holder will contact the rotor disk, which results in damage of rotor disk, the seal holder, and domestic damage of the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wear pin has been used to determine the rate of closure of the gap between the stator vane and the rotor disk. The closure rate has been used to predict when the seal holder will hit the rotor disk. Such prediction has been used to schedule proper maintenance. The wear pin is usually formed from a plastic with low shear strength so that the wear pin wears without damaging the rotor disk upon which the wear pin contacts. The wear pin typically includes a threaded base and is screwed into place. The plastic wear pin often becomes brittle and breaks apart due to the compressor heat. As such, the wear pin becomes ineffective at predicting the gap closure rate. Thus, a need exists for a more robust system for determining compressor diaphragm outer hook wear.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates to a wear indication system for use in turbine engines to measure gap closure that indicates the amount of wear found on a compressor diaphragm outer hook to prevent contact between a compressor vane attached to the compressor diaphragm outer hook and an upstream compressor blade. The wear indication system enables the wear to be identified, and the wear serviced before failure occurs. The wear indication system may be formed from a base mounting plate having at least one wearable material receiving surface. Two or more wearable material layers may be attached to the base mounting plate. The outermost wearable layer may have a cross-sectional area less than a wearable layer to which it is attached to enable visual determination of the amount of wear that has occurred. The wearable layers may be formed from a honeycomb shaped material enabling wear to occur to the layers without threatening downstream components with damage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The wear indication system for identifying outer hook wear in turbine engines may include a base mounting plate having at least one wearable material receiving surface. The base mounting plate may extend radially beyond the first wearable material layer and may include at least one orifice usable to attach the base mounting plate to a turbine component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wear indication system may also include a first wearable material layer having a first surface attached to the wearable material receiving surface and a second surface on an opposite side of the first wearable material layer from the first surface. A second wearable material layer may have a first surface attached to a second surface of the first wearable material layer, wherein a cross-sectional area of the second wearable material layer is less than a cross-sectional area of the first wearable material layer. The first and second wearable material layers may have generally cylindrically shaped side surfaces, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or may be generally rectangular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The wear indication system may include a releasable connector extending from the base mounting plate for attaching the wear indication system to an inner seal of a compressor vane. In at least one embodiment, the releasable connector may be a threaded shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first wearable material layer may be formed from honeycomb shaped material. The honeycomb shaped material may be oriented such that channels within the honeycomb shaped material extend from the first surface to the second surface of the first wearable material layer. The second wearable material layer may also be formed from honeycomb shaped material. The honeycomb shaped material may be oriented such that channels within the honeycomb shaped material extend from the first surface to the second surface of the second wearable material layer as well. The honeycomb shaped material may be formed from materials, such as, but not limited to, metallic foil. The metallic foil may have a thickness of between about 0.005 inch and about 0.020 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The wear indication system may include three or more wearable material layers. For instance, in another embodiment, the wear indication system may include a third wearable material layer having a first surface attached to a second surface of the second wearable material layer, wherein a cross-sectional area of the third wearable material layer is less than a cross-sectional area of the second wearable material layer. The third wearable material layer may be formed from a honeycomb shaped material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An advantage of this invention is that the wearable material layers may be formed from a material capable of wearing to indicate material loss at the outer hook without creating projectiles that may possibly damage downstream turbine components.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another advantage of this invention is that the honeycomb shaped wearable material layers may be formed from one or more metals capable of withstanding the hot environment found within a compressor of a turbine engine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other embodiments are described in more detail below.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, this invention is directed to a wear indication system <b>10</b> for use in turbine engines <b>11</b> to measure gap closure that indicates the amount of wear found on a compressor diaphragm outer hook <b>12</b> to prevent contact between a compressor vane <b>14</b> attached to the compressor diaphragm outer hook <b>12</b> and an upstream compressor blade <b>16</b>. The wear indication system <b>10</b> enables the wear to be identified and the wear serviced before failure occurs. The wear indication system <b>10</b> may be formed from a base mounting plate <b>18</b> having at least one wearable material receiving surface <b>20</b>. At least two wearable material layers <b>22</b> may be attached to the base mounting plate <b>18</b>. The outermost wearable layer <b>54</b> may have a cross-sectional area less than one or more wearable layers <b>24</b> to which it is attached to enable visual determination of the amount of wear that has occurred. The wearable layers <b>22</b> may be formed from a honeycomb shaped material enabling wear to occur without threatening downstream components with damage.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The wear indication system <b>10</b> for identifying outer hook wear in turbine engines <b>11</b> may be formed from a base mounting plate <b>18</b> having at least one wearable material receiving surface <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. The base mounting plate <b>18</b> may be in the form of a plate or other appropriate structure. The wearable material receiving surface <b>20</b> may be flat or otherwise structured to receive a wearable material layer <b>22</b>. The base mounting plate <b>18</b> may be generally cylindrical or have another appropriate shape. The base mounting plate <b>18</b> may be formed from any material, such as, but not limited to, metal, capable of withstanding high temperatures that are found in the compressor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The base mounting plate <b>18</b> may be releasably attachable to an upstream side <b>28</b> of an inner seal <b>30</b>. As the wear occurs to the compressor diaphragm outer hook <b>12</b>, the compressor vane <b>14</b> tilts upstream causing the inner seal <b>30</b> of the diaphragm to move generally upstream. The base mounting plate <b>18</b> may include a releasable connector <b>36</b> extending from the base mounting plate <b>18</b>. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the releasable connector <b>36</b> may be a threaded shaft <b>38</b>. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the base mounting plate <b>18</b> may extend radially beyond the first wearable material layer <b>24</b> and may include one or more orifices <b>40</b> usable to attach the base mounting plate <b>18</b> to a turbine component <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wear indication system <b>10</b> may also include one or more wearable material layers <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, wear indication system <b>10</b> may include a single wearable layer <b>22</b> with two or more reduced sized sections, with the smaller section being positioned opposite from the base mounting plate <b>18</b>, to enable one to determine whether wear to the outer hook needs to be serviced by looking at the wear that has occurred to the single wearable layer <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the wear indication system <b>10</b> may be formed from two or more wearable material layers <b>22</b>. The wear indication system <b>10</b> may be formed from a first wearable material layer <b>24</b> having a first surface <b>44</b> attached to the wearable material receiving surface <b>20</b> and a second surface <b>46</b> on an opposite side of the first wearable material layer <b>24</b> from the first surface <b>44</b>. The first wearable material layer <b>24</b> may be attached to the wearable material receiving surface <b>20</b> via brazing or through other appropriate methods. A second wearable material layer <b>26</b> may have a first surface <b>44</b> attached to a second surface <b>46</b> of the first wearable material layer <b>24</b>. A cross-sectional area of the second wearable material layer <b>26</b> may be less than a cross-sectional area of the first wearable material layer <b>24</b>, thereby enabling visual inspection of the wear indication system <b>10</b> with a bore-scope to easily determine whether wear to the outer hook needs to be serviced. Such a configuration creates tiers or steps that are easily seen.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first wearable material layer <b>24</b> may be formed from a honeycomb shaped material. The second wearable material layer <b>26</b> may also be formed from honeycomb shaped material. The honeycomb shaped material may be oriented such that channels <b>48</b> within the honeycomb shaped material extend from the first surface <b>44</b> to the second surface <b>46</b> of the first and second wearable material layers <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The honeycomb shaped material may be formed from a material that is capable of withstanding the heat formed in the compressor <b>50</b>, such as, but not limited to, a metallic foil. The metallic foil may be sized such that if a piece of the foil breaks free and is swept downstream during turbine engine operation, the downstream components are not likely to suffer damage. As such, the metallic foil may have a thickness of between about 0.005 inch and about 0.020 inch. The first and second wearable material layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be separated by a support layer <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. The second wearable layer <b>26</b> and a third wearable material layer <b>54</b> may be separated with a support layer <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. The third wearable material layer <b>54</b> and other outer wearable layers may be separated with a support layer <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. The support layer <b>52</b> may be, but is not limited to being, a thin foil layer. The support layer <b>52</b> may be attached to the adjacent wearable material layers <b>22</b> by brazing or other appropriate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the wear indication system <b>10</b> may be include the third wearable material layer <b>54</b> having a first surface <b>44</b> attached to a second surface <b>46</b> of the second wearable material layer <b>26</b>, whereby a cross-sectional area of the third wearable material layer <b>54</b> is less than a cross-sectional area of the second wearable material layer <b>26</b>. The third wearable material layer <b>54</b> may be formed from a honeycomb shaped material. In other embodiments, the wear indication system <b>10</b> may include four or more wearable material layers <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the first, second and third wearable material layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>54</b> may have generally cylindrically shaped side surfaces. As such, the wearable material layers, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>54</b> form a conical configuration formed by a plurality of tiers that enable one to easily determine visually the amount of wear on the outer hook <b>12</b> by viewing the wear on the first, second and third wearable material layers <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the wear indication system <b>10</b> may be attached to an inner seal of a compressor vane <b>14</b> and may extend upstream toward an upstream compressor blade <b>16</b>. During turbine engine operation, the compressor diaphragm outer hook <b>12</b> may be become worn and cause an outer surface <b>58</b> of the wear indication system <b>10</b> to contact a rotor <b>56</b> to which the upstream compressor blade <b>16</b> is attached. As the compressor diaphragm outer hook <b>12</b> continues to wear down from turbine engine operation, the outer surface <b>58</b> of the wear indication system <b>10</b> continues to wear down. The amount of wear to the compressor diaphragm outer hook <b>12</b> can be determined by observing the wear to the outer surface <b>58</b> of the wear indication system <b>10</b>. Because the wearable material layers <b>22</b> of the wear indication system <b>10</b> are formed from honeycomb shaped material, any material that is worn from the wear indication system <b>10</b> is small enough not to create a substantial risk to downstream turbine components.</p>

Modifications and adaptations to these embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made without departing from the scope or spirit of this invention.</p>
