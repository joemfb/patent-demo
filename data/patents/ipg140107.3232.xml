<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor chips with integrated circuits are a part of most modern electronic devices. The distribution of electric power is central to the operation of these semiconductor chips. In some semiconductor chips, fifty percent or more of inputs and outputs are dedicated to power distribution. Similarly, a quarter to a third of the layers of a circuit board upon which a semiconductor chip is mounted are often dedicated to power, ground, and other power distribution functions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditional electrical power connections can also be affected by electromigration, parasitic capacitances, voltage drops, and the like. These effects can complicate the design of traditional power distribution circuits for semiconductor chips and can reduce the efficiency of traditional power distribution.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">From the foregoing discussion, it should be apparent that a need exists for an apparatus, system, and method that provide power to a semiconductor chip. Beneficially, such an apparatus, system, and method would provide power to a semiconductor chip optically.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been developed in response to the present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available power distribution systems.

The one or more conductive pathways of the semiconductor chip, in certain embodiments, are between the photovoltaic semiconductor layer and the active semiconductor layer. In a further embodiment, the one or more conductive pathways provide the electric power from the photovoltaic semiconductor layer to the one or more integrated circuit devices of the active semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A method of the present invention is also presented for providing optical power to a semiconductor. The method in the disclosed embodiments substantially includes the steps necessary to carry out the functions presented above with respect to the operation of the described apparatus and system. In one embodiment, the method includes impinging electromagnetic radiation onto a back side of a semiconductor chip. In a further embodiment, the method includes converting the electromagnetic radiation to electric power using a photovoltaic semiconductor layer of the semiconductor chip.</p>

Each semiconductor chip <b>118</b>, in the depicted embodiment, includes a photovoltaic semiconductor layer <b>112</b> and an active semiconductor layer <b>114</b>. The system <b>100</b>, in one embodiment, distributes electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> along engineered propagation pathways to the one or more semiconductor chips <b>118</b> and the photovoltaic semiconductor layers <b>112</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>118</b> convert the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> to electric power to power the active semiconductor layers <b>114</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, gamma rays, and the like. Distributing energy as electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> instead of using traditional electrical distribution, in certain embodiments, may reduce the number of inputs and outputs of the system <b>100</b> that are dedicated to power distribution. In semiconductor chips that receive power using traditional electrical distribution, up to fifty percent or more of inputs and outputs of a semiconductor chip may be dedicated to power distribution. Similarly, a quarter to a third of the layers of a circuit board are typically dedicated to power, ground, and other power distribution functions.</p>

Further, in various embodiments, using electromagnetic waves to distribute power to the semiconductor chips <b>118</b> may reduce or eliminate the negative effects of electromigration, parasitic capacitances, voltage drops, and the like associated with traditional electrical power distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>102</b> is an optical power source for the system <b>100</b>, generating, collecting, directing, and/or otherwise providing the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> to the system <b>100</b>.

In a further embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>102</b> provides the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> as a coherent beam, such as a laser beam, or the like, that has a substantially uniform relative phase (or set of several substantially uniform relative phases).

In certain embodiments, where a bulk semiconductor layer is disposed between a photovoltaic semiconductor layer <b>112</b> and the back side of a semiconductor chip <b>118</b>, providing the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> at wavelengths to which the bulk semiconductor layer is substantially transparent allows at least a portion of the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> to travel through the bulk semiconductor layer into the photovoltaic semiconductor layer <b>112</b> where photons of the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> may be absorbed, freeing electrons to create an electric current and generate electric power.

In another embodiment, the electromagnetic radiation source <b>102</b> may direct the electromagnetic radiation <b>104</b> directly to the back sides of the one or more semiconductor chips <b>118</b>, or the like.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the depicted embodiment, each output of the beam splitter <b>106</b> corresponds to a fiber optic channel <b>108</b>.
