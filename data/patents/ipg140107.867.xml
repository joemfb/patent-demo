<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed to a fuel system and, more particularly, to a fuel system having accumulators and flow limiters.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Common rail fuel systems typically employ multiple fuel injectors to inject highly pressurized fuel into combustion chambers of an engine. The high-pressure fuel is supplied to the fuel injectors via a common rail or manifold that is secured along a length of the engine, and individual supply lines connected between the common rail and each of the injectors. In some configurations, flow limiters can be employed in the supply passages between the common rail and each of the fuel injectors to limit fuel leakage during catastrophic injector failure or to dampen pressure oscillations caused by normal operation of the fuel injectors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although functionally adequate, the common rail fuel system described above can be expensive and time consuming to fabricate. In particular, because of the high pressure of the fuel passing through the common rail, the common rail is generally made from heavy solid-stock material. The solid-stock material must be gun-drilled through its entire length to form a main bore having thick walls that can withstand the elevated pressures. In addition, each intersection of the common rail with the individual supply lines must be cross-drilled into the solid-stock material, and then treated, for example by way of autofrettage, ECM, abrasive flow, etc., to help ensure hermetic sealing of the intersections with little or no process contamination. These materials and processes used in the fabrication of the common rail increase a cost and a fabrication time of the fuel system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One attempt to address the problems described above is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,412 (the '412 patent) of Jay issued on Feb. 8, 2005. Specifically, the '412 patent discloses a fuel injection system having an injector nozzle for each cylinder of an engine, and a dedicated pressure accumulator in direct connection with each nozzle. The dedicated pressure accumulators replace the common rail typical of such fuel systems. Each of the pressure accumulators is arranged at least partially within a cylinder head of the engine such that the cylinder head serves as a supporting casing for the accumulators, and extends from outside the cylinder head to the injector nozzles. Each pressure accumulator comprises a longitudinally elongated body part that defines at least two separate chambers in open fluid communication with each other and bounded by a common intermediate wall. A total volume of each pressure accumulator is at least 30 times greater than the volume of fuel injected by one injector nozzle during a single combustion stroke of the engine. The pressure accumulators fluidly communicate with each other by way of a tube system external to the cylinder head, the tube system being connected to a high pressure fuel pump driven by the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the system of the '412 patent may reduce fuel system costs by replacing the common rail with dedicated pressure accumulators, the system may still be less than optimal. In particular, the multiple chambers within each accumulator of the '412 patent may increase a complexity of the accumulators, making the accumulators expensive and time consuming to fabricate. Further, the system of the '412 patent does not provide any way to limit fuel leakage during catastrophic injector failure or to dampen pressure oscillations caused by normal operation of an injector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The system of the present disclosure solves one or more of the problems set forth above and/or other problems of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a fuel accumulator. The fuel accumulator may include a body having a first end, a second end, and a single chamber extending in a length direction of the body between the first end and the second end. The fuel accumulator may also include a cap configured to close off the first end and including a first inlet and a first outlet in fluid communication with the single chamber of the body, each of the first inlet and first outlet having a diameter. The single chamber may have a cross-sectional diameter greater than the diameters of the first inlet and the first outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a flow limiter. The flow limiter may include a body having an inlet, an outlet, and a recess disposed between the inlet and the outlet. The fuel limiter may also include a first valve element disposed within the recess and configured to allow substantially unrestricted fuel flow from the inlet to the recess and to restrict fuel flow from the recess to the inlet. The fuel limiter may further include a second valve element disposed within the recess and configured to allow fuel flow from the recess to the outlet during a first condition, and to inhibit fuel flow from the recess to the outlet during a second condition.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to fuel system for an engine. The fuel system may include a pump driven by the engine to pressurize fuel, and a plurality of fuel injectors configured to inject pressurized fuel into associated combustion chambers of the engine. Each of the plurality of fuel injectors may be located at least partially within a different cylinder head of the engine. The fuel system may also include a plurality of fuel accumulators associated with the plurality of fuel injectors. Each of the plurality of fuel accumulators may be disposed at least partially within a different cylinder head of the engine in fluid communication with an associated fuel injector of the plurality of fuel injectors and in fluid communication with adjacent fuel accumulators of the plurality of fuel accumulators. At least one of the plurality of fuel accumulators may also be in fluid communication with the pump.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An exemplary embodiment of an engine <b>10</b> having a fuel system <b>12</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the purposes of this disclosure, engine <b>10</b> is depicted and described as a four-stroke diesel engine. One skilled in the art will recognize, however, that engine <b>10</b> may be any other type of internal combustion engine such as, for example, a gasoline or a gaseous fuel-powered engine. Engine <b>10</b> may include an engine block <b>14</b> that at least partially defines a plurality of cylinders <b>16</b>, a piston <b>18</b> slidably disposed within each cylinder <b>16</b>, and a cylinder head <b>20</b> associated with each cylinder <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Cylinder <b>16</b>, piston <b>18</b>, and cylinder head <b>20</b> may together form a combustion chamber <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, engine <b>10</b> includes four combustion chambers <b>22</b>. However, it is contemplated that engine <b>10</b> may include a greater or lesser number of combustion chambers <b>22</b> and that combustion chambers <b>22</b> may be disposed in an &#x201c;in-line&#x201d; configuration, a &#x201c;V&#x201d; configuration, or in any other suitable configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Fuel system <b>12</b> may include components that cooperate to deliver injections of pressurized fuel into each combustion chamber <b>22</b>. Specifically, fuel system <b>12</b> may include a tank <b>24</b> configured to hold a supply of fuel, a fuel pumping arrangement <b>26</b> configured to pressurize the fuel, and a plurality of fuel injectors <b>28</b> configured to receive the pressurized fuel by way of a plurality of distributed accumulators <b>30</b>. Each fuel injector <b>28</b> may be associated with a different cylinder head <b>20</b> and be operable to inject an amount of pressurized fuel into an associated combustion chamber <b>22</b> at specific timings, fuel pressures, and fuel flow rates.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Fuel pumping arrangement <b>26</b> may include one or more pumping devices that function to increase the pressure of the fuel and direct one or more pressurized streams of fuel to accumulators <b>30</b> and fuel injectors <b>28</b>. In one example, fuel pumping arrangement <b>26</b> may include a low-pressure source <b>32</b> and a high-pressure source <b>34</b> disposed in series and fluidly connected by way of a fuel line <b>36</b>. Low-pressure source <b>32</b> may be a transfer pump configured to draw fuel from tank <b>24</b> and provide low-pressure feed to high-pressure source <b>34</b>. High-pressure source <b>34</b> may be configured to receive the low pressure feed and increase the pressure of the fuel to, in some embodiments, about 200-400 MPa. High-pressure source <b>34</b> may be connected to accumulators <b>30</b> by way of a fuel line <b>38</b>. A check valve <b>40</b> may be disposed within fuel line <b>38</b> to provide for a unidirectional flow of fuel from fuel pumping arrangement <b>26</b> to accumulators <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each fuel injector <b>28</b> may be paired with one accumulator <b>30</b> to receive pressurized fuel from that accumulator <b>30</b>. The paired fuel injector <b>28</b> and accumulator <b>30</b> may be at least partially disposed within a common cylinder head <b>20</b>, with an axial flow direction of accumulator <b>30</b> being oriented generally orthogonal to an axial flow direction of the paired fuel injector <b>28</b>. Fuel injector <b>28</b> may extend from an upper surface <b>42</b> of cylinder head <b>20</b> through a lower surface <b>44</b> of cylinder head <b>20</b> and a distance into combustion chamber <b>22</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Accumulator <b>30</b> may extend from a front surface <b>46</b> of cylinder head <b>20</b> about halfway through cylinder head <b>20</b> to a location about midway along a length of fuel injector <b>28</b>. Each accumulator <b>30</b> may be in fluid communication with each fuel injector <b>28</b> and with adjacent accumulators <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, accumulators <b>30</b> may be daisy-chained together (i.e., fluidly connected in series) via individual supply passages <b>48</b> such that one or more of accumulators <b>30</b> may receive pressurized fuel directly from fuel line <b>38</b>, and pass the fuel to its associated fuel injector <b>28</b> and to the remaining downstream accumulators <b>30</b>. Although an end accumulator <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as being the accumulator <b>30</b> connected directly to fuel line <b>38</b>, it is contemplated that another accumulator <b>30</b> may alternatively or additionally be connected directly to fuel line <b>38</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each accumulator <b>30</b> may include an inlet <b>50</b> and an outlet <b>52</b> oriented in general oppositional alignment with each other and orthogonally to the axial flow direction of accumulator <b>30</b>. The accumulator <b>30</b> located furthest upstream may have its inlet <b>50</b> fluidly connected to fuel line <b>38</b>, while the accumulator <b>30</b> located furthest downstream may have its outlet <b>52</b> plugged or otherwise capped off. The remaining accumulators <b>30</b> may have their inlets <b>50</b> fluidly connected to the outlets <b>52</b> of upstream accumulators <b>30</b> by way of supply passages <b>48</b>. It is contemplated that outlet <b>52</b> of the furthest downstream accumulator may alternatively be fluidly connected back to tank <b>24</b>, if desired, for example by way of a pressure relief valve (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, accumulator <b>30</b> may include an elongated body <b>54</b> having a first end <b>56</b> and an opposing second end <b>58</b>, and a cap <b>59</b> configured to engage and close off first end <b>56</b>. A single chamber <b>60</b> may extend in the axial flow direction of body <b>54</b>, between first and second ends <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. Chamber <b>60</b> may be generally open at first end <b>56</b>, and include an outlet <b>62</b> at second end <b>58</b>. Chamber <b>60</b> may have a cross-sectional diameter greater than a diameter of outlet <b>62</b>, and define a volume of about 15-50 times a maximum injection amount of injector <b>28</b> during a single cycle of engine <b>10</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Body <b>54</b> may have a generally cylindrical and stepped outer surface, with at least one external groove <b>64</b> configured to receive a sealing member <b>66</b>. Sealing member <b>66</b> may be configured to engage a bore of cylinder head <b>20</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) and create a fluid seal around accumulator <b>30</b>. A flange member <b>67</b> may extend from an outer surface of body <b>54</b> for engagement with front surface <b>46</b> of cylinder head <b>20</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In one embodiment, fasteners <b>69</b> (shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may extend through flange member <b>67</b> and into cylinder head <b>20</b> to secure accumulator <b>30</b> to cylinder head <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Cap <b>59</b> may at least partially define inlet <b>50</b> and outlet <b>52</b>, and include a generally hollow protrusion <b>68</b> orthogonal to inlet <b>50</b> and outlet <b>52</b> that is received by a recess <b>70</b> of body <b>54</b> to close off chamber <b>60</b> at first end <b>56</b>. Cap <b>59</b> may also include shoulders <b>72</b> that engage first end <b>56</b>, and one or more fasteners <b>74</b> that pass through cap <b>59</b> and into first end <b>56</b> of body <b>54</b> to secure cap <b>59</b> in place. A sealing member <b>76</b> may be received within an external groove <b>78</b> of protrusion <b>68</b> to create a fluid seal between cap <b>59</b> and body <b>54</b>. In this manner, cap <b>59</b> may fluidly communicate inlet <b>50</b> and outlet <b>52</b> with chamber <b>60</b> via hollow protrusion <b>68</b>. Chamber <b>60</b> may have a cross-sectional diameter greater than diameters of inlet <b>50</b> and outlet <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, an insert <b>79</b> may be positioned within hollow protrusion <b>68</b> and include internal passages <b>81</b> that fluidly interconnect inlet <b>50</b>, outlet <b>52</b>, and chamber <b>60</b>. Internal passages <b>81</b> may be arranged in a general T-shape, and have smaller diameters than that of chamber <b>60</b>. Insert <b>79</b> may be fabricated from a material or through a process different from those associated with cap <b>59</b>, if desired. For example, insert <b>79</b> may be fabricated from a material having a higher strength and/or through a process having a higher precision. By utilizing insert <b>79</b>, the cost and time associated with fabricating cap <b>59</b> may be relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each fuel injector <b>28</b> may be a closed nozzle-type unit injector having a nozzle member <b>80</b>. Nozzle member <b>80</b> may be a generally cylindrical body configured to receive a needle valve <b>82</b>. One or more orifices <b>84</b> may be located at a tip end of nozzle member <b>80</b> and selectively blocked and unblocked by needle valve <b>82</b> to allow injections of pressurized fuel into an associated combustion chamber <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some situations, it may be possible for a portion of nozzle member <b>80</b> to erode, crack, or completely break away. In order to inhibit unchecked fuel leakage from the damaged nozzle member <b>80</b> into combustion chamber <b>22</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a flow limiter <b>86</b> may be fluidly disposed between each accumulator <b>30</b> and each fuel injector <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, flow limiter <b>86</b> may be disposed at least partially within a recess <b>87</b> of body <b>54</b> that is located at second end <b>58</b> of accumulator <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A coupling <b>90</b> may connect a filter housing <b>88</b> to second end <b>58</b> of accumulator <b>30</b> to close off recess <b>87</b> and thereby retain flow limiter <b>86</b> in place. Filter housing <b>88</b> may include a central passage <b>89</b> that accommodates a filter <b>91</b>, for example an edge filter, that may be used to remove debris from the flow of fuel passing from accumulator <b>30</b> to injector <b>28</b>. Coupling <b>90</b> may include an internal flange <b>92</b> that engages shoulders <b>94</b> of filter housing <b>88</b>, and threads <b>96</b> that engage second end <b>58</b> of accumulator <b>30</b>. With this configuration, a rotation of coupling <b>90</b> may serve to draw an end face <b>100</b> of filter housing <b>88</b> against a biting edge <b>102</b> of accumulator <b>30</b> to create a fluid seal. A tip end <b>98</b> of filter housing <b>88</b> may directly engage fuel injector <b>28</b> at an inlet <b>104</b> such that fuel passing from accumulator <b>30</b> through flow limiter <b>86</b> may be directed to injector <b>28</b> via central passage <b>89</b>. As fasteners <b>69</b> are tightened into cylinder head <b>20</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), accumulator <b>30</b> may press tip end <b>98</b> of filter housing <b>88</b> against injector <b>28</b> to create a seal at inlet <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Flow limiter <b>86</b> may be configured to inhibit unchecked fuel flow to a leaking fuel injector <b>28</b> in response to a pressure differential between accumulator <b>30</b> and the leaking fuel injector <b>28</b>. That is, when the integrity of nozzle member <b>80</b> is compromised (e.g., when nozzle member <b>80</b> is cracked, eroded, broken, etc.), the fuel within the compromised fuel injector <b>28</b> may flow substantially unimpeded into the associated combustion chamber <b>22</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As a result of this decreased restriction to flow within the compromised fuel injector <b>28</b>, the pressure of the fuel within the compromised fuel injector <b>28</b> may quickly be reduced by a significant amount. The difference in pressure between accumulator <b>30</b> and the compromised fuel injector <b>28</b> may be much greater than the difference in pressure between accumulator <b>30</b> and a properly functioning fuel injector <b>28</b>. This increased pressure difference, as will be described in more detail below, may cause flow limiter <b>86</b> to actuate and inhibit fuel flow to the compromised fuel injector <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, flow limiter <b>86</b> may include multiple components that cooperate to selectively pass or block fuel flow in response to a pressure differential. Specifically, flow limiter <b>86</b> may include a first valve element <b>106</b> and a second valve element <b>108</b>. First valve element <b>106</b> may be a cuplike element having a face end <b>110</b> and an open end <b>112</b>. Cylindrical sidewalls <b>113</b> may extend from face end <b>110</b> to open end <b>112</b> and at least partially define an inner passage <b>114</b>. A restricted orifice <b>116</b> may pass through face end <b>110</b> at a center thereof to fluidly communicate inner passage <b>114</b> with outlet <b>62</b> of accumulator <b>30</b>. Face end <b>110</b> of first valve element <b>106</b> may include an external chamfer <b>118</b> configured to engage an internal chamfer <b>120</b> located at an upstream end of recess <b>87</b>. A spring <b>122</b>, located between open end <b>112</b> and an internal shoulders <b>124</b> of filter housing <b>88</b>, may bias first valve element <b>106</b> toward a closed position at which external chamfer <b>118</b> engages internal chamfer <b>120</b>. When first valve element <b>106</b> is in the closed position, fuel may only pass through restricted orifice <b>116</b>. When first valve element <b>106</b> is pushed by fuel pressure to compress spring <b>122</b>, fuel may pass both through restricted orifice <b>116</b> and between cylindrical sidewalls <b>113</b> of first valve element <b>106</b> and internal walls of recess <b>87</b> (i.e., when first valve element <b>106</b> is moved to an open position, fuel may flow substantially unrestricted through flow limiter <b>86</b> to injector <b>28</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Second valve element <b>108</b> may include a ball <b>126</b> received within a sleeve <b>128</b> of first valve element <b>106</b> and biased away from fuel injector <b>28</b> and toward accumulator <b>30</b> by a spring <b>130</b>. Ball <b>126</b>, sleeve <b>128</b>, and spring <b>130</b> may be received within spring <b>122</b> of first valve element <b>106</b>. Ball <b>126</b> may be configured to compress spring <b>122</b> during catastrophic failure of injector <b>28</b> (i.e., during a failure of injector <b>28</b> that results in a pressure gradient across flow limiter <b>86</b> greater than a threshold amount) and engage an inner conical seat <b>131</b> of filter housing <b>88</b>. When ball <b>126</b> engages seat <b>131</b>, little or no fuel may flow to injector <b>28</b>. Under normal conditions (i.e., when a tip end of nozzle member <b>80</b> has not been compromised), ball <b>126</b> may be held away from seat <b>131</b> by the force of spring <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The fuel system of the present disclosure has wide application in a variety of engine types including, for example, diesel engines, gasoline engines, and gaseous fuel-powered engines. The disclosed fuel system may be implemented into any engine that utilizes a high pressure fuel supply and closed orifice-type fuel injectors where fabrication time and cost are concerns, and flow limiting is desired. Operation of fuel system <b>12</b> will now be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, during operation of fuel system <b>12</b>, fuel pumping arrangement <b>26</b> may draw fuel from tank <b>24</b>, pressurize the fuel, and direct the pressurized fuel to the upstream-most accumulator <b>30</b>. The pressurized fuel may fill this accumulator <b>30</b> and continue to flow via supply passages <b>48</b> toward the most downstream accumulator <b>30</b>. Once the pressure of the fuel within each of accumulators <b>30</b> reaches a threshold pressure, for example about 200-400 MPa, fuel injectors <b>28</b> and engine <b>10</b> may become fully operational.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pressurized fuel within accumulators <b>30</b> may flow from chamber <b>60</b> past flow limiter <b>86</b> and through filter <b>91</b> to inlet passage <b>104</b> of injector <b>28</b>. Needle valve <b>82</b> may then be selectively moved away from orifices <b>84</b> at specific timings and for specific durations to inject desired amounts of the fuel into combustion chamber <b>22</b>. When needle valve <b>82</b> returns and seats against the tip end of nozzle member <b>80</b>, orifices <b>84</b> may be blocked and fuel injection may end.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The return of needle valve <b>82</b> against the tip end of nozzle member <b>80</b> may generate pressure oscillations within injector <b>28</b> and accumulator <b>30</b>. In particular, the flow of fuel from accumulator <b>30</b> to injector <b>28</b> during an injection event may have a corresponding momentum related to the flow rate and the flow volume. The sudden closing of the needle valve <b>82</b> at the end of the injection event may instantaneously block the fuel flow and cause the corresponding momentum to rebound in the opposite direction, resulting in a reverse pressure wave traveling from injector <b>28</b> back through accumulator <b>30</b>. If unaccounted for, this pressure wave could travel to adjacent accumulators <b>30</b> and interfere with subsequent injection events (i.e., the reverse traveling pressure wave could cause needle valve <b>82</b> of the same or other injectors <b>28</b> to dither and open early, close early, or open additional times).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Flow limiter <b>86</b> may help to dampen pressure oscillations within fuel system <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as the pressure wave described above travels from injector <b>28</b> back toward accumulator <b>30</b>, it may first enter recess <b>87</b> of flow limiter <b>86</b>. This pressure wave, together with the bias of spring <b>122</b>, may urge first valve element <b>106</b> toward accumulator <b>30</b>, until external chamfer <b>118</b> engages internal chamfer <b>120</b> and flow around a periphery of first valve element <b>106</b> is substantially blocked. At this point in time, the only fluid communication between flow limiter <b>86</b> and accumulator <b>30</b> may be through passage <b>114</b> and restricted orifice <b>116</b>. As the pressure wave passes through restricted orifice <b>116</b> to accumulator <b>30</b>, a magnitude of the pressure wave may be reduced by the associated restriction. After the pressure wave has passed through flow limiter <b>86</b>, the pressure differential between accumulator <b>30</b> and injector <b>28</b> may overcome the bias of spring <b>122</b> and return first valve element <b>106</b> to the open position, at which fuel from accumulator <b>30</b> may pass both through and around first valve element <b>106</b> substantially unrestricted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Flow limiter <b>86</b> may also inhibit fuel supply to injector <b>28</b> during catastrophic failure of injector <b>28</b>. In particular, as the pressure differential between accumulator <b>30</b> and injector <b>28</b> reaches a threshold limit indicative of an injector failure condition, the pressure differential may move ball <b>126</b> against the bias of spring <b>130</b> to engage seat <b>131</b>. In this position, little or no fuel may pass through flow limiter <b>86</b> to injector <b>28</b>. Once the injector failure condition has been remedied, or the pressure differential across flow limiter <b>86</b> has otherwise been reduced (such as at engine shutdown), spring <b>130</b> may move ball <b>126</b> away from seat <b>131</b> to restore the flow of fuel to injector <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Numerous advantages of the disclosed fuel system may be realized. For example, because the disclosed fuel system utilizes simple distributed accumulators that are relatively easy to fabricate compared to traditional common rail construction, the overall cost of the fuel system may be low. In addition, the use and location of flow limiters may help to dampen pressure oscillations within the fuel system that could disrupt normal injection events, as well as inhibit fuel leakage during a failure condition of a downstream component.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the fuel system of the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the fuel system disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
