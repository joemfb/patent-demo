<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An arrangement and method in a communication system such as an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) radio receiver for reducing the impact of interference from an intermittent interfering signal transmitted by an interfering system which may be co-located with the OFDM system or may be remotely located. Each OFDM symbol in a received OFDM signal includes a guard interval (GI), a middle portion, and a last portion identical to the GI. The arrangement determines which portion of each OFDM symbol is contemporaneous with the interfering signal and time-shifts a fast Fourier transform (FFT) window in the OFDM receiver to minimize or eliminate FFT processing of samples of the OFDM symbol that are contemporaneous with the interfering signal, thereby minimizing the impact of the interfering signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to communication systems. More particularly, and not by way of limitation, the invention is directed to a system and method for correlating different communication sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Correlation is a mathematical term for a statistical measurement on the degree of dependency of two variables. In mathematics, a correlation coefficient is used to indicate the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two random variables. In communication systems, it is desirable to know whether two or more sessions used to set up media streams are correlated in some sense (for example, in the sense that they are used in the same context). Such sessions may be set up and operated under the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) or other suitable communication protocol. On the terminal side, such a correlation could mean, for example, displaying text from a chat session and video from another session in the same terminal window. On the network side, it could mean, for example, applying some special charging scheme to a multi-service session comprised of two or more individual sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to provide these and similar services, it must be determined and communicated how sessions relate to each other. However, there is no inherent mechanism in today's networks that provides the capability to indicate correlation between SIP sessions. Rather, higher level applications utilizing multiple SIP sessions must correlate the sessions at the application level using information available to each particular application. Due to the lack of inherent correlation mechanisms, however, the application level correlations may lead to false correlation assumptions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed in the art is a system and method for correlating different communication sessions which overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art. The present invention provides such a system and method.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a system and method for correlating communication sessions. The invention creates and exchanges between the parties, a globally unique correlation identifier (C-ID) during SIP session setup to allow for association and correlation of SIP sessions. The correlation information may then be used by network and session entities to perform different services.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of correlating different communication sessions. The method includes creating a globally unique correlation identifier during establishment of a first communication session between a first entity and a second entity; storing the correlation identifier by the first and second entities; and utilizing the correlation identifier to correlate with the first session, a subsequent session established between the first and second entities.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a system for correlating different communication sessions. The system includes means for creating a globally unique correlation identifier during establishment of a first communication session between a first entity and a second entity; means for storing the correlation identifier by the first and second entities; and means for utilizing the correlation identifier to correlate with the first session, a subsequent session established between the first and second entities.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention provides a system and method for correlating communication sessions. The invention creates and exchanges between the parties, a globally unique correlation identifier during SIP session setup to allow for association and correlation of SIP sessions. The correlation information may then be used by network and session entities to perform different services. It should be noted that sessions may be conducted between fixed terminals, mobile terminals, user agents, network nodes, and the like. The term &#x201c;entities&#x201d; is used herein to encompass all terminals, agents, nodes, and the like that may be parties to sessions. This invention is also described in S. Loreto et al., &#x201c;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Dialog Correlation&#x201d;, IETF SIPPING Working Group Internet Draft, Jun. 25, 2006, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This draft is available online at http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sipping/draft-loreto-sipping-dialog-correlation-01.txt.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention communicates a correlation identifier (ID) in a new header with the label &#x201c;Same-Session&#x201d; added to the SIP INVITE and REFER messages. In one embodiment, the correlation ID may be communicated between two user agents (UAs) in a simple point-to-point (P2P) scenario in which both UAs have all the information required to uniquely identify the dialog (Call-ID, From-Tag, and To-Tag) with one correlation ID. In other embodiments addressing the use of intermediaries (for example a business-to-business (B2B) UA, group communications, and use of multiple correlation IDs, the correlation ID may be sent to multiple entities.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the preferred embodiment, the invention creates and exchanges a globally unique correlation ID during IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) session establishment. The exchange of the globally unique correlation ID provides the ability to associate and correlate independent IMS sessions (for example, SIP sessions). The correlation IDs may be transported in a SIP header field.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The preferred embodiment for the correlation ID is a value comprising a number of attributes derived from the SIP session. In the P2P case, the correlation ID preferably includes three parameters: Call-ID, To-Tag, and From-Tag. Although the Call-ID and From-Tag make the correlation ID globally unique on their own, the To-Tag is needed to address the scenario of forking proxies in the path of signaling. Thus, the P2P correlation ID may take the form:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">Same-Session: Call-Id;From-Tag;To-Tag</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">For example, the P2P correlation ID may appear as:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0022">Same-Session: 3s09cs03;ty20s;d92119.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">In the P2P case, the Call-ID and From-Tag are derived from the INVITE request, and the To-Tag is derived from the 200 OK response to the request. For example in a session setup request, the Call-ID, From-Tag, and To-Tag may appear as:</p>

In order to correlate the new session to the existing one, UE-B uses the dialogue ID (i.e., session identifier) of the ongoing chat session as a key to perform a search in the correlation table and fetch the correlation ID for use in the correlation procedure. UE-B places the correlation ID in a Same-Session header of the INVITE message <b>16</b> and sends it to UE-A <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Upon receiving the INVITE message <b>16</b> with the Same-Session header containing a complete correlation ID (i.e., with all three parameters), UE-A <b>11</b> interprets this as a session that should be correlated with an existing session. UE-A then accesses its correlation table to find a match for the correlation ID received. If a match is found, it means that UE-A is already part of an ongoing session to which the correlation ID points. The new, now correlated session, is inserted as a new entry in the table. If a match is not found, UE-A may add the correlation ID to the table, thereby acknowledging the correlation to an existing session in which it (UE-A) is not involved. UE-A accepts in a 200 OK message <b>17</b>, and the P2P voice session is established and correlated with the P2P chat session at step <b>18</b>. Alternatively, UE-A may reject the request.</p>

UE-A retrieves from its correlation table, the correlation ID to be used for the VoIP session. UE-A adds the correlation ID to the Same-Session header of the INVITE message <b>7</b>. Later, UE-A again includes the correlation ID in the Same-Session header of the REFER message <b>9</b> sent to UE-B. UE-B copies the Same-Session header from the REFER message into the INVITE message <b>10</b>, which is returned, signifying UE-B's acceptance.

The correlation approach described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D is based on the principle of correlation groups identified through a single correlation ID.

<p id="p-0056" num="0063">The procedure for the establishment of the first session and creation/communication of the correlation ID is identical to the basic correlation approach. Subsequently, during establishment of a second session to be correlated with the first session, a new correlation ID is created in accordance with the procedures previously described.

<p id="p-0064" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustrative drawing illustrating a correlation structure between four sessions <b>36</b>-<b>39</b> at a high level of abstraction. At this level of abstraction, x, y, z, and w represent different correlation IDs. The chat session <b>36</b> is correlated with the VoIP session <b>38</b> and with the data session <b>39</b> using the &#x201c;x&#x201d; correlation ID. The Video session <b>37</b> is correlated with the VoIP session <b>38</b> using the &#x201c;y&#x201d; correlation ID. However, the Video session <b>33</b> and the chat session <b>36</b> are not correlated because they do not share a common correlation ID.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">The present invention also includes a method of modifying the correlation ID of an already established session. A further extension to the basic case is to provide the ability to modify the correlation ID of an already established and correlated session. The goal is to modify the correlation table content accordingly. This requires transport of the new correlation ID to the correlation parties along with an instruction to change the previous correlation ID in each party's correlation table. In the context of SIP/IMS, this result may be achieved by sending a re-INVITE for an ongoing session, or by sending another SIP message (for example, MESSAGE, INFO, and the like) within or outside of the ongoing session.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">Transporting the information in a SIP MESSAGE method requires the formulation of a request to change the correlation-ID. The request is transported as content by the SIP MESSAGE either within the body of the message or in an additional header (for example, the Same-Session header). The following example illustrates such signaling:</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0076">The present invention thus provides a system and method for correlating independent IMS sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">It should be noted that the present invention correlates two or more sessions between two or more entities. There may be multiple entities in one correlation &#x201c;group&#x201d; and each entity may further be residing in separate correlation groups with separate correlation IDs. For example, two P2P sessions may be established, a first session between entity A and entity B, and a second session between entity A and entity C. Both sessions may utilize the same correlation ID. In this case, the correlation allows entity A to perform intelligent actions with this information. Entity C and entity B are not aware of the other session. Further, entity B and entity C may be part of other correlations with other sessions. For example, entity B may conduct another session with entity C or with entity D utilizing a different correlation ID.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0078">Correlation IDs may also be utilized to form subgroups between different entities. In the basic case, a single correlation ID is shared by all sessions in the correlation group. In an advanced case, a new correlation ID is created for every new session and the correlation IDs are concatenated to signify a correlation group. For example, entity A may start a session with entity B utilizing correlation ID (X). Entity C then connects to entity B and creates a new correlation ID (Y). By concatenating X and Y (X,Y) a correlation ID is formed which signifies a correlation group including both the A-B session and the B-C session. If a fourth party wishes to establish a session, it can choose to correlate with either (X) or (Y) or (X,Y). It may also set up a totally new correlation ID (Z).</p>

The specification contemplates any all modifications that fall within the scope of the invention defined by the following claims.</p>
