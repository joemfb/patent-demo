<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present exemplary embodiments relate to raster output scanner (ROS) apparatus and to techniques for beam mapping to adjust ROS operation to address wiper and jitter errors. Wiper errors are found in printers and other systems employing scanning of laser beams or other light beams for image rendering. This error is typically caused by manufacturing and mounting tolerances of the ROS in a printing system, where the output beams do not maintain a single column alignment at all locations in the fast scan (cross-process) direction, and instead tend to &#x201c;rotate&#x201d; with fast scan position, similar to the operation of automobile windshield wipers. This problem has conventionally been addressed by aligning the beams (column alignment) at a center of scan (COS) position in the fast scan range so that the wiper effect is seen in approximately equal amounts (in opposite directions) at the extreme ends of the scan range (start of scan (SOS) and end of scan (EOS)). In this manner, the wiper error amount is effectively distributed along the ROS fast scan range, with the range center having the best column alignment. Jitter error is also found in optical scanning systems, appearing as pixel misregistration in scan lines formed in the fast scan direction. Jitter can be cause by rotational or velocity variations in the ROS polygon scanner, as well as optical component misalignment, scan direction failures and pixel clock circuit failures. Jitter can be corrected by a variety of techniques, such as adjusting the power level and focus of the scanning beam. As quality requirements become stricter for printers and other systems employing multiple beam raster scanning, improved ROS manufacturing techniques are important to address wiper and jitter errors without adding to product cost.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to ROS apparatus, printing systems, and manufacturing adjustment techniques in which beam delay values are determined by beam mapping for an array of light sources based on both wiper error and jitter error. Column alignment is achieved at a location other than the COS so as to combat combined jitter/wiper effects, where the alignment location in certain embodiments is between the COS and EOS or at the EOS location. The inventors have appreciated that the wiper effect can significantly amplify the effect of fast scan jitter variations, particularly at the EOS, and that column alignment at the EOS or between the COS and EOS can advantageously reduce the cumulative error of these effects. This may be employed in association with printing systems and other systems in which multiple optical beams are scanned along a fast scan direction toward a light-receiving medium for image generation or rendering.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Document processing systems and raster output scanners thereof are provided in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. The ROS includes a plurality of light sources, such as a laser emitter array comprising a plurality of lasers in certain embodiments, which generate a plurality of light outputs. The ROS includes a driver that stores a plurality of beam delay values corresponding to the light sources, where the beam delay values are set such that column alignment is achieved at an alignment location spaced from a COS location toward an EOS location along a fast scan range of operation of the ROS. In operation, the driver selectively actuates the light sources according to the corresponding beam delay values based on a stream of image data to produce a plurality of modulated light outputs. The ROS also includes a scanner that directs the modulated light outputs toward a light-receiving medium, such as a photoreceptor in certain embodiments, along the fast scan direction to generate an image on at least a portion of the light-receiving medium. In certain embodiments, the ROS beam delay values are set to compensate for a combined effect of wiper error and jitter error.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further aspects of the disclosure involve a method for manufacturing or adjusting a document processing system with a multi-beam ROS. The method includes determining a wiper error and a jitter error associated with the ROS, as well as determining beam delay values corresponding to individual light sources of the ROS at least partially according to the wiper error and the jitter error, and the beam delay values are stored in a memory of the ROS. In certain embodiments, the beam delay values are determined so as to compensate for a combined effect of the wiper error and the jitter error. In certain embodiments, the combined effect of the wiper error and the jitter error is determined by multiplying the wiper error and the jitter error to generate a combined error curve or function along the fast scan range of operation of the ROS. In other embodiments, the combined effect is determined by adding the wiper error and the jitter error to generate the combined error curve or function. In certain embodiments, the delay values are determined such that an area of the combined error curve or function is minimized along the fast scan range of operation of the ROS. In some embodiments, the delay values are determined such that column alignment is achieved at an alignment location spaced from a COS location toward an end of scan location along a fast scan range of operation of the ROS, and the alignment location in some implementations is at or near the EOS.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Several embodiments or implementations of the different aspects of the present disclosure are hereinafter described in conjunction with the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout, and wherein the various features, structures, and graphical renderings are not necessarily drawn to scale. The disclosure relates to ROS operation and adjustment in which both jitter (optical and/or electrical) and wiper effects are compensated in a coordinated fashion through beam mapping to set ROS driver beam delay values for multiple beams.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, these concepts are illustrated and described hereinafter in the context of exemplary document processing systems with marking devices for marking images onto intermediate (e.g., photoreceptor) or final printable media using raster output scanning with associated scanners and optics. However, the techniques and ROS systems of the present disclosure may be implemented in other forms of image generating or rendering systems, such as ink-based or other direct-marking printers, etc., by adjusting beam delays to minimize or mitigate artifact banding, including without limitation laser or other type light shows, stereo lithography, or direct plate, laser cutters for paper or other articles, imaging systems with multiple scanned beams going through a shared optical system concurrently, or other multiple rasterized writing in which two or more beams are provided or transmitted through a shared optical channel onto a medium.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>10</b> for manufacturing or adjusting a ROS in an imaging system, such as a printing system, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> show a document processing system <b>100</b> and ROS <b>200</b> thereof in which stored beam delay values are set for compensation of combined wiper and jitter effects in accordance with one or more aspects of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary tandem multi-color document processing system <b>100</b> with a system controller <b>122</b> and marking devices <b>102</b> thereof including ROSs that may be initially setup or thereafter adjusted in accordance with the method <b>10</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes a plurality of xerographic marking devices or print engines <b>102</b> individually operative to transfer toner marking material onto an intermediate substrate <b>104</b> that may or may not be a photoreceptor, in this case, a shared intermediate transfer belt <b>104</b> traveling in a counter clockwise direction in the figure past the xerographic marking devices <b>102</b>. In certain embodiments, the marking devices <b>102</b> individually include a cylindrical drum photoreceptor <b>204</b> employed as an intermediate transfer substrate, and in other embodiments, the marking devices <b>102</b> may directly transfer marking material to a final printable media <b>108</b>. Other embodiments are possible when these techniques are applied to Image On Image (IOI) systems. The illustrated printing system <b>100</b> includes a transfer component <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) disposed downstream of the marking devices <b>102</b> along a lower portion of the IBT path to transfer marking material from the IBT <b>104</b> to an upper side of a final print medium <b>108</b> (e.g., precut paper sheets in one embodiment) traveling along a path P<b>1</b> from a media supply. After the transfer of toner to the print medium <b>108</b> at the transfer station <b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the final print medium <b>108</b> is provided to a fuser type affixing apparatus <b>110</b> on the path P<b>1</b> where the transferred marking material is fused to the print medium <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The system controller <b>122</b> performs various control functions and may implement digital front end (DFE) functionality for the system <b>100</b>, where the controller <b>122</b> may be any suitable form of hardware, processor-executed software and/or firmware, programmable logic, or combinations thereof, whether unitary or implemented in distributed fashion in a plurality of components, wherein all such implementations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. In a normal printing mode, the controller <b>122</b> receives incoming print jobs <b>118</b> and operates one or more of the marking devices <b>102</b> to transfer marking material onto the intermediate medium <b>104</b> in accordance with the print job <b>118</b>. In operation of the marking devices <b>102</b>, marking material (e.g., toner <b>151</b> for the first device <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is supplied to an internal drum photoreceptor <b>204</b> (schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) via a ROS <b>200</b> of the marking device <b>102</b>. A surface of the intermediate medium <b>104</b> is adjacent to and/or in contact with the drum photoreceptor <b>204</b> and the toner <b>151</b> is transferred to the ITB <b>104</b> with the assistance of the biased transfer roller (not shown) to attract oppositely charged toner <b>151</b> from the drum <b>204</b> onto the ITB surface as the ITB <b>104</b> passes through a nip between the drum <b>204</b> and the charged transfer roller. The toner <b>151</b> ideally remains on the surface of the ITB <b>104</b> after it passes through the nip for subsequent transfer and fusing to the final print media <b>108</b> via the transfer device <b>106</b> and fuser <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each of the xerographic marking devices <b>102</b> is operable under control of the controller <b>122</b> to transfer toner <b>151</b>-<b>154</b> of a corresponding color (e.g., cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), black (K)) to the transfer belt <b>104</b>, where the first device <b>102</b> encountered by the ITB <b>104</b> in one example provides yellow toner <b>151</b>, the next device provides magenta toner <b>152</b>, the next provides cyan toner <b>153</b>, and the last device <b>102</b> provides black toner <b>154</b>, although other organizations and configurations are possible in which two or more marking devices <b>102</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In normal operation, print jobs <b>118</b> are received at the controller <b>122</b> via an internal source such as a scanner (not shown) and/or from an external source, such as one or more computers connected to the system <b>100</b> via one or more networks, or from wireless sources. The print job execution may include printing selected text, line graphics, images, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) notation, etc., on the front and/or back sides or pages of one or more sheets of paper or other printable media <b>108</b>. In this regard, some sheets may be left completely blank in accordance with a particular print job <b>118</b>, and some sheets may have mixed color and black-and-white printing. Execution of the print job <b>118</b>, moreover, may include collating the finished sheets in a certain order, along with specified folding, stapling, punching holes into, or otherwise physically manipulating or binding the sheets. The system <b>100</b> can include one or more sensors <b>160</b> internal to the marking stations <b>102</b> and/or external thereto, for instance, to measure one or more marking material transfer characteristics relative to the intermediate transfer belt <b>104</b> or other photoreceptor or with respect to a final printed medium <b>108</b>, and corresponding feedback signals or values are provided to the controller <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the exemplary xerographic stations <b>102</b> each include a multi-beam ROS <b>200</b> which generate latent images along a circuitous length of a drum type photoreceptor <b>204</b> (shown in partial section view with the process direction into the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) using a plurality of beams <b>222</b>. A ROS controller <b>202</b> provides one or more control signals to a driver <b>212</b> and a ROS clock <b>201</b>, where a data stream is provided from the controller <b>202</b> to the driver <b>212</b> associated with 32 laser-type light sources <b>214</b>, for instance, arranged as a laser emitter array of eight groups of four lasers in one embodiment. The controller also operates the clock <b>201</b>, which in turn provides a clock output to the driver <b>212</b> and to a motor polygon assembly (MPA) that includes a polygon motor speed control <b>228</b><i>a </i>and a rotating polygon <b>228</b> with a plurality of reflective (e.g., mirrored) outer surfaces or facets <b>226</b> (eight in one example).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, a stream of image data is provided to the driver <b>212</b> associated with a single color portion of a panel image in the printer of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the driver <b>212</b> modulates the lasers <b>214</b> to produce a plurality of modulated light outputs or beams <b>222</b> in conformance with the input image data. The laser beam light output <b>222</b> passes into conditioning optics <b>224</b> and then illuminates a facet <b>226</b> of the rotating polygon <b>228</b>. The light beams <b>222</b> are reflected from the polygon facet <b>226</b> through a lens <b>230</b> to form corresponding spots on the photosensitive image plane of the passing photoreceptor <b>204</b> drum. Rotation of the facet <b>226</b> causes the spots to sweep across the image plane in order to form a succession of scan lines oriented in a &#x201c;fast scan&#x201d; direction (e.g., generally perpendicular to a &#x201c;slow scan&#x201d; or process direction along which the photoreceptor <b>204</b> travels), where modulation of the light outputs <b>222</b> by the driver selectively creates spots or pixels in given locations along the fast scan direction. In the multi-beam arrangement of the ROS <b>200</b>, 32 such scan lines are created concurrently with the image data provided to the individual lasers <b>214</b> being interleaved accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Movement of the photoreceptor <b>204</b> in the slow scan direction is such that successive rotating facets <b>226</b> of the polygon <b>228</b> form successive sets of 32 scan lines that are offset from each other in the slow scan direction. In this regard, each facet <b>226</b> may scan <b>32</b> scan lines, but the photoreceptor <b>104</b> may move such that the top 16 scan lines from the next facet <b>226</b> can overlap the bottom <b>16</b> scan lines from the previous facet <b>226</b>, causing so-called overwriting issues. Other problems in such systems can include scan line interlacing. Thus, although sets of 32 scan lines are ideally offset from one another, the offset may in certain system not be complete, and the inventors have appreciated that wiper-induced jitter amplification can differ based on the presence or absence of overwrite.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Within each set of 32 scan lines, moreover, the laser emitter array <b>214</b> provides mechanical spacing of the individual light outputs <b>222</b> such that the spacing of adjacent scan lines is ideally uniform. Each such scan line in this example consists of a row of pixels produced by the modulation of the laser beams <b>222</b> as the laser spots scan across an image plane, where individual spots are either illuminated or not at various points as the beams scan across the scan lines so as to selectively illuminate or refrain from illuminating individual locations on the photoreceptor <b>204</b> according to the input image data. In this way a latent image is created by selectively discharging the areas of the photoreceptor <b>204</b> which are to receive a toner image. Exposed (drawn) portions of the image to be printed move on to a toner deposition station (not shown) where toner adheres to the drawn/discharged portions of the image. The exposed portions of the image with adherent toner then pass to a transfer station with a biased transfer roller (BTR, not shown) for transfer of the toner image to the intermediate transfer belt (ITB <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> above).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, moreover, the driver <b>212</b> includes a memory storing a plurality of delay values <b>213</b> corresponding to individual ones of the 32 light sources <b>214</b>. In operation, the generation of individual ones of the scan lines is selectively delayed by the driver <b>212</b> according to the corresponding beam delay value <b>213</b>, with the individual beam modulation being carried out according to the input image data. The MPA scanner <b>228</b> then directs the modulated light outputs <b>222</b> toward the photoreceptor medium <b>204</b> along the fast scan direction to generate an image on at least a portion of the medium <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring also to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>12</b>, in accordance with the present disclosure, the beam delay values <b>213</b> are set or adjusted based at least partially on a wiper error <b>502</b> and a jitter error <b>802</b> associated with the ROS in the printing system <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a manufacturing or adjustment process <b>10</b> that may be carried out in association with the exemplary ROS <b>200</b> as installed in an imaging system, such as the printer <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or in other imaging systems using multi-beam ROS devices. While the method <b>10</b> is illustrated and described in the form of a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated that the various methods of the disclosure are not limited by the illustrated ordering of such acts or events except as specifically set forth herein. In this regard, except as specifically provided hereinafter, some acts or events may occur in different order and/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illustrated and described herein, and not all illustrated steps may be required to implement a process or method in accordance with the present disclosure. Certain embodiments of the illustrated method <b>10</b> and other methods of the disclosure may be implemented in hardware, processor-executed software, programmable logic, etc., or combinations thereof, whether in a single device management component or system or in distributed form in two or more components or systems, and may be employed in association with any form of multi-beam ROS or imaging system, wherein the disclosure is not limited to the specific devices, systems, applications, and implementations illustrated and described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a ROS <b>200</b> is operatively coupled with or otherwise installed in a printing system <b>100</b> (e.g., in one of the marking devices <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). At <b>14</b>, the document processing system <b>100</b> is operated using the installed ROS <b>200</b> to determine a wiper error curve or function <b>502</b> associated with the ROS <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides a graph <b>500</b> illustrating a wiper error curve or function <b>502</b> along the ROS fast scan range that extends from a start of scan location (SOS) to an end of scan location (EOS), with a central COS location midway between the SOS and EOS locations. As seen in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wiper error may be quantified as a curve <b>502</b> and/or as a formula (e.g., parametric characterization represented as parameters of an equation, etc.) as a function of some error metric associated with image creation, rendering, etc. For instance, the Y axis in the graph <b>500</b> may represent errors in perceived (e.g., sensed) darkness or brightness (e.g., dL* in an L*a*b* color space) based on feedback from a system sensor <b>160</b> during operation of the system <b>100</b> to create one or more test images (e.g., columns) and comparison thereof with a known desired brightness value from the input data to identify, ascertain, or derive a curve of formula <b>502</b> indicative of brightness error related to the wiper effect in a raster scanning apparatus <b>200</b>. A graph <b>520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a photoreceptor column output image with corresponding wiper error, with exemplary SOS, COS, and EOS columns <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, and <b>526</b>, each of which is tilted in the same direction. In this example, the largest tilt is at the SOS location, with the smallest tilt at the EOS, and the tilt angle at the COS location is between the angles of the COS and EOS columns.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a graph <b>600</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an a conventional compensated wiper error function or curve <b>602</b> in which beam mapping adjustment provides beam delays so that column alignment is provided at the COS position <b>610</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a photoreceptor column output image <b>700</b> on a photoreceptor <b>204</b> including column images <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> and <b>706</b> at the SOS, COS and EOS positions, respectively, corresponding to the compensated wiper error function <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the column image <b>704</b> is aligned at the COS location. In contrast, the SOS and EOS columns <b>702</b> and <b>706</b> are out of alignment, being at angles &#x3b1;<b>1</b> and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> with respect to the process direction, respectively. In this example, the SOS and EOS offset angles &#x3b1;<b>1</b> and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> are approximately equal. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, moreover, this conventional compensation via beam mapping effectively spreads the wiper error effect approximately equally at the SOS and EOS ends of the ROS fast scan range, where the dL* errors <b>604</b> and <b>606</b> are approximately equal. It is noted that while this conventional wiper compensation technique may effectively minimize the wiper error effect, this does not take into account jitter effects in the ROS.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, the inventors have appreciated additive or multiplicative interaction between jitter effects and wiper effects, which are believed to be particularly pronounced at or near the EOS location of the ROS fast scan range. Thus, while conventional wiper error compensation such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> is in some sense optimized to ideally zero out the wiper error, this compensation leaves the ROS vulnerable to banding or other potentially perceptible image artifacts due to the combined jitter and wiper effects.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The process <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also provides for determining a jitter error at <b>16</b>, and a combined wiper/jitter error curve or function is determined at <b>18</b>. In certain embodiments, the document processing system <b>100</b> is operated after ROS installation to determine a jitter error as a function of fast scan position, where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a graph <b>800</b> showing an exemplary jitter error curve or function <b>802</b> in the ROS <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. At <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the combined effect of the wiper error <b>502</b> and the jitter error <b>802</b> is determined, where graph <b>900</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an exemplary combined wiper/jitter error curve or function <b>902</b> determined according to the wiper error <b>502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the jitter error <b>802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Any suitable technique can be employed for deriving the combined error function or curve <b>902</b>. In certain embodiments, this is done at <b>18</b> by multiplying the wiper error <b>502</b> and the jitter error <b>802</b> to generate the combined error curve or function <b>902</b> along the fast scan range of operation of the ROS <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, the combined error function or curve <b>902</b> is determined at <b>18</b> by adding the wiper error <b>502</b> and the jitter error <b>802</b>. In either of these implementations, the multiplication or summation can include weighting factors for one or both of the wiper error <b>502</b> and the jitter error <b>802</b>. Moreover, while the exemplary implementations of the error curves or functions <b>502</b>, <b>802</b>, <b>902</b> are shown in brightness error units (e.g., dL*), other error metrics may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present disclosure provides for determining the ROS driver beam delay values <b>213</b> at <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in whole or in part according to the wiper error <b>502</b> and the jitter error <b>802</b>. The process <b>10</b> further includes storing the beam delay values <b>213</b> at <b>22</b> in a memory of the ROS <b>200</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) for use in image scanning. As seen in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the jitter error curve or function <b>802</b> (also shown in terms of brightness error metric dL* in this example) is small at the start of scan and increases toward the EOS location. While not wishing to be tied to any particular theory, it is believed that the cumulative effects of the wiper and jitter errors <b>502</b> and <b>802</b> exacerbate the ROS imaging near the EOS location, and consequently, the conventional technique of delay adjustment solely for wiper error (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) actually creates problems, contrary to the conventional wisdom.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the wiper compensation in certain embodiments is done at <b>20</b> by beam mapping to set the delay values <b>213</b> such that column alignment is achieved at an alignment location <b>1010</b> at the EOS or between the COS and EOS, unlike the conventional wiper compensation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) which instead set the alignment at the COS. The inventors have appreciated that control over the alignment location <b>1010</b> used in the beam mapping can advantageously reduce the cumulative error of the wiper and jitter errors <b>502</b> and <b>802</b>. In certain embodiments, the delay values <b>213</b> are determined at <b>20</b> by beam mapping to compensate for the combined effect <b>902</b> of the wiper error <b>502</b> and the jitter error <b>802</b>. The delay values <b>213</b> may be determined in certain implementations so as to minimize an area of the combined error curve or function <b>902</b> along the fast scan range of operation of the ROS <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As seen in the graph <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a compensated wiper error curve <b>1002</b> results from the delay value selection at <b>20</b>, in which the alignment location <b>1010</b> is spaced from the COS location toward the EOS (in certain embodiments, the alignment location <b>1010</b> may be at or near the EOS). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a photoreceptor column output image <b>900</b> on the photoreceptor <b>204</b> including column images <b>1102</b> and <b>1106</b> at the SOS and EOS positions, respectively, as well as an aligned column image <b>1104</b> at the alignment location <b>1010</b>, which is spaced from the center position COS. In this example, the SOS and EOS columns <b>1102</b> and <b>1106</b> exhibit the wiper effect (offset angles &#x3b2;<b>1</b> and &#x3b2;<b>2</b> relative to the process direction). In this example, the offset angles &#x3b2;<b>3</b> are different at the SOS and EOS locations, and the resulting wiper error amounts <b>1004</b> and <b>1006</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are different, although not a requirement of the present disclosure. As previously noted, this asymmetrical wiper error is contrary to the conventional wiper adjustment approach, in which it was believed that minimizing the area under the wiper error curve through beam mapping was the optimal compensation.</p>
