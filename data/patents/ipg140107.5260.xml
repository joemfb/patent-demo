<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Aircraft have historically been equipped with a collection of mechanical or electro-mechanical flight instrument gauges that provide a pilot with information about the aircraft's position, orientation, speed, and performance. The gauges commonly provide quite limited breadth of functionality&#x2014;typically only a single function. For example, the instrument panel of an aircraft employing such gauges might include an attitude indicator that shows the aircraft's orientation relative to the horizon, an altimeter that gives information about the aircraft's height above some reference level (e.g. sea-level) by measuring the local air pressure, an airspeed indicator that shows the aircraft's speed relative to the surrounding air, a heading indicator or magnetic compass that displays the direction the aircraft is pointing relative to north, or a turn and bank indicator that displays the direction of turn and rate of turn of the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated avionics systems replace mechanical and electro-mechanical instrument gauges with one or more electronic displays for displaying (e.g., presenting) primary flight information such as attitude, altitude, heading, vertical speed, and so forth, to the pilot. Integrated avionics systems may include one or more primary flight displays (PFD) and one or more multifunction displays (MFD). A representative PFD displays primary flight and selected navigation information that is typically received from one or more sensor systems such as an attitude heading reference system (AHRS), an inertial navigation system (INS), one or more air data computers (ADC) and/or navigation sensors. A representative MFD displays information for navigation and for broad situational awareness such as navigation routes, flight plans, information about aids to navigation (including airports), moving maps, weather information, terrain and obstacle information, traffic information, engine and other aircraft systems information, and so forth.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An integrated avionics system is described that includes components that provide multi-product functionality. In implementations, the integrated avionics system includes one or more avionics control and display units (CDU). At least one of the CDUs may include a display unit having a touch screen configured to receive touch input. The CDU is configured to have a first mode of operation or a second mode of operation. When the first mode of operation is selected, the display unit is configured to display control indicia to facilitate the control of one or more functions associated with the avionics system. When the second mode of operation is selected, the CDU display unit is configured to enable a cursor control area to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device such as a primary flight display (PFD), a multifunction display (MFD), and so forth, via touch input to the touch screen over the cursor control area.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Integrated avionics systems typically employ primary flight display(s) (PFDs) and multifunction display(s) (MFDs) to provide primary flight control, navigational, and other information to the flight crew (e.g., the pilot and/or the co-pilot) of an aircraft. In many instances, a member of the flight crew may wish to interface with one or more aspects of the information conveyed through the display devices to manipulate the information. For example, a pilot may wish to manipulate (e.g., pan, enlarge, or reduce) a map display, or select waypoints on the map display. In large commercial aircraft, the flight crew may interface with displayed information via manipulation of a cursor displayed over (e.g., presented within) the information using a dedicated cursor control device such as a dedicated touch pad, trackball, joystick, or the like. However, in smaller aircraft such as general aviation aircraft and light commercial aircraft, the aircraft's instrument panel may lack sufficient space for dedicated cursor control devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, an avionics control and display unit (CDU) is described that can be introduced into an integrated avionics system of an aircraft to, amongst other functionality, provide a cursor control mode of operation. In this manner, the CDU may be used as a cursor control device for other display devices within the integrated avionics system. During the cursor control mode of operation, the CDU may be configured to enable a cursor control area to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device such as a primary flight display (PFD), a multifunction display (MFD), and so forth, via touch input. In some embodiments, the PFD and/or MFD may include touch screens to receive touch inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In implementations, an integrated avionics system may be provided with one or more avionics control and display units (CDU). Each CDU includes a display unit having a touch screen configured to receive touch input. The CDU further includes a memory operable to store one or more modules and a processor coupled to the display unit and the memory. The CDU processor is configured to execute the one or more modules to select one of a first (e.g., &#x201c;standard&#x201d;) mode of operation or a second (e.g., &#x201c;cursor control&#x201d;) mode of operation in response to a received input from an operator such as a member of the aircraft's flight crew (e.g., a pilot or copilot), a maintenance technician, and so forth. When the first mode of operation is selected, the CDU processor further executes the one or more modules to cause the CDU display unit to be configured to display control indicia for facilitating control of one or more functions associated with the avionics system. When, the second mode of operation is selected, the CDU processor further executes the one or more modules to cause the CDU display unit to be configured to enable a cursor control area to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device of the avionics system via touch input to the touch screen over the cursor control area.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As noted, the display device may be a primary flight display (PFD) or a multifunction display (MFD). Thus, when the second mode of operation is selected, the CDU may be configured to enable a cursor control area that may be used by the operator to manipulate indicia such as a cursor, displayed information, maps, aircraft control display, and so forth, that are displayed by either the PFD or the MFD (or both) via touch input to the touch screen of the CDU display unit. For example, an operator may apply or provide a touch input to the CDU touch screen within the cursor control area to cause manipulation of a cursor, information, or indicia displayed within the display of either the PFD or the MFD (or both). Specifically, the cursor of the PFD or MFD may be moved from the cursor control area of the CDU touch screen as if a cursor control mechanism (e.g., mouse, joystick, touch input, etc) was applied directly to the PFD or MFD. Similarly, information and indicia displayed on the PFD or MFD may be selected (e.g., clicked) from the cursor control area of the CDU touch screen. In another example, the operator may provide multiple touch inputs (e.g., pan, pinch scale, flick scrolling, rotate, and so forth) to facilitate manipulation of a map (e.g., re-scaling the map, rotating the map, changing the area of the map displayed, and so forth) displayed by the PFD or the MFD (or both). Similarly, information and indicia displayed on the PFD or MFD that may be manipulated by from the CDU touch screen may include documents, charts, images, graphics, and other content commonly displayed by an avionics system. In some implementations, a function (e.g., action) may be performed on information and indicia displayed on the PFD or MFD from the cursor control area of the CDU touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Example Implementations</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate an example implementation of an integrated avionics system <b>100</b> within an aircraft. The integrated avionics system <b>100</b> may include one or more primary flight displays (PFDs) <b>102</b>, one or more multifunction displays (MFD) <b>104</b>, and one or more multi-product avionics control and display units (CDU) <b>106</b>. For instance, in the implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> may be configured for use in an aircraft that is flown by two pilots (e.g., a pilot and a copilot). In this implementation, the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> may include a first PFD <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>), a second PFD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>), an MFD <b>104</b>, a first CDU <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>), a second CDU <b>106</b>(<b>2</b>), and a third CDU <b>106</b>(<b>3</b>) that are mounted in the aircraft's instrument panel <b>108</b>. As shown, the MFD <b>104</b> is mounted generally in the center of the instrument panel <b>108</b> so that it may be accessed by either pilot (e.g., by either the pilot or the copilot). The first PFD <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) and the first CDU <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>) are mounted in the instrument panel <b>108</b> generally to the left of the MFD <b>104</b> for viewing and access by the pilot. Similarly, the second PFD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) and the second CDU <b>106</b>(<b>2</b>) are mounted in the instrument panel <b>108</b> generally to the right of the MFD <b>104</b> for viewing and access by the aircraft's copilot or other crew member or passenger. The third CDU <b>106</b>(<b>3</b>) may be mounted between the first and second CDUs <b>106</b>(<b>1</b>), <b>106</b>(<b>2</b>). In implementations, the CDUs <b>106</b> may be positioned within the instrument panel <b>108</b> so that they may be readily viewed and/or accessed by the pilot flying the aircraft (which could be either the pilot or copilot).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PFDs <b>102</b> may be configured to display primary flight information, such as aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, vertical speed, and so forth. In implementations, the PFDs <b>102</b> may display primary flight information via a graphical representation of basic flight instruments such as an attitude indicator, an airspeed indicator, an altimeter, a heading indicator, a course deviation indicator, and so forth. The PFDs <b>102</b> may also display other information providing situational awareness to the pilot such as terrain information, ground proximity warning information, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, primary flight information may be generated by one or more flight sensor data sources including, for example, one or more attitude, heading, angular rate, and/or acceleration information sources such as attitude and heading reference systems (AHRS) <b>110</b>, one or more air data information sources such as air data computers (ADCs) <b>112</b>, and/or one or more angle of attack information sources. For instance, the AHRSs <b>110</b> may be configured to provide information such as attitude, rate of turn, slip and skid; while the ADCs <b>112</b> may be configured to provide information including airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, and outside air temperature. Other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Integrated avionics units (IAUs) may aggregate the primary flight information from the AHRS <b>110</b> and ADC <b>112</b> and provide the information to the PFDs <b>102</b> via an avionics data bus <b>116</b>. The IAUs may also function as a combined communications and navigation radio. For example, the IAUs may include a two-way VHF communications transceiver, a VHF navigation receiver with glide slope, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and so forth. As shown, each integrated avionics unit may be paired with a primary flight display (PFD), which may function as a controlling unit for the integrated avionic unit. In implementations, the avionics data bus <b>116</b> may comprise a high speed data bus (HSDB), such as data bus complying with ARINC 429 data bus standard promulgated by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC), a MIL-STD-1553 compliant data bus, and so forth. In some embodiments, the CDUs <b>106</b> may connect to the avionics data bus <b>116</b> after being mounted in the aircraft's instrument panel <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The MFD <b>104</b> displays information describing operation of the aircraft such as navigation routes, moving maps, engine gauges, weather radar, ground proximity warning system (GPWS) warnings, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) warnings, airport information, and so forth, that are received from a variety of aircraft systems via the avionics data bus <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In implementations, the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> employs redundant sources of primary flight information to assure the availability of the information to the pilot, and to allow for cross-checking of the sources of the information. For example, the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> employs two PFDs <b>102</b> that receive primary flight information from redundant AHRSs <b>110</b> and ADCs <b>112</b> via redundant IAUs. The integrated avionics system <b>100</b> is configured so that the first PFD <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) receives a first set of primary flight information aggregated by a first IAU from a first AHRS <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and ADC <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>). Similarly, the second PFD <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>) receives a second set of primary flight information aggregated by a second IAU from a second AHRS <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) and ADC <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>). Additionally, although a single avionics data bus <b>116</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, it is contemplated that redundant data buses may be employed for communication between the various components of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In implementations, primary flight information provided by either the first AHRS <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and ADC <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>) or the second AHRS <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) and ADC <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>) may be displayed on either PFD <b>102</b>(<b>1</b>) or <b>102</b>(<b>2</b>), or on the MFD <b>104</b> upon determining that the primary flight information received from either AHRS <b>110</b> and ADC <b>112</b> is in error or unavailable. Reversionary switches <b>118</b> may be selected by the pilot to configure the PFDs <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b> to display primary flight information from either the first AHRS <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and ADC <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>) or the second AHRS <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) and ADC(<b>2</b>). One or both of the PFDs <b>102</b> may also be configured to display information shown on the MFD <b>104</b> (e.g., engine gauges and navigational information), such as in the event of a failure of the MFD <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The integrated avionics system <b>100</b> may employ cross-checking of the primary flight information (e.g., attitude information, altitude information, etc.) to determine if the primary flight information to be provided to either of the PFDs <b>102</b> is incorrect. In implementations, cross-checking may be accomplished through software-based automatic continual comparison of the primary flight information provided by the AHRS <b>110</b> and ADC <b>112</b>. In this manner, a &#x201c;miss-compare&#x201d; condition can be explicitly and proactively annunciated to warn the pilot when attitude information displayed by either PFD <b>102</b> sufficiently disagrees.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The CDUs <b>106</b> may provide a general purpose pilot interface to control the aircraft's avionics. For example, the CDUs <b>106</b> allow the pilots to control various systems of the aircraft such as the aircraft's autopilot system, navigation systems, communication systems, engines, and so on, via the avionics data bus <b>116</b>. In implementations, the CDUs <b>106</b> may also be used for control of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> including operation of the PFD <b>102</b> and MFD <b>104</b>. In implementations, one or both of the CDUs <b>106</b> may include a display unit <b>120</b>. The display unit <b>120</b> of the CDU <b>106</b> may be used for the display of information suitable for use by the pilot of the aircraft to control a variety of aircraft systems. Further, as discussed in greater detail herein below, the display unit <b>120</b> of the CDU may be configured to enable a cursor control area to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device of the avionics system (e.g., a PFD <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>) via touch input to the touch screen over the cursor control area.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The CDUs <b>106</b> may be operable to provide independent standby primary flight information to the pilot. The CDUs <b>106</b> may be configurable to operate in a reversionary mode to provide standby primary flight information to the pilot(s) of the aircraft. When operating in reversionary mode, the display unit <b>120</b> of the CDU <b>106</b> is used to display standby primary flight information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, standby primary flight information, which may include information such as attitude, altitude, heading, vertical speed, and so forth, may be generated by a standby attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) <b>122</b> and a standby air data computer (ADC) <b>124</b>. Data generated by AHRS <b>122</b> and ADC <b>124</b> may be provided to one or more of the CDUs <b>106</b> via a standby avionics data bus <b>128</b>. In implementations, one or more mode switches <b>130</b> may be selected by the pilot to cause any number of the CDUs <b>106</b> to operate in the first mode to display standby primary flight information. While operating in the reversionary mode, the CDUs <b>106</b> may be disconnected from the avionics data bus <b>116</b> so that the CDUs <b>106</b> operate independently of and communicatively isolated from the primary components of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> (e.g., the PFDs <b>102</b>, the MFD <b>104</b>, the AHRS <b>110</b>, the ADCs <b>112</b>, and so forth). For example, the CDUs <b>106</b> may not communicate with the avionics data bus <b>116</b> while in the first mode or may be physically disconnected from the avionics data bus <b>116</b> (e.g., via the mode switch <b>130</b>, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a system <b>200</b> in an example implementation showing a representative CDU <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> in greater detail. The CDU <b>106</b> is illustrated as including a processor <b>202</b>; a memory <b>204</b>; one or more avionics data bus interfaces <b>206</b> &#x26; <b>208</b> and the display unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The processor <b>202</b> provides processing functionality for the CDU <b>106</b> and may include any number of processors, micro-controllers, or other processing systems and resident or external memory for storing data and other information accessed or generated by the CDU <b>106</b>. The processor <b>202</b> may execute one or more software programs which implement techniques described herein. The processor <b>202</b> is not limited by the materials from which it is formed or the processing mechanisms employed therein, and as such, may be implemented via semiconductor(s) and/or transistors (e.g., electronic integrated circuits (ICs)), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The memory <b>204</b> is an example of computer-readable media that provides storage functionality to store various data associated with the operation of the CDU <b>106</b>, such as the software programs and code segments mentioned above, or other data to instruct the processor <b>202</b> and other elements of the CDU <b>106</b> to perform the functionality described herein. Although a single memory <b>204</b> is shown, a wide variety of types and combinations of memory may be employed. The memory <b>204</b> may be integral with the processor <b>202</b>, stand-alone memory, or a combination of both. The memory <b>204</b> may include, for example, removable and non-removable memory elements such as RAM, ROM, Flash (e.g., SD Card, mini-SD card, micro-SD Card), magnetic, optical, USB memory devices, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The avionics data bus interface <b>206</b> and the standby avionics data bus interface <b>208</b> provide functionality to enable the CDU <b>106</b> to communicate with one or more avionics data buses such as the avionics data bus <b>116</b> and standby avionics data bus <b>128</b>, respectively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In various implementations, the avionics data bus interface <b>206</b> and standby avionics data bus interface <b>208</b> may include a variety of components, such as processors, memory, encoders, decoders, and so forth, and any associated software employed by these components (e.g., drivers, configuration software, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The display unit <b>120</b> displays information to the pilot of the aircraft. In implementations, the display unit <b>120</b> may comprise an LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode) display, a TFT (Thin Film Transistor) LCD display, an LEP (Light Emitting Polymer or PLED (Polymer Light Emitting Diode) display, a cathode ray tube (CRT), and so forth, capable of displaying text and graphical information. The display unit <b>120</b> may be backlit via a backlight such that it may be viewed in the dark or other low-light environments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The display unit <b>120</b> may include a touch interface, such as a touch screen <b>210</b>, that can detect a touch input within a specified area of the display unit <b>120</b> for entry of information and commands. In implementations, the touch screen <b>210</b> may employ a variety of technologies for detecting touch inputs. For example, the touch screen <b>210</b> may employ infrared optical imaging technologies, resistive technologies, capacitive technologies, surface acoustic wave technologies, and so forth. In implementations, buttons, keypads, knobs and so forth, may be used for entry of data and commands instead of or in addition to the touch screen <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The CDU <b>106</b> is illustrated as including a cursor control module <b>212</b> which is storable in memory <b>204</b> and executable by the processor <b>202</b>. The cursor control module <b>212</b> is representative of mode of operation selection and cursor control functionality for the CDU <b>106</b>. Thus, the cursor control module <b>212</b> may provide functionality to select one of a first (e.g., &#x201c;standard&#x201d;) mode of operation or a second (e.g., &#x201c;cursor control&#x201d;) mode of operation of the CDU <b>106</b> in response to a received input from an operator such as a member of the aircraft's flight crew (e.g., a pilot or copilot), a maintenance technician, and so forth. When the first mode of operation is selected, the cursor control module <b>212</b> may further cause the display unit <b>120</b> to be configured to display control indicia for facilitating control of one or more functions associated with the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>). Conversely, when the second mode of operation is selected, the cursor control module <b>212</b> may cause the display unit <b>120</b> to be configured to enable a cursor control area to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device (e.g., PFD <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>) of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> via touch input to the touch screen <b>210</b> over the cursor control area.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 4B</figref> illustrate an example CDU <b>106</b> configured for operation in a first (e.g., &#x201c;standard&#x201d;) mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a second (e.g., &#x201c;cursor control&#x201d;) mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>), respectively. In the implementation illustrated, the CDU <b>106</b> includes a bezel <b>302</b> that surrounds the display unit <b>120</b> and touch screen <b>210</b> to aesthetically integrate the CDU <b>106</b> with the instrument panel <b>108</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). One or more controls <b>304</b> may be provided in the bezel <b>302</b> adjacent to the display unit <b>120</b> and touch screen <b>210</b>. In an implementation, the controls <b>304</b> may be control knobs, joysticks, buttons, indicia displayed within the display unit <b>120</b>, combinations thereof, and so forth. An operator may actuate a control <b>304</b> to initiate functionality associated with a cursor control module <b>212</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The actuation of the control <b>304</b> causes an input to be provided to the processor <b>202</b>. In response, the processor <b>202</b> accesses the cursor control module <b>212</b>, which causes the processor <b>202</b> to select (e.g., toggle) between a first mode of operation and a second mode of operation, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the display unit <b>120</b> may be operable to display a graphical user interface (GUI) <b>306</b> when the CDU <b>106</b> is operating in the first mode of operation (e.g., the first mode of operation is selected). In an implementation, the GUI <b>306</b> includes indicia <b>308</b> such as menus, icons, buttons, windows, text information, and/or other elements, which may be selected by the operator via the touch screen <b>210</b> to provide input to the CDU <b>106</b> and/or control various functionalities associated with the integrated avionics system <b>100</b>. Indicia <b>308</b> includes control indicia <b>308</b>A that represents an interface to one or more applications of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> that perform specific functions related to the control and operation of the aircraft. When the operator initiates an application (e.g., the operator touches the touch screen <b>210</b> corresponding to the graphical indicia <b>308</b>A), the application causes specific functionality to occur including, but not limited to: selecting radio frequencies for communication with other entities such as air traffic control, other aircraft, and so forth, causing a graphical representation of flight path to be displayed at the MFD <b>104</b>; causing air traffic information to be displayed at the MFD <b>104</b>; causing weather forecasts and/or reports to be displayed at the MFD <b>104</b>; causing a flight plan to be displayed at the MFD <b>104</b>; causing waypoint information to be displayed at the MFD <b>104</b>; causing aircraft system information to be displayed at the MFD <b>104</b>; selection of entertainment media, and so forth. The above application functionality is described for example purposes only, and it is understood that the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> may incorporate additional applications configured to provide additional functionality depending upon the features of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> and aircraft. The GUI <b>306</b> may also display text fields <b>310</b> (e.g., as part of indicia <b>308</b>B) for providing a variety of data to the operator. For instance, the GUI <b>306</b> may include text fields <b>310</b> that provide setting information including, but not limited to: radio frequency settings, autopilot settings, navigational settings and so forth. In implementations, one or more of the settings may be adjusted by inputs from the operator via the touch screen <b>210</b> and/or the controls <b>304</b>. In another implementation, indicia <b>308</b>A may represent an interface to cause selection (e.g., via execution of the cursor control module <b>212</b>) of the first mode of operation or the second mode of operation of the CDU <b>106</b>. For example, an operator may provide a touch input over the touch screen <b>210</b> to select indicia <b>308</b>A to cause a mode selection input to be provided to the processor <b>202</b> as discussed herein. In response to input, the processor <b>202</b> accesses and executes the cursor control module <b>212</b> to cause selection of either the first mode of operation or the second mode of operation of the CDU <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the display unit <b>120</b> is operable to enable a cursor control area <b>402</b> when the CDU <b>106</b> is in the second mode of operation. In the second mode of operation, the cursor control area <b>402</b> provides an interface to facilitate manipulation of indicia <b>502</b> displayed by PFDs <b>102</b> or MFDs <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, PFDs <b>102</b> may display indicia <b>502</b> that represents primary flight information (e.g., aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, vertical speed, and so forth). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the MFD <b>104</b> displays indicia <b>502</b> that represents information describing operation of the aircraft (e.g., navigation routes, moving maps, engine gauges, weather radar, ground proximity warning system (GPWS) warnings, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) warnings, airport information, and so forth). An operator can manipulate indicia <b>502</b> by providing touch input to the touch screen <b>210</b> within the cursor control area <b>402</b>. The indicia <b>502</b> may be manipulated in various manners corresponding to the provided touch input. In an implementation, an operator may provide a single finger touch input, a multi-touch input, and so forth, to the touch screen <b>210</b> to manipulate indicia <b>502</b> displayed by PFDs <b>102</b> or MFDs <b>104</b>. For example, the MFD <b>104</b> may display a map of an area surrounding the aircraft. The operator may perform a pan operation to modify the displayed map region (e.g., display a map region corresponding to the user's pan input). For instance, the operator may perform a one finger pan to view a region of the map outside of the currently displayed map area. The one finger pan may correspond to an operator placing his or her finger over the touch screen <b>210</b> and moving his or her finger within the cursor control area <b>402</b> corresponding to an area of the map the operator wishes to view. In another example, the operator may perform a two finger pinch scale input over the touch screen <b>210</b> to re-scale (e.g., control the scaling of) the map displayed within the MFD <b>104</b>. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the operator may perform a pinch scale input to re-scale the map region corresponding to the operator's input in the second mode of operation (e.g., &#x201c;zoom-in&#x201d; to re-scale the displayed map to have greater granularity with respect to the previously displayed map, &#x201c;zoom out&#x201d; to re-scale the displayed map to have less granularity with respect to the previously displayed map, and so forth). The pinch scale input may correspond to a zoom operation where the operator positions two opposing fingers within the cursor control area <b>402</b> and moves the fingers away/towards each other corresponding to the desired zoom operation. In yet another example, the operator may perform a double tap &#x201c;zoom in&#x201d; input over the touch screen <b>210</b> to re-scale the map displayed within the MFD <b>104</b> so that map has greater granularity with respect to the previously displayed map.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, indicia <b>502</b> may also include a cursor <b>504</b>, which can be manipulated by the operator through the touch screen <b>210</b> when the CDU <b>106</b> is in the second mode of operation. For example, touch input provided to the CDU touch screen <b>210</b> within the cursor control area <b>402</b> is translated to a relative position within the PFD <b>102</b> and/or the MFD <b>104</b> to manipulate the cursor <b>504</b>. In an implementation, the touch input may be invalidated and/or not recognized if the operator provides a touch input to an area outside of the cursor control area <b>402</b>. Thus, the operator may manipulate the cursor <b>504</b> to a desired position within the PFD <b>102</b> and/or the MFD <b>104</b> by applying a touch input to the CDU touch screen <b>210</b>. For instance, the operator may manipulate the cursor <b>504</b> to actuate an aircraft sub-routine through the PFD <b>102</b> and/or the MFD <b>104</b>. In another instance, the operator may manipulate the cursor <b>504</b> to control a scaling feature of a map displayed within the MFD <b>104</b>. In yet another instance, the operator may manipulate the cursor <b>504</b> to a point of interest within a map displayed by the MFD <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, an indication of or a perimeter around the cursor control area <b>402</b> may be displayed within a portion of the CDU display unit <b>120</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). For example, when the operator (e.g., pilot or copilot) actuates a control <b>304</b> (e.g., actuates a joystick, depresses a button, and so forth) of the CDU <b>106</b>, the cursor control area <b>402</b> is enabled within a portion of the display unit <b>120</b>. Thus, the operator may provide or apply a touch input capable of manipulating the indicia <b>502</b> within the enabled cursor control area <b>402</b>. Indicia corresponding to one or more control buttons <b>404</b> may also be displayed by the display unit <b>120</b>. In the example shown, the control buttons <b>404</b> are aligned horizontally above (distal from the operator) the cursor control area <b>402</b>. However, the control buttons <b>404</b> may be aligned differently in accordance with the requirements of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b>. The control buttons <b>404</b> represent graphical representations of various applications that perform specific functionality in response to selection of the corresponding control button <b>404</b>. The functionality may include, but is not limited to: causing the display of waypoint information, allowing the creation of waypoint information defined by a user, causing the display of airspace information, displaying information associated with the operator, and so forth. The above functionality is described for example purposes only and is not meant to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, the operator may wish to utilize a greater portion of the display unit <b>120</b> to provide touch input to. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the operator may select indicia (e.g., &#x201c;Full&#x201d; Screen button <b>406</b>) displayed within display unit <b>120</b>. Full Screen button <b>406</b> represents an interface (e.g., the operator can provide a touch input over the Full Screen button <b>406</b> to actuate specific functionality related to the Full Screen button <b>406</b>), that when selected, causes the CDU <b>106</b> to convert to a full screen display mode wherein a greater portion of the display unit <b>120</b> is occupied by the cursor control area <b>402</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In this manner, the operator is provided with a larger area in which he or she may apply a touch input to manipulate indicia <b>502</b> of the display device (e.g., PFD <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>). For example, selection of the Full Screen button <b>406</b> may cause the portion of the CDU display unit <b>120</b> displaying the control buttons <b>404</b> to be removed from the display unit <b>120</b> and replaced with a cursor control area <b>402</b> having increased area as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. When in the full screen display mode, the display unit <b>120</b> may cause indicia (e.g., &#x201c;Reduce&#x201d; Screen button <b>408</b>) to be displayed. The Reduce Screen button <b>408</b>, when selected, may represent an interface to cause the display unit <b>120</b> to reduce the size of the enabled cursor control area <b>402</b> and add control buttons <b>404</b> to the display unit <b>120</b> (e.g., cursor control area <b>402</b> is again displayed within a portion of the display unit <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). It is further contemplated that the size of the cursor control area <b>402</b> may be determined or selected by the operator (e.g., via a control <b>304</b>, indicia (e.g., control buttons) displayed by the display unit <b>120</b>, touch input to the touch screen <b>210</b> over the cursor control area <b>402</b>, combinations thereof, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the display unit <b>120</b> is also configured to display control buttons <b>404</b> including a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button <b>410</b> and a &#x201c;Home&#x201d; button <b>412</b>. The Cancel button <b>410</b> is representative of an interface to allow an operator to cause cancellation of the previous input and/or functionality initiated by the input to the display unit <b>120</b>. For example, if an operator has inadvertently provided an input to cause the cursor control area <b>402</b> to increase the size of the enabled cursor control area <b>402</b> (e.g., provided touch input over touch screen <b>210</b> corresponding to the Full Screen button <b>406</b>), the operator may provide a touch input over the touch screen <b>210</b> corresponding to the Cancel button <b>410</b> to return to the previous state (e.g., cursor control area <b>402</b> is enabled within a reduced portion of the display unit <b>120</b>). In another implementation, the operator may utilize the Cancel button <b>410</b> to cancel an operation provided to the PFDs <b>102</b> or the MFD <b>104</b>. The Home button <b>412</b> is representative of an interface to cause, when actuated, a home screen (e.g., GUI <b>306</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to be displayed at the display unit <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the Home button <b>412</b> may be representative of an interface to cause the CDU <b>106</b> to convert from the second mode of operation to the first mode of operation. As shown, the control buttons <b>404</b> (e.g., Full Screen button <b>406</b>, Reduce Screen button <b>408</b>, Cancel button <b>410</b>, and Home button <b>412</b>) may be aligned horizontally below (proximate to the operator) the cursor control area <b>402</b>. However, it is understood that the control buttons <b>404</b> may be displayed in other portions of the display unit <b>120</b> with respect to the cursor control area <b>402</b> in accordance with the requirements of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the indicia displayed within display unit <b>120</b> (e.g., &#x201c;Full&#x201d; Screen button <b>406</b>, &#x201c;Reduce&#x201d; Screen button <b>408</b> &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button <b>410</b>, and a &#x201c;Home&#x201d; button <b>412</b>) may facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device (e.g., PFD <b>102</b> or MH) <b>104</b>) of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> via touch input to the touch screen <b>210</b> over the cursor control area. For example, the a touch input within CDU display unit <b>120</b> selecting (e.g., activating) the &#x201c;Full&#x201d; Screen button <b>406</b>, may cause content displayed on a display device (e.g., PH) <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>) to expand to fill substantially the full screen of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, a function (e.g., action) may be performed on information and indicia displayed on the PFD or MFD from the cursor control area of the CDU touch screen. A graphic, such as an icon, associated with the function (e.g., action) may be displayed within the display unit <b>120</b>. In an implementation, if a cursor is presented within the display device (e.g., PFD <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>), a touch input associated with the graphic may cause a function to be performed on information or indicia displayed under the cursor of the display device. For example, icons for &#x201c;More Info,&#x201d; &#x201c;Direct To,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Insert in Flight Plan&#x201d; may be presented within CDU display unit <b>120</b> with a cursor control area enabled. Information and indicia, including a cursor, may be displayed by a display device (e.g., PFD <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>). The cursor's position may be manipulated from the cursor control area of CDU display unit <b>120</b> to be positioned over information and other indicia displayed by the display device. A touch input associated with the &#x201c;More Info&#x201d; icon may cause performance of a more information function on any information or indicia that overlaps with the current cursor position. In some embodiments, an input selecting a control button <b>404</b> representing various applications that perform specific functionality in response to selection of the corresponding control button <b>404</b> on information or indicia displayed under the cursor of the display device. It is to be understood that any function may be initiated from inputs to the CDU, including display unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using software, firmware, hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry), manual processing, or a combination of these implementations. The terms &#x201c;module&#x201d; and &#x201c;functionality&#x201d; as used herein generally represent software, firmware, hardware, or a combination thereof. The communication between modules in the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> can be wired, wireless, or some combination thereof. In the case of a software implementation, for instance, the module represents executable instructions that perform specified tasks when executed on a processor, such as the CDU processor <b>202</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The program code can be stored in one or more device-readable storage media, an example of which is the memory <b>204</b> associated with the CDU <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Example Methods</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a method <b>600</b> in an example implementation in which an avionics control and display unit (CDU) of an avionics system is configured to switch between a first mode of operation and a second mode of operation to apply cursor control functionality to a CDU, such as the CDU <b>106</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an avionics control and display unit (CDU) of an avionics system receives an input to select one of a first mode of operation or a second mode of operation (Block <b>602</b>). As discussed herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4B</figref>, at some points during operation and/or maintenance of the aircraft, the operator may wish to manipulate indicia <b>502</b> displayed by a display device such as a PFD <b>102</b> or MFD <b>104</b>. Thus, the operator may actuate a control <b>304</b> of a control and display unit (CDU) <b>106</b> of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> (or indicia <b>308</b>A displayed within the display unit <b>120</b> of the CDU <b>106</b>) to apply an input to the processor <b>202</b> to access and execute a cursor control module <b>212</b>. For example, the input may be a signal representing data or a parameter provided to the processor <b>202</b> to cause the processor <b>202</b> to access and execute the cursor control module <b>212</b>. As described above, the cursor control module <b>212</b> is representative of functionality to select a first mode of operation or a second mode of operation of the CDU <b>106</b>. Upon powering the integrated avionics system <b>100</b>, the CDU <b>106</b> may begin in the first mode of operation. Therefore, when the operator actuates control <b>304</b>, or selects indicia <b>308</b>A, the cursor control module <b>212</b> causes the processor <b>202</b> to select the second mode of operation of the CDU <b>106</b>. In embodiments, the display device may be a primary flight display (PFD) <b>102</b> or a multifunction display (MFD) <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the first mode of operation of the control and display unit (CDU) is selected, control indicia configured to facilitate control of a function of the avionics system is displayed by the CDU display unit (Block <b>604</b>). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4B</figref>, upon selection of the first mode of operation, the processor <b>202</b> is configured to cause the display unit <b>120</b> to display one or more graphical indicia <b>308</b> (e.g., indicia <b>308</b>A) that are configured to facilitate control functionality of the integrated avionics system <b>100</b>. The indicia <b>308</b>A represents interfaces that actuate various sub-routines to cause specific functionality to occur when triggered (e.g., operator provides touch input over the touch screen <b>210</b> corresponding to the indicia <b>308</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the second mode of operation of the control and display unit is selected, a cursor control area is enabled by the control and display unit (CDU) (Block <b>606</b>). As described above, the enabled cursor control area is configured to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by a display device of the avionics system via a touch input to the touch screen over the cursor control area. Upon selection of the second mode of operation, the processor <b>202</b> is configured to cause the display unit <b>120</b> to enable a cursor control area <b>402</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the touch screen detects a touch input over the cursor control area that is configured to facilitate manipulation of indicia displayed by the display device (Block <b>608</b>). Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref>, the cursor control area <b>402</b> is configured to receive a touch input to facilitate manipulation of indicia <b>502</b> displayed by a display device (e.g., PFD <b>102</b>, MFD <b>104</b>). As described above, a touch input may include, but is not limited to: a single finger touch input, a multi-touch input, and so forth, that correspondingly manipulate the indicia <b>502</b>. In implementations, the indicia <b>502</b> include primary flight information displayed within PFD <b>102</b>, information describing operation of the aircraft displayed within a MFD <b>104</b>, a cursor <b>504</b>, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the processor determines whether an input (e.g., touch input) has been received to select the other of the first mode/second mode of operation (Decision Block <b>610</b>). If an input has been received (YES from Decision Block <b>610</b>), the processor causes the control and display unit (CDU) to switch from either the first or second mode of operation to the other of the first or second mode of operation. If no input has been received (NO from Decision Block <b>610</b>), the processor continues to cause the control and display unit to operate in the selected mode of operation (Block <b>612</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> has been described with reference to example implementations illustrated in the attached drawing figures, it is noted that equivalents may be employed and substitutions made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as recited in the claims. Further, the integrated avionics system <b>100</b> and its components as illustrated and described herein are merely examples of a system and components that may be used to implement the present invention and may be replaced with other devices and components without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
