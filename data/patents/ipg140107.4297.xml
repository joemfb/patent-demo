<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0048638, filed on May 23, 2011, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts generally relate to semiconductor memory devices and, more particularly, to memory devices with three-dimensional structure and program methods thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor memory devices may be classified into volatile memory devices such as DRAM and SRAM and non-volatile memory devices such as EEPROM, FRAM, PRAM, MRAM, and flash memory. Volatile memory devices lose their stored data when their power supplies are interrupted, while nonvolatile memory devices retain their stored data even when their power supplies are interrupted. In particular, flash memory devices have advantages such as high program speed, low power consumption, and large data storage capacity. Therefore, a flash memory system including a flash memory is widely used as a data storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Flash memory devices are increasing in integration density to meet users' demands for better performance and lower costs. However, conventional two-dimensional flash memory devices are limited with respect to increasing integration density due to their fabrication processes. Three-dimensional flash memory devices have been proposed to overcome the limitation. A three-dimensional flash memory device is fabricated by vertically and horizontally stacking various layers and forming a channel hole. However, it is considerably difficult to form a uniform channel hole of a three-dimensional flash memory device. If a cross section of a channel hole of a three-dimensional flash memory device is not uniform, rising slope of a wordline voltage may vary between different wordlines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts provide memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some example embodiments, a memory device may include a memory cell array with a three-dimensional structure, a voltage generator configured to supply a pass voltage and a program voltage to the memory cell array, and a control logic configured to make the rising slope of the pass voltage variable with a program loop during a program operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to at least one example embodiment, the control logic may increase the rising slope of the pass voltage as the program loop increases. The control logic may include a voltage sloper configured to make the rising slope of the pass voltage variable. According to at least one other example embodiment, the voltage generator may include a voltage ramper configured to generate a pass voltage having a plurality of ramping levels. The voltage sloper may provide a ramp enable signal to the voltage ramper. The voltage ramper may provide a pass voltage having the same rising slope in the same program loop to a plurality of wordlines. The voltage ramper may adjust the rising slope of the pass voltage by adjusting a transition interval of the ramp enable signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts provide a memory device program method including a memory cell array with a three-dimensional structure. In some example embodiments, the program method may include receiving a program command, making the rising slope of a pass voltage variable with a program loop, and applying the pass voltage of the variable rising slope to a wordline.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to at least one example embodiment, a memory device includes a three-dimensional memory cell array, a voltage generator configured to supply a pass voltage and a program voltage to the memory cell array and a control logic configured to set a rising slope of the pass voltage based on a program loop of a program operation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to at least one example embodiment, a memory program method includes receiving a program command at a memory device including a three-dimensional memory cell array, setting a rising slope of a pass voltage based on a program loop of a program operation and applying the pass voltage to a wordline.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to at least one example embodiment, a memory device includes a three-dimensional memory cell array including a plurality of memory cells connected to a plurality of wordlines, a voltage generator configured to apply a first pass voltage to the plurality of wordlines in a first program loop of a program operation and a second pass voltage to the plurality of wordlines in a second program loop of the program operation and a control logic configured to set rates of change of the first and second pass voltages.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be noted that these figures are intended to illustrate the general characteristics of methods, structure and/or materials utilized in certain example embodiments and to supplement the written description provided below. These drawings are not, however, to scale and may not precisely reflect the precise structural or performance characteristics of any given embodiment, and should not be interpreted as defining or limiting the range of values or properties encompassed by example embodiments. For example, the relative thicknesses and positioning of molecules, layers, regions and/or structural elements may be reduced or exaggerated for clarity. The use of similar or identical reference numbers in the various drawings is intended to indicate the presence of a similar or identical element or feature.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown. Example embodiments may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of example embodiments to those of ordinary skill in the art. In the drawings, the thicknesses of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers indicate like elements throughout. As used herein the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; &#x201c;on&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly on&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be understood that, although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; if used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which example embodiments belong. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly-used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating flash memory systems according to example embodiments of the inventive concepts. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a flash memory system <b>1000</b> may include a flash memory device <b>1100</b> and a memory controller <b>1200</b>.

The voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may separately include a Vpgm sloper configured to adjust the slope of the program voltage Vpgm and a Vpass sloper configured to adjust the slope of the pass voltage Vpass. The voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may be implemented in the form of hardware or software. The voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may be incorporated in the memory controller <b>1200</b>. In this case, the voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may be managed by a flash translation layer (FTL). A program speed of the flash memory system <b>1000</b> may be improved using the voltage sloper <b>1165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a flash memory device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A flash memory device <b>1100</b> may include a memory cell array <b>1110</b>, an address decoder <b>1120</b>, a page buffer circuit <b>1130</b>, a data input/output circuit (data I/O circuit) <b>1140</b>, a voltage generator <b>1150</b> and a control logic <b>1160</b>. The control logic <b>1160</b> may include a voltage sloper <b>1165</b>. The voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may adjust the slope of, for example, a program voltage Vpgm and/or a pass voltage Vpass. The memory cell array <b>1110</b> may include a plurality of memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz each with a three-dimensional structure (e.g., a vertical and horizontal structure). In contrast, a memory block with a two-dimensional structure (e.g., a horizontal structure) may include memory cells only arranged in a horizontal direction with respect to a substrate. Each of the memory blocks BLK<b>1</b>-BLKz may constitute an erase unit of the flash memory device <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An address decoder <b>1200</b> may be connected to the memory cell array <b>1110</b> through selection lines SSL, GSL and/or wordlines WLs. The address decoder <b>1200</b> may receive a wordline voltage (VWL) from the voltage generator <b>1150</b> and may be controlled by the control logic <b>1160</b>. The address decoder <b>1120</b> may select a wordline during a program and/or read operation. A program voltage and/or a read voltage may be supplied to the selected wordline. The page buffer circuit <b>1130</b> may be connected to the memory cell array <b>1110</b> through a bitline BLs. The page buffer circuit <b>1130</b> may include a plurality of page buffers (not shown). One bitline may be connected to one page buffer (all BL structure) or two or more bitlines may be connected to one page buffer (shield BL structure). The page buffer <b>1130</b> may randomly store data to be programmed to a selected page and/or data read from the selected page.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The data I/O circuit <b>1140</b> may be internally connected to the page buffer circuit <b>1130</b> through a data line DL and may be externally connected to a memory controller (e.g., a memory controller <b>1200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through an input/output line I/O. The data I/O circuit <b>1140</b> may receive program data Data from the memory controller <b>1200</b> during a program operation and may provide read data to the memory controller <b>1200</b> during a read operation. The voltage generator <b>1150</b> may receive power PWR from the memory controller <b>1200</b> and may generate a wordline voltage VWL for reading and/or writing data. The voltage generator <b>1150</b> may generate a high voltage above a power supply voltage (Vcc). The high voltage may be used as a program voltage (Vpgm) and/or a pass voltage (Vpass).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The voltage generator <b>1150</b> may include a Vpgm generator <b>1151</b> and a Vpass generator <b>1152</b>. The Vpgm generator <b>1151</b> may generate a program voltage Vpgm supplied to a selected wordline during a program operation. The program voltage (Vpgm) may gradually increase as a program loop proceeds. The Vpass generator may generate a pass voltage (Vpass) that may be supplied to selected and unselected wordlines during a program operation. The pass voltage (Vpass) may be maintained at a constant level even when the program loop proceeds. The voltage generator <b>1150</b> may include a voltage ramper <b>1153</b>. The voltage ramper <b>1153</b> may receive the program voltage (Vpgm) and/or the pass voltage (Vpass) and may control the slope of the wordline voltage VWL in response to a ramp enable signal RMP_EN.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The control logic <b>1160</b> may control program, read, and erase operations of a flash memory device <b>1100</b> by using a command CMD, an address ADDR, and a control signal CTRL. For example, during the program operation, the control logic <b>1160</b> may control the address decoder <b>1120</b> to supply a program voltage Vpgm to a selected wordline and control the page buffer circuit <b>1130</b> and the data I/O circuit <b>1140</b> to supply program data to a selected page. The control logic <b>1160</b> may include a voltage sloper <b>1165</b>. The voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may generate a ramp enable signal RMP_EN to adjust a slope of the program voltage (Vpgm) and/or the pass voltage (Vpass). For example, the voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may improve program speed by increasing the slope of the pass voltage Vpass as the program loop proceeds. The voltage sloper <b>1165</b> may be configured separately, outside of the control logic <b>1160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is perspective view illustrating a three-dimensional structure of a memory block BLK<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the memory block BLK<b>1</b> may be perpendicular to a substrate SUB. An n<sup>+</sup>-doped region may be in the substrate SUB. Gate electrode layers (e.g., WL<b>1</b>-WL<b>8</b>, GSL and SSL), and insulation layers may alternate on the substrate SUB. An information storage layer may be between each gate electrode layer and an insulating layer. The information storage layer may include, for example, a tunnel insulating layer, a charge storage layer and a blocking insulating layer. If the gate electrode and the insulating layer are vertically patterned, a V-shaped pillar may be formed. The pillar may be connected to the substrate SUB through the gate electrode layer and the insulating layer. The interior of the pillar, as a filling dielectric pattern, may include a dielectric material, for example, a silicon oxide. The exterior of the pillar, as a vertical active pattern, may include a semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gate electrode layer of the memory block BLK<b>1</b> may be connected to a ground selection line GSL, a plurality of wordlines WL<b>1</b>-WL<b>8</b> and a string selection line SSL. The pillar of the memory block BLK<b>1</b> may be connected to a plurality of bitlines BL<b>1</b>-BL<b>3</b>. Although it is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that one memory block BLK<b>1</b> may include two selection lines GSL and SSL, eight wordlines WL<b>1</b>-WL<b>8</b>, and three bitlines BL<b>1</b>-BL<b>3</b>, a larger or smaller number of lines may be provided according to example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a memory block BLK<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, NAND strings NS<b>11</b>-NS<b>33</b> may be coupled between bitlines BL<b>1</b>-BL<b>3</b> and a common source line CSL. Each NAND string (e.g., NS<b>11</b>) may include a string selection transistor SST, a plurality of memory cells MC<b>1</b>-MC<b>8</b>, and a ground selection transistor GST. The string selection transistors SST may be connected to string selection lines SSL<b>1</b>-SSL<b>3</b>. The memory cells MC<b>1</b>-MC<b>8</b> may be connected to corresponding wordlines WL<b>1</b>-WL<b>8</b>, respectively. The ground selection transistors GST may be connected to ground selection lines GSL<b>1</b>-GSL<b>3</b>. The string selection transistors SST may be connected to a bitlines BL and the ground selection transistors GST may be connected to a common source line CSL.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Wordlines (e.g., WL<b>1</b>) of the same height (e.g., same vertical plane) may be connected in common, and the ground selection lines GSL<b>1</b>-GSL<b>3</b> and the string selection lines SSL<b>1</b>-SSL<b>3</b> may be separated from each other. In case of memory cells connected to a first wordline WL<b>1</b> and belonging to NAND strings NS<b>11</b>, NS<b>12</b>, and NS<b>13</b> (hereinafter, the memory cells will be referred to as &#x201c;page&#x201d;), the first wordline WL<b>1</b> and first selection lines SSL<b>1</b> and GSL<b>1</b> may be selected. Single-bit data or multi-bit data (at least two bits of data) may be stored in one memory cell. A memory cell capable of storing single-bit data may be called a single-level cell (SLC) or a single-bit cell, while a memory cell that may be capable of storing multi-bit data may be called a multi-level cell (MLC) or a multi-bit cell.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top plan view illustrating cross-sections A and B of a memory block BLK<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The cross section A may be a cross section of a plane corresponding to an eighth wordline WL<b>8</b>, and the cross section B may be a cross section of a plane corresponding to the first wordline WL<b>1</b>. Referring to the cross sections A and B, a cell transistor may include a filling dielectric pattern, a vertical active pattern, an information storage layer and a gate electrode layer sequentially disposed from the interior of a pillar. The filling dielectric pattern may include a silicon oxide and/or an air gap. The vertical active pattern may be made of P-type silicon and may act as a channel of a cell transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The information storage layer may include, for example, a tunnel oxide layer, a charge storage layer, and a blocking oxide layer. The tunnel oxide layer may act as a tunneling insulating layer through which charges migrate due to a tunneling effect. The charge storage layer may include a charge-trapping insulating layer. The charge storage layer may include, for example, a nitride (e.g., SiN) and/or a metal (e.g., aluminum and/or hafnium). The blocking oxide layer may act as an insulating layer between the gate electrode layer and the charge storage layer. The blocking oxide layer may include, for example, a silicon oxide. The tunnel oxide layer, the charge storage layer, and the blocking oxide layer may be, for example, an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) structure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A memory block (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with a three-dimensional structure may be formed by etching a plurality of thin films at one time to form a hole and forming a silicon channel layer in the hole. A diameter of the hole that may be a result of an etch process may vary with depth. The diameter of the hole may increase as a function of distance from the substrate SUB. A radius R of a filling dielectric pattern corresponding to the eighth wordline WL<b>8</b> may be greater than a radius r of a filling dielectric pattern corresponding to the first wordline WL<b>1</b>. The varying width of the hole may result in a difference between characteristics of a cell transistor connected to the eighth wordline WL<b>8</b> and a cell transistor that may be connected to the first wordline WL<b>1</b> (e.g., transistor characteristics may vary as a function of distance from the substrate). Generally, as a diameter of a pillar increases, an effective area of a gate electrode layer may be reduced and resistance of the gate electrode may increase. Coupling capacitance and resistance of a cell transistor may increase as the diameter of the pillar increases. Resistance R and capacitance C of the eighth wordline WL<b>8</b> on the uppermost layer of the pillar may be at a maximum and/or increased.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If resistance R and capacitance C of a wordline increase, the slope of a program voltage Vpgm and/or a pass voltage Vpass may also increase. In this case, the slope (e.g., change over time represented in a graph) of a wordline voltage may vary with the height of a wordline. During a program operation, a difference of program speed and a disturbance characteristic may vary with the wordline and may increase threshold voltage dispersion of a memory block.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph illustrating a change in wordline voltage over time as a function of wordline height. Due to process characteristics and/or error, a sectional area of a pillar may increase as a function of distance from a substrate. An increase of sectional area of the pillar corresponds to a decrease in sectional area of a gate electrode layer. A sectional area of a wordline may decrease as a function of distance from the substrate. A sectional area of the first wordline WL<b>1</b> may be larger than that of the eighth wordline WL<b>8</b>. Because resistance of a wordline is inversely proportional to its sectional area, resistance of the first wordline WL<b>1</b> may be lower than resistance of the eighth wordline WL<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A rate of change of a wordline voltage of a first wordline near the substrate may be greater than a rate of change of a wordline voltage of a second wordline farther away from the substrate than the first wordline. The rate of change is represented graphically by the slope of a line representing the wordline voltage (rate of change and slope of a word line voltage may be used interchangeably herein). This difference in rising slope may lead to read margin reduction resulting from a program speed difference. During a program operation, a voltage supplied to the first wordline WL<b>1</b> may change at a rate represented by a rising slope &#x2018;&#x3b3;&#x2019; while rising up to the pass voltage Vpass in a time period T<b>3</b>. A voltage supplied to an eight wordline WL<b>8</b> may change at a rate represented by a rising slope &#x2018;&#x3b1;&#x2019; while rising up to the pass voltage Vpass in a time period T<b>1</b>. While the wordline voltages of wordlines WL<b>1</b> and WL<b>8</b> increase to the pass voltage Vpass, the rising slope of the first wordline voltage may be greater than that of the eighth wordline voltage. An instantaneous voltage at a point in time during the rise of the wordline voltages from Vss to Vpass may be different for different wordlines.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first and eighth wordline voltages may change according to slopes &#x2018;&#x3b4;&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x3b2;&#x2019; while rising up to the program voltage Vpgm in time periods T<b>4</b> and T<b>2</b>, respectively. While rising up to the program voltage Vpgm, the rising slope of the first wordline voltage may be greater than that of the eighth wordline voltage. When memory cells connected to the first and eighth wordlines WL<b>1</b> and WL<b>8</b> are programmed, memory cells connected to the first wordline WL<b>1</b> may be programmed faster than those connected to the eighth wordline WL<b>8</b>. This program speed difference of the memory cells may lead to read margin reduction. A flash memory device <b>1100</b> according to example embodiments may allow a change in a program voltage and/or a pass voltage to be represented by the same slope in the same program loop during a program operation by using a voltage ramper <b>1153</b>. The flash memory device <b>1100</b> may increase the slope of a pass voltage as a program loop proceeds by using the voltage ramper <b>1153</b> and the voltage sloper <b>1165</b> to improve a program speed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a voltage ramper <b>1153</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> according to at least one example embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it may be assumed that the pass voltage Vpass may be received from the Vpass generator <b>1152</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the voltage ramper <b>1153</b> may include first to sixth switches S/W<b>1</b>-S/W<b>6</b> and first to eleventh transistors NM<b>1</b>-NM<b>11</b>. Each of the first to sixth switches S/W<b>1</b>-S/W<b>6</b> may receive a high voltage Vpp. The high voltage Vpp, which may be higher than a power supply voltage Vcc, may be externally applied and/or internally generated. The first to sixth switches S/W<b>1</b>-S/W<b>6</b> may receive first to sixth ramp enable signals RMP_EN_<b>1</b>-RMP_EN_<b>6</b>, respectively. In response to corresponding ramp enable signals, the first to sixth switches S/W<b>1</b>-S/W<b>6</b> may transmit the high voltage Vpp to gates of the sixth to eleventh transistors NM<b>6</b>-NM<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first to fifth transistors NM<b>1</b>-NM<b>5</b> may be serially connected. Gates and sources of the first to fourth transistors NM<b>1</b>-NM<b>4</b> may be connected to drains of the second to fifth transistors NM<b>2</b>-NM<b>5</b>, respectively. A drain of the first transistor NM<b>1</b> may be connected to a drain of the sixth transistor NM<b>6</b>, and a source of the fifth transistor NM<b>5</b> may be connected to the pass voltage Vpass. Gates of the sixth to eleventh transistors NM<b>6</b>-NM<b>11</b> may be connected to the switches S/W<b>1</b>-S/W<b>6</b>, respectively. Drains of the sixth to eleventh transistors NM<b>6</b>-NM<b>11</b> may be connected to sources of the first to fifth transistors NM<b>1</b>-NM<b>5</b>, respectively. Sources of the sixth to eleventh transistors NM<b>6</b>-NM<b>11</b> may be connected to the same node and may generate a wordline voltage VWL.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating operations of a voltage ramper of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the first ramp enable signal RMP_EN_<b>1</b> may be activated. The first switch S/W<b>1</b> may transfer a high voltage Vpp to the gate of the sixth transistor NM<b>6</b> in response to the activated first enable signal RMP_EN_<b>1</b>. The sixth transistor NM<b>6</b> may be turned on. Because the drain of the sixth transistor NM<b>6</b> is connected to the drain of the first transistor NM<b>1</b>, a voltage level dropping by threshold voltages of the first to fifth transistors NM<b>1</b>-NM<b>5</b> may be output to the wordline voltage VWL from the pass voltage Vpass (e.g., Vpass minus the threshold voltages of NM<b>1</b>-NM<b>5</b>). The voltage level of the wordline voltage VWL may be called a first ramping level.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the second ramp enable signal RMP_EN_<b>1</b> is activated, the seventh transistor NM<b>7</b> may be turned on and a voltage level dropping by threshold voltages of the second to fifth transistors NM<b>2</b>-NM<b>5</b> may be output to the wordline voltage VWL from the pass voltage Vpass. The voltage level of the wordline voltage VWL may be called a second ramping level. The second ramping level may be higher than the first ramping level by the threshold voltage of the first transistor NM<b>1</b>. When the third to sixth ramp enable signals RMP_EN_<b>3</b>-RMP_EN_<b>6</b> are sequentially activated, the wordline voltage VWL may gradually rise by threshold voltages of the second to fifth transistors NM<b>2</b>-NM<b>5</b>. As a result, the wordline voltage VWL may gradually rise up to the level of the pass voltage Vpass.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The flash memory device <b>1100</b> according to example embodiments may adjust the rising slope of the wordline voltage VWL in the same program loop. For example, the rising slope of the first wordline voltage may be adjusted to be the same as the rising slope of the eighth wordline voltage by adjusting transition intervals t<b>1</b>-t<b>5</b> of respective ramp enable signals. As another example, the rising slope of the first wordline voltage may be adjusted to be the same as the rising slope of the eighth wordline voltage by varying the number of transistors of the voltage ramper <b>1153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> are timing diagrams illustrating flash memory device program methods according to example embodiments of the inventive concepts. A flash memory device (e.g., <b>1100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may apply a pass voltage to selected and unselected wordlines in respective program loops before applying a program voltage to the selected wordline. In the flash memory device <b>1100</b>, a program voltage may gradually increase as a program loop proceeds while a pass voltage may be maintained at a constant level.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The flash memory device <b>1100</b> according to example embodiments of the inventive concepts may adjust the slope of a pass voltage as a program loop proceeds by using a voltage sloper <b>1165</b>. As the program loop proceeds, a program operation may be terminated to increase the number of program-inhibited cells. If the number of program-inhibited cells increases, area capacitance between a control gate and a channel may be reduced during wordline loading.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In case of a three-dimensional flash memory, area capacitance may place a much greater deal of weight during wordline loading than a two-dimensional flash memory. Because slowest wordline loading may decrease, the slope of a wordline voltage may be adjusted at a higher speed than when a program operation is started. The flash memory device according to the inventive concept may decrease pass voltage develop time and may improve a program speed because the slope of a pass voltage increases as a program loop proceeds.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it may be assumed that the rising slope of a pass voltage in a first program loop may be S<b>1</b>. The flash memory device <b>1100</b> may increase the rising slope of the pass voltage to S<b>2</b> in an i<sup>th </sup>program loop and to S<b>3</b> in an n<sup>th </sup>program loop. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the rising slope of the pass voltage increases to S<b>2</b> and S<b>3</b>, Vpass develop times may decrease by &#x394;t<b>1</b> and &#x394;t<b>2</b>, respectively. The program speed may be improved by as much as the decrease of the Vpass develop time.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flash memory device <b>1100</b> according to example embodiments may allow the slope of a program voltage and/or a pass voltage to be the same slope in the same program loop during a program operation by using the voltage ramper <b>1153</b>. The flash memory device <b>1100</b> may increase the slope of a pass voltage as a program loop may proceed by using the voltage ramper <b>1153</b> and the voltage sloper <b>1165</b> to improve a program speed. The flash memory device according to example embodiments may be applied even when the voltage ramper shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is not used. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as a program loop proceeds, the rising slope of a pass voltage may increase and Vpass develop times may decrease by &#x394;t<b>1</b> and &#x394;t<b>2</b>, respectively.
