<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional patent application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/400,511, which was filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on 20 Feb. 2012 and entitled Article Of Footwear Incorporating A Knitted Component With A Tongue, such application being entirely incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional articles of footwear generally include two primary elements, an upper and a sole structure. The upper is secured to the sole structure and forms a void on the interior of the footwear for comfortably and securely receiving a foot. The sole structure is secured to a lower area of the upper, thereby being positioned between the upper and the ground. In athletic footwear, for example, the sole structure may include a midsole and an outsole. The midsole often includes a polymer foam material that attenuates ground reaction forces to lessen stresses upon the foot and leg during walking, running, and other ambulatory activities. Additionally, the midsole may include fluid-filled chambers, plates, moderators, or other elements that further attenuate forces, enhance stability, or influence the motions of the foot. The outsole is secured to a lower surface of the midsole and provides a ground-engaging portion of the sole structure formed from a durable and wear-resistant material, such as rubber. The sole structure may also include a sockliner positioned within the void and proximal a lower surface of the foot to enhance footwear comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The upper generally extends over the instep and toe areas of the foot, along the medial and lateral sides of the foot, under the foot, and around the heel area of the foot. In some articles of footwear, such as basketball footwear and boots, the upper may extend upward and around the ankle to provide support or protection for the ankle. Access to the void on the interior of the upper is generally provided by an ankle opening in a heel region of the footwear. A lacing system is often incorporated into the upper to adjust the fit of the upper, thereby permitting entry and removal of the foot from the void within the upper. The lacing system also permits the wearer to modify certain dimensions of the upper, particularly girth, to accommodate feet with varying dimensions. In addition, the upper may include a tongue that extends under the lacing system to enhance adjustability of the footwear, and the upper may incorporate a heel counter to limit movement of the heel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of material elements (e.g., textiles, polymer foam, polymer sheets, leather, synthetic leather) are conventionally utilized in manufacturing the upper. In athletic footwear, for example, the upper may have multiple layers that each include a variety of joined material elements. As examples, the material elements may be selected to impart stretch-resistance, wear-resistance, flexibility, air-permeability, compressibility, comfort, and moisture-wicking to different areas of the upper. In order to impart the different properties to different areas of the upper, material elements are often cut to desired shapes and then joined together, usually with stitching or adhesive bonding. Moreover, the material elements are often joined in a layered configuration to impart multiple properties to the same areas. As the number and type of material elements incorporated into the upper increases, the time and expense associated with transporting, stocking, cutting, and joining the material elements may also increase. Waste material from cutting and stitching processes also accumulates to a greater degree as the number and type of material elements incorporated into the upper increases. Moreover, uppers with a greater number of material elements may be more difficult to recycle than uppers formed from fewer types and numbers of material elements. By decreasing the number of material elements utilized in the upper, therefore, waste may be decreased while increasing the manufacturing efficiency and recyclability of the upper.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various configurations of an article of footwear may have an upper and a sole structure secured to the upper. The upper includes a knit element and a tongue. The knit element defines a portion of an exterior surface of the upper and an opposite interior surface of the upper, with the interior surface defining a void for receiving a foot. The tongue is formed of unitary knit construction with the knit element and extends through a throat area of the upper.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The advantages and features of novelty characterizing aspects of the invention are pointed out with particularity in the appended claims. To gain an improved understanding of the advantages and features of novelty, however, reference may be made to the following descriptive matter and accompanying figures that describe and illustrate various configurations and concepts related to the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The following discussion and accompanying figures disclose a variety of concepts relating to knitted components and the manufacture of knitted components. Although the knitted components may be utilized in a variety of products, an article of footwear that incorporates one of the knitted components is disclosed below as an example. In addition to footwear, the knitted components may be utilized in other types of apparel (e.g., shirts, pants, socks, jackets, undergarments), athletic equipment (e.g., golf bags, baseball and football gloves, soccer ball restriction structures), containers (e.g., backpacks, bags), and upholstery for furniture (e.g., chairs, couches, car seats). The knitted components may also be utilized in bed coverings (e.g., sheets, blankets), table coverings, towels, flags, tents, sails, and parachutes. The knitted components may be utilized as technical textiles for industrial purposes, including structures for automotive and aerospace applications, filter materials, medical textiles (e.g. bandages, swabs, implants), geotextiles for reinforcing embankments, agrotextiles for crop protection, and industrial apparel that protects or insulates against heat and radiation. Accordingly, the knitted components and other concepts disclosed herein may be incorporated into a variety of products for both personal and industrial purposes.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Footwear Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An article of footwear <b>100</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4C</figref> as including a sole structure <b>110</b> and an upper <b>120</b>. Although footwear <b>100</b> is illustrated as having a general configuration suitable for running, concepts associated with footwear <b>100</b> may also be applied to a variety of other athletic footwear types, including baseball shoes, basketball shoes, cycling shoes, football shoes, tennis shoes, soccer shoes, training shoes, walking shoes, and hiking boots, for example. The concepts may also be applied to footwear types that are generally considered to be non-athletic, including dress shoes, loafers, sandals, and work boots. Accordingly, the concepts disclosed with respect to footwear <b>100</b> apply to a wide variety of footwear types.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For reference purposes, footwear <b>100</b> may be divided into three general regions: a forefoot region <b>101</b>, a midfoot region <b>102</b>, and a heel region <b>103</b>. Forefoot region <b>101</b> generally includes portions of footwear <b>100</b> corresponding with the toes and the joints connecting the metatarsals with the phalanges. Midfoot region <b>102</b> generally includes portions of footwear <b>100</b> corresponding with an arch area of the foot. Heel region <b>103</b> generally corresponds with rear portions of the foot, including the calcaneus bone. Footwear <b>100</b> also includes a lateral side <b>104</b> and a medial side <b>105</b>, which extend through each of regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and correspond with opposite sides of footwear <b>100</b>. More particularly, lateral side <b>104</b> corresponds with an outside area of the foot (i.e. the surface that faces away from the other foot), and medial side <b>105</b> corresponds with an inside area of the foot (i.e., the surface that faces toward the other foot). Regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b>-<b>105</b> are not intended to demarcate precise areas of footwear <b>100</b>. Rather, regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b>-<b>105</b> are intended to represent general areas of footwear <b>100</b> to aid in the following discussion. In addition to footwear <b>100</b>, regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b>-<b>105</b> may also be applied to sole structure <b>110</b>, upper <b>120</b>, and individual elements thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Sole structure <b>110</b> is secured to upper <b>120</b> and extends between the foot and the ground when footwear <b>100</b> is worn. The primary elements of sole structure <b>110</b> are a midsole <b>111</b>, an outsole <b>112</b>, and a sockliner <b>113</b>. Midsole <b>111</b> is secured to a lower surface of upper <b>120</b> and may be formed from a compressible polymer foam element (e.g., a polyurethane or ethylvinylacetate foam) that attenuates ground reaction forces (i.e., provides cushioning) when compressed between the foot and the ground during walking, running, or other ambulatory activities. In further configurations, midsole <b>111</b> may incorporate plates, moderators, fluid-filled chambers, lasting elements, or motion control members that further attenuate forces, enhance stability, or influence the motions of the foot, or midsole <b>21</b> may be primarily formed from a fluid-filled chamber. Outsole <b>112</b> is secured to a lower surface of midsole <b>111</b> and may be formed from a wear-resistant rubber material that is textured to impart traction. Sockliner <b>113</b> is located within upper <b>120</b> and is positioned to extend under a lower surface of the foot to enhance the comfort of footwear <b>100</b>. Although this configuration for sole structure <b>110</b> provides an example of a sole structure that may be used in connection with upper <b>120</b>, a variety of other conventional or nonconventional configurations for sole structure <b>110</b> may also be utilized. Accordingly, the features of sole structure <b>110</b> or any sole structure utilized with upper <b>120</b> may vary considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Upper <b>120</b> defines a void within footwear <b>100</b> for receiving and securing a foot relative to sole structure <b>110</b>. The void is shaped to accommodate the foot and extends along a lateral side of the foot, along a medial side of the foot, over the foot, around the heel, and under the foot. Access to the void is provided by an ankle opening <b>121</b> located in at least heel region <b>103</b>. A lace <b>122</b> extends through various lace apertures <b>123</b> in upper <b>120</b> and permits the wearer to modify dimensions of upper <b>120</b> to accommodate proportions of the foot. More particularly, lace <b>122</b> permits the wearer to tighten upper <b>120</b> around the foot, and lace <b>122</b> permits the wearer to loosen upper <b>120</b> to facilitate entry and removal of the foot from the void (i.e., through ankle opening <b>121</b>). In addition, upper <b>120</b> includes a tongue <b>124</b> that extends under lace <b>122</b> and lace apertures <b>123</b> to enhance the comfort of footwear <b>100</b>. In further configurations, upper <b>120</b> may include additional elements, such as (a) a heel counter in heel region <b>103</b> that enhances stability, (b) a toe guard in forefoot region <b>101</b> that is formed of a wear-resistant material, and (c) logos, trademarks, and placards with care instructions and material information.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Many conventional footwear uppers are formed from multiple material elements (e.g., textiles, polymer foam, polymer sheets, leather, synthetic leather) that are joined through stitching or bonding, for example. In contrast, a majority of upper <b>120</b> is formed from a knitted component <b>130</b>, which extends through each of regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b>, along both lateral side <b>104</b> and medial side <b>105</b>, over forefoot region <b>101</b>, and around heel region <b>103</b>. In addition, knitted component <b>130</b> forms portions of both an exterior surface and an opposite interior surface of upper <b>120</b>. As such, knitted component <b>130</b> defines at least a portion of the void within upper <b>120</b>. In some configurations, knitted component <b>130</b> may also extend under the foot. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, however, a strobel sock <b>125</b> is secured to knitted component <b>130</b> and an upper surface of midsole <b>111</b>, thereby forming a portion of upper <b>120</b> that extends under sockliner <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Knitted Component Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Knitted component <b>130</b> is depicted separate from a remainder of footwear <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Knitted component <b>130</b> is formed of unitary knit construction. As utilized herein, a knitted component (e.g., knitted component <b>130</b>) is defined as being formed of &#x201c;unitary knit construction&#x201d; when formed as a one-piece element through a knitting process. That is, the knitting process substantially forms the various features and structures of knitted component <b>130</b> without the need for significant additional manufacturing steps or processes. Although portions of knitted component <b>130</b> may be joined to each other (e.g., edges of knitted component <b>130</b> being joined together) following the knitting process, knitted component <b>130</b> remains formed of unitary knit construction because it is formed as a one-piece knit element. Moreover, knitted component <b>130</b> remains formed of unitary knit construction when other elements (e.g., lace <b>122</b>, tongue <b>124</b>, logos, trademarks, placards with care instructions and material information) are added following the knitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The primary elements of knitted component <b>130</b> are a knit element <b>131</b> and an inlaid strand <b>132</b>. Knit element <b>131</b> is formed from at least one yarn that is manipulated (e.g., with a knitting machine) to form a plurality of intermeshed loops that define a variety of courses and wales. That is, knit element <b>131</b> has the structure of a knit textile. Inlaid strand <b>132</b> extends through knit element <b>131</b> and passes between the various loops within knit element <b>131</b>. Although inlaid strand <b>132</b> generally extends along courses within knit element <b>131</b>, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may also extend along wales within knit element <b>131</b>. Advantages of inlaid strand <b>132</b> include providing support, stability, and structure. For example, inlaid strand <b>132</b> assists with securing upper <b>120</b> around the foot, limits deformation in areas of upper <b>120</b> (e.g., imparts stretch-resistance) and operates in connection with lace <b>122</b> to enhance the fit of footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Knit element <b>131</b> has a generally U-shaped configuration that is outlined by a perimeter edge <b>133</b>, a pair of heel edges <b>134</b>, and an inner edge <b>135</b>. When incorporated into footwear <b>100</b>, perimeter edge <b>133</b> lays against the upper surface of midsole <b>111</b> and is joined to strobel sock <b>125</b>. Heel edges <b>134</b> are joined to each other and extend vertically in heel region <b>103</b>. In some configurations of footwear <b>100</b>, a material element may cover a seam between heel edges <b>134</b> to reinforce the seam and enhance the aesthetic appeal of footwear <b>100</b>. Inner edge <b>135</b> forms ankle opening <b>121</b> and extends forward to an area where lace <b>122</b>, lace apertures <b>123</b>, and tongue <b>124</b> are located. In addition, knit element <b>131</b> has a first surface <b>136</b> and an opposite second surface <b>137</b>. First surface <b>136</b> forms a portion of the exterior surface of upper <b>120</b>, whereas second surface <b>137</b> forms a portion of the interior surface of upper <b>120</b>, thereby defining at least a portion of the void within upper <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Inlaid strand <b>132</b>, as noted above, extends through knit element <b>131</b> and passes between the various loops within knit element <b>131</b>. More particularly, inlaid strand <b>132</b> is located within the knit structure of knit element <b>131</b>, which may have the configuration of a single textile layer in the area of inlaid strand <b>132</b>, and between surfaces <b>136</b> and <b>137</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>. When knitted component <b>130</b> is incorporated into footwear <b>100</b>, therefore, inlaid strand <b>132</b> is located between the exterior surface and the interior surface of upper <b>120</b>. In some configurations, portions of inlaid strand <b>132</b> may be visible or exposed on one or both of surfaces <b>136</b> and <b>137</b>. For example, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may lay against one of surfaces <b>136</b> and <b>137</b>, or knit element <b>131</b> may form indentations or apertures through which inlaid strand passes. An advantage of having inlaid strand <b>132</b> located between surfaces <b>136</b> and <b>137</b> is that knit element <b>131</b> protects inlaid strand <b>132</b> from abrasion and snagging.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, inlaid strand <b>132</b> repeatedly extends from perimeter edge <b>133</b> toward inner edge <b>135</b> and adjacent to a side of one lace aperture <b>123</b>, at least partially around the lace aperture <b>123</b> to an opposite side, and back to perimeter edge <b>133</b>. When knitted component <b>130</b> is incorporated into footwear <b>100</b>, knit element <b>131</b> extends from a throat area of upper <b>120</b> (i.e., where lace <b>122</b>, lace apertures <b>123</b>, and tongue <b>124</b> are located) to a lower area of upper <b>120</b> (i.e., where knit element <b>131</b> joins with sole structure <b>110</b>. In this configuration, inlaid strand <b>132</b> also extends from the throat area to the lower area. More particularly, inlaid strand repeatedly passes through knit element <b>131</b> from the throat area to the lower area.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although knit element <b>131</b> may be formed in a variety of ways, courses of the knit structure generally extend in the same direction as inlaid strands <b>132</b>. That is, courses may extend in the direction extending between the throat area and the lower area. As such, a majority of inlaid strand <b>132</b> extends along the courses within knit element <b>131</b>. In areas adjacent to lace apertures <b>123</b>, however, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may also extend along wales within knit element <b>131</b>. More particularly, sections of inlaid strand <b>132</b> that are parallel to inner edge <b>135</b> may extend along the wales.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As discussed above, inlaid strand <b>132</b> passes back and forth through knit element <b>131</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, inlaid strand <b>132</b> also repeatedly exits knit element <b>131</b> at perimeter edge <b>133</b> and then re-enters knit element <b>131</b> at another location of perimeter edge <b>133</b>, thereby forming loops along perimeter edge <b>133</b>. An advantage to this configuration is that each section of inlaid strand <b>132</b> that extends between the throat area and the lower area may be independently tensioned, loosened, or otherwise adjusted during the manufacturing process of footwear <b>100</b>. That is, prior to securing sole structure <b>110</b> to upper <b>120</b>, sections of inlaid strand <b>132</b> may be independently adjusted to the proper tension.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In comparison with knit element <b>131</b>, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may exhibit greater stretch-resistance. That is, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may stretch less than knit element <b>131</b>. Given that numerous sections of inlaid strand <b>132</b> extend from the throat area of upper <b>120</b> to the lower area of upper <b>120</b>, inlaid strand <b>132</b> imparts stretch-resistance to the portion of upper <b>120</b> between the throat area and the lower area. Moreover, placing tension upon lace <b>122</b> may impart tension to inlaid strand <b>132</b>, thereby inducing the portion of upper <b>120</b> between the throat area and the lower area to lay against the foot. As such, inlaid strand <b>132</b> operates in connection with lace <b>122</b> to enhance the fit of footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Knit element <b>131</b> may incorporate various types of yarn that impart different properties to separate areas of upper <b>120</b>. That is, one area of knit element <b>131</b> may be formed from a first type of yarn that imparts a first set of properties, and another area of knit element <b>131</b> may be formed from a second type of yarn that imparts a second set of properties. In this configuration, properties may vary throughout upper <b>120</b> by selecting specific yarns for different areas of knit element <b>131</b>. The properties that a particular type of yarn will impart to an area of knit element <b>131</b> partially depend upon the materials that form the various filaments and fibers within the yarn. Cotton, for example, provides a soft hand, natural aesthetics, and biodegradability. Elastane and stretch polyester each provide substantial stretch and recovery, with stretch polyester also providing recyclability. Rayon provides high luster and moisture absorption. Wool also provides high moisture absorption, in addition to insulating properties and biodegradability. Nylon is a durable and abrasion-resistant material with relatively high strength. Polyester is a hydrophobic material that also provides relatively high durability. In addition to materials, other aspects of the yarns selected for knit element <b>131</b> may affect the properties of upper <b>120</b>. For example, a yarn forming knit element <b>131</b> may be a monofilament yarn or a multifilament yarn. The yarn may also include separate filaments that are each formed of different materials. In addition, the yarn may include filaments that are each formed of two or more different materials, such as a bicomponent yarn with filaments having a sheath-core configuration or two halves formed of different materials. Different degrees of twist and crimping, as well as different deniers, may also affect the properties of upper <b>120</b>. Accordingly, both the materials forming the yarn and other aspects of the yarn may be selected to impart a variety of properties to separate areas of upper <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As with the yarns forming knit element <b>131</b>, the configuration of inlaid strand <b>132</b> may also vary significantly. In addition to yarn, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may have the configurations of a filament (e.g., a monofilament), thread, rope, webbing, cable, or chain, for example. In comparison with the yarns forming knit element <b>131</b>, the thickness of inlaid strand <b>132</b> may be greater. In some configurations, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may have a significantly greater thickness than the yarns of knit element <b>131</b>. Although the cross-sectional shape of inlaid strand <b>132</b> may be round, triangular, square, rectangular, elliptical, or irregular shapes may also be utilized. Moreover, the materials forming inlaid strand <b>132</b> may include any of the materials for the yarn within knit element <b>131</b>, such as cotton, elastane, polyester, rayon, wool, and nylon. As noted above, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may exhibit greater stretch-resistance than knit element <b>131</b>. As such, suitable materials for inlaid strands <b>132</b> may include a variety of engineering filaments that are utilized for high tensile strength applications, including glass, aramids (e.g., para-aramid and meta-aramid), ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene, and liquid crystal polymer. As another example, a braided polyester thread may also be utilized as inlaid strand <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">An example of a suitable configuration for a portion of knitted component <b>130</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. In this configuration, knit element <b>131</b> includes a yarn <b>138</b> that forms a plurality of intermeshed loops defining multiple horizontal courses and vertical wales. Inlaid strand <b>132</b> extends along one of the courses and alternates between being located (a) behind loops formed from yarn <b>138</b> and (b) in front of loops formed from yarn <b>138</b>. In effect, inlaid strand <b>132</b> weaves through the structure formed by knit element <b>131</b>. Although yarn <b>138</b> forms each of the courses in this configuration, additional yarns may form one or more of the courses or may form a portion of one or more of the courses.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Another example of a suitable configuration for a portion of knitted component <b>130</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. In this configuration, knit element <b>131</b> includes yarn <b>138</b> and another yarn <b>139</b>. Yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> are plated and cooperatively form a plurality of intermeshed loops defining multiple horizontal courses and vertical wales. That is, yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> run parallel to each other. As with the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, inlaid strand <b>132</b> extends along one of the courses and alternates between being located (a) behind loops formed from yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> and (b) in front of loops formed from yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b>. An advantage of this configuration is that the properties of each of yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> may be present in this area of knitted component <b>130</b>. For example, yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> may have different colors, with the color of yarn <b>138</b> being primarily present on a face of the various stitches in knit element <b>131</b> and the color of yarn <b>139</b> being primarily present on a reverse of the various stitches in knit element <b>131</b>. As another example, yarn <b>139</b> may be formed from a yarn that is softer and more comfortable against the foot than yarn <b>138</b>, with yarn <b>138</b> being primarily present on first surface <b>136</b> and yarn <b>139</b> being primarily present on second surface <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Continuing with the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, yarn <b>138</b> may be formed from at least one of a thermoset polymer material and natural fibers (e.g., cotton, wool, silk), whereas yarn <b>139</b> may be formed from a thermoplastic polymer material. In general, a thermoplastic polymer material melts when heated and returns to a solid state when cooled. More particularly, the thermoplastic polymer material transitions from a solid state to a softened or liquid state when subjected to sufficient heat, and then the thermoplastic polymer material transitions from the softened or liquid state to the solid state when sufficiently cooled. As such, thermoplastic polymer materials are often used to join two objects or elements together. In this case, yarn <b>139</b> may be utilized to join (a) one portion of yarn <b>138</b> to another portion of yarn <b>138</b>, (b) yarn <b>138</b> and inlaid strand <b>132</b> to each other, or (c) another element (e.g., logos, trademarks, and placards with care instructions and material information) to knitted component <b>130</b>, for example. As such, yarn <b>139</b> may be considered a fusible yarn given that it may be used to fuse or otherwise join portions of knitted component <b>130</b> to each other. Moreover, yarn <b>138</b> may be considered a non-fusible yarn given that it is not formed from materials that are generally capable of fusing or otherwise joining portions of knitted component <b>130</b> to each other. That is, yarn <b>138</b> may be a non-fusible yarn, whereas yarn <b>139</b> may be a fusible yarn. In some configurations of knitted component <b>130</b>, yarn <b>138</b> (i.e., the non-fusible yarn) may be substantially formed from a thermoset polyester material and yarn <b>139</b> (i.e., the fusible yarn) may be at least partially formed from a thermoplastic polyester material.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The use of plated yarns may impart advantages to knitted component <b>130</b>. When yarn <b>139</b> is heated and fused to yarn <b>138</b> and inlaid strand <b>132</b>, this process may have the effect of stiffening or rigidifying the structure of knitted component <b>130</b>. Moreover, joining (a) one portion of yarn <b>138</b> to another portion of yarn <b>138</b> or (b) yarn <b>138</b> and inlaid strand <b>132</b> to each other has the effect of securing or locking the relative positions of yarn <b>138</b> and inlaid strand <b>132</b>, thereby imparting stretch-resistance and stiffness. That is, portions of yarn <b>138</b> may not slide relative to each other when fused with yarn <b>139</b>, thereby preventing warping or permanent stretching of knit element <b>131</b> due to relative movement of the knit structure. Another benefit relates to limiting unraveling if a portion of knitted component <b>130</b> becomes damaged or one of yarns <b>138</b> is severed. Also, inlaid strand <b>132</b> may not slide relative to knit element <b>131</b>, thereby preventing portions of inlaid strand <b>132</b> from pulling outward from knit element <b>131</b>. Accordingly, areas of knitted component <b>130</b> may benefit from the use of both fusible and non-fusible yarns within knit element <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Another aspect of knitted component <b>130</b> relates to a padded area adjacent to ankle opening <b>121</b> and extending at least partially around ankle opening <b>121</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, the padded area is formed by two overlapping and at least partially coextensive knitted layers <b>140</b>, which may be formed of unitary knit construction, and a plurality of floating yarns <b>141</b> extending between knitted layers <b>140</b>. Although the sides or edges of knitted layers <b>140</b> are secured to each other, a central area is generally unsecured. As such, knitted layers <b>140</b> effectively form a tube or tubular structure, and floating yarns <b>141</b> may be located or inlaid between knitted layers <b>140</b> to pass through the tubular structure. That is, floating yarns <b>141</b> extend between knitted layers <b>140</b>, are generally parallel to surfaces of knitted layers <b>140</b>, and also pass through and fill an interior volume between knitted layers <b>140</b>. Whereas a majority of knit element <b>131</b> is formed from yarns that are mechanically-manipulated to form intermeshed loops, floating yarns <b>141</b> are generally free or otherwise inlaid within the interior volume between knitted layers <b>140</b>. As an additional matter, knitted layers <b>140</b> may be at least partially formed from a stretch yarn. An advantage of this configuration is that knitted layers will effectively compress floating yarns <b>141</b> and provide an elastic aspect to the padded area adjacent to ankle opening <b>121</b>. That is, the stretch yarn within knitted layers <b>140</b> may be placed in tension during the knitting process that forms knitted component <b>130</b>, thereby inducing knitted layers <b>140</b> to compress floating yarns <b>141</b>. Although the degree of stretch in the stretch yarn may vary significantly, the stretch yarn may stretch at least one-hundred percent in many configurations of knitted component <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The presence of floating yarns <b>141</b> imparts a compressible aspect to the padded area adjacent to ankle opening <b>121</b>, thereby enhancing the comfort of footwear <b>100</b> in the area of ankle opening <b>121</b>. Many conventional articles of footwear incorporate polymer foam elements or other compressible materials into areas adjacent to an ankle opening. In contrast with the conventional articles of footwear, portions of knitted component <b>130</b> formed of unitary knit construction with a remainder of knitted component <b>130</b> may form the padded area adjacent to ankle opening <b>121</b>. In further configurations of footwear <b>100</b>, similar padded areas may be located in other areas of knitted component <b>130</b>. For example, similar padded areas may be located as an area corresponding with joints between the metatarsals and proximal phalanges to impart padding to the joints. As an alternative, a terry loop structure may also be utilized to impart some degree of padding to areas of upper <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Based upon the above discussion, knitted component <b>130</b> imparts a variety of features to upper <b>120</b>. Moreover, knitted component <b>130</b> provides a variety of advantages over some conventional upper configurations. As noted above, conventional footwear uppers are formed from multiple material elements (e.g., textiles, polymer foam, polymer sheets, leather, synthetic leather) that are joined through stitching or bonding, for example. As the number and type of material elements incorporated into an upper increases, the time and expense associated with transporting, stocking, cutting, and joining the material elements may also increase. Waste material from cutting and stitching processes also accumulates to a greater degree as the number and type of material elements incorporated into the upper increases. Moreover, uppers with a greater number of material elements may be more difficult to recycle than uppers formed from fewer types and numbers of material elements. By decreasing the number of material elements utilized in the upper, therefore, waste may be decreased while increasing the manufacturing efficiency and recyclability of the upper. To this end, knitted component <b>130</b> forms a substantial portion of upper <b>120</b>, while increasing manufacturing efficiency, decreasing waste, and simplifying recyclability.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Further Knitted Component Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A knitted component <b>150</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> and may be utilized in place of knitted component <b>130</b> in footwear <b>100</b>. The primary elements of knitted component <b>150</b> are a knit element <b>151</b> and an inlaid strand <b>152</b>. Knit element <b>151</b> is formed from at least one yarn that is manipulated (e.g., with a knitting machine) to form a plurality of intermeshed loops that define a variety of courses and wales. That is, knit element <b>151</b> has the structure of a knit textile. Inlaid strand <b>152</b> extends through knit element <b>151</b> and passes between the various loops within knit element <b>151</b>. Although inlaid strand <b>152</b> generally extends along courses within knit element <b>151</b>, inlaid strand <b>152</b> may also extend along wales within knit element <b>151</b>. As with inlaid strand <b>132</b>, inlaid strand <b>152</b> imparts stretch-resistance and, when incorporated into footwear <b>100</b>, operates in connection with lace <b>122</b> to enhance the fit of footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Knit element <b>151</b> has a generally U-shaped configuration that is outlined by a perimeter edge <b>153</b>, a pair of heel edges <b>154</b>, and an inner edge <b>155</b>. In addition, knit element <b>151</b> has a first surface <b>156</b> and an opposite second surface <b>157</b>. First surface <b>156</b> may form a portion of the exterior surface of upper <b>120</b>, whereas second surface <b>157</b> may form a portion of the interior surface of upper <b>120</b>, thereby defining at least a portion of the void within upper <b>120</b>. In many configurations, knit element <b>151</b> may have the configuration of a single textile layer in the area of inlaid strand <b>152</b>. That is, knit element <b>151</b> may be a single textile layer between surfaces <b>156</b> and <b>157</b>. In addition, knit element <b>151</b> defines a plurality of lace apertures <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Similar to inlaid strand <b>132</b>, inlaid strand <b>152</b> repeatedly extends from perimeter edge <b>153</b> toward inner edge <b>155</b>, at least partially around one of lace apertures <b>158</b>, and back to perimeter edge <b>153</b>. In contrast with inlaid strand <b>132</b>, however, some portions of inlaid strand <b>152</b> angle rearwards and extend to heel edges <b>154</b>. More particularly, the portions of inlaid strand <b>152</b> associated with the most rearward lace apertures <b>158</b> extend from one of heel edges <b>154</b> toward inner edge <b>155</b>, at least partially around one of the most rearward lace apertures <b>158</b>, and back to one of heel edges <b>154</b>. Additionally, some portions of inlaid strand <b>152</b> do not extend around one of lace apertures <b>158</b>. More particularly, some sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> extend toward inner edge <b>155</b>, turn in areas adjacent to one of lace apertures <b>158</b>, and extend back toward perimeter edge <b>153</b> or one of heel edges <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Although knit element <b>151</b> may be formed in a variety of ways, courses of the knit structure generally extend in the same direction as inlaid strands <b>152</b>. In areas adjacent to lace apertures <b>158</b>, however, inlaid strand <b>152</b> may also extend along wales within knit element <b>151</b>. More particularly, sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> that are parallel to inner edge <b>155</b> may extend along wales.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In comparison with knit element <b>151</b>, inlaid strand <b>152</b> may exhibit greater stretch-resistance. That is, inlaid strand <b>152</b> may stretch less than knit element <b>151</b>. Given that numerous sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> extend through knit element <b>151</b>, inlaid strand <b>152</b> may impart stretch-resistance to portions of upper <b>120</b> between the throat area and the lower area. Moreover, placing tension upon lace <b>122</b> may impart tension to inlaid strand <b>152</b>, thereby inducing the portions of upper <b>120</b> between the throat area and the lower area to lay against the foot. Additionally, given that numerous sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> extend toward heel edges <b>154</b>, inlaid strand <b>152</b> may impart stretch-resistance to portions of upper <b>120</b> in heel region <b>103</b>. Moreover, placing tension upon lace <b>122</b> may induce the portions of upper <b>120</b> in heel region <b>103</b> to lay against the foot. As such, inlaid strand <b>152</b> operates in connection with lace <b>122</b> to enhance the fit of footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Knit element <b>151</b> may incorporate any of the various types of yarn discussed above for knit element <b>131</b>. Inlaid strand <b>152</b> may also be formed from any of the configurations and materials discussed above for inlaid strand <b>132</b>. Additionally, the various knit configurations discussed relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> may also be utilized in knitted component <b>150</b>. More particularly, knit element <b>151</b> may have areas formed from a single yarn, two plated yarns, or a fusible yarn and a non-fusible yarn, with the fusible yarn joining (a) one portion of the non-fusible yarn to another portion of the non-fusible yarn or (b) the non-fusible yarn and inlaid strand <b>152</b> to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A majority of knit element <b>131</b> is depicted as being formed from a relatively untextured textile and a common or single knit structure (e.g., a tubular knit structure). In contrast, knit element <b>151</b> incorporates various knit structures that impart specific properties and advantages to different areas of knitted component <b>150</b>. Moreover, by combining various yarn types with the knit structures, knitted component <b>150</b> may impart a range of properties to different areas of upper <b>120</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a schematic view of knitted component <b>150</b> shows various zones <b>160</b>-<b>169</b> having different knit structures, each of which will now be discussed in detail. For purposes of reference, each of regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> and sides <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to provide a reference for the locations of knit zones <b>160</b>-<b>169</b> when knitted component <b>150</b> is incorporated into footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A tubular knit zone <b>160</b> extends along a majority of perimeter edge <b>153</b> and through each of regions <b>101</b>-<b>103</b> on both of sides <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>. Tubular knit zone <b>160</b> also extends inward from each of sides <b>104</b> and <b>105</b> in an area approximately located at an interface regions <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> to form a forward portion of inner edge <b>155</b>. Tubular knit zone <b>160</b> forms a relatively untextured knit configuration. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, a cross-section through an area of tubular knit zone <b>160</b> is depicted, and surfaces <b>156</b> and <b>157</b> are substantially parallel to each other. Tubular knit zone <b>160</b> imparts various advantages to footwear <b>100</b>. For example, tubular knit zone <b>160</b> has greater durability and wear resistance than some other knit structures, especially when the yarn in tubular knit zone <b>160</b> is plated with a fusible yarn. In addition, the relatively untextured aspect of tubular knit zone <b>160</b> simplifies the process of joining strobel sock <b>125</b> to perimeter edge <b>153</b>. That is, the portion of tubular knit zone <b>160</b> located along perimeter edge <b>153</b> facilitates the lasting process of footwear <b>100</b>. For purposes of reference, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> depicts a loop diagram of the manner in which tubular knit zone <b>160</b> is formed with a knitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Two stretch knit zones <b>161</b> extend inward from perimeter edge <b>153</b> and are located to correspond with a location of joints between metatarsals and proximal phalanges of the foot. That is, stretch zones extend inward from perimeter edge in the area approximately located at the interface regions <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. As with tubular knit zone <b>160</b>, the knit configuration in stretch knit zones <b>161</b> may be a tubular knit structure. In contrast with tubular knit zone <b>160</b>, however, stretch knit zones <b>161</b> are formed from a stretch yarn that imparts stretch and recovery properties to knitted component <b>150</b>. Although the degree of stretch in the stretch yarn may vary significantly, the stretch yarn may stretch at least one-hundred percent in many configurations of knitted component <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A tubular and interlock tuck knit zone <b>162</b> extends along a portion of inner edge <b>155</b> in at least midfoot region <b>102</b>. Tubular and interlock tuck knit zone <b>162</b> also forms a relatively untextured knit configuration, but has greater thickness than tubular knit zone <b>160</b>. In cross-section, tubular and interlock tuck knit zone <b>162</b> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, in which surfaces <b>156</b> and <b>157</b> are substantially parallel to each other. Tubular and interlock tuck knit zone <b>162</b> imparts various advantages to footwear <b>100</b>. For example, tubular and interlock tuck knit zone <b>162</b> has greater stretch resistance than some other knit structures, which is beneficial when lace <b>122</b> places tubular and interlock tuck knit zone <b>162</b> and inlaid strands <b>152</b> in tension.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A 1&#xd7;1 mesh knit zone <b>163</b> is located in forefoot region <b>101</b> and spaced inward from perimeter edge <b>153</b>. 1&#xd7;1 mesh knit zone has a C-shaped configuration and forms a plurality of apertures that extend through knit element <b>151</b> and from first surface <b>156</b> to second surface <b>157</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>. The apertures enhance the permeability of knitted component <b>150</b>, which allows air to enter upper <b>120</b> and moisture to escape from upper <b>120</b>.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Knitting Machine and Feeder Configurations</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although knitting may be performed by hand, the commercial manufacture of knitted components is generally performed by knitting machines. An example of a knitting machine <b>200</b> that is suitable for producing either of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Knitting machine <b>200</b> has a configuration of a V-bed flat knitting machine for purposes of example, but either of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> or aspects of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> may be produced on other types of knitting machines.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Knitting machine <b>200</b> includes two needle beds <b>201</b> that are angled with respect to each other, thereby forming a V-bed. Each of needle beds <b>201</b> include a plurality of individual needles <b>202</b> that lay on a common plane. That is, needles <b>202</b> from one needle bed <b>201</b> lay on a first plane, and needles <b>202</b> from the other needle bed <b>201</b> lay on a second plane. The first plane and the second plane (i.e., the two needle beds <b>201</b>) are angled relative to each other and meet to form an intersection that extends along a majority of a width of knitting machine <b>200</b>. As described in greater detail below, needles <b>202</b> each have a first position where they are retracted and a second position where they are extended. In the first position, needles <b>202</b> are spaced from the intersection where the first plane and the second plane meet. In the second position, however, needles <b>202</b> pass through the intersection where the first plane and the second plane meet.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A pair of rails <b>203</b> extend above and parallel to the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b> and provide attachment points for multiple standard feeders <b>204</b> and combination feeders <b>220</b>. Each rail <b>203</b> has two sides, each of which accommodates either one standard feeder <b>204</b> or one combination feeder <b>220</b>. As such, knitting machine <b>200</b> may include a total of four feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b>. As depicted, the forward-most rail <b>203</b> includes one combination feeder <b>220</b> and one standard feeder <b>204</b> on opposite sides, and the rearward-most rail <b>203</b> includes two standard feeders <b>204</b> on opposite sides. Although two rails <b>203</b> are depicted, further configurations of knitting machine <b>200</b> may incorporate additional rails <b>203</b> to provide attachment points for more feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Due to the action of a carriage <b>205</b>, feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> move along rails <b>203</b> and needle beds <b>201</b>, thereby supplying yarns to needles <b>202</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a yarn <b>206</b> is provided to combination feeder <b>220</b> by a spool <b>207</b>. More particularly, yarn <b>206</b> extends from spool <b>207</b> to various yarn guides <b>208</b>, a yarn take-back spring <b>209</b>, and a yarn tensioner <b>210</b> before entering combination feeder <b>220</b>. Although not depicted, additional spools <b>207</b> may be utilized to provide yarns to feeders <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Standard feeders <b>204</b> are conventionally-utilized for a V-bed flat knitting machine, such as knitting machine <b>200</b>. That is, existing knitting machines incorporate standard feeders <b>204</b>. Each standard feeder <b>204</b> has the ability to supply a yarn that needles <b>202</b> manipulate to knit, tuck, and float. As a comparison, combination feeder <b>220</b> has the ability to supply a yarn (e.g., yarn <b>206</b>) that needles <b>202</b> knit, tuck, and float, and combination feeder <b>220</b> has the ability to inlay the yarn. Moreover, combination feeder <b>220</b> has the ability to inlay a variety of different strands (e.g., filament, thread, rope, webbing, cable, chain, or yarn). Accordingly, combination feeder <b>220</b> exhibits greater versatility than each standard feeder <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As noted above, combination feeder <b>220</b> may be utilized when inlaying a yarn or other strand, in addition to knitting, tucking, and floating the yarn. Conventional knitting machines, which do not incorporate combination feeder <b>220</b>, may also inlay a yarn. More particularly, conventional knitting machines that are supplied with an inlay feeder may also inlay a yarn. A conventional inlay feeder for a V-bed flat knitting machine includes two components that operate in conjunction to inlay the yarn. Each of the components of the inlay feeder are secured to separate attachment points on two adjacent rails, thereby occupying two attachment points. Whereas an individual standard feeder <b>204</b> only occupies one attachment point, two attachment points are generally occupied when an inlay feeder is utilized to inlay a yarn into a knitted component. Moreover, whereas combination feeder <b>220</b> only occupies one attachment point, a conventional inlay feeder occupies two attachment points.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Given that knitting machine <b>200</b> includes two rails <b>203</b>, four attachment points are available in knitting machine <b>200</b>. If a conventional inlay feeder were utilized with knitting machine <b>200</b>, only two attachment points would be available for standard feeders <b>204</b>. When using combination feeder <b>220</b> in knitting machine <b>200</b>, however, three attachment points are available for standard feeders <b>204</b>. Accordingly, combination feeder <b>220</b> may be utilized when inlaying a yarn or other strand, and combination feeder <b>220</b> has an advantage of only occupying one attachment point.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Combination feeder <b>220</b> is depicted individually in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref> as including a carrier <b>230</b>, a feeder arm <b>240</b>, and a pair of actuation members <b>250</b>. Although a majority of combination feeder <b>220</b> may be formed from metal materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, titanium), portions of carrier <b>230</b>, feeder arm <b>240</b>, and actuation members <b>250</b> may be formed from polymer, ceramic, or composite materials, for example. As discussed above, combination feeder <b>220</b> may be utilized when inlaying a yarn or other strand, in addition to knitting, tucking, and floating a yarn. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> specifically, a portion of yarn <b>206</b> is depicted to illustrate the manner in which a strand interfaces with combination feeder <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Carrier <b>230</b> has a generally rectangular configuration and includes a first cover member <b>231</b> and a second cover member <b>232</b> that are joined by four bolts <b>233</b>. Cover members <b>231</b> and <b>232</b> define an interior cavity in which portions of feeder arm <b>240</b> and actuation members <b>250</b> are located. Carrier <b>230</b> also includes an attachment element <b>234</b> that extends outward from first cover member <b>231</b> for securing feeder <b>220</b> to one of rails <b>203</b>. Although the configuration of attachment element <b>234</b> may vary, attachment element <b>234</b> is depicted as including two spaced protruding areas that form a dovetail shape, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. A reverse dovetail configuration on one of rails <b>203</b> may extend into the dovetail shape of attachment element <b>234</b> to effectively join combination feeder <b>220</b> to knitting machine <b>200</b>. It should also be noted that second cover member <b>234</b> forms a centrally-located and elongate slot <b>235</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Feeder arm <b>240</b> has a generally elongate configuration that extends through carrier <b>230</b> (i.e., the cavity between cover members <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>) and outward from a lower side of carrier <b>230</b>. In addition to other elements, feeder arm <b>240</b> includes an actuation bolt <b>241</b>, a spring <b>242</b>, a pulley <b>243</b>, a loop <b>244</b>, and a dispensing area <b>245</b>. Actuation bolt <b>241</b> extends outward from feeder arm <b>240</b> and is located within the cavity between cover members <b>231</b> and <b>232</b>. One side of actuation bolt <b>241</b> is also located within slot <b>235</b> in second cover member <b>232</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Spring <b>242</b> is secured to carrier <b>230</b> and feeder arm <b>240</b>. More particularly, one end of spring <b>242</b> is secured to carrier <b>230</b>, and an opposite end of spring <b>242</b> is secured to feeder arm <b>240</b>. Pulley <b>243</b>, loop <b>244</b>, and dispensing area <b>245</b> are present on feeder arm <b>240</b> to interface with yarn <b>206</b> or another strand. Moreover, pulley <b>243</b>, loop <b>244</b>, and dispensing area <b>245</b> are configured to ensure that yarn <b>206</b> or another strand smoothly passes through combination feeder <b>220</b>, thereby being reliably-supplied to needles <b>202</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, yarn <b>206</b> extends around pulley <b>243</b>, through loop <b>244</b>, and into dispensing area <b>245</b>. In addition, yarn <b>206</b> extends out of a dispensing tip <b>246</b>, which is an end region of feeder arm <b>240</b>, to then supply needles <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Each of actuation members <b>250</b> includes an arm <b>251</b> and a plate <b>252</b>. In many configurations of actuation members <b>250</b>, each arm <b>251</b> is formed as a one-piece element with one of plates <b>252</b>. Whereas arms <b>251</b> are located outside of carrier <b>230</b> and at an upper side of carrier <b>230</b>, plates <b>252</b> are located within carrier <b>250</b>. Each of arms <b>251</b> has an elongate configuration that defines an outside end <b>253</b> and an opposite inside end <b>254</b>, and arms <b>251</b> are positioned to define a space <b>255</b> between both of inside ends <b>254</b>. That is, arms <b>251</b> are spaced from each other. Plates <b>252</b> have a generally planar configuration. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, each of plates <b>252</b> define an aperture <b>256</b> with an inclined edge <b>257</b>. Moreover, actuation bolt <b>241</b> of feeder arm <b>240</b> extends into each aperture <b>256</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The configuration of combination feeder <b>220</b> discussed above provides a structure that facilitates a translating movement of feeder arm <b>240</b>. As discussed in greater detail below, the translating movement of feeder arm <b>240</b> selectively positions dispensing tip <b>246</b> at a location that is above or below the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. That is, dispensing tip <b>246</b> has the ability to reciprocate through the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. An advantage to the translating movement of feeder arm <b>240</b> is that combination feeder <b>220</b> (a) supplies yarn <b>206</b> for knitting, tucking, and floating when dispensing tip <b>246</b> is positioned above the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b> and (b) supplies yarn <b>206</b> or another strand for inlaying when dispensing tip <b>246</b> is positioned below the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. Moreover, feeder arm <b>240</b> reciprocates between the two positions depending upon the manner in which combination feeder <b>220</b> is being utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In reciprocating through the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>, feeder arm <b>240</b> translates from a retracted position to an extended position. When in the retracted position, dispensing tip <b>246</b> is positioned above the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. When in the extended position, dispensing tip <b>246</b> is positioned below the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. Dispensing tip <b>246</b> is closer to carrier <b>230</b> when feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the retracted position than when feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the extended position. Similarly, dispensing tip <b>246</b> is further from carrier <b>230</b> when feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the extended position than when feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the retracted position. In other words, dispensing tip <b>246</b> moves away from carrier <b>230</b> when in the extended position, and dispensing tip <b>246</b> moves closer to carrier <b>230</b> when in the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">For purposes of reference in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20C</figref>, as well as further figures discussed later, an arrow <b>221</b> is positioned adjacent to dispensing area <b>245</b>. When arrow <b>221</b> points upward or toward carrier <b>230</b>, feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the retracted position. When arrow <b>221</b> points downward or away from carrier <b>230</b>, feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the extended position. Accordingly, by referencing the position of arrow <b>221</b>, the position of feeder arm <b>240</b> may be readily ascertained.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The natural state of feeder arm <b>240</b> is the retracted position. That is, when no significant forces are applied to areas of combination feeder <b>220</b>, feeder arm remains in the retracted position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref>, for example, no forces or other influences are shown as interacting with combination feeder <b>220</b>, and feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the retracted position. The translating movement of feeder arm <b>240</b> may occur, however, when a sufficient force is applied to one of arms <b>251</b>. More particularly, the translating movement of feeder arm <b>240</b> occurs when a sufficient force is applied to one of outside ends <b>253</b> and is directed toward space <b>255</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, a force <b>222</b> is acting upon one of outside ends <b>253</b> and is directed toward space <b>255</b>, and feeder arm <b>240</b> is shown as having translated to the extended position. Upon removal of force <b>222</b>, however, feeder arm <b>240</b> will return to the retracted position. It should also be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref> depicts force <b>222</b> as acting upon inside ends <b>254</b> and being directed outward, and feeder arm <b>240</b> remains in the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As discussed above, feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> move along rails <b>203</b> and needle beds <b>201</b> due to the action of carriage <b>205</b>. More particularly, a drive bolt within carriage <b>205</b> contacts feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> to push feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> along needle beds <b>201</b>. With respect to combination feeder <b>220</b>, the drive bolt may either contact one of outside ends <b>253</b> or one of inside ends <b>254</b> to push combination feeder <b>220</b> along needle beds <b>201</b>. When the drive bolt contacts one of outside ends <b>253</b>, feeder arm <b>240</b> translates to the extended position and dispensing tip <b>246</b> passes below the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. When the drive bolt contacts one of inside ends <b>254</b> and is located within space <b>255</b>, feeder arm <b>240</b> remains in the retracted position and dispensing tip <b>246</b> is above the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. Accordingly, the area where carriage <b>205</b> contacts combination feeder <b>220</b> determines whether feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the retracted position or the extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The mechanical action of combination feeder <b>220</b> will now be discussed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-20B</figref> depict combination feeder <b>220</b> with first cover member <b>231</b> removed, thereby exposing the elements within the cavity in carrier <b>230</b>. By comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>, the manner in which force <b>222</b> induces feeder arm <b>240</b> to translate may be apparent. When force <b>222</b> acts upon one of outside ends <b>253</b>, one of actuation members <b>250</b> slides in a direction that is perpendicular to the length of feeder arm <b>240</b>. That is, one of actuation members <b>250</b> slides horizontally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-20B</figref>. The movement of one of actuation members <b>250</b> causes actuation bolt <b>241</b> to engage one of inclined edges <b>257</b>. Given that the movement of actuation members <b>250</b> is constrained to the direction that is perpendicular to the length of feeder arm <b>240</b>, actuation bolt <b>241</b> rolls or slides against inclined edge <b>257</b> and induces feeder arm <b>240</b> to translate to the extended position. Upon removal of force <b>222</b>, spring <b>242</b> pulls feeder arm <b>240</b> from the extended position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Based upon the above discussion, combination feeder <b>220</b> reciprocates between the retracted position and the extended position depending upon whether a yarn or other strand is being utilized for knitting, tucking, or floating or being utilized for inlaying. Combination feeder <b>220</b> has a configuration wherein the application of force <b>222</b> induces feeder arm <b>240</b> to translate from the retracted position to the extended position, and removal of force <b>222</b> induces feeder arm <b>240</b> to translate from the extended position to the retracted position. That is, combination feeder <b>220</b> has a configuration wherein the application and removal of force <b>222</b> causes feeder arm <b>240</b> to reciprocate between opposite sides of needle beds <b>201</b>. In general, outside ends <b>253</b> may be considered actuation areas, which induce movement in feeder arm <b>240</b>. In further configurations of combination feeder <b>220</b>, the actuation areas may be in other locations or may respond to other stimuli to induce movement in feeder arm <b>240</b>. For example, the actuation areas may be electrical inputs coupled to servomechanisms that control movement of feeder arm <b>240</b>. Accordingly, combination feeder <b>220</b> may have a variety of structures that operate in the same general manner as the configuration discussed above.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Knitting Process</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The manner in which knitting machine <b>200</b> operates to manufacture a knitted component will now be discussed in detail. Moreover, the following discussion will demonstrate the operation of combination feeder <b>220</b> during a knitting process. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, a portion of knitting machine <b>200</b> that includes various needles <b>202</b>, rail <b>203</b>, standard feeder <b>204</b>, and combination feeder <b>220</b> is depicted. Whereas combination feeder <b>220</b> is secured to a front side of rail <b>203</b>, standard feeder <b>204</b> is secured to a rear side of rail <b>203</b>. Yarn <b>206</b> passes through combination feeder <b>220</b>, and an end of yarn <b>206</b> extends outward from dispensing tip <b>246</b>. Although yarn <b>206</b> is depicted, any other strand (e.g., filament, thread, rope, webbing, cable, chain, or yarn) may pass through combination feeder <b>220</b>. Another yarn <b>211</b> passes through standard feeder <b>204</b> and forms a portion of a knitted component <b>260</b>, and loops of yarn <b>211</b> forming an uppermost course in knitted component <b>260</b> are held by hooks located on ends of needles <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The knitting process discussed herein relates to the formation of knitted component <b>260</b>, which may be any knitted component, including knitted components that are similar to knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b>. For purposes of the discussion, only a relatively small section of knitted component <b>260</b> is shown in the figures in order to permit the knit structure to be illustrated. Moreover, the scale or proportions of the various elements of knitting machine <b>200</b> and knitted component <b>260</b> may be enhanced to better illustrate the knitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Standard feeder <b>204</b> includes a feeder arm <b>212</b> with a dispensing tip <b>213</b>. Feeder arm <b>212</b> is angled to position dispensing tip <b>213</b> in a location that is (a) centered between needles <b>202</b> and (b) above an intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> depicts a schematic cross-sectional view of this configuration. Note that needles <b>202</b> lay on different planes, which are angled relative to each other. That is, needles <b>202</b> from needle beds <b>201</b> lay on the different planes. Needles <b>202</b> each have a first position and a second position. In the first position, which is shown in solid line, needles <b>202</b> are retracted. In the second position, which is shown in dashed line, needles <b>202</b> are extended. In the first position, needles <b>202</b> are spaced from the intersection where the planes upon which needle beds <b>201</b> lay meet. In the second position, however, needles <b>202</b> are extended and pass through the intersection where the planes upon which needle beds <b>201</b> meet. That is, needles <b>202</b> cross each other when extended to the second position. It should be noted that dispensing tip <b>213</b> is located above the intersection of the planes. In this position, dispensing tip <b>213</b> supplies yarn <b>211</b> to needles <b>202</b> for purposes of knitting, tucking, and floating.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Combination feeder <b>220</b> is in the retracted position, as evidenced by the orientation of arrow <b>221</b>. Feeder arm <b>240</b> extends downward from carrier <b>230</b> to position dispensing tip <b>246</b> in a location that is (a) centered between needles <b>202</b> and (b) above the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> depicts a schematic cross-sectional view of this configuration. Note that dispensing tip <b>246</b> is positioned in the same relative location as dispensing tip <b>213</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, standard feeder <b>204</b> moves along rail <b>203</b> and a new course is formed in knitted component <b>260</b> from yarn <b>211</b>. More particularly, needles <b>202</b> pulled sections of yarn <b>211</b> through the loops of the prior course, thereby forming the new course. Accordingly, courses may be added to knitted component <b>260</b> by moving standard feeder <b>204</b> along needles <b>202</b>, thereby permitting needles <b>202</b> to manipulate yarn <b>211</b> and form additional loops from yarn <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Continuing with the knitting process, feeder arm <b>240</b> now translates from the retracted position to the extended position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>. In the extended position, feeder arm <b>240</b> extends downward from carrier <b>230</b> to position dispensing tip <b>246</b> in a location that is (a) centered between needles <b>202</b> and (b) below the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> depicts a schematic cross-sectional view of this configuration. Note that dispensing tip <b>246</b> is positioned below the location of dispensing tip <b>246</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> due to the translating movement of feeder arm <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref>, combination feeder <b>220</b> moves along rail <b>203</b> and yarn <b>206</b> is placed between loops of knitted component <b>260</b>. That is, yarn <b>206</b> is located in front of some loops and behind other loops in an alternating pattern. Moreover, yarn <b>206</b> is placed in front of loops being held by needles <b>202</b> from one needle bed <b>201</b>, and yarn <b>206</b> is placed behind loops being held by needles <b>202</b> from the other needle bed <b>201</b>. Note that feeder arm <b>240</b> remains in the extended position in order to lay yarn <b>206</b> in the area below the intersection of needle beds <b>201</b>. This effectively places yarn <b>206</b> within the course recently formed by standard feeder <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In order to complete inlaying yarn <b>206</b> into knitted component <b>260</b>, standard feeder <b>204</b> moves along rail <b>203</b> to form a new course from yarn <b>211</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21E</figref>. By forming the new course, yarn <b>206</b> is effectively knit within or otherwise integrated into the structure of knitted component <b>260</b>. At this stage, feeder arm <b>240</b> may also translate from the extended position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21D and 21E</figref> show separate movements of feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> along rail <b>203</b>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21D</figref> shows a first movement of combination feeder <b>220</b> along rail <b>203</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21E</figref> shows a second and subsequent movement of standard feeder <b>204</b> along rail <b>203</b>. In many knitting processes, feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> may effectively move simultaneously to inlay yarn <b>206</b> and form a new course from yarn <b>211</b>. Combination feeder <b>220</b>, however, moves ahead or in front of standard feeder <b>204</b> in order to position yarn <b>206</b> prior to the formation of the new course from yarn <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The general knitting process outlined in the above discussion provides an example of the manner in which inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> may be located in knit elements <b>131</b> and <b>151</b>. More particularly, knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> may be formed by utilizing combination feeder <b>220</b> to effectively insert inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> into knit elements <b>131</b>. Given the reciprocating action of feeder arm <b>240</b>, inlaid strands may be located within a previously formed course prior to the formation of a new course.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Continuing with the knitting process, feeder arm <b>240</b> now translates from the retracted position to the extended position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21F</figref>. Combination feeder <b>220</b> then moves along rail <b>203</b> and yarn <b>206</b> is placed between loops of knitted component <b>260</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21G</figref>. This effectively places yarn <b>206</b> within the course formed by standard feeder <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21E</figref>. In order to complete inlaying yarn <b>206</b> into knitted component <b>260</b>, standard feeder <b>204</b> moves along rail <b>203</b> to form a new course from yarn <b>211</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21H</figref>. By forming the new course, yarn <b>206</b> is effectively knit within or otherwise integrated into the structure of knitted component <b>260</b>. At this stage, feeder arm <b>240</b> may also translate from the extended position to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21H</figref>, yarn <b>206</b> forms a loop <b>214</b> between the two inlaid sections. In the discussion of knitted component <b>130</b> above, it was noted that inlaid strand <b>132</b> repeatedly exits knit element <b>131</b> at perimeter edge <b>133</b> and then re-enters knit element <b>131</b> at another location of perimeter edge <b>133</b>, thereby forming loops along perimeter edge <b>133</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Loop <b>214</b> is formed in a similar manner. That is, loop <b>214</b> is formed where yarn <b>206</b> exits the knit structure of knitted component <b>260</b> and then re-enters the knit structure.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As discussed above, standard feeder <b>204</b> has the ability to supply a yarn (e.g., yarn <b>211</b>) that needles <b>202</b> manipulate to knit, tuck, and float. Combination feeder <b>220</b>, however, has the ability to supply a yarn (e.g., yarn <b>206</b>) that needles <b>202</b> knit, tuck, or float, as well as inlaying the yarn. The above discussion of the knitting process describes the manner in which combination feeder <b>220</b> inlays a yarn while in the extended position. Combination feeder <b>220</b> may also supply the yarn for knitting, tucking, and floating while in the retracted position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21I</figref>, for example, combination feeder <b>220</b> moves along rail <b>203</b> while in the retracted position and forms a course of knitted component <b>260</b> while in the retracted position. Accordingly, by reciprocating feeder arm <b>240</b> between the retracted position and the extended position, combination feeder <b>220</b> may supply yarn <b>206</b> for purposes of knitting, tucking, floating, and inlaying. An advantage to combination feeder <b>220</b> relates, therefore, to its versatility in supplying a yarn that may be utilized for a greater number of functions than standard feeder <b>204</b></p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The ability of combination feeder <b>220</b> to supply yarn for knitting, tucking, floating, and inlaying is based upon the reciprocating action of feeder arm <b>240</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, dispensing tips <b>213</b> and <b>246</b> are at identical positions relative to needles <b>220</b>. As such, both feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> may supply a yarn for knitting, tucking, and floating. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, dispensing tip <b>246</b> is at a different position. As such, combination feeder <b>220</b> may supply a yarn or other strand for inlaying. An advantage to combination feeder <b>220</b> relates, therefore, to its versatility in supplying a yarn that may be utilized for knitting, tucking, floating, and inlaying.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Further Knitting Process Considerations</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Additional aspects relating to the knitting process will now be discussed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the upper course of knitted component <b>260</b> is formed from both of yarns <b>206</b> and <b>211</b>. More particularly, a left side of the course is formed from yarn <b>211</b>, whereas a right side of the course is formed from yarn <b>206</b>. Additionally, yarn <b>206</b> is inlaid into the left side of the course. In order to form this configuration, standard feeder <b>204</b> may initially form the left side of the course from yarn <b>211</b>. Combination feeder <b>220</b> then lays yarn <b>206</b> into the right side of the course while feeder arm <b>240</b> is in the extended position. Subsequently, feeder arm <b>240</b> moves from the extended position to the retracted position and forms the right side of the course. Accordingly, combination feeder may inlay a yarn into one portion of a course and then supply the yarn for purposes of knitting a remainder of the course.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> depicts a configuration of knitting machine <b>200</b> that includes four combination feeders <b>220</b>. As discussed above, combination feeder <b>220</b> has the ability to supply a yarn (e.g., yarn <b>206</b>) for knitting, tucking, floating, and inlaying. Given this versatility, standard feeders <b>204</b> may be replaced by multiple combination feeders <b>220</b> in knitting machine <b>200</b> or in various conventional knitting machines.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> depicts a configuration of knitted component <b>130</b> where two yarns <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> are plated to form knit element <b>131</b>, and inlaid strand <b>132</b> extends through knit element <b>131</b>. The general knitting process discussed above may also be utilized to form this configuration. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, knitting machine <b>200</b> includes multiple standard feeders <b>204</b>, and two of standard feeders <b>204</b> may be utilized to form knit element <b>131</b>, with combination feeder <b>220</b> depositing inlaid strand <b>132</b>. Accordingly, the knitting process discussed above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21I</figref> may be modified by adding another standard feeder <b>204</b> to supply an additional yarn. In configurations where yarn <b>138</b> is a non-fusible yarn and yarn <b>139</b> is a fusible yarn, knitted component <b>130</b> may be heated following the knitting process to fuse knitted component <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The portion of knitted component <b>260</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-21I</figref> has the configuration of a rib knit textile with regular and uninterrupted courses and wales. That is, the portion of knitted component <b>260</b> does not have, for example, any mesh areas similar to mesh knit zones <b>163</b>-<b>165</b> or mock mesh areas similar to mock mesh knit zones <b>166</b> and <b>167</b>. In order to form mesh knit zones <b>163</b>-<b>165</b> in either of knitted components <b>150</b> and <b>260</b>, a combination of a racked needle bed <b>201</b> and a transfer of stitch loops from front to back needle beds <b>201</b> and back to front needle beds <b>201</b> in different racked positions is utilized. In order to form mock mesh areas similar to mock mesh knit zones <b>166</b> and <b>167</b>, a combination of a racked needle bed and a transfer of stitch loops from front to back needle beds <b>201</b> is utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Courses within a knitted component are generally parallel to each other. Given that a majority of inlaid strand <b>152</b> follows courses within knit element <b>151</b>, it may be suggested that the various sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> should be parallel to each other. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for example, some sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> extend between edges <b>153</b> and <b>155</b> and other sections extend between edges <b>153</b> and <b>154</b>. Various sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> are, therefore, not parallel. The concept of forming darts may be utilized to impart this non-parallel configuration to inlaid strand <b>152</b>. More particularly, courses of varying length may be formed to effectively insert wedge-shaped structures between sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b>. The structure formed in knitted component <b>150</b>, therefore, where various sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> are not parallel, may be accomplished through the process of darting.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Although a majority of inlaid strands <b>152</b> follow courses within knit element <b>151</b>, some sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> follow wales. For example, sections of inlaid strand <b>152</b> that are adjacent to and parallel to inner edge <b>155</b> follow wales. This may be accomplished by first inserting a section of inlaid strand <b>152</b> along a portion of a course and to a point where inlaid strand <b>152</b> is intended to follow a wale. Inlaid strand <b>152</b> is then kicked back to move inlaid strand <b>152</b> out of the way, and the course is finished. As the subsequent course is being formed, inlay strand <b>152</b> is again kicked back to move inlaid strand <b>152</b> out of the way at the point where inlaid strand <b>152</b> is intended to follow the wale, and the course is finished. This process is repeated until inlaid strand <b>152</b> extends a desired distance along the wale. Similar concepts may be utilized for portions of inlaid strand <b>132</b> in knitted component <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">A variety of procedures may be utilized to reduce relative movement between (a) knit element <b>131</b> and inlaid strand <b>132</b> or (b) knit element <b>151</b> and inlaid strand <b>152</b>. That is, various procedures may be utilized to prevent inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> from slipping, moving through, pulling out, or otherwise becoming displaced from knit elements <b>131</b> and <b>151</b>. For example, fusing one or more yarns that are formed from thermoplastic polymer materials to inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> may prevent movement between inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> and knit elements <b>131</b> and <b>151</b>. Additionally, inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> may be fixed to knit elements <b>131</b> and <b>151</b> when periodically fed to knitting needles as a tuck element. That is, inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> may be formed into tuck stitches at points along their lengths (e.g., once per centimeter) in order to secure inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b> to knit elements <b>131</b> and <b>151</b> and prevent movement of inlaid strands <b>132</b> and <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Following the knitting process described above, various operations may be performed to enhance the properties of either of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b>. For example, a water-repellant coating or other water-resisting treatment may be applied to limit the ability of the knit structures to absorb and retain water. As another example, knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> may be steamed to improve loft and induce fusing of the yarns. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, yarn <b>138</b> may be a non-fusible yarn and yarn <b>139</b> may be a fusible yarn. When steamed, yarn <b>139</b> may melt or otherwise soften so as to transition from a solid state to a softened or liquid state, and then transition from the softened or liquid state to the solid state when sufficiently cooled. As such, yarn <b>139</b> may be utilized to join (a) one portion of yarn <b>138</b> to another portion of yarn <b>138</b>, (b) yarn <b>138</b> and inlaid strand <b>132</b> to each other, or (c) another element (e.g., logos, trademarks, and placards with care instructions and material information) to knitted component <b>130</b>, for example. Accordingly, a steaming process may be utilized to induce fusing of yarns in knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Although procedures associated with the steaming process may vary greatly, one method involves pinning one of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> to a jig during steaming. An advantage of pinning one of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> to a jig is that the resulting dimensions of specific areas of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> may be controlled. For example, pins on the jig may be located to hold areas corresponding to perimeter edge <b>133</b> of knitted component <b>130</b>. By retaining specific dimensions for perimeter edge <b>133</b>, perimeter edge <b>133</b> will have the correct length for a portion of the lasting process that joins upper <b>120</b> to sole structure <b>110</b>. Accordingly, pinning areas of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> may be utilized to control the resulting dimensions of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> following the steaming process.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The knitting process described above for forming knitted component <b>260</b> may be applied to the manufacture of knitted components <b>130</b> and <b>150</b> for footwear <b>100</b>. The knitting process may also be applied to the manufacture of a variety of other knitted components. That is, knitting processes utilizing one or more combination feeders or other reciprocating feeders may be utilized to form a variety of knitted components. As such, knitted components formed through the knitting process described above, or a similar process, may also be utilized in other types of apparel (e.g., shirts, pants, socks, jackets, undergarments), athletic equipment (e.g., golf bags, baseball and football gloves, soccer ball restriction structures), containers (e.g., backpacks, bags), and upholstery for furniture (e.g., chairs, couches, car seats). The knitted components may also be utilized in bed coverings (e.g., sheets, blankets), table coverings, towels, flags, tents, sails, and parachutes. The knitted components may be utilized as technical textiles for industrial purposes, including structures for automotive and aerospace applications, filter materials, medical textiles (e.g. bandages, swabs, implants), geotextiles for reinforcing embankments, agrotextiles for crop protection, and industrial apparel that protects or insulates against heat and radiation. Accordingly, knitted components formed through the knitting process described above, or a similar process, may be incorporated into a variety of products for both personal and industrial purposes.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Knitted Components with Tongues</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In footwear <b>100</b>, tongue <b>124</b> is separate from knitted component <b>130</b> and joined to knitted component <b>130</b>, possibly with stitching, an adhesive, or thermal bonding. Moreover, tongue <b>124</b> is discussed as being added to knitted component <b>130</b> following the knitting process. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, however, knitted component <b>130</b> includes a knitted tongue <b>170</b> that is formed of unitary knit construction with knit element <b>131</b>. That is, knit element <b>131</b> and tongue <b>170</b> are formed as a one-piece element through a knitting process, which will be discussed in greater detail below. Although tongue <b>124</b> or another tongue may be joined to knit element <b>131</b> after knitted component <b>130</b> is formed, tongue <b>170</b> or another knitted tongue may be formed during the knitting process and of unitary knit construction with a portion of knitted component <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Tongue <b>170</b> is located within a throat area (i.e., where lace <b>122</b> and lace apertures <b>123</b> are located) of knitted component <b>130</b> and extends along the throat area. When incorporated into footwear <b>100</b>, for example, tongue <b>170</b> extends from a forward portion of the throat area to ankle opening <b>121</b>. As with knit element <b>131</b>, tongue <b>170</b> is depicted as being formed from a relatively untextured textile and a common or single knit structure. Tongue <b>170</b> is also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> as having a generally planar configuration. Examples of knit structures that may impart this configuration for tongue <b>170</b>, as well as knit element <b>131</b>, are any of the various knit structures in knit zones <b>160</b>-<b>162</b> discussed above. In further configurations, however, apertures may be formed in areas of tongue <b>170</b> by utilizing the knit structures of mesh knit zones <b>163</b>-<b>165</b>, indentations may be formed in areas of tongue <b>170</b> by utilizing the knit structures of mock mesh knit zones <b>166</b> or <b>167</b>, or a combination of apertures and indentations may be formed in areas of tongue <b>170</b> by utilizing the knit structure of hybrid knit zone <b>168</b>. Additionally, areas of tongue <b>170</b> may have a padded aspect when formed to have layers and floating yarns, for example, that are similar to padded zone <b>169</b>. Accordingly, the untextured and planar aspect of tongue <b>170</b> is shown for purposes of example, and various features may be imparted through the use of different knit structures.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, a knitted tongue <b>175</b> is depicted as being formed of unitary knit construction with knit element <b>151</b> of knitted component <b>150</b>. Tongue <b>175</b> has the same general shape as tongue <b>170</b>, but may have a padded aspect with greater thickness. More particularly, tongue <b>175</b> is depicted in FIG. <b>30</b> as including two overlapping and at least partially coextensive knitted layers <b>176</b>, which may be formed of unitary knit construction, and a plurality of yarn loops <b>177</b> located between layers <b>176</b>. Although the sides or edges of layers <b>176</b> are secured or knit to each other, a central area is generally unsecured. As such, layers <b>176</b> effectively form a tube or tubular structure, and yarn loops <b>177</b> are located between and extend outward from one of layers <b>176</b>. In effect, yarn loops <b>177</b> fill an interior volume between layers <b>176</b> and impart a compressible or padded aspect to tongue <b>175</b>. It should also be noted that each of layers <b>176</b> and yarn loops <b>177</b> may be formed of unitary knit construction during the knitting process that forms knitted component <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Another knitted component <b>180</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> as including a knit element <b>181</b>, an inlaid strand <b>182</b>, and a knitted tongue <b>183</b>. With the exception of the presence of tongue <b>183</b>, knitted component <b>180</b> has a general structure of a knitted component disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2010/0154256 to Dua, which is incorporated herein by reference. Tongue <b>183</b> is formed of unitary knit construction with knit element <b>181</b> and includes various knit structures. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, for example, peripheral areas of tongue <b>183</b> exhibit an untextured configuration that may have any of the various knit structures in knit zones <b>160</b>-<b>162</b>. At least two areas of tongue <b>183</b> incorporate apertures and may have any of the various knit structures in mesh knit zones <b>163</b>-<b>165</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, a central area of tongue <b>183</b> has a compressible or padded aspect that includes two overlapping and at least partially coextensive knitted layers <b>184</b>, which may be formed of unitary knit construction, and a plurality of floating yarns <b>185</b> extending between layers <b>184</b>. The central area of tongue <b>183</b> may exhibit, therefore, the knit structure of padded zone <b>169</b>. Although the sides or edges of layers <b>184</b> are secured to each other, a central area is generally unsecured. As such, layers <b>184</b> effectively form a tube or tubular structure, and floating yarns <b>185</b> may be located or inlaid between layers <b>184</b> to pass through the tubular structure. That is, floating yarns <b>185</b> extend between layers <b>184</b>, are generally parallel to surfaces of layers <b>184</b>, and also pass through and fill an interior volume between layers <b>184</b>. Whereas a majority of tongue <b>183</b> is formed from yarns that are mechanically-manipulated to form intermeshed loops, floating yarns <b>185</b> are generally free or otherwise inlaid within the interior volume between layers <b>184</b>. As an additional matter, layers <b>184</b> may be at least partially formed from a stretch yarn to impart the advantages discussed above for knitted layers <b>140</b> and floating yarns <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Tongue <b>183</b> provides an example of the manner in which various knit structures may be utilized. As discussed above, the peripheral areas of tongue <b>183</b> exhibit an untextured configuration, two areas of tongue <b>183</b> incorporate apertures, and the central area of tongue <b>183</b> includes knitted layers <b>184</b> and floating yarns <b>185</b> to provide a compressible or padded aspect. Mock mesh knit structures and hybrid knit structures may also be utilized. Accordingly, various knit structures may be incorporated into tongue <b>183</b> or any other knitted tongue (e.g., tongues <b>170</b> and <b>175</b>) to impart different properties or aesthetics.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Tongue <b>170</b> is secured to a forward portion of the throat area of knit element <b>131</b>. That is, tongue <b>170</b> is joined through knitting to knit element <b>131</b> in a portion of the throat area that is closest to forefoot region <b>101</b> in footwear <b>100</b>. Each of tongues <b>175</b> and <b>183</b> are respectively secured or knit to a similar position in knitted components <b>150</b> and <b>180</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref>, however, a knitted tongue <b>190</b> is secured along a length of the throat area of a configuration of knitted component <b>131</b> that does not include inlaid strand <b>132</b> or lace apertures <b>123</b>. More particularly, edges of tongue <b>190</b> are knit to an area of knit element <b>131</b> that is spaced outward from inner edge <b>135</b>. Accordingly, any of the configurations of tongues <b>170</b>, <b>175</b>, <b>183</b>, and <b>190</b> may be secured (e.g., through unitary knit construction) to various locations in the throat areas of knitted components <b>130</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Advantages of constructing tongue <b>170</b> during the knitting process and of unitary knit construction are more efficient manufacture and common properties. More particularly, manufacturing efficiency may be increased by forming more of knitted component <b>130</b> during the knitting process and eliminating various steps (e.g., making a separate tongue, securing the tongue) that are often performed manually. Tongue <b>170</b> and knit element <b>131</b> may also have common properties when formed from the same yarn (or type of yarn) or with similar knit structures. For example, utilizing the same yarn in both of tongue <b>170</b> and knit element <b>131</b> imparts similar durability, strength, stretch, wear-resistance, biodegradability, thermal, and hydrophobic properties. In addition to physical properties, utilizing the same yarn in both of tongue <b>170</b> and knit element <b>131</b> may impart common aesthetic or tactile properties, such as color, sheen, and texture. Utilizing the same knit structures in both of tongue <b>170</b> and knit element <b>131</b> may also impart common physical properties and aesthetic properties. These advantages may also be present when at least a portion of knit element <b>131</b> and at least a portion of tongue <b>170</b> are formed from a common yarn (or type of yarn) or with common knit structures.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Tongue <b>175</b> includes yarn loops <b>177</b> between layers <b>176</b>, and tongue <b>183</b> includes floating yarns <b>185</b> between layers <b>184</b>. A benefit of yarn loops <b>177</b> and floating yarns <b>185</b> is that compressible or padded areas are formed. In addition to yarn loops <b>177</b> and floating yarns <b>185</b>, other types of free yarn sections may be utilized. For purposes of the present application, &#x201c;free yarn sections&#x201d; or variants thereof is defined as segments or portions of yarns that are not directly forming intermeshed loops (e.g., that define courses and wales) of a knit structure, such as floating yarns, inlaid yarns, terry loops, ends of yarns, and cut segments of yarn, for example. Moreover, it should be noted that free yarn sections may be one portion of an individual yarn, with other portions of the yarn forming intermeshed loops of the knit structure, For example, the portion of a yarn forming terry loops (e.g., the free yarn sections) may be between portions of the yarn forming intermeshed loops of a knit structure. As an alternative to free yarn sections, foam materials or other types of compressible materials may be utilized within either of tongues <b>175</b> and <b>183</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As a final matter, although tongue <b>170</b> is disclosed in combination with knitted component <b>130</b>, tongue <b>170</b> may also be utilized with knitted components <b>150</b> and <b>180</b>, as well as other knitted components. Similarly, tongues <b>175</b>, <b>183</b>, and <b>190</b> may be utilized with any of knitted components <b>130</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>180</b>, as well as other knitted components. The combinations disclosed herein are, therefore, for purposes of example and other combinations may also be utilized. Moreover, the specific configurations of tongues <b>170</b>, <b>175</b>, <b>183</b>, and <b>190</b> are also meant to provide examples and may also vary significantly. For example, the position of layers <b>184</b> and floating yarns <b>185</b> may be enlarged, moved to a periphery of tongue <b>183</b>, or removed from tongue <b>183</b>.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The manner in which knitting machine <b>200</b> operates to manufacture a knitted component with a tongue will now be discussed in detail. Moreover, the following discussion will demonstrate the manner in which knit element <b>131</b> and tongue <b>170</b> are formed of unitary knit construction, but similar processes may be utilized for other knitted components and tongues. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A-36G</figref>, a portion of knitting machine <b>200</b> is schematically-depicted as including needle beds <b>201</b>, one rail <b>203</b>, one standard feeder <b>204</b>, and one combination feeder <b>220</b>. It should be understood that although knitted component <b>130</b> is formed between needle beds <b>201</b>, knitted component <b>130</b> is shown adjacent to needle beds <b>201</b> to (a) be more visible during discussion of the knitting process and (b) show the position of portions of knitted component <b>130</b> relative to each other and needle beds <b>201</b>. Also, although one rail <b>203</b>, one standard feeder <b>204</b>, and one combination feeder <b>220</b> are depicted, additional rails <b>203</b>, standard feeders <b>204</b>, and combination feeders <b>220</b> may be utilized. Accordingly, the general structure of knitting machine <b>200</b> is simplified for purposes of explaining the knitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Initially, a portion of tongue <b>170</b> is formed by knitting machine <b>200</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>. In forming this portion of tongue <b>170</b>, standard feeder <b>204</b> repeatedly moves along rail <b>203</b> and various courses are formed from at least yarn <b>211</b>. More particularly, needles <b>202</b> pull sections of yarn <b>211</b> through loops of a prior course, thereby forming another course. This action continues until tongue <b>170</b> is substantially formed, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>. It should be noted at this stage that although tongue <b>170</b> is depicted as being formed from one yarn <b>211</b>, additional yarns may be incorporated into tongue <b>170</b> from further standard feeders <b>204</b>. For example, a fusible yarn may be incorporated into at least the upper or final course of tongue <b>170</b> to assist with ensuring that tongue <b>170</b> is properly joined or knitted with knit element <b>131</b>. Additionally, at least the final course of tongue <b>170</b> may include cross-tuck stitches with a relatively tight or dense knit to ensure that tongue <b>170</b> remains properly positioned on needles <b>202</b> during later stages of the knitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Knitting machine <b>200</b> now begins the process of forming knit element <b>131</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref>, in accordance with the knitting process discussed previously. As the knitting process continues, combination feeder <b>220</b> inlays yarn <b>206</b> to form inlaid strand <b>132</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36D</figref>, also in accordance with the knitting process discussed previously. Through a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36C and 36D</figref>, tongue <b>170</b> remains stationary relative to needle beds <b>201</b>, but knit element <b>131</b> moves downward and may overlap tongue <b>170</b> as successive courses are formed in knit element <b>131</b>. This continues until a course is formed that is intended to join tongue <b>170</b> to knit element <b>131</b>. More particularly, tongue <b>170</b> remains stationary relative to needle beds <b>201</b> as portions of knitted component <b>131</b> are formed. At the point depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36E</figref>, however, a course is formed that (a) extends across the final course of tongue <b>170</b>, which includes the cross-tuck stitches, and (b) joins with the final course of tongue <b>170</b>. In effect, this course joins tongue <b>170</b> to knit element <b>131</b>. At this stage, therefore, knit element <b>131</b> and tongue <b>170</b> are effectively formed of unitary knit construction.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Once tongue <b>170</b> is joined to knit element <b>131</b>, knitting machine <b>200</b> continues the process of forming courses, thereby forming more of knit element <b>131</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36F</figref>. Given that tongue <b>170</b> is now joined to knit element <b>131</b>, tongue <b>170</b> moves downward with knit element <b>131</b> as successive courses are formed, as seen through a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36E and 36F</figref>. Moving forward, knitting machine <b>200</b> continues the process of forming courses in knit element <b>131</b> until knitted component <b>130</b> is substantially formed, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Now that the general process associated with forming knitted component <b>130</b> to include tongue <b>170</b> is presented, additional aspects of the knitting process will be discussed. As noted above, a fusible yarn may be incorporated into at least the final course of tongue <b>170</b> to assist with ensuring that tongue <b>170</b> is properly joined or knitted with knit element <b>131</b>. In some knitting processes, the yarn forming the final course of tongue <b>170</b> is cut. By incorporating the fusible yarn into the final course of tongue <b>170</b>, the knit structure at the interface of tongue <b>170</b> with knit element <b>131</b> may be strengthened. That is, melting of the fusible yarn will fuse or otherwise join the sections of yarn at the interface and prevent unraveling of the cut yarn.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Also as noted above, at least the final course of tongue <b>170</b> may include cross-tuck stitches with a relatively tight or dense knit to ensure that tongue <b>170</b> remains properly positioned on needles <b>202</b> during later stages of the knitting process. During a majority of the knitting process that forms knit element <b>131</b>, tongue <b>170</b> remains stationary relative to needle beds <b>201</b>. Movement, vibration, or other actions of knitting machine <b>200</b> may, however, dislodge portions of the final course from needles <b>202</b>, thereby forming dropped stitches. By forming cross-tuck stitches with a relatively tight or dense knit, fewer dropped stitches are formed. Moreover, if dropped stitches are formed, the fusible yarn within the final course will fuse or otherwise join the dropped stitches within the knit structure.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Once tongue <b>170</b> is knit, various needles <b>202</b> hold tongue <b>170</b> in position while knit element <b>131</b> is formed. In effect, the needles <b>202</b> that hold tongue <b>170</b> are unavailable for further knitting until tongue <b>170</b> is joined with knit element <b>131</b>. As a result, only those needles <b>202</b> located beyond the edges (i.e., to the right and to the left) of tongue <b>170</b> are available for forming knit element <b>131</b>. The final course of tongue <b>170</b> should, therefore, have equal or less width than the distance between opposite sides of inner edge <b>135</b> in the area where tongue <b>170</b> is joined with knit element <b>131</b>. In other words, the design of knitted component <b>130</b> should account for (a) the length of the final course of tongue <b>170</b> and (b) the number of needles <b>202</b> that are reserved for holding tongue <b>170</b> while knit element <b>131</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the knitting process discussed above, both tongue <b>170</b> and knit element <b>131</b> are formed from yarn <b>211</b>. Whereas tongue <b>170</b> remains stationary relative to needle beds <b>201</b> through a portion of the knitting process, portions of knit element <b>131</b> move downward as successive courses are formed. Given that a segment of yarn <b>211</b> may extend from the final course of tongue <b>170</b> to the first course of knit element <b>131</b> (i.e., the bottom edges of knit element <b>131</b>), this segment of yarn should have sufficient length to account for the downward movement of the first course of knit element <b>131</b>. In effect, a comparison of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36C-36E</figref>, demonstrates that the first course of knit element <b>131</b> moves downward and away from the final course of tongue <b>170</b> as knit element <b>131</b> is formed. Accordingly, if a segment of yarn <b>211</b> extends from the final course of tongue <b>170</b> to the first course of knit element <b>131</b>, this segment of yarn should have sufficient length to account for the growing distance between the final course of tongue <b>170</b> and the first course of knit element <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Although various methods may be employed to account for the growing distance between the final course of tongue <b>170</b> and the first course of knit element <b>131</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> depicts an expansion section <b>195</b> as being formed following the formation of tongue <b>170</b>. Expansion section <b>195</b> may then be cast off of needles <b>202</b>. As the distance between the final course of tongue <b>170</b> and the first course of knit element <b>131</b> increases, expansion section <b>195</b> may unravel and lengthen. That is, unraveling of expansion section <b>195</b> may be used to effectively lengthen the section of yarn <b>211</b> between the final course of tongue <b>170</b> and the first course of knit element <b>131</b>. In some configurations, expansion section <b>195</b> may be formed as a jersey fabric to facilitate unraveling.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The various <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A-36G</figref> show knitted component <b>130</b> as being formed independently. In some knitting processes, however, a waste element is knit prior to forming knitted component <b>130</b>. The waste element engages various rollers that provide a downward force upon knitted component <b>130</b>. The downward force ensures that courses move away from needles <b>202</b> as later courses are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Based upon the above discussion, knit element <b>131</b> and tongue <b>170</b> may be formed of unitary knit construction through a single knitting process. As described, tongue <b>170</b> is formed first and remains stationary upon needle beds <b>201</b> as knit element <b>131</b> is formed. After a course is formed that joins knit element <b>131</b> and tongue <b>170</b>, knit element <b>131</b> and tongue <b>170</b> move downward together as further portions of knit element <b>131</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Sequential Alterations</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Knitting machine <b>200</b> includes, among other elements, a knitting mechanism <b>270</b>, a pattern <b>280</b>, and a computing device <b>290</b>, as schematically-depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Knitting mechanism <b>270</b> includes many of the mechanical components of knitting machine <b>200</b> (e.g., needles <b>202</b>, feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b>, carriage <b>205</b>) that mechanically-manipulate yarns <b>206</b> and <b>211</b> to form a knitted component (e.g., knitted component <b>130</b>). Pattern <b>280</b> includes data on the knitted component, including the yarns that are utilized for each stitch, the type of knit structures formed by each stitch, and the specific needles <b>202</b> and feeders <b>204</b> and <b>220</b> that are used for each stitch, for example. The operation of knitting machine <b>200</b> is governed by computing device <b>290</b>, which reads data from pattern <b>280</b> and directs the corresponding operation of knitting mechanism <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Multiple and substantially identical knitted components may be formed by knitting machine <b>200</b>. More particularly, computing device <b>290</b> may repeatedly read pattern <b>280</b> and direct knitting mechanism <b>270</b> to form substantially identical knitted components. In general, therefore, each knitted component that is formed will be substantially identical to other knitted components that are formed based upon a particular pattern <b>280</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-39C</figref>, however, three versions of tongue <b>170</b> are shown. Whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref> depicts tongue <b>170</b> as including a knit structure (e.g., yarns with different colors) with alphanumeric characters that form &#x201c;1 OF 100,&#x201d; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39B and 39C</figref> respectively depict tongue <b>170</b> as including knit structures with alphanumeric characters that form &#x201c;2 OF 100&#x201d; and &#x201c;3 OF 100.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">One manner of accomplishing the sequential alterations of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-39C</figref> is to create multiple patterns. In effect, each of the configurations of tongue <b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-39C</figref> may have a different pattern. As an alternative, an application (e.g., software) run by computing device <b>290</b> may alter pattern <b>280</b> while each successive tongue <b>170</b> is formed to provide sequential alterations. For example, pattern <b>280</b> may include a modifiable field <b>281</b>, which is an area of pattern <b>280</b> that can be updated or changed by computing device <b>290</b>. For purposes of reference, portions of pattern <b>280</b> that correspond with &#x201c;1,&#x201d; &#x201c;2,&#x201d; and &#x201c;3&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A-39C</figref> may be governed by modifiable field <b>281</b>. Computing device <b>290</b> may include a counter, for example, that updates modifiable field <b>281</b> with each successive knitted component that is formed. Accordingly, sequential alterations of pattern <b>280</b> may be automated through the use of an application run by computing device <b>290</b>, thereby rectifying the need for different patterns <b>280</b> for each sequential variation of tongue <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In operation, pattern <b>280</b> with modifiable field <b>281</b> is provided by an operator, designer, or manufacturer, for example. Computing device <b>290</b> may either form a first knitted component with a default setting for modifiable field <b>281</b> or may update modifiable field <b>281</b> according to other instructions or data. As such, for example, tongue <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref> may be knitted with &#x201c;1 OF 100.&#x201d; Computing device <b>290</b> now updates modifiable field <b>281</b> with data representing another alphanumeric character, possibly a sequential alphanumeric character when computing device <b>290</b> includes a counter, and tongue <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</figref> may be knitted with &#x201c;2 OF 100.&#x201d; The procedure repeats and computing device <b>290</b> updates modifiable field <b>281</b> with data representing another alphanumeric character and tongue <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39C</figref> may be knitted with &#x201c;3 OF 100.&#x201d; Accordingly, modifiable field of pattern <b>280</b> may be repeatedly updated with data representing different alphanumeric characters, possibly sequential alphanumeric characters.</p>
