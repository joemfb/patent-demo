<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to power calculations for intraocular lenses (IOLs) and, more particularly, is directed to an apparatus, system and method to develop and use a regression formula incorporating corneal spherical aberrations in order to select a suitable power for an IOL to be implanted into an eye in order to obtain a predetermined refractive outcome.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Intraocular Lenses (IOLs) are frequently used for restoring or improving visual performance, such as after cataract surgery. Because an IOL may be selected from various providers and in differing IOL powers, reliable systems and methods to select IOL powers to achieve the desired refractive outcome for a patient are needed. More particularly, it is most desirable to select an IOL power that will achieve emmetropia after surgery, independent of the refractive state or clinical history of the patient prior to implantation. The term emmetropia, and variations thereof, is used herein to indicate a state of vision in which an object at infinite distance from the subject eye is in sharp focus on the patient's retina.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The IOL power necessary to achieve emmetropia is often calculated using regression theory. One of the first calculations using this approach was the Saunders, Retzlaff, and Kraff formula (SRK). It is a regression formula empirically derived from clinical data to indicate the optimal power for an IOL. The SRK regression formula is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P=A&#x2212;</i>2.5<i>*AXL&#x2212;</i>0.9<i>*K </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">where P is the IOL power, A is the lens constant, AXL is the axial length in millimeters, and K is the average corneal power in diopters. Unfortunately, the SRK regression formula may lead to the indication of a stronger IOL power for long eyes, and a weaker IOL power for short eyes. That is, the SRK typically underestimates the necessary IOL power to obtain emmetropia for short eyes, and overestimates the IOL power necessary for long eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to remedy these shortcomings of SRK, the SRKII regression formula was developed, incorporating further empirical analysis of clinical data. In the SRKII regression, an additional constant is provided to modify the lens constant A from the SRK formula. The modification to A is based on whether the eye is long or short. More particularly, the SRKII formula is:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P=A&#x2212;</i>2.5<i>*AXL&#x2212;</i>0.9<i>*K+F </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">where F is a known constant that is equal to +3 D at less than 20 millimeters of axial length (AXL), +2D at 20 to 20.9 millimeters, +1 D at 21 to 21.9 millimeters, 0 D at 22 to 22.5 millimeters, and &#x2212;0.5 D at greater than 24.5 millimeters. By way of example, if SRK yields an IOL power of +32D, SRKII may yield an IOL power of +35 D (+32 D+3 D=+35 D), if the patient's axial length is less than 20 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An additional regression method, developed in an effort to address the shortcomings of SRK and SRKII, is the SRK/T formula. In the SRK/T method, the empirical calculation based on regressions is used to predict the position of the IOL in the eye after surgery. Once the position is known, the IOL power to implant is calculated by simple paraxial optics, taking into account that the eye can be modeled under this approximation as a two lens system (wherein the two lenses are the cornea and the IOL), focusing on the retina. This approach is based on Fyodorov's theoretical formula.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are numerous formulas for calculating IOL power, such as the aforementioned, and additionally the Haigis, Olsen, and Holladay 1 and 2 models, for example. An in-depth analysis of IOL power calculation methods is provided in Shammas H J (ed.), <i>Intraocular Lens Power Calculations</i>, Thorofare, N.J.; Slack (2004), which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, it is well known that these formulas do not provide accurate predictions to achieve emmetropia for all preoperative refractive states. While a good prediction may be obtained using some of the aforementioned formulas to achieve emmetropia after surgery for emmetropic or close to emmetropic patients prior to surgery, errors arise for those with extreme myopia or hyperopia. These deviations for extreme eyes are not unexpected, because empirical regressions have been back calculated from &#x201c;average,&#x201d; that is, emmetropic or near-emmetropic, eyes. Due to the regression nature of these formulas, even emmetropic eyes with a non common or odd configuration may not be well predicted, since they are not inside of the regression. Thus, it is also possible to have errors in emmetropic eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the variations from the predicted outcome, for the same patient (labeled by patient number), provided by different regression calculation methods. As illustrated, the differences from the predicted outcome for a particular patient using the IOL power recommended by the current regression calculations become more extreme for progressively more myopic eyes (i.e., eyes having an average IOL power predicted of less than 15 D) or hyperopic eyes (i.e., eyes having an average IOL power predicted of greater than 25 D).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The way in which these deviations from the plano refraction are typically approached is by the optimization of the A constant. Thus, possible bias, as well as, surgical technique can be considered by personalizing this constant. This approach can remove small biases, so that the average population can have zero refraction after surgery. However, the standard deviation is not lowered, meaning that IOL power for those non average eyes is still not correctly predicted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Postlasik eyes are a particular example of eyes that are not &#x201c;average,&#x201d; in part because the corneal power of the post-lasik eye has been modified by lasik surgery. A factor that causes difficulty in obtaining an optimal IOL power outcome for the post-lasik eye is the corneal power (K) in the regression formulas above, which is often incorrectly measured by topographers or keratometers after a lasik procedure. Additionally, the decoupling that occurs between the anterior and posterior corneal radius after lasik makes the effective index calculated for &#x201c;average&#x201d; patients inaccurate for postlasik eyes. Thus, it is well known that regression formulas do not typically provide a recommended IOL power that will produce the desired refractive outcome for post-lasik patients and thus regular regression formulas cannot be directly applied to this population without modification.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, it has been widely reported that the lasik procedure may typically generate large amounts of corneal aberrations. This may be inferred because post-lasik patients typically present higher amounts of corneal aberrations, likely due to the lasik surgery, than would an &#x201c;average&#x201d; patient. Such aberrations should not be excluded in IOL power predictions if the desired refractive outcome is to be obtained. Currently, aberrations are not incorporated in regression formulas, which are instead based on paraxial optics as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The importance of corneal aberrations in IOL power calculations has been demonstrated in, for example, Application 61/375,657 filed on Aug. 20, 2010 entitled &#x201c;Apparatus, System and Method for an Empirically-Based, Customized Intraocular Lens Power Calculation&#x201d;. The ray tracing approach is based on the exact solution of Snell's law for all of the rays passing through the ocular surfaces placed in positions defined by biometric measurements. This is a personalized model, where all the patient's biometric measurements are considered, in contrast with regression formulas, which are based on averages. In this customized model, all corneal aberrations can also be introduced, thus making it applicable for both normal and postlasik patients, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the residual refraction (SE meaning spherical equivalent) achieved by different approaches including the SRK/T as well as the ray tracing approach with and without corneal aberrations for 17 normal patients. Because of the small amount of aberrations, the impact on IOL power calculation is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the improvement in IOL power prediction considering corneal aberration (custom+ab) in the ray tracing approach with respect to the current state of the art in IOL power calculation for postlasik eyes (double K) and also with the same ray tracing procedure without considering corneal wavefront aberrations for 12 patients. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> reveals that this improvement is related to the lower standard deviation, so IOL power calculations can be more predictable and accurate when corneal aberrations are considered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> discloses that the improvement in the accuracy of IOL power calculations considering corneal aberrations is mainly due to spherical aberration (z12), since this parameter is highly correlated with the difference in IOL power prediction with and without considering corneal aberrations (CWA_influence).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although ray tracing may be the most theoretically accurate way to calculate IOL power, all inputs must be very accurate, since there is not an A constant to optimize in case of errors or bias. Another disadvantage of this procedure is that is relatively slow, since the area under the radial MTF is used as an optimized parameter and the computation for this parameter takes time.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, the need exists for an apparatus, system and method that provide greater accuracy in predicting optimal IOL power for particular patients using regression theory, for eyes inside and outside the &#x201c;average&#x201d; range.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for the purpose of clarity and brevity, many other elements found in typical implantable optic apparatuses, systems and methods. Those of ordinary skill in the art may thus recognize that other elements and/or steps are desirable and/or required in implementing the present invention. However, because such elements and steps are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, a discussion of such elements and steps is not provided herein. The disclosure herein is directed to all such variations and modifications to the disclosed elements and methods known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention is directed to apparatuses, systems and methods for selecting power for spherical and aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs) to provide a predetermined refractive outcome for &#x201c;average&#x201d; and non-average patients. Aspects of the invention may be understood with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is a graphical representation of a model eye <b>20</b> having cornea <b>22</b>, iris <b>24</b>, retina <b>26</b>, and optical axis <b>28</b>. IOL <b>30</b> is disposed within eye <b>20</b>, and IOL <b>30</b> may include an optic <b>32</b> and one or more haptics <b>34</b> having distal ends <b>38</b>. In general, eye <b>20</b> may have the dimensional parameters illustrated by the geometry shown, including the axial length (AXL) and the anterior chamber depth (ACD) of eye <b>20</b>. Other dimensional parameters that may be included in model eye <b>20</b>, but that are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, include, but are not limited to, the corneal radius (CR), the corneal power (K) and the crystalline lens thickness (LT). Model eye <b>20</b> may also include various other parameters, such as, for example, the refractive indices of the various portions of eye <b>20</b> and/or IOL <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In certain embodiments, distal ends <b>38</b> of haptics <b>34</b> may be disposed within a plane, defined as the lens haptic plane (LHP). In various embodiments, model eye <b>20</b> may include other information indicated by IOL <b>30</b>, such as, for example, an effective principal plane of optic <b>32</b> and/or the location of optic <b>32</b> within eye <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also indicates a coordinate system having a horizontal axis <b>40</b> and a vertical axis <b>42</b>, shown in units of millimeters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a plurality of rays <b>44</b> entering cornea <b>22</b> and IOL <b>30</b>. The plurality of rays <b>44</b> comprises a paraxial ray <b>50</b> that is disposed near the optical axis <b>28</b>, and a marginal ray <b>52</b> that is disposed near the edge of the opening formed by the iris <b>24</b>. The plurality of rays <b>44</b> additionally comprise of an averaged ray <b>51</b> disposed between the paraxial ray <b>50</b> and the marginal ray <b>52</b>, for example, at a height, at the pupil, of 1/{square root over (2)} or &#xbd; times the height of the entrance pupil height. In some embodiments, the eye model may additionally include information regarding an object or source represented by the plurality of rays <b>44</b> entering eye <b>20</b>, such as, for example, the distance of the source or object from eye <b>20</b> and/or the extent of the source or object in units of length.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, shown is a magnified view of the region around retina <b>28</b>, illustrating that rays <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> may come to focus at different points along optical axis <b>28</b>. These points of focus are labeled as marginal focus, best focus, and paraxial focus. As illustrated, the distance between the marginal focus and the best focus may be used to define a longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA). A LSA may result, for example, when the surfaces of IOL <b>30</b> are spherical. Alternatively, one or more of the surfaces of IOL <b>30</b> may comprise an aspheric profile that is configured to reduce or eliminate spherical aberrations produced by IOL <b>30</b> or by portions of eye <b>20</b>, such as corneal spherical aberrations (SA) produced by cornea <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The present invention may be used to select the characteristics of IOL <b>30</b> to be implanted into a subject eye or a class of subject eyes. For example, a class of subject eyes may include subjects of a particular age group or condition (e.g., a class of subjects who have had lasik or a similar procedure). In certain embodiments, measurements from a subject eye, such as the AXL, ACD, CR and/or LT, may be used in conjunction with statistical data and/or an analytical tool to determine the characteristics of IOL <b>30</b>. The characteristics of the IOL resulting from embodiments of the invention are most particularly the power of the IOL, but may additionally include the thickness of the IOL, the asphericity of the IOL, and/or the location of the IOL within the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The present invention also provides a customizable procedure for predicting the optimum IOL power of a specific IOL <b>30</b> for the eye of a particular individual. The apparatus, system and method discussed herein, in formulating the IOL power prediction, take into account biometric parameters of the individual patient and the corneal spherical aberration (SA) of the subject eye. The empirical data discussed herein illustrates that the apparatus, system and method are robust for average patients, as well as for patients having most levels of corneal aberration, including aberrations found in post-lasik patients.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">More particularly, and in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, exemplary methods <b>100</b>/<b>101</b> of selecting of an IOL may include determining the biometric parameters of the eye, such as the AXL, ACD or K, at step <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">These two methods <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> can be used to determine a desired postoperative condition, such as a postoperative refraction and/or spherical aberration. The desired refractive outcome may be, for example, improved distance vision and/or near vision, such as providing the subject sufficient visual acuity to eliminate the need for corrective spectacles or contact lenses for near and/or distant vision. Alternatively, the refractive outcome may be to provide sufficient visual acuity such that normal vision is provided without the use of corrective external lenses, or by the use of corrective spectacles or contact lenses having a correction of less than about 3 diopters, preferably less than about 2 diopters, or more preferably less than about 1 diopter. Most particularly, the present invention has, as a desired refractive outcome, to obtain the desired postoperative outcome with the predicted IOL power.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Both methods <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> further include at step <b>130</b>, a representation of the corneal topography obtained at step <b>120</b>, in the form of at least one corneal aberration. These corneal aberrations can be obtained by the internal process of the apparatus used or by the external process from corneal elevations achieved by corneal topographers. It may also be obtained using an analytical tool, such as using established ray tracing procedures. As used herein, a ray tracing procedure is a procedure that simulates the light propagation and refraction, by means of an exact solution of Snell's law, for all rays passing through an optical system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, for example, a Zemax optical design software simulation may be employed in order to provide the ray tracing modeling discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In accordance with step <b>130</b>, the SA may be obtained pursuant to the light level, such as at the 4 mm pupil. The desired light level may simulate, for example, mesopic light (dusk). The pupil size at dusk is typically about 4 mm, but may vary between at least about 2 mm to about 6 mm or more. The mesopic light pupil size may be selected, by way of example, in part because the about 4 mm pupil is a realistic pupil for cataract patients and allows for the introduction of aberrations that are omitted in paraxial optics (herein defined as the study of optics related to small angles, and small apertures).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">From these results, at step <b>140</b> the IOL power to implant for the patient will be calculated following the standard procedures in cataract surgery. At step <b>160</b> the optimum IOL power is back calculated from each patient from knowledge of the postoperative refraction, obtained at step <b>150</b>. Once this is calculated in the IOL plane, this will be added to the implanted IOL power thus defining the optimum IOL power for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Using the data gained at step <b>160</b>, a multiple regression analysis may be performed across several subjects in order to establish the final formula to use, based on pre-operative data and corneal spherical aberration, to predict the optimum IOL characteristics, such as the optimum IOL power, at step <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The main difference between method <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8) and 101</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is the nature of the regression data. In method <b>100</b>, optimization is based directly on the constants, which weight each of the input parameters obtained at step <b>110</b>, as well as the corneal spherical aberration at step <b>130</b>. On the other hand, corneal spherical aberration is also considered as a parameter in method <b>101</b>. In method <b>101</b>, the other parameter is the IOL power calculated using preoperative data from one of the current paraxial optic formulas calculated at step <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In both methods, the final regression allows for improved prediction of IOL characteristics, such as IOL power, for subsequent average and non-average subjects at step <b>170</b>. Because of the regression nature of these formulas, they can be continuously updated by the addition of new patients, personalizing in this way the different constants involved in the calculation.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once the formula has been established, the procedure <b>200</b>, described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, can be used to predict a desired postoperative condition in a different population than that from which formula <b>170</b> had been obtained, such as a postoperative refraction and/or spherical aberration, at step <b>210</b> by previous knowledge of biometric parameters included in the formula (directly as inputs if method <b>100</b> is applied to develop procedure <b>200</b> or, in the case of method <b>101</b>, the input will be from one of the current paraxial formulas used to compute the IOL power) as well as corneal spherical aberration and the selected refractive stage after the surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Methods of predicting refractive outcomes, such as refractive outcomes correcting &#x201c;average&#x201d; or &#x201c;normal&#x201d; SA in a patient group, based on IOL characteristics is well understood, and embodiments of such analyses are detailed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,609,793, which is herein incorporated by reference. More particularly, corneas of the normal population, which have historically been the subject of regression analysis at step <b>170</b>, show on average positive spherical aberration. However, methods <b>100</b> or <b>101</b> of the present invention, which use a customized regression from step <b>170</b>, allow for optimal IOL characteristic prediction for IOLs to treat corneas having all types of corneal SA including providing optimal IOL characteristic prediction for all types of spherical or aspheric IOLs. For example, patients who had lasik to correct myopia may have an increased value of positive spherical aberration with respect to the average normal population, while those who had corneal refractive surgery to correct hyperopia may present minor spherical aberration as compared to the average. Methods <b>100</b> or <b>101</b> provide optimal IOL characteristics, such as optimal IOL power, based on the customized regression from step <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The interaction between defocus, related to IOL power and spherical aberration has been reported (Applegate R. A., Marsack J. D., Ramos R., Edwin E. J. Sarver, &#x2018;Interaction between aberrations to improve or reduce visual performance&#x2019;, <i>J Cataract Refract Surg </i>2003; 29:1487-1495). Thus, modifying IOL power in accordance with spherical aberration can improve visual performance. The inclusion in the regression of an additional constant, herein referred to as constant D, obtained in the regression of step <b>170</b> accounts for the variation of corneal SA parameter for individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, it has been clinically shown, based on a statistically significant population, that there is a nominal change of 0.7 diopters or more in the A constant in the SRK/T regression analysis as between a spherical IOL having a positive spherical aberration, and an aspherical IOL having a negative spherical aberration. Because the characteristics of the exemplary IOLs were the same in each case, with the exception of the spherical aberration (SA) parameter, it may be inferred from these clinical findings that the change in the A constant for a regression analysis is due to the SA.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The cornea may present SA in different amounts. Thus, for example, the optimal IOL power calculated by the regression from step <b>170</b> may comprise constant D to minimize the spherical equivalent (SE) of the eye. Minimization of the SE is particularly applicable in patients with less than about 1 diopter of corneal astigmatism, where visual performance is still good without the need of a toric IOL. This is an advantageous modeling approach, in part because the SE does not appreciably change due to, for example, the incision in a cataract surgery. On the contrary, corneal astigmatism and power may change pursuant to cataract surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">This procedure can be also extended to toric IOL power calculations. The spherical equivalent of an IOL can be calculated following a similar procedure as <b>200</b>. The toric IOL power may then be obtained by the difference between the paraxial calculation for the flat and steep meridian. Further optimization may be possible considering corneal spherical aberration or other corneal aberrations in those meridians to improve the cylinder prediction as well as the spherical equivalent prediction.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Methods <b>100</b> or <b>101</b> thus account for the non-constant nature of SA in a broader population of surgical subjects, based on the applicability of methods <b>100</b> or <b>101</b> to &#x201c;average&#x201d; eyes, as that term is defined above, and to non-average eyes, such as eyes having significant SA. For a more detailed discussion of the variation of SA across a broad candidate population, see G. H. H. Beiko, et al., &#x201c;Distribution of Corneal Spherical Aberration in a Comprehensive Ophthalmology Practice, and Whether Keratometry Can Predict Aberration Values,&#x201d; <i>J. Cataract Refract. Surg</i>., vol. 33 (2007), pp. 848-858.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">More particularly, the present invention improves the prediction of IOL characteristics, and specifically IOL power, across the broad population that includes average and non-average eyes through the application, at step <b>170</b> of method <b>100</b> or <b>101</b>. The final regression from step <b>170</b> improves predictive accuracy by introducing an additional regression parameter, namely constant D, to account for SA. More particularly, the modification to known regression approaches may be made to improve predictive accuracy, particularly in non-average subjects, as seen in the following example of method <b>101</b>:

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Of course, those skilled in the pertinent arts will appreciate, in light of the discussion herein, that an adjustment constant or constants may also be applied to the Formula prior to or in conjunction with the modification made to account for the SA.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As was described in method <b>100</b>, another possible implementation of this idea is to consider the classical SRK regression model and then adjust all the constants involved in addition to those related to SA as follows:

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">where D is the aforementioned constant applied to the SA, and A, B and C are the remaining constants which may also be optimized in order to improve the IOL power prediction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In order to show the feasibility of taking into account, for example, the z12 Zernike term (SA) in IOL power calculations and the implementation of the invention disclosed herein, the present inventors have empirically derived a SA adjustment from a sampling of 97 average subjects using modifications to the SRK following method <b>100</b> (SRK optimized+z12) and SRK/T regressions (SRK/T modified+z12), following method <b>101</b>, being the SRK/T uses a paraxial formula, and have empirically derived a SA adjustment from a sampling of 29 non-average, postlasik subjects using modifications to the SRK following method <b>100</b> (SRK optimized+z12) and for the SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay 1 and Hoffer Q formulae according method <b>101</b> (referred to be SRK/T+z12, Haigis+z12, Holladay 1+z12 and Hoffer Q+z12 respectively). Of course, those skilled in the art will appreciate that any known regression may be modified, in accordance with the present invention, using empirical data gained from any statistically significant number of subjects, and thus the present invention is not limited to the regressions and subjects or numbers of patients discussed with particularity herein.</p>

In the illustration, the optimum IOL power was known for each patient following implantation, and was compared to the predicted outcome of the SRK/T+z12 formula and/or the SRK optimized+z12 formula (with SA in the OSA convention and at about 4 mm pupil). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show a slight improvement in the error, in Diopters, in the IOL power predicted both by the SRK/T+z12 or SRK optimized+z12 formula as compared to the SRK/T formula, for patients having SA in the &#x201c;average&#x201d; range. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates this slight predictive improvement in the error for the prediction using both the SRK/T+z12 or SRK optimized+z12 formula as compared to the classical SRK/T approach.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For non-average subjects, it is well known that the same formulas as used for normal patients do not provide good results. Varying solutions to improve the calculations for these types of patients have been proposed. These solutions include: calculating the IOL power based on the corneal power prior to, for example, lasik surgery; applying the &#x201c;Double K&#x201d; method; and the aforementioned and other retrospective regression analyses.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Various studies have shown that, of the aforementioned solutions, those based on pre-lasik data are less accurate than regression methods correcting corneal power (see, e.g. Wang L, Hill W E, Koch D D, &#x2018;Evaluation of intraocular lens power prediction methods using the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons Post-Keratorefractive Intraocular Lens Power Calculator&#x2019;, <i>J Cataract Refract Surg. </i>2010 September; 36(9):1466-73, which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety). Thus, method <b>101</b> of the present invention, using the data related to the 29 myopic postlasik patients referenced above (including the IOL power necessary for an emmetropic outcome and the SA, as calculated from measured corneal topography, with no corneal power corrections and using no pre-lasik data), was applied to calculate the IOL power, including at step <b>115</b> the SRK/T, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, and Haigis formulas, which results were used in addition to corneal spherical aberration to generate the corresponding modified regression formulas at step <b>170</b>.
