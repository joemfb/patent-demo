<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to circuits that drive light emitting diodes (LEDs). More specifically, embodiments of the present invention are related to LED driver circuits that including triac dimming circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Light emitting diode (LED) lighting become very popular in the industry due to the many advantages that this technology provides. For example, LED lamps have a longer lifespan, fewer hazards and increased visual appeal when compared to other lighting technologies, such as for example compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) or incandescent lighting technologies. The advantages provided by LED lighting have resulted in LEDs being incorporated into a variety of lighting technologies, televisions, monitors and other applications that may also require dimming.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One known technique that has been used for dimming is the use of a triac circuit for analog LED dimming or phase angle dimming. A triac circuit operates by delaying the beginning of each half-cycle of ac power, which is known as &#x201c;phase control.&#x201d; By delaying the beginning of each half-cycle, the amount of power delivered to the lamp is reduced and the light output of the LED appears dimmed to the human eye. In most applications, the delay in the beginning of each half-cycle is not noticeable to the human eye because the variations in the phase controlled line voltage and the variations of power delivered to the lamp occur so quickly. Although triac dimming circuits work especially well when used to dim incandescent light bulbs since the variations in phase angle with altered ac line voltages are immaterial to incandescent light bulbs, flicker may be noticed when triac circuits are used for dimming LED lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">LED lamps are typically driven with LED drivers having a regulated power supplies, which provide regulated current and voltage to the LED lamps from ac power lines. Unless the regulated power supplies that drive the LED lamps are specially designed to recognize and respond to the voltage signals from triac dimming circuits in a desirable way, the triac dimming circuits are likely to produce non-ideal results, such as flickering, blinking and/or color shifting in the LED lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A difficulty in using triac dimming circuits with LED lamps comes from a characteristic of the triac itself. Specifically, a triac is a semiconductor component that behaves as a controlled ac switch. Thus, the triac behaves as an open switch to an ac voltage until it receives a trigger signal at a control terminal, which causes the switch to close. The switch remains closed as long as the current through the switch is above a value referred to as the holding current. Most incandescent lamps easily draw more than the minimum holding current from the ac power source to enable reliable and consistent operation of a triac. However, the comparably low currents drawn by LEDs from efficient power supplies may not be enough compared to the minimum holding currents required to keep triac switches conducting for reliable operation. As a consequence, conventional power supply controller designs usually rely on the power supply including a dummy load, sometimes called a bleeder circuit, in addition to the LEDs to take enough extra current from the input of the power supply to keep the triac conducting reliably after it is triggered. In general, a conventional bleeder circuit is external from the integrated circuit of the conventional power supply controller. However, use of the conventional bleeder circuit external to the conventional power supply controller requires the use of extra components with associated penalties in cost and efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As will be shown, a new feed forward circuit for an LED driver including triac dimming circuitry is disclosed. The new circuit provides improved reliable performance of an LED driver having a pre-stage triac dimming circuit. As mentioned, typical low cost triac dimming circuits often have poor performance and as a consequence provide imbalanced load currents for each line half-cycle due to the inaccurate half-line cycle conduction phases. An example feed forward circuit in accordance with the teachings of the present invention may be added as a pre-stage, or as a front stage, in a LED driver having a triac dimming circuit. In one example, the circuit improves performance of the LED driver in low or deep dimming conditions and helps prevent shimmering in an LED lamp driven by the LED driver that would otherwise result due to inaccurate conduction phase angle control and imbalanced load currents in successive line half-cycles due to the triac dimming circuit. The disclosed example circuit compensates the feedback signal in a regulated power supply of an LED driver with a feed forward signal responsive to the line conduction angle of the rectified input voltage signal in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that the techniques described herein can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring certain aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Throughout this specification, several terms of art are used. These terms are to take on their ordinary meaning in the art from which they come, unless specifically defined herein or the context of their use would clearly suggest otherwise. For example, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used in the inclusive sense (e.g., as in &#x201c;and/or&#x201d;) unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a general block diagram of an LED driver including a regulated power supply and a triac dimming circuit. As shown, a pre-stage triac circuit <b>104</b> is coupled to the input ac line signal Vac <b>102</b> through a fusible protection device <b>103</b> to control the conduction phase of the sinusoidal input voltage of the input ac line signal Vac <b>102</b> fed to the rectifier bridge <b>108</b> through the electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter <b>106</b>. The triac circuit operates by delaying the beginning of each half-cycle of input ac line signal Vac <b>102</b>, By delaying the beginning of each half-cycle of the input ac line signal vac <b>102</b> with triac circuit <b>104</b>, the amount of power delivered to the lamp is reduced and the light output of the LED appears dimmed. As shown in the depicted example, the rectified voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>110</b>, having a conduction phase angle control in each half line cycle responsive to triac circuit <b>104</b>, is produced by the rectifier bridge <b>108</b>. As shown, the rectified voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>110</b> provides an adjustable average dc voltage to a high frequency regulated power supply <b>140</b> through some required or optional interface devices/blocks such as inductive block <b>105</b> and capacitive filter <b>130</b> and/or other required blocks depending on the application. As illustrated, an example circuit <b>180</b>, which is labeled as &#x201c;Feed Forward Imbalance Corrector&#x201d; in the example, is cascaded at the interface between rectifier bridge <b>108</b> and regulated power supply <b>140</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. In one example, the output voltage Vo <b>170</b> and the regulated output current Io <b>168</b> are coupled to drive the load <b>175</b>, which in one example could be string of one or more LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example schematic shown some additional detail of an LED driver similar to that as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in the illustrated example, an input ac voltage Vac <b>202</b> is coupled through a fusible protection device <b>203</b> to a pre-stage triac dimming circuit <b>204</b>, followed by a common and/or differential mode EMI filter <b>206</b> and the bridge rectifier <b>208</b>. An example circuit <b>280</b>, which is shown in the illustration as &#x201c;Feed Forward Imbalance Corrector,&#x201d; may be cascaded at the interface between the bridge rectifier <b>208</b> and a high frequency regulated power supply <b>240</b>. In the example, bridge rectifier <b>208</b> outputs rectified voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>210</b> between two output terminals of the bridge rectifier <b>208</b> with conduction phase angles in each half line cycle as controlled by the triac circuit <b>204</b> that adjusts the average dc voltage received by the regulated power supply <b>240</b>, which results in the desired dimming. In one example, the example circuit <b>280</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention feeds forward a current (signal) in response to the conduction angle of triac circuit to adjust/compensate the imbalance conduction angles in line half cycles. In one example, an inductive element <b>205</b> is coupled between bridge rectifier <b>208</b> and regulated power supply <b>240</b> as shown to help prevent the impulsive current at the rising/leading edge of the triac conduction angle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The example LED driver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides output dimming with a low cost, triac-based, leading edge phase control dimmer supply with an active damper <b>220</b>, capacitance <b>227</b> and resistance <b>223</b> arranged as shown. Since the LED driver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is coupled to drive a load <b>275</b>, which in one example is a string of one or more LEDs <b>276</b> as shown, the current drawn by the string of LEDs <b>276</b> may be below the holding current of the triac used in the triac dimming circuit <b>204</b>. As mentioned, current drawn by the string of LEDs <b>276</b> being below the holding current may cause the undesirable behavior discussed above, including a limited dimming range and/or flickering as the triac fires inconsistently as a result of the low current drawn by the string of LEDs <b>276</b>. In addition, due to the inrush current charging the input capacitance <b>230</b> and because of the relatively large impedance that the string of LEDs <b>276</b> present to the line, a significant ringing may occur whenever the triac turns on in the triac dimming circuit <b>204</b>. This ringing may cause even more undesirable behavior as the triac current could fall to zero and turn off the string of LEDs <b>276</b>, resulting in flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the depicted example, active damper <b>220</b>, passive bleeder, capacitance <b>227</b> and resistance <b>223</b> are incorporated into the LED driver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to address the undesirable behavior discussed above. It is noted that the inclusion of these circuits results in increased energy dissipation and reduced efficiency when compared to a non-dimming application, in which these circuit elements are not necessary and therefore could simply be omitted. As shown in the example, active damper <b>220</b> is coupled at the input interface of the regulated power supply <b>240</b> and performs as an active damping module consisting of resistor module <b>222</b>, a semiconductor-controlled rectifier (SCR) <b>224</b>, capacitance <b>226</b> and resistance <b>228</b>. This active damping module acts to limit the inrush current that flows to charge capacitor <b>230</b> when the triac turns on by placing resistance <b>228</b> in series for a short time of the conduction period, which in one example is the first 1 ms of conduction. This short period of time is calculated and defined by selecting values for resistor module <b>222</b> and capacitance <b>226</b>. In one example, the charging time of capacitance <b>226</b> to the activation threshold of SCR <b>224</b> is responsive to the values for resistor module <b>222</b> and capacitance <b>226</b>. After this short period of time, such as for example approximately 1 ms, SCR <b>224</b> turns on and shorts resistance <b>228</b>. This allows a larger value damping resistance during current limiting at short interval of starting conduction while keeps the power dissipation on resistance <b>228</b> low afterwards during normal operation. In one example, SCR <b>224</b> is a low current, cost effective device. In the example, capacitance <b>227</b> and resistance <b>223</b> form a passive bleeder circuit that keeps the input current above the triac holding current while the input current corresponding to the driver increases during each ac half-cycle, which helps to prevent the triac from oscillating on and off at the start of each conduction angle period.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Continuing with the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the energy transfer element, transformer T<b>1</b> <b>245</b> has primary winding <b>241</b> coupled to the dc bus and the drain of MOSFET switch S<b>1</b> <b>251</b>. During the on-time of switch S<b>1</b> <b>251</b>, current ramps through the primary winding <b>241</b> storing energy which is then delivered to the output during the switch S<b>1</b> <b>251</b> off time. The clamp circuit <b>246</b> across primary prevents any voltage spike that may happen due to leakage inductance of winding oscillating with the existing parasitic capacitances and may damage the switch S<b>1</b> <b>451</b>. To provide peak line voltage information to the controller <b>255</b>, the incoming rectified ac peak charges capacitance <b>235</b> via diode <b>234</b>. In the example, the peak line voltage information is fed as a current via resistor module <b>236</b> into the pin <b>253</b> of the controller <b>255</b>, which enables controller <b>255</b> to monitor line voltage level. In the example, the current to pin <b>253</b> can also be used to set the input line over-voltage and under voltage protection thresholds. Resistor <b>232</b> provides a discharge path for capacitance <b>235</b> with a time constant much longer than that of the line rectified half-cycle to prevent any line frequency current being modulated at pin <b>253</b> of the controller <b>255</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example, the secondary winding <b>242</b> of transformer T<b>1</b> <b>245</b> is rectified by an ultrafast diode D<b>1</b> <b>262</b> and filtered by a capacitor Co <b>263</b>.

In one example, the first and second input port terminals <b>307</b> and <b>309</b> are coupled to the positive and negative terminals, respectively, of the output of the rectifier bridge to receive V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b>.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As will be illustrated in further detail below, a resistive divider at input port including resistors <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>316</b> provides a scaled signal representative of V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b> to a control terminal of an active device Q<b>1</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b>. As shown in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the resistive divider provides a biasing current for transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> at leading edges of triac conduction angles of V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b> through a resistor <b>318</b>. Thus, the current conducted through transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> is controlled in response or is proportional to the leading edges of triac conduction angles of V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b>. As a result, the net feedback current to the feedback pin of the controller, which may correspond for example to FB pin <b>254</b> of controller <b>255</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is adjusted or reduced in response to the resulting current passing from the collector to the emitter of transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> through resistors <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> to terminal <b>309</b>. Thus, in the illustrated example, the net feedback current to the feedback pin of the controller is adjusted in response to current that flows through transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b>, which is controlled in response to V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. In one example, the adjustments to the feedback current correspondingly adjust the output current of the LED driver in response to the triac conduction angles of V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b>. Since the conduction time of Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> depends on the conduction angle of the rectified input voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>310</b>, the phase by phase output current imbalance at each half line cycle is corrected in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one example, transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> can also be controlled or deactivated through an active device Q<b>2</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>320</b>. In the example, transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> can also be controlled or deactivated by shorting the control terminal or base of transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> to the return terminal <b>309</b> through transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>320</b> whenever voltage on bypass pin BP <b>356</b> exceeds the predetermined rated breakdown level of zener diode <b>340</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another example schematic of an LED driver that includes an example circuit, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> above, as a part of an LED driver in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. As shown, the input port terminals <b>407</b> and <b>409</b> are coupled to receive the rectified voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>410</b>, such as for example V<sub>RECT </sub><b>210</b> provided at the output of bridge rectifier <b>208</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In one example, the input circuitry is similar to that as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Inductance <b>412</b> prevents the impulsive current at the rising/leading edge of the triac conduction angle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in the example, an active damper <b>420</b> at the input interface, which includes resistance <b>422</b>, SCR <b>424</b>, capacitance <b>426</b> and resistance <b>428</b>, is utilized as an active damper that limits the inrush current of charging capacitor <b>430</b> whenever the triac turns on, similar to for example active damper <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In operation, at each conduction period of the triac, for a short time defined by charging time of capacitance <b>426</b> through resistance <b>422</b> to the threshold activation voltage of SCR <b>424</b>, the resistance <b>228</b> is placed in series to the inrush current of charging capacitor <b>430</b>. This short period of time in one example is the first 1 ms of triac conduction. After this short period of time that capacitance <b>426</b> is charged through resistance <b>422</b> to the threshold activation voltage of SCR <b>424</b>, the resistance <b>428</b> gets shorted by SCR <b>424</b> to prevent extra loss and efficiency reduction during normal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similar to the counterpart components described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the capacitance <b>427</b> and resistance <b>423</b> form a passive bleeder circuit, which helps to keep the input current above the triac holding current during each ac half-cycle while the input current corresponding to the driver increases. This also helps to prevent the triac from oscillating on and off at the start of each conduction angle period.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown, the circuit <b>480</b>, labeled in the example as &#x201c;feed forward imbalance corrector,&#x201d; is cascaded at the input interface of the high frequency regulated power supply <b>440</b> of the LED driver. In the example, circuit <b>480</b> includes similar counterpart components to those discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

Thus, the current conducted through transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> is controlled in response or is proportional to V<sub>RECT </sub><b>410</b>. As a result, the net feedback current to FB pin <b>454</b> of controller <b>455</b> is adjusted or reduced by the amount of current passing from the collector to the emitter of transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> through resistors <b>494</b> and <b>492</b>. In operation, the reduced feedback current to FB pin <b>454</b> of controller <b>455</b> lowers the output current Io <b>468</b> in response to the triac conduction angles in the rectified voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>410</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Since the conduction time of Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> is responsive to the conduction angles of the rectified input voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>410</b>, the phase by phase output current imbalance at each half line cycle is corrected in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An active device Q<b>2</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>485</b> deactivates the transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> of the feed forward imbalance corrector circuit <b>480</b> by shorting the control terminal or base of transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> to the return terminal <b>409</b> whenever the voltage on bypass pin BP <b>456</b> exceeds the predetermined/rated breakdown level of zener diode <b>488</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Resistance <b>486</b> and capacitance <b>487</b> at the gate of transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>485</b> provide an RC filter, which filters out noise and helps to prevent unwanted biasing of transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>485</b>, which would deactivate transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> and cancel the desired effect of feed forward imbalance correction in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the depicted example, a transformer T<b>1</b> <b>445</b> having a primary winding <b>441</b> is coupled to receive the rectified dc voltage V<sub>RECT </sub><b>410</b> and the drain of switch S<b>1</b> <b>451</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example, capacitance <b>435</b> via diode <b>434</b> is charged by the rectified ac peak to provide information of peak line voltage to the controller <b>455</b> as a current fed via resistor module <b>436</b> into the pin <b>453</b> of the controller <b>455</b> to monitor line voltage level.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the depicted example, primary side control is provided by utilizing a third winding <b>443</b> of transformer T<b>1</b> <b>445</b> to sense the output voltage indirectly and provide a feedback signal representative of output voltage Vo <b>470</b> on FB pin <b>454</b>, which is referenced to the primary side ground <b>401</b> and eliminates the need for secondary side control feedback components.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows example timing diagrams illustrating some general waveforms at different locations in an LED driver having imbalanced triac controlled dimming circuitry. In the depicted examples, the horizontal axis on all the waveforms includes several line frequency cycles over time t <b>505</b>. As shown, timing diagram <b>510</b> illustrates an input line ac full sinusoidal waveform <b>512</b> versus time t <b>505</b>. Timing diagram <b>520</b> illustrates the waveform of a triac controlled ac input voltage with the dotted portion <b>522</b> not being conducted through the triac. In particular, only the conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>1</b> <b>523</b> during the positive line half-cycle depicted by the solid line <b>524</b> and the conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>2</b> <b>527</b> during negative line half-cycle depicted by the solid line <b>526</b> are applied at the input of the dimming LED driver to the bridge rectifier. Thus, there is a reduced average voltage applied to the input of LED driver to produce a desired level of dimming at the output. However, as mentioned previously, in typical low cost triac dimmers, it is not unusual for there to be some unwanted variations between the conduction angles of the positive and negative line half-cycles <b>524</b> and <b>526</b>, which consequently result in unequal phase by phase conduction angles causing &#x3a6;<b>1</b>&#x2260;&#x3a6;<b>2</b>. For instance, in the example timing diagram <b>520</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, &#x3a6;<b>1</b>&#x3e;&#x3a6;<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Timing diagram <b>530</b> shows the rectified bus voltage at output of bridge rectifier, corresponding to, for example, V<sub>RECT </sub><b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>310</b> and/or <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, respectively. It is noted that the leading edges of conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>1</b> <b>523</b> and conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>2</b> <b>527</b> in the rectified bus voltage provide the biasing current for transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>330</b> and/or Q<b>1</b> <b>490</b> as mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, timing diagram <b>530</b> depicts the conduction period at the positive line half-cycle <b>534</b> and at the negative line half-cycle <b>536</b> and the difference &#x394;V <b>539</b> between the peak voltage points of positive and negative line half-cycles <b>534</b> and <b>536</b> during dimming. As shown in the example, the peak voltage points of the positive line half-cycles <b>534</b> reach a level <b>535</b> and the peak voltage points of the negative line half-cycles <b>536</b> reach a level <b>538</b>. Due to the larger conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>1</b> <b>523</b> of the positive line half-cycles <b>534</b> compared to the smaller conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>2</b> <b>527</b> of the negative line half-cycles <b>536</b>, level <b>535</b> is greater than level <b>538</b>. As a result, there are differences in the load current crest values for the positive and negative line half-cycles <b>534</b> and <b>536</b>. Consequently, there is an uneven ripple at the line frequency in the output load current, which may cause undesirable LED light shimmering.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the example shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, timing diagram <b>540</b> shows the regulated output current Io of the LED load.

During the non-conducting intervals of triac, which are illustrated as dotted intervals <b>521</b> and <b>522</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the ripple current drops low as indicated with current ripple <b>543</b> and current ripple <b>547</b>. Although the average current line <b>542</b> is defined the average load current value IoAV <b>541</b>, the difference &#x394;Io <b>549</b> between ripple current crest values <b>545</b> and <b>548</b> of the positive and negative line half-cycles causes shimmering in the LED light.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In particular, in the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the vertical axis represents the load/output current Io <b>560</b> in an LED driver that does not include a feed forward imbalance corrector circuit as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, while the horizontal axis represents time t <b>505</b>. During a positive line half-cycle with a bigger conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>1</b> <b>523</b>, the current ripple <b>564</b> rises to a higher crest value of <b>565</b> while during a negative line half-cycle with a smaller conduction angle &#x3a6;<b>2</b> <b>527</b>, the current ripple <b>566</b> rises to a lower crest value of <b>568</b>, which results in a line frequency fluctuation in output current &#x394;Io <b>569</b> that affects the LED output light causing the undesired effect of shimmering.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In comparison, in the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the vertical axis represents the load/output current Io <b>580</b> in an LED driver that includes a feed forward imbalance corrector circuit, such as those described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, while the horizontal axis represents time t <b>505</b>.
