<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> receives broadcasting signals using various broadcasting systems. In particular, the broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> can receive digital broadcasting signals using digital broadcasting systems such as the digital multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T) system, the digital multimedia broadcasting-satellite (DMB-S) system, the media forward link only (MediaFLO) system, and the DVB-H and integrated services digital broadcast-terrestrial (ISDB-T) system. The broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> can also be constructed to be suited to broadcasting systems providing broadcasting signals other than the above-described digital broadcasting systems. The broadcasting signals and/or broadcasting related information received through the broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> can also be stored in the memory <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, the mobile communication module <b>112</b> transmits/receives a radio signal to/from at least one of a base station, an external terminal, and a server on a mobile communication network.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the position information module <b>115</b> confirms or obtains the position of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. A global positioning system (GPS) module is a representative example of the position information module <b>115</b>. Further, the GPS module <b>115</b> can calculate information on distances between one point (object) and at least three satellites and information on the time when the distance information is measured and apply trigonometry to the obtained distance information to obtain three-dimensional position information on the point (object) according to latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates at a predetermined time. Furthermore, a method of calculating position and time information using three satellites and correcting the calculated position and time information using another satellite is also used. In addition, the GPS module <b>115</b> continuously calculates the current position in real time and calculates velocity information using the position information.</p>

The mobile terminal <b>100</b> can also include at least two cameras.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, the microphone <b>122</b> receives an external audio signal in a call mode, a recording mode or a speed recognition mode and processes the received audio signal into electric audio data. The audio data can also be converted into a form that can be transmitted to a mobile communication base station through the mobile communication module <b>112</b> and output in the call mode. The microphone <b>122</b> can employ various noise removal algorithms for removing noise generated when the external audio signal is received.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the user input unit <b>130</b> receives input data for controlling the operation of the terminal from a user. The user input unit <b>130</b> can include a keypad, a dome switch, a touch pad (constant voltage/capacitance), jog wheel, jog switch and so on.

Some of these displays can be of a transparent type or a light transmission type, which is referred to as a transparent display. The transparent display also includes a transparent liquid crystal display. The rear structure of the display unit <b>151</b> can also be of the light transmission type. According to this structure, a user can see an object located behind the body of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> through an area of the body of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, which is occupied by the display <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> can include at least two displays <b>151</b>. For example, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> can include a plurality of displays that are arranged on a single face at a predetermined distance or integrated.

The touch sensor can be in the form of a touch film, a touch sheet and a touch pad, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also, the touch sensor can be constructed such that it converts a variation in pressure applied to a specific portion of the display <b>151</b> or a variation in capacitance generated at a specific portion of the display <b>151</b> into an electric input signal. The touch sensor can also be constructed such that it can sense pressure of touch as well as the position and area of touch. When touch input is applied to the touch sensor, a signal corresponding to the touch input is transmitted to a touch controller. The touch controller then processes the signal and transmits data corresponding to the processed signal to the controller <b>180</b>. Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> can detect a touched portion of the display <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the proximity sensor <b>141</b> can be located in an internal region of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, surrounded by the touch screen or near the touch screen.

In this instance, the touch screen (touch sensor) can be classified as a proximity sensor. For convenience of explanation, an action of approaching the pointer to the touch screen while the pointer is not in contact with the touch screen such that the location of the pointer on the touch screen is recognized is referred to as a &#x201c;proximity touch,&#x201d; and an action of bringing the pointer into contact with the touch screen is referred to as a &#x201c;contact touch&#x201d; in the following description. Also, a proximity touch point of the pointer on the touch screen means a point of the touch screen to which the pointer corresponds perpendicularly to the touch screen when the pointer proximity-touches the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the proximity sensor <b>141</b> senses a proximity touch and a proximity touch pattern (for example, a proximity touch distance, a proximity touch direction, a proximity touch velocity, a proximity touch time, a proximity touch position, a proximity touch moving state, etc.). Information corresponding to the sensed proximity touch action and proximity touch pattern can also be displayed on the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, the audio output module <b>152</b> can output audio data received from the radio communication unit <b>110</b> or stored in the memory <b>160</b> in a call signal receiving mode, a telephone call mode or a recording mode, a speech recognition mode and a broadcasting receiving mode.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the terminal body includes a case (a casing, a housing, a cover, etc.) forming the exterior of the terminal <b>100</b>. In the present embodiment, the case is divided into a front case <b>101</b> and a rear case <b>102</b>.

Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display <b>151</b> occupies most part of the main face of the front case <b>101</b>. The audio output unit <b>152</b> and the camera <b>121</b> are arranged in a region in proximity to one of both ends of the display <b>151</b> and the user input unit <b>131</b> and the microphone <b>122</b> are located in a region in proximity to the other end of the display <b>151</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a rear perspective view of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a camera <b>121</b>&#x2032; is additionally attached to the rear side of the terminal body, that is, the rear case <b>102</b>. The camera <b>121</b>&#x2032; has a photographing direction opposite to that of the camera <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and can have pixels different from those of the camera <b>121</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. For example, it is preferable that the camera <b>121</b> has low pixels such that it can capture an image of the face of a user and transmit the image to a receiving part for video telephony, while the camera <b>121</b>&#x2032; has high pixels because it captures an image of a general object and does not immediately transmit the image in many instances. The cameras <b>121</b> and <b>121</b>&#x2032; can also be attached to the terminal body such that they can be rotated or popped-up.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A flash bulb <b>123</b> and a mirror <b>124</b> are also arranged in proximity to the camera <b>121</b>&#x2032;. The flash bulb <b>123</b> lights an object when the camera <b>121</b>&#x2032; takes a picture of the object, and the mirror <b>124</b> is used for the user to look at his/her face in the mirror when the user wants to self-photograph himself/herself using the camera <b>121</b>&#x2032;. An audio output unit <b>152</b>&#x2032; is also provided on the rear side of the terminal body.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A broadcasting signal receiving antenna <b>124</b> is also attached to the side of the terminal body in addition to an antenna for telephone calls. The antenna <b>124</b> constructing a part of the broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be set in the terminal body such that the antenna <b>124</b> can be retracted from the terminal body. Further, the power supply <b>190</b> for providing power to the handheld terminal <b>100</b> is set in the terminal body. The power supply <b>190</b> can be included in the terminal body or detachably attached to the terminal body. A touch pad <b>135</b> for sensing touch is also attached to the rear case <b>102</b>. The touch pad <b>135</b> can be of a light transmission type as the display <b>151</b>. In this instance, if the display <b>151</b> outputs visual information through both sides thereof, the visual information can be recognized through the touch pad <b>135</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The proximity sensor described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will now be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a conceptual diagram used for explaining a proximity depth of the proximity sensor <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a pointer such as a user's finger approaches the touch screen, the proximity sensor <b>141</b> located inside or near the touch screen senses the approach and outputs a proximity signal. Further, the proximity sensor <b>141</b> can be constructed such that it outputs a proximity signal according to the distance between the pointer approaching the touch screen and the touch screen (referred to as &#x201c;proximity depth&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also, the distance in which the proximity signal is output when the pointer approaches the touch screen is referred to as a detection distance. The proximity depth can be determined using a plurality of proximity sensors having different detection distances and comparing proximity signals respectively output from the proximity sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the section of the touch screen in which proximity sensors capable of sensing three proximity depths are arranged. Of course, proximity sensors capable of sensing less than three or more than three proximity depths can be arranged in the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the pointer (user's finger in this example) completely comes into contact with the touch screen (D<b>0</b>), the controller <b>180</b> recognizes this action as the contact touch. When the pointer is located within a distance D<b>1</b> from the touch screen, the controller <b>180</b> recognizes this action as a proximity touch of a first proximity depth.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Similarly, when the pointer is located in a range between the distance D<b>1</b> and a distance D<b>2</b> from the touch screen, the controller <b>180</b> recognizes this action as a proximity touch of a second proximity depth. When the pointer is located in a range between the distance D<b>2</b> and a distance D<b>3</b> from the touch screen, the controller <b>180</b> recognizes this action a proximity touch of a third proximity depth. Also, when the pointer is located at longer than the distance D<b>3</b> from the touch screen, the controller <b>180</b> recognizes this action as a cancellation of proximity touch.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> can recognize the proximity touch as various input signals according to the proximity distance and proximity position of the pointer with respect to the touch screen and perform various operations according to the input signals.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are diagrams for describing a proximity touch recognition area and a tactile effect generation region according to an embodiment of the present invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> represents an object such as an icon, a menu item and the like in a circle type for clarity and convenience of explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A(a), the region for displaying an object on the display <b>151</b> can be divided into a first region A at a central part and a second region B enclosing the first region A. Further, the first and second regions A and B can be configured to generate tactile effects differing from each other in strength or pattern. For instance, the first and second regions can be configured to generate 2-step vibrations by outputting a first vibration if the second region B is touched and by outputting a second vibration greater than the first vibration if the first region A is touched.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, the haptic region can be different from the proximity touch recognition region. In particular, the haptic region can be set to be narrower or wider than the proximity touch recognition region. For instance, in FIG. <b>4</b>A(a), the proximity touch recognition region can be set to include both of the first and second regions A and B, and the haptic region can be set to include only the first region A.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A(b), the region having the object displayed therein can be discriminated into three regions A, B and C. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. <b>4</b>A(c), the region having the object displayed therein can be discriminated into N regions (N&#x3e;3). Each of the divided regions can also be set to generate a tactile effect having a different strength or pattern. Further, as discussed above, a region having a single object can be divided into at least three regions, and in which the haptic region and the proximity touch recognition region are set to differ from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates configuring a size of the proximity touch recognition region of the display <b>151</b> to vary according to a proximity depth. In particular, referring to FIG. <b>4</b>B(a), the proximity touch recognition region is configured to decrease by C&#x2192;B&#x2192;A according to the proximity depth for the display <b>151</b>, and configured to increase by C&#x2192;B&#x2192;A according to the proximity depth for the display <b>151</b>. Further, the haptic region can be set to have a predetermined size, as the region &#x2018;H&#x2019; shown in FIG. <b>4</b>B(b), regardless of the proximity depth for the display <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, when dividing the object-displayed region for the setting of the haptic region or the proximity touch recognition region, various schemes of horizontal/vertical division, radial division and combinations thereof can be used as well as the concentric circle type division shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The following description of the embodiments assumes the display <b>151</b> includes a touchscreen. The display screen of the touchscreen <b>151</b> will also be indicated by a reference number <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a flowchart illustrating a method of controlling a mobile terminal according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the controller <b>180</b> displays at least one function icon on the touchscreen <b>400</b> (S<b>51</b>). The user then sets a particular touch gesture to correspond to a particular icon displayed on the touchscreen <b>400</b> (S<b>52</b>). Then, the controller <b>180</b> removes the particular icon from the display <b>151</b> when the user sets the particular touch gesture on the touchscreen <b>400</b> (S<b>53</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">These features will now be described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 12</figref>. In more detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> (<b>6</b>-<b>1</b>), the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is in a standby mode in which a plurality of function icons <b>401</b>-<b>406</b> are displayed (i.e., a standby screen is displayed). Also, if the user touches any one of the icons <b>401</b>-<b>406</b> in the standby mode, the particular function is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Thus, the displayed icons will be referred to as function icons. Further, when a prescribed menu icon (e.g., MP3 menu icon) is executed, a displayed icon such as a play icon, stop icon, etc. related to the prescribed menu will also be referred to as function icon.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, in FIGS. <b>6</b>(<b>6</b>-<b>1</b>) and (<b>6</b>-<b>2</b>), the user sets a touch gesture for the &#x2018;new memo&#x2019; icon <b>403</b> (hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;a first menu icon&#x2019;). The icon <b>403</b> is only being used as an example and any other function icon can be selected. Further, a touch gesture setting mode is first entered to set the touch gesture for the first menu icon <b>403</b>. In more detail, the touch gesture setting mode can be entered in several different ways such as by performing a long-touch operation on the first menu icon <b>403</b> (i.e., touching the icon <b>403</b> for an amount of time longer than a predetermined time). A double touch operation can also be used. In another example, the user can manipulate a physical key included with the user input unit <b>130</b> (e.g., a side key, a push key located below the touchscreen, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Then, when the user enters the touch gesture setting mode, and as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>(<b>6</b>-<b>2</b>), the controller <b>180</b> displays a touch gesture input window <b>410</b> on the touch screen <b>400</b> that the user can use for inputting a prescribed gesture that is to be set for the first menu icon <b>403</b>. The displayed window <b>410</b> also includes a storage icon <b>411</b> for storing the input prescribed touch gesture and a return icon <b>413</b> for returning to the standby image.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The user then inputs a prescribed touch gesture (hereinafter referred to as &#x2018;a first touch gesture&#x2019;) for the first menu icon <b>403</b> to the touch gesture input window <b>410</b>. The first touch gesture can be input by performing a proximity/contact touch and then performing a touch &#x26; drag operation along a trace of a first shape (e.g., &#x2018;M&#x2019; shape in this example) on the first touch gesture input window <b>410</b>. As shown in FIG. <b>6</b>(<b>6</b>-<b>2</b>), the controller <b>180</b> also displays a trace of the touch &#x26; drag operation on the touch gesture input window <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Then, if the user is satisfied with the drawn gesture, the user can select (e.g., touch, manipulation of a physical key, etc.) the storage icon <b>411</b> to save the first touch gesture for the first menu icon <b>403</b> in the memory <b>160</b>. That is, the first touch gesture is stored in the memory <b>160</b> in association with the first menu icon <b>403</b>. Therefore, the user can set a plurality of gestures for a plurality of function icons.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to FIG. <b>6</b>(<b>6</b>-<b>3</b>), the mobile terminal <b>100</b> returns to the standby mode and displays the standby screen on the touchscreen <b>400</b>. However, the controller <b>180</b> does not display the first menu icon <b>403</b>. Then, if the user wants to execute the first menu icon <b>403</b>, the user can simply perform the preset first touch gesture (draw the letter M as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>(<b>6</b>-<b>3</b>)). Then, referring to FIG. <b>6</b>(<b>6</b>-<b>4</b>), the controller <b>180</b> executes the function corresponding to the first menu icon <b>403</b>. That is, the controller <b>180</b> displays a &#x2018;new memo&#x2019; menu corresponding to the function for the first menu icon <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which two functions are executed based on a single touch gesture. In more detail, as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>1</b>), the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is a standby mode and the standby screen is displayed on the touchscreen <b>400</b>. Also, as discussed above, because the user has set the first touch gesture for the first menu icon <b>403</b>, the controller <b>180</b> does not display the first menu icon <b>403</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>1</b>). The user also then enters the touch gesture setting mode using a variety of different ways as discussed above, and the controller <b>180</b> displays the touch gesture input window <b>410</b> on the touchscreen <b>400</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>2</b>). Then, the user sets the same touch gesture for the &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu icon <b>401</b> (hereinafter named &#x2018;a second menu icon&#x2019;) as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Subsequently, the user selects the storage icon <b>411</b>, and the controller <b>180</b> stores the first touch gesture for the second menu icon <b>401</b> in the memory <b>160</b>. Thus, the same touch gesture is assigned or set to two different function icons (or functions). In addition, the controller <b>180</b> can also first display a guide window to help guide the user in correctly redrawing the first touch gesture such that the touch gestures are identical or similar to each other. The controller <b>180</b> can also display a prompt informing the user that the first touch gesture for the second menu icon <b>401</b> will be stored, and indicate the two touch gestures are identical to each other. If the user confirms the touch gesture is to be linked to two function icons, the controller <b>180</b> stores the first touch gesture for the second menu icon <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Subsequently, referring FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>3</b>), the mobile terminal <b>100</b> returns to the standby mode and displays the standby screen on the touchscreen <b>400</b>. However, the controller <b>180</b> does not display the MP3 icon <b>401</b> (or the memo icon <b>403</b>). Then, when the user performs the first touch gesture on the touchscreen <b>400</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>3</b>), the controller <b>180</b> executes both functions (i.e., the &#x2018;new memo&#x2019; menu and the &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu functions) as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>4</b>). That is, the controller <b>180</b> displays a &#x2018;new memo&#x2019; executing window <b>420</b> and a &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu executing window <b>430</b> on the touchscreen <b>400</b> in an overlapping manner. The controller <b>180</b> can also display the two windows as being separate windows, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Then, when the user selects the &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu executing window <b>430</b>, the controller <b>180</b> displays the &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu executing window <b>430</b> to be overlapping the &#x2018;new memo&#x2019; menu executing window <b>420</b> as shown in FIG. <b>7</b>(<b>7</b>-<b>4</b>). The user can then manipulate various functions (e.g., &#x2018;play&#x2019;, &#x2018;stop&#x2019;, etc.) displayed in a control window <b>431</b> associated with the &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu execution.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates displaying a list of touch gestures set in the mobile terminal and re-displaying a menu icon that is not displayed on the standby screen because of the set touch gesture. In particular, as shown FIG. <b>8</b>(<b>8</b>-<b>1</b>), the user can display a list of touch gestures set in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. For example, the user can manipulate a particular key or keys on the user input unit <b>130</b> to display the list of touch gestures. The user can also display the list by performing a touch &#x26; drag operation and draw an &#x2018;L&#x2019; shape, for example. The user can also set a particular touch gesture to invoke the displaying of the list of touch gestures.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, the controller <b>180</b> also display a menu display icon <b>415</b> that the user can select to re-display a function icon and a setting cancel icon <b>417</b> for canceling the setting of the set touch gesture. As shown in FIGS. <b>8</b>(<b>8</b>-<b>1</b>) and <b>8</b>(<b>8</b>-<b>2</b>), the user can select one of the displayed list of function icons, and the controller <b>180</b> re-displays the touched function icon on the standby screen.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In particular, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the user touches the &#x2018;new memo menu&#x2019; from the touch gesture list, and then selects the menu display icon <b>415</b>. The controller <b>180</b> then re-displays the new memo menu icon <b>403</b> on the standby screen as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>(<b>8</b>-<b>2</b>). Further, the user can cancel the re-displaying of a selection function icon by selecting the setting cancel icon <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, after the user sets a particular touch gesture, the controller <b>180</b> can determine that the same touch gesture has later been input on the touchscreen <b>400</b> if the user draws the touch gesture in any portion of the touchscreen <b>400</b>. In another embodiment, the controller <b>180</b> can execute different functions based on where the user draws the touch gesture on the touchscreen <b>400</b>. That is, the user can set touch gestures for particular portions of the touchscreen <b>400</b>. Thus, drawing an M shape on the top portion of the touchscreen <b>400</b> can correspond to executing the menu icon <b>403</b> and drawing the same M shape on the lower portion of the touchscreen <b>400</b> can correspond to executing the MP3 function icon <b>401</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate these varying features.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to FIG. <b>9</b>(<b>9</b>-<b>1</b>), the user enters the touch gesture setting mode and the controller <b>180</b> displays the touch gesture input window <b>410</b> for a first menu (e.g., &#x2018;new memo&#x2019; menu) is displayed on the touchscreen <b>400</b>. The user then draws a touch gesture following a trace of a specific shape (e.g., &#x2018;M&#x2019; shape) for the first menu on a top side of the touch gesture input window <b>410</b>. The user then stores the input touch gesture by selecting the store icon <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">FIG. <b>9</b>(<b>9</b>-<b>2</b>) illustrates the user entering the touch gesture input window <b>410</b> for a second menu (e.g., &#x2018;MP3&#x2019; menu). The user then draws a touch gesture following a trace of a specific shape (e.g., &#x2018;M&#x2019; shape) for the second menu on a bottom side of the touch gesture input window <b>410</b> and stores the input touch gesture. Then, as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>10</b>-<b>1</b>), when the user draws the touch gesture having the set shape on the top side of the standby screen, the new memo function is executed. When the user draws the same gesture on the bottom side of the touchscreen <b>400</b> as shown in FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>10</b>-<b>3</b>), the MP3 function is executed as shown FIG. <b>10</b>(<b>10</b>-<b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the MP3 function currently executing, and then the user drawing a particular touch gesture on the touchscreen <b>400</b>. In particular, as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>(<b>11</b>-<b>1</b>), the controller <b>180</b> displays the MP3 control window <b>431</b> including play, rewind, etc. buttons the user can select to play MP3 files on the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Then, the user draws a touch gesture corresponding to the Internet function icon, and the controller <b>180</b> stops executing the MP3 function and instead executes the Internet function as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>(<b>11</b>-<b>2</b>). Alternatively, as shown in FIG. <b>11</b>(<b>11</b>-<b>3</b>), the controller <b>180</b> can display the Internet function in an overlapping manner with the MP3 function.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the user drawing a particular touch gesture and the corresponding function not being executed because the function is not available on the mobile terminal. In more detail, as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>(<b>12</b>-<b>1</b>), the user draws the touch gesture according to a trace of &#x2018;g&#x2019; shape, which has been previously set for a &#x2018;bookmark&#x2019; function within the &#x2018;Internet&#x2019; menu, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Then, as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>(<b>12</b>-<b>2</b>), the controller <b>180</b> does not execute the Internet bookmark function. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. <b>12</b>(<b>12</b>-<b>3</b>), the controller <b>180</b> can execute a corresponding Internet browser <b>440</b> and display a &#x2018;bookmark&#x2019; associated window <b>441</b> on the touchscreen <b>400</b> when the particular touch gesture is input and the function is available on the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Accordingly, the present invention provides several advantages. For example, the terminal display is small in size, yet there are a plurality of function icons available to the user. According to embodiments of the present invention, the user can set particular touch gestures for different function icons such that the limited display area is not cluttered with several icons.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be specified into other form(s) without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. For instance, the setting of the touch gesture can be set for executing a main menu of the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, the user can also set particular touch gestures to correspond to functions such as a &#x2018;memo storage&#x2019; function, &#x2018;memo delete&#x2019; function, etc. even if such a function does not have a corresponding function icon that is displayed. The function icons can also correspond to a send function in a messaging mode including a text messaging mode, a multimedia messaging mode, an email mode, etc. The touch gesture can also include a letter shape as discussed above or other shapes such as a checkmark, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the above-described methods can be implemented in a program recorded medium as computer-readable codes. The computer-readable media include all kinds of recording devices in which data readable by a computer system are stored. The computer-readable media include ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic tapes, floppy discs, optical data storage devices, and the like for example and also include Internet) transmission. Further, the computer can include the controller <b>180</b> of the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions.
