<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method for performing sample rate conversion and creating fractional delays to a signal is disclosed. The system comprises a filter, a look up table for storing coefficients for sample rate conversion and fractional delays, and control circuitry configured to use an indexing scheme to select one or more coefficients from the look up table for rate conversion and fractional delays. The coefficients stored in the look up table comprise the coefficients required to generate delays in desired increments of a sample rate. In the disclosed method, the one or more coefficients necessary for a desired sample rate and fractional delay are selected from a single look up table and provided to a filter to delay the signal based upon the input sample rate.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The embodiments described herein relate to the operation, use, and calibration of an open loop envelope tracker system for sending data transmissions. The embodiments described herein are further related to systems and techniques for optimizing a calibration of a group delay of a modulated power amplifier supply voltage with respect to a modulated signal to be transmitted by a radio frequency power amplifier. The embodiments described herein are further related to systems and techniques for using a look up table (LUT) and an intelligent coefficient indexing scheme for a rate converter, such as in an open loop envelope tracker system for sending data transmissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Envelope tracking systems for wide bandwidth modulation systems may be sensitive to the time-alignment between the modulated power amplifier supply voltage provided to a radio frequency power amplifier and a modulated radio frequency envelope signal provided as a signal input of the radio frequency power amplifier. A delay misalignment between the modulated power amplifier supply voltage and the radio frequency modulated envelope signal provided may result in spectrum and error vector magnitude degradation at an output of the radio frequency power amplifier. As an example, in the case of an LTE signal having a 10 MHz channel bandwidth, the spectrum requirements cannot be met when the absolute delay mismatch between the modulated power amplifier supply voltage and the radio frequency modulated envelope signal received by the radio frequency power amplifier is greater than four nanoseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, because detectors used to measure an output power at an output of the radio frequency power amplifier include offset errors and suffer from limited or low sensitivity with respect to delay mismatch, calibration techniques based on minimizing mismatch delay by determining an offset delay that provides maximum output power may not be repeatable or reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for a new system and technique for configuring and calibrating open loop envelope tracking systems to minimize group delay misalignment between the modulated power amplifier supply voltage and the radio frequency modulated envelope signal. In addition, there is a need to develop a new system and technique for configuring an open loop envelope tracking system during factor calibration or phone operation that minimizes or eliminates special external factory equipment or complex internal circuitries inside a communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, in an envelope tracking system, where a digital predistorted envelope signal is generated to modulate a PA supply, the input sample rate of the digital signal vramp is variable, based upon the modulation format and bandwidth. However, the final sample rate is always the same. This requires many interpolation rates to be implemented. Very fine timing control of the vramp delay is also required (as fine as 0.5 nanoseconds), where vramp is a digital signal representing the predistorted envelope signal. The fine delay control and many interpolation ratios can lead to the need or several very large coefficient look up tables (LUTs) to perform all of the required rate conversions and fractional delays. These large LUTs require a lot of digital area, consume large amounts of power, and may not be realizable from a digital timing perspective. Accordingly, there is also a need for an improved method and apparatus to decrease the size and power consumption of a rate converter in an envelope tracking system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments disclosed in the detailed description relate to an open loop envelope tracking system, calibration techniques and circuitry for calibration of the open loop envelope tracking system. The open loop envelope tracking system calibration technique and circuitry are proposed. A radio frequency power amplifier receives a modulated signal. An envelope tracker power converter generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage for the radio frequency power amplifier based a control signal derived from the modulated signal. A first measured output power and a second measured output power of the radio frequency power amplifier are measured when the control signal is respectively delayed by a first delay period and a second delay period. A sensitivity of the output power of the radio frequency power amplifier is near a maximum near the first delay period and the second delay period. The first delay period and/or the second delay period are adjusted until the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. The first delay period and the second delay period are used to obtain a calibrated fine tuning delay offset.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first embodiment of an open loop envelope tracking system includes a digital baseband circuit configured to generate a modulated signal based on a calibration test signal and a control signal based on the calibration test signal and a fine tuning delay setting of a fine tuning delay circuit. An envelope tracker power converter generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal. A radio frequency power amplifier generates a radio frequency power amplifier output signal based on the modulated signal and the modulated power amplifier supply voltage. A detector generates an output power measurement for the radio frequency power amplifier output signal. Controller circuitry may set the fine tuning delay setting to a first fine tuning delay setting in order to obtain a first measured output power from the radio frequency power amplifier output signal based on the output power measurement generated by the detector while the fine tuning delay setting is set to the first fine tuning delay setting. The controller circuitry may also set the fine tuning delay setting to a second fine tuning delay setting in order to obtain a second measured output power from the radio frequency power amplifier output signal based on the output power measurement generated by the detector while the fine tuning delay setting is set to the second fine tuning delay setting. Thereafter, the controller circuitry may determine a calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting based on the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting. The first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may each be near a fine tuning delay setting at which an output power of the radio frequency power amplifier output signal has a maximum sensitivity to a change in the fine tuning delay setting. To determine whether the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power, the controller circuitry may calculate a power difference between the first measured output power and the second measured output power. The controller circuitry may compare the power difference to a maximum power difference threshold. Based on a determination that the power difference fails to exceed a maximum power difference threshold, the controller circuitry may determine that the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power and store the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting in a memory associated with the controller circuitry. In some embodiments, the controller circuitry may set the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting substantially equal to half a sum of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting. In those embodiments where the first fine tuning delay setting is a positive fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting is a negative fine tuning delay setting, the controller circuitry may set the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting substantially equal to half a sum of the positive fine tuning delay setting and the negative fine tuning delay setting. In some embodiments, the test signal provided to digital baseband circuit may generate a modulated signal that has a substantially sinusoidal envelope. Alternatively, the test signal may be selected such that the digital based band circuit generates a modulated signal that is a carrier wave tone signal. In some instances, a frequency of the modulated signal is based on a band of operation of a communication network for which a communication device is configured to operate. Upon determining a calibrated fine tuning offset delay, the controller circuitry may obtain a temperature measurement from the envelope tracker power converter. The controller circuitry may store the temperature measurement as a calibrated temperature in association with the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting in the memory. In addition, in some embodiments, the controller circuitry may also obtain a supply voltage measurement from the envelope tracker power converter based on the determination that the power difference fails to exceed the maximum power difference threshold. Thereafter, the controller circuitry may store the supply voltage measurement as a calibrated supply voltage in association with the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting in the memory. In some embodiments, the calibrated temperature and the calibrated supply voltage may be used to adjust a fine tuning delay setting prior to initiation of a data transmission. For example, prior to initiation of a data transmission, obtain an operational temperature of the envelope tracker power converter and determine a fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment based on the operational temperature and the calibrated temperature. In addition, the controller circuitry may determine a fine tuning offset delay setting for the fine tuning delay circuit based on the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting and the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment. Thereafter, the controller circuitry may set the fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit equal to the fine tuning offset delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments of the open loop envelope tracking system of the controller circuitry may determine that the first measured output power is unequal to the second measured output power based a determination that the power difference exceeds the maximum power difference threshold. As a non-limiting example, in some embodiments, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust at least one of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. For example, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust both the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. As another example, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only one of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. In some embodiments of the open loop envelope tracking system, the controller circuitry may determine whether the first measured output power is greater than the second measured output power based on the power difference before adjusting the at least one of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting. In some embodiments, based on a determination that the first measured output power is greater than the second measured output power, the controller circuitry incrementally adjusts only the first fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power based on a determination that the second measured output power is less than the first measured output power. In still other embodiments, where the first fine tuning delay setting is greater than the second fine tuning delay setting, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only the first fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power because the second fine tuning delay setting is less that the first fine tuning delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some embodiments of the open loop envelope tracking system include a method for calibrating a group delay for an open loop envelope tracking system. As an example, the method may include generating a radio frequency power amplifier output signal having a first output power at an output of a radio frequency power amplifier based on a modulated signal as a function of a control signal delayed in time by a first delay relative to the modulated signal. In addition, the method may include generating the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having a second output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier as the function of the control signal delayed in time by a second delay relative to the modulated signal. Thereafter, the method may determine a calibrated offset delay as a function of the second delay and the first delay. As an example, the method may calculate a power difference between the first output power and the second output power and determine whether the first output power substantially equals the second output power based on the power difference based on the power difference. Illustratively, to determine that the first output power substantially equal the second output power based on the power difference, the method may compare a magnitude of the power difference to a maximum power difference threshold. Based on a determination that the magnitude of the power difference fails to exceed the maximum power difference threshold, the method may determine that the first output power substantially equals the second output power. A sensitivity of an output power of a radio frequency power amplifier output signal generated by the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the first delay may be substantially near a maximum value. Likewise, the sensitivity of the output power of the radio frequency power amplifier output signal generated by the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the second delay may also be substantially near the maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the method for calibrating the group delay for the open loop envelope tracking system of claim, the calibrated offset delay is a calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting for a fine tuning delay circuit located in a baseband processing circuit in communication with an envelope tracker power converter. The method further includes adjusting a group delay between the control signal and the modulated signal based on a fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit. For example, in some embodiments, the calibrated offset delay is determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay. Illustratively, the calibrated offset delay may be set to substantially equal to half a sum of the second delay and the first delay. Alternatively, where the second delay is less than zero and the first delay is greater than zero, the calibrated offset delay may be determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay by setting the calibrated offset delay substantially equal to a sum of the second delay and the first delay. Alternatively, the calibrated offset delay may be determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay by setting the calibrated offset delay substantially equal to half a sum of the first delay and the second delay. In the case where the first delay is a positive fine tuning delay and the second delay is a negative fine tuning delay the calibrated offset delay may be determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay by setting the calibrated offset delay substantially equal to half a sum of the positive fine tuning delay and the negative fine tuning delay. However, in some embodiments, the calibrated offset delay may be set substantially equal to half a sum of a magnitude of the positive fine tuning delay less a magnitude of the negative fine tuning delay. The method may further include providing a test signal to a digital baseband circuit such that the based band circuit generates a modulated signal having a substantially symmetric envelope characteristic, The radio frequency power amplifier may receive the modulated signal at the radio frequency power amplifier. In some cases, the modulated signal has a substantially sinusoidal envelope. In other cases, the modulated signal may be a carrier wave tone signal. For example, the carrier wave tone signal may have a frequency at about 10 MHz. Alternatively, the frequency of the modulated signal may be based on a band of operation of a communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, to generate the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the first output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the first delay relative to the modulated signal, the method includes receiving, at an envelope tracker power converter, the control signal delayed in time by the first delay, which generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal delayed in time by the first delay. The radio frequency power amplifier generates the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the first output power based on the modulated signal and the modulated power amplifier supply voltage. A detector may be used to measure an output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier to obtain the first output power. Similarly, to generate the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the second output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the second delay relative to the modulated signal, the method may include receiving, at the envelope tracker power converter, the control signal delayed in time by the second delay, which generates the modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal delayed in time by the second delay. The radio frequency power amplifier then generates the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the second output power based on the modulated signal and the modulated power amplifier supply voltage. The detector may then measure the output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier to obtain the second output power.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some embodiments of the method for calibrating the open loop envelope tracking system further include obtaining a temperature of an envelope tracker power converter upon determination of the calibrated offset delay and storing the temperature as a calibrated temperature in association with the calibrated offset delay. During normal operation of the communication device, the method may include configuring an offset delay of a fine tuning delay circuit of a digital baseband circuit based on the calibrated offset delay and providing the control signal to the envelope tracker power converter based on the offset delay of the fine tuning delay circuit. The envelope tracker power converter then generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal and provides the modulated power amplifier supply voltage to the radio frequency power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still other embodiments of the method for calibrating the open loop envelope tracking system further include adjusting the offset delay of a fine tuning delay circuit for temperature variations prior to initiation of a data transmission. To determine a fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment, the method may obtain an operational temperature of the envelope tracker power converter. Upon obtaining the operational temperature of the envelope tracker power converter, the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment is determined based on the operational temperature and the calibrated temperature. Thereafter, the offset delay of a fine tuning delay circuit is adjusted based on the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment prior to initiating the data transmission. Some embodiments of the method may further determine a supply voltage compensation adjustment. Illustratively, the method may obtain a supply voltage measurement of the envelope tracker power converter upon determination of the calibrated offset delay, and store the supply voltage measurement as a calibrated supply voltage in association with the calibrated offset delay. Prior to initiation of a data transmission, the method determines a fine tuning delay supply voltage compensation adjustment by obtaining an operational temperature and an operational supply voltage measurement of the envelope tracker power converter. Thereafter, the method may include determining a fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment based on the operational temperature and the calibrated temperature and determining a fine tuning delay supply voltage compensation adjustment based on the operational supply voltage measurement and the calibrated supply voltage. The offset delay of the fine tuning delay circuit may then be adjusted based on the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment and the fine tuning delay supply voltage compensation adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another example embodiment includes a method for calibrating a group delay for the open loop envelope tracking system. The method may include obtaining an initial value for a negative fine tuning delay and an initial value for a positive fine tuning delay. The radio frequency power amplifier may receive a substantially symmetric modulated signal. Thereafter, until a determination that a negative fine tuning delay output power is substantially equal to a positive fine tuning delay output power, the method may include recursively carrying out a process including: generating a modulated power amplifier supply control signal related to the substantially symmetric modulated signal based on the positive fine tuning delay, generating a modulated power amplifier supply voltage related to the substantially symmetric modulated signal based on the modulated power amplifier supply control signal advanced in time by the negative fine tuning delay, measuring the negative fine tuning delay output power of the radio frequency power amplifier, generating the modulated power amplifier supply control signal related to the substantially symmetric modulated signal based on the positive fine tuning delay, generating a modulated power amplifier supply voltage related to the substantially symmetric modulated signal based on the modulated power amplifier supply control signal delayed in time by the positive fine tuning delay, measuring the positive fine tuning delay output power of the radio frequency power amplifier, determining whether the negative fine tuning delay output power is substantially equal to the positive fine tuning delay output power, and in response to a determination that the negative fine tuning delay output power is substantially unequal to the positive fine tuning delay output power, adjusting the negative fine tuning delay and the positive fine tuning delay based on the negative fine tuning delay output power and the positive fine tuning delay output power. After the determination that the negative fine tuning delay output power is substantially equal to the positive fine tuning delay output power, the method may include determining a calibrated fine tuning delay based on the negative fine tuning delay and the positive fine tuning delay.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, a method and system is disclosed for calibrating the group delay for a power amplifier envelope tracking system. The described system includes a fine tuning delay circuit which can be used in a method for setting the fine tuning delay of the V<sub>RAMP </sub>delay where V<sub>RAMP </sub>is a digital signal representing the pre-distorted envelope signal used to control generation of the modulated supply voltage, V<sub>CC</sub>, generated by the envelope tracker. V<sub>CC </sub>is provided to the collector of the RF amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, the fine tuning delay circuit may be combined with an up-converter. In one embodiment, an interpolator in combination with a FIFO both up samples the incoming data stream to create a V<sub>RAMP </sub>signal for driving the envelope tracker and temporally adjusts the V<sub>RAMP </sub>signal relative to the RF modulated signal provided to the RF power amplifier. The fine tuning delay setting can be combined with an interpolator delay and sample rate conversion with respect to setting up group delay of the overall power amplifier envelope tracking system. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a method is disclosed to calibrate the fractional delay of the interpolator to provide group delay calibration for the open loop envelope tracking system, as well as a method for group delaying a signal using an interpolator or sample rate converting (up sampling) the data stream used to create V<sub>RAMP </sub>to drive the envelope tracker.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, a system and method for performing sample rate conversion and creating fractional delays to a signal is disclosed. The system comprises a filter, a look up table for storing coefficients for sample rate conversion and fractional delays, and control circuitry configured to use an indexing scheme to select one or more coefficients from the look up table for rate conversion and fractional delays. The coefficients stored in the look up table comprise the coefficients required to generate delays in desired increments of a sample rate. In the disclosed method, the one or more coefficients necessary for a desired sample rate and fractional delay are selected from a single look up table and provided to a filter to delay the signal based upon the input sample rate.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments disclosed in the detailed description relate to an open loop envelope tracking system, calibration techniques and circuitry for calibration of the open loop envelope tracking system. The open loop envelope tracking system calibration technique and circuitry are proposed. A radio frequency power amplifier receives a modulated signal. An envelope tracker power converter generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage for the radio frequency power amplifier based a control signal derived from the modulated signal. A first measured output power and a second measured output power of the radio frequency power amplifier are measured when the control signal is respectively delayed by a first delay period and a second delay period. A sensitivity of the output power of the radio frequency power amplifier is near a maximum near the first delay period and the second delay period. The first delay period and/or the second delay period are adjusted until the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. The first delay period and the second delay period are used to obtain a calibrated fine tuning delay offset.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A first embodiment of an open loop envelope tracking system includes a digital baseband circuit configured to generate a modulated signal based on a calibration test signal and a control signal based on the calibration test signal and a fine tuning delay setting of a fine tuning delay circuit. An envelope tracker power converter generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal. A radio frequency power amplifier generates a radio frequency power amplifier output signal based on the modulated signal and the modulated power amplifier supply voltage. A detector generates an output power measurement for the radio frequency power amplifier output signal. Controller circuitry may set the fine tuning delay setting to a first fine tuning delay setting in order to obtain a first measured output power from the radio frequency power amplifier output signal based on the output power measurement generated by the detector while the fine tuning delay setting is set to the first fine tuning delay setting. The controller circuitry may also set the fine tuning delay setting to a second fine tuning delay setting in order to obtain a second measured output power from the radio frequency power amplifier output signal based on the output power measurement generated by the detector while the fine tuning delay setting is set to the second fine tuning delay setting. Thereafter, the controller circuitry may determine a calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting based on the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting. The first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may each be near a fine tuning delay setting at which an output power of the radio frequency power amplifier output signal has a maximum sensitivity to a change in the fine tuning delay setting. To determine whether the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power, the controller circuitry may calculate a power difference between the first measured output power and the second measured output power. The controller circuitry may compare the power difference to a maximum power difference threshold. Based on a determination that the power difference fails to exceed a maximum power difference threshold, the controller circuitry may determine that the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power and store the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting in a memory associated with the controller circuitry. In some embodiments, the controller circuitry may set the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting substantially equal to half a sum of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting. In those embodiments where the first fine tuning delay setting is a positive fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting is a negative fine tuning delay setting, the controller circuitry may set the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting substantially equal to half a sum of the positive fine tuning delay setting and the negative fine tuning delay setting. In some embodiments, the test signal provided to digital baseband circuit may generate a modulated signal that has a substantially sinusoidal envelope. Alternatively, the test signal may be selected such that the digital based band circuit generates a modulated signal that is a carrier wave tone signal. In some instances, a frequency of the modulated signal is based on a band of operation of a communication network for which a communication device is configured to operate. Upon determining a calibrated fine tuning offset delay, the controller circuitry may obtain a temperature measurement from the envelope tracker power converter. The controller circuitry may store the temperature measurement as a calibrated temperature in association with the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting in the memory. In addition, in some embodiments, the controller circuitry may also obtain a supply voltage measurement from the envelope tracker power converter based on the determination that the power difference fails to exceed the maximum power difference threshold. Thereafter, the controller circuitry may store the supply voltage measurement as a calibrated supply voltage in association with the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting in the memory. In some embodiments, the calibrated temperature and the calibrated supply voltage may be used to adjust a fine tuning delay setting prior to initiation of a data transmission. For example, prior to initiation of a data transmission, obtain an operational temperature of the envelope tracker power converter and determine a fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment based on the operational temperature and the calibrated temperature. In addition, the controller circuitry may determine a fine tuning offset delay setting for the fine tuning delay circuit based on the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting and the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment. Thereafter, the controller circuitry may set the fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit equal to the fine tuning offset delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments of the open loop envelope tracking system of the controller circuitry may determine that the first measured output power is unequal to the second measured output power based a determination that the power difference exceeds the maximum power difference threshold. As a non-limiting example, in some embodiments, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust at least one of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. For example, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust both the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. As another example, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only one of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. In some embodiments of the open loop envelope tracking system, the controller circuitry may determine whether the first measured output power is greater than the second measured output power based on the power difference before adjusting the at least one of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting. In some embodiments, based on a determination that the first measured output power is greater than the second measured output power, the controller circuitry incrementally adjusts only the first fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power based on a determination that the second measured output power is less than the first measured output power. In still other embodiments, where the first fine tuning delay setting is greater than the second fine tuning delay setting, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only the first fine tuning delay setting to determine the first fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the controller circuitry may incrementally adjust only the second fine tuning delay setting to determine the second fine tuning delay setting at which the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power because the second fine tuning delay setting is less that the first fine tuning delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some embodiments of the open loop envelope tracking system include a method for calibrating a group delay for an open loop envelope tracking system. As an example, the method may include generating a radio frequency power amplifier output signal having a first output power at an output of a radio frequency power amplifier based on a modulated signal as a function of a control signal delayed in time by a first delay relative to the modulated signal. In addition, the method may include generating the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having a second output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier as the function of the control signal delayed in time by a second delay relative to the modulated signal. Thereafter, the method may determine a calibrated offset delay as a function of the second delay and the first delay. As an example, the method may calculate a power difference between the first output power and the second output power and determine whether the first output power substantially equals the second output power based on the power difference based on the power difference. Illustratively, to determine that the first output power substantially equal the second output power based on the power difference, the method may compare a magnitude of the power difference to a maximum power difference threshold. Based on a determination that the magnitude of the power difference fails to exceed the maximum power difference threshold, the method may determine that the first output power substantially equals the second output power. A sensitivity of an output power of a radio frequency power amplifier output signal generated by the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the first delay may be substantially near a maximum value. Likewise, the sensitivity of the output power of the radio frequency power amplifier output signal generated by the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the second delay may also be substantially near the maximum value.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments of the method for calibrating the group delay for the open loop envelope tracking system of claim, the calibrated offset delay is a calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting for a fine tuning delay circuit located in a baseband processing circuit in communication with an envelope tracker power converter. The method further includes adjusting a group delay between the control signal and the modulated signal based on a fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit. For example, in some embodiments, the calibrated offset delay is determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay. Illustratively, the calibrated offset delay may be set to substantially equal to half a sum of the second delay and the first delay. Alternatively, where the second delay is less than zero and the first delay is greater than zero, the calibrated offset delay may be determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay by setting the calibrated offset delay substantially equal to a sum of the second delay and the first delay. Alternatively, the calibrated offset delay may be determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay by setting the calibrated offset delay substantially equal to half a sum of the first delay and the second delay. In the case where the first delay is a positive fine tuning delay and the second delay is a negative fine tuning delay the calibrated offset delay may be determined as the function of the second delay and the first delay by setting the calibrated offset delay substantially equal to half a sum of the positive fine tuning delay and the negative fine tuning delay. However, in some embodiments, the calibrated offset delay may be set substantially equal to half a sum of a magnitude of the positive fine tuning delay less a magnitude of the negative fine tuning delay. The method may further include providing a test signal to a digital baseband circuit such that the based band circuit generates a modulated signal having a substantially symmetric envelope characteristic, The radio frequency power amplifier may receive the modulated signal at the radio frequency power amplifier. In some cases, the modulated signal has a substantially sinusoidal envelope. In other cases, the modulated signal may be a carrier wave tone signal. For example, the carrier wave tone signal may have a frequency at about 10 MHz. Alternatively, the frequency of the modulated signal may be based on a band of operation of a communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, to generate the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the first output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the first delay relative to the modulated signal, the method includes receiving, at an envelope tracker power converter, the control signal delayed in time by the first delay, which generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal delayed in time by the first delay. The radio frequency power amplifier generates the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the first output power based on the modulated signal and the modulated power amplifier supply voltage. A detector may be used to measure an output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier to obtain the first output power. Similarly, to generate the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the second output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier based on the modulated signal as the function of the control signal delayed in time by the second delay relative to the modulated signal, the method may include receiving, at the envelope tracker power converter, the control signal delayed in time by the second delay, which generates the modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal delayed in time by the second delay. The radio frequency power amplifier then generates the radio frequency power amplifier output signal having the second output power based on the modulated signal and the modulated power amplifier supply voltage. The detector may then measure the output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier to obtain the second output power.</p>

The envelope tracker power converter then generates a modulated power amplifier supply voltage based on the control signal and provides the modulated power amplifier supply voltage to the radio frequency power amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Still other embodiments of the method for calibrating the open loop envelope tracking system further include adjusting the offset delay of a fine tuning delay circuit for temperature variations prior to initiation of a data transmission. To determine a fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment, the method may obtain an operational temperature of the envelope tracker power converter. Upon obtaining the operational temperature of the envelope tracker power converter, the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment is determined based on the operational temperature and the calibrated temperature. Thereafter, the offset delay of a fine tuning delay circuit is adjusted based on the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment prior to initiating the data transmission. Some embodiments of the method may further determine a supply voltage compensation adjustment. Illustratively, the method may obtain a supply voltage measurement of the envelope tracker power converter upon determination of the calibrated offset delay, and store the supply voltage measurement as a calibrated supply voltage in association with the calibrated offset delay. Prior to initiation of a data transmission, the method determines a fine tuning delay supply voltage compensation adjustment by obtaining an operational temperature and an operational supply voltage measurement of the envelope tracker power converter. Thereafter, the method may include determining a fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment based on the operational temperature and the calibrated temperature and determining a fine tuning delay supply voltage compensation adjustment based on the operational supply voltage measurement and the calibrated supply voltage. The offset delay of the fine tuning delay circuit may then be adjusted based on the fine tuning delay temperature compensation adjustment and the fine tuning delay supply voltage compensation adjustment.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The center fine tuning delay may also be referred to as a mid-point of the fine tuning delay circuit. For example, in some embodiments, the mid-point fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>CENTER</sub>, has a reference value of zero. In this case, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, may be divided into a negative fine tuning delay time, T<sub>NEGATIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, and a positive fine tuning delay time, T<sub>POSITIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>. As an example, a signal delayed by the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> by a negative fine tuning delay time, T<sub>NEGATIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, arrives earlier than a signal delayed by a positive fine tuning delay time, T<sub>POSITVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>. The negative fine tuning delay time, T<sub>NEGATIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, may correspond to a negative fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> that is less than zero. The positive fine tuning delay time, T<sub>NEGATIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, may correspond to a negative fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> that is greater than zero.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, a fine tuning delay setting equal to one corresponds to 1.08 nanoseconds of delay relative to a mid-point fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>CENTER</sub>, where the mid-point fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>CENTER</sub>, is assumed to have a fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, equal to zero. Alternatively, for example, a fine tuning delay setting equal to negative four corresponds to &#x2212;4.32 nanoseconds of delay relative to the mid-point fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>CENTER</sub>. Accordingly, a negative fine tuning delay time, T<sub>NEGATIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, corresponds to a fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, which is less than zero relative to the mid-point fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>CENTER</sub>. Accordingly, relative to the receipt of the digitally delayed control signal without pre-distortion compensation <b>84</b>, the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> will provide the digital control signal <b>86</b> earlier in time when the fine tuning delay time, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, is at least equal to zero. A positive fine tuning delay, T<sub>POSITIVE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, corresponds to a fine tuning delay, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, greater than zero relative to the mid-point fine tuning delay, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>CENTER</sub>.</p>

In some embodiments, the coefficients of the digital pre-distortion compensation filter <b>74</b> may be configured by either the controller <b>32</b> or the processor <b>28</b>. In addition, the propagation delay through the digital pre-distortion compensation filter <b>74</b> may vary depending upon the various modes of operation of the communication device <b>10</b>.

Thus, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be used in a method for setting the fine tuning delay of the V<sub>RAMP </sub>delay where V<sub>RAMP </sub>is a digital signal representing the pre-distorted envelope signal used to control generation of the modulated supply voltage, V<sub>CC</sub>, generated by the envelope tracker. V<sub>CC </sub>is provided to the collector of the RF amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another embodiment, the fine tuning delay circuit may be combined with an up-converter. In one embodiment, an interpolator in combination with a FIFO both up samples the incoming data stream to create a V<sub>RAMP </sub>signal for driving the envelope tracker and temporally adjusts the V<sub>RAMP </sub>signal relative to the RF modulated signal provided to the RF power amplifier. A relationship exists between the fine tuning delay setting described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the interpolator delay and sample rate conversion described below with respect to setting up group delay of the overall power amplifier envelope tracking system. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shown below may be an exemplary embodiment of the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As a result, in one embodiment, a method is disclosed to calibrate the fractional delay of the interpolator to provide group delay calibration for the open loop envelope tracking system, as well as a method for group delaying a signal using an interpolator or sample rate converting (up sampling) the data stream used to create V<sub>RAMP </sub>to drive the envelope tracker.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, in an envelope tracking system as described above, where a digital predistorted envelope signal is generated to modulate a PA supply, the input sample rate of the digital signal vramp is variable, based upon the modulation format and bandwidth. However, the final sample rate is always the same. This requires many interpolation rates to be implemented. Very fine timing control of the vramp delay is also required (as fine as 0.5 nanoseconds), where vramp is a digital signal representing the predistorted envelope signal. The fine delay control (which is 1/36 in one embodiment) and many interpolation ratios can lead to the need or several very large coefficient look up tables (LUTs) to perform all of the required rate conversions and fractional delays. These large LUTs require a lot of digital area, consume large amounts of power, and may not be realizable from a digital timing perspective. Accordingly, there is also a need for an improved method and apparatus to decrease the size and power consumption of a rate converter in an envelope tracking system.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, an improvement to an existing rate converter with a variable fractional delay is disclosed. For example, a rate converter is often needed with variable fractional delay. The rate converter can interpolate and create fractional delays to a signal. One known way to accomplish this is to use a brute force method to generate a coefficient look up table (LUT) for each rate and fractional delay. This requires a very large LUT, or multiple LUTs, each of which may be large. In addition, in certain envelope tracking systems, there are many interpolation rates and a very fine fractional delay needed. In one embodiment, it may be as fine as 1/36. In another embodiment, it may be 1/18. The large number of coefficients needed to implement these functions can be prohibitively large.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">This may be addressed by using a small LUT and an intelligent coefficient scheme to decrease the size and power consumption of the rate converter. To interpolate n delay, the proper coefficients must be selected for the delay. In one embodiment, the small LUT includes the coefficients required to generate delays in 1/36 increments of the output sample rate. The coefficient set is like a circular buffer. Only one output period of delay coefficients is needed for the fractional delay. In this manner, in one embodiment, if a 0.25 nanosecond (ns) delay is desired, this corresponds to a 1/36 delay. In this embodiment, only 36 sets of coefficients need to be stored in the LUT. In another embodiment, LUT includes the coefficients required to generate delays in 1/18 increments of the output sample rate, so there would be 18 sets of coefficients stored in the LUT. The integer delays are implemented with a low cost and low power FIFO. Coefficient selection is reduced to a modulo counter with a programmable reset, an increment, and a FIFO control. The preset is a function of desired delay. The increment is a function of the interpolation rate. The FIFO is used to handle the coefficient LUT wrap. Although this method is described herein with respect to 1/36 fractional delay, it can be generalized to any fractional delay 1/N resolution, with 1/18 being just a single other non-limiting example.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A sample rate converter can be implemented as a finite impulse response filter (FIR). Depending on interpolation rate, the coefficient table can become quite large. In addition to the sample rate conversion, coefficient selection can also be used to implement delays of the signal that are a fraction of the sample rate. In particular, the digital filter may need several very large coefficient tables to perform all the required rate conversions and fractional delay calculations. These tables will require a lot of digital area, consume a lot of power, and may not be realizable from a digital timing perspective. To implement both sample rate conversion and fractional delays of the signal, the tables can grow exponentially. In the method described herein, several large coefficient tables are condensed into a small LUT and an indexing scheme is used to satisfy the rate conversions and fractional delays.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In one embodiment, a minimal coefficient table using an intelligent look up algorithm can be used to accomplish both the rate conversion and the fractional delay calculation. This approach reduces the area of the digital circuits, the power consumption of the digital filter, and allows the use of a slower digital process. The described method creates a smaller table and uses an intelligent coefficient lookup to address all three areas of concern. This technique is not limited to the sizes used in the exemplary system. This method is also compact enough that programmable filters can be created and adapted to different system requirements of many standards. Although specific rates and delays in a cellular system are discussed herein, the described technique is applicable to any system that needs rate conversion and fractional delay.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The problem of how to implement the interpolation and fractional delay with just one filter (of small size) is approached by first looking at the requirements for the fractional delay. For a fractional delay circuit, the FIR coefficients are a function of the required delay. The system timing resolution needed is on the order of 0.5 ns for the higher modulation bandwidths, which is approximately 1/18 of 104 Mhz. However, the fractional delay circuit delays the signal based upon the input sampling rate. The input sample rate for an exemplary system can vary from 11.55 MHz to 104 MHz. A table of 36 sets of coefficients is used to provide &#x2dc;2.4 ns to &#x2dc;0.27 ns for the 11.55 MHz and 104 MHz rates, respectively. This provides a compromise between the delay required for the higher bandwidths and performance at the lower bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">An example of the delay table is shown in Table 2. For a given output sample, it is possible to simply index into the table by the desired delay (in &#x2212;1/36 or &#x2212;1/18 increments).</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It was recognized by the inventors of the current application that the coefficients are a function of delay. Further, it was also recognized that interpolation may be accomplished using delays. Therefore, indexing through the table faster than the sample rate at fractional increments (&#x3c;36) can be used to interpolate and create fractional delays.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one embodiment of a system employing the concepts of the present application. In one embodiment, the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be implemented in a filter <b>300</b>. The filter <b>300</b> may include a buffer or queue, such as FIFO <b>302</b>; a fractional delay circuit, such as an FIR <b>308</b>; a coefficient look-up table (LUT) <b>318</b>; and a modulo counter <b>320</b>. The FIFO <b>302</b> has an input Sig_in <b>304</b> and an input FSin <b>306</b>. The FIR <b>308</b> has inputs <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>314</b> and an output signal Sig_out <b>316</b>. Input <b>310</b> is an output from the FIFO <b>302</b>. Input <b>312</b> is the FSin <b>306</b>. Input <b>314</b> is FSout <b>322</b>, which is also is an input to the modulo counter <b>320</b>. The modulo counter <b>320</b> may be programmable, in which case it also has a programmed delay signal <b>324</b> and a ratio signal <b>326</b> as inputs. The modulo counter <b>320</b> acts as control circuitry for selecting the proper coefficients from the coefficient LUT <b>318</b>. In one embodiment, the modulo counter <b>320</b> uses the programmed delay signal <b>324</b> and the ratio <b>326</b> values to determine the counter preset and increment. The modulo counter <b>320</b> also advances and retards the FIFO <b>302</b> as necessary. In this manner, the FIFO <b>302</b> provides the integer delay and the FIR <b>308</b> provides the fractional delay.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the disclosed method is accomplished by using a small LUT as the coefficient LUT <b>318</b> and an intelligent coefficient scheme to decrease the size and power consumption of the rate converter. In one embodiment, the small LUT <b>318</b> includes the coefficients required to generate delays in 1/36 increments of the output sample rate. Only one output period of delay coefficients is needed for the fractional delay. In this manner, in one embodiment, only 36 sets of coefficients need to be stored in the LUT <b>318</b>. The integer delays are implemented with the FIFO <b>302</b>, which may be a low cost and low power FIFO. Coefficient selection is reduced to a modulo counter <b>320</b> with a programmable reset, an increment, and a FIFO control. The preset is a function of desired delay. The increment is a function of the interpolation rate. The FIFO <b>302</b> is used to handle the coefficient LUT wrap. Although this method is described herein with respect to 1/36 fractional delay, it can be generalized to any fractional delay 1/N resolution, with 1/18 being just a single other non-limiting example.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In short, the method involves using the modulo counter <b>320</b> to perform rate conversion and calculate the fractional delay. The counter preset is the desired delay. The counter increment is a function of the interpolation rate. In the embodiment where the coefficient LUT <b>318</b> has 36 sets of coefficients, and there is a 1&#xd7; interpolation rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the modulo counter <b>320</b> increments by 36. In the 2&#xd7; interpolation rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the modulo counter <b>320</b> increments by 18. In the 3&#xd7; interpolation rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the modulo counter <b>320</b> increment is 12. In the 9/2&#xd7; interpolation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the increment is 8. In the 9&#xd7; interpolation rate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the increment is 4.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> show how the table is used to interpolate and delay the signal. The first row shows the input signal. The second row shows the output signal. The double bars &#x201c;&#x2225;&#x201d; show the clocks edges. The format of the samples is &#x201c;S-D&#x201d;, where &#x201c;S&#x201d; is the sample and &#x201c;D&#x201d; is the delay. The delay ranges from 0-17 (&#x201c;0&#x201d;-&#x201c;h&#x201d;). The output sample chosen is the one shown just after the double bars. The other samples shown are just for reference.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, in the 1&#xd7; interpolation case (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the current input sample is 1. So, in the 0/36 delay, the first output sample is sample[1] (x[n]) with 0 delay (1&#x2212;0). For the 1/36 delay case, all samples are delayed by 1/36, so the output sample will be sample[0] (x[n&#x2212;1]) with a delay of 36.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The interpolate by 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) shows two output samples for every 1 input sample. For illustration, take the case of 18/36 delay. The current input is sample[1] (x[n]). However, since there is a delay of 18/36, the first output sample will be sample[0] (x[n&#x2212;1]) delayed by 18/36. The second output will be sample[1] delayed by 0/36 or 0/18. Again, note that the integer sample delay comes from the FIFO <b>302</b>, not the fractional delay FIR <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The 9/2 interpolate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is not an integer divisor of the coefficient LUT table of 36. A table of 1/36 delay (contains 36 sets of coefficients) is the least common multiple of all the interpolation rates. However, it has been shown in simulation by the inventors of the present application that it is acceptable to have this table repeat every two input samples. This allows the table to be reduced to 36 sets of coefficients. This table is large and becomes unreadable, so this is illustrated with a table with 1/18 delays.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one embodiment, the modulo counter <b>320</b> is a modulo 36 counter. A modulo 36 counter is used to increment the counter because the coefficient table only contains 36 sets. Each time the counter rolls over, the FIFO output must change accordingly. The 9/2&#xd7; interpolation case (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) changes the calculations slightly because it spans two samples (inverse of fractional interpolation rate=1/0.5=2).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Thus, according to the described method and system, a minimal coefficient table using an intelligent look up algorithm can be used to accomplish both the rate conversion and the fractional delay calculation. This approach reduces the area of the digital circuits, the power consumption of the digital filter, and allows the use of a slower digital process. The described method creates a smaller table and uses an intelligent coefficient lookup to address all three areas of concern. This technique is not limited to the sizes used in the exemplary system. This method is also compact enough that programmable filters can be created and adapted to different system requirements of many standards.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The calibration technique depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-C</figref> may be used to calibrate the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> as part of a factor calibration operation or during normal operation of the communication device <b>10</b>. As an example, the calibration technique may be used during inactive transmission periods or slots to ensure that neither a change in temperature nor supply voltage have changed the group delay characteristics. In addition, in some embodiments, the calibration technique may be used each time a communication device changes an operational mode or a band of operation. In addition, the calibration technique may be used periodically, before commencement of a data transmission, or initiation of a series of data transmissions. For example, the calibration technique may be used prior to commencing a telephonic communication and/or a data communication. Likewise, in some embodiments, the calibration technique may be triggered based on a detection of a change in temperature, a supply voltage, a transmission power level, a transmission power mode, and/or some combination thereof. In some embodiments, the trigger to recalibrate may be initiated due to a comparison to a threshold. An example threshold may include a battery level threshold, a supply voltage threshold, a rate of battery consumption, and/or a relative change in temperature of at least one of a plurality of devices within the communication device <b>10</b>. As another example, while the transmitter is not active during a compressed period or discontinuous transmit period of operation, the communication device may initiate the calibration technique. As an example, during calibration, the communication device may be configured to operate at a power amplifier output power less than &#x2212;36 dBm plus antenna switch isolation provided by the radio frequency switch <b>22</b>. For example, some embodiments of the radio frequency switch <b>22</b> may have an antenna switch isolation around +25 dBm. Accordingly, as one example, during execution of the calibration technique, the calibration output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier <b>18</b> may be between &#x2212;11 dBm and &#x2212;17 dBm. In this case, the detector <b>20</b> may be configured to have an operating range between +28 dBm to &#x2212;17 dBm, which provides approximately 45 dBm of dynamic range. As an example, the calibration technique may be used within various communication networks including those based on High-Speed Uplink Pack Access (HSUPA), Dual Cell High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (DC-HSUPCA), or Long Term Evolution (LTE) communication standards.</p>

In such a case, the initial values for the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may be adjusted based on the operational mode of the device being calibrated and the known operational mode or assumed operational mode of the device or system from which the initial values of the first fine tuning delay setting and the initial fine tuning delay setting were obtained. In some embodiments, the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may be parameter values that are stored in association with the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b>, in a memory location associated with the controller <b>32</b> or the processor <b>28</b>, or downloaded from a test equipment interface. In some embodiments, the initial values for the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may be provided via a network connection. As an example, the initial values for the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may be provided via a network connection after a communication device is assigned to operate in an operational mode or a band of operation in a communication network. In other embodiments, the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may be obtained from the memory associated with the controller <b>32</b>, the processor <b>28</b>, or the digital baseband circuit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The initial values of the first fine tuning delay and the second fine tuning delay may depend on the architecture or control interface of the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b>.

In some cases, the minimum fine tuning delay setting may correspond to a fine tuning delay setting equal to zero and the maximum fine tuning delay setting may correspond to a maximum number of fine tuning delay steps.

In yet other embodiments, the initial values of the first fine tuning delay setting and the second fine tuning delay setting may near or within a particular range of the respective first maximum sensitivity fine tuning delay setting and the second maximum fine tuning delay setting.

For example, as a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts an embodiment of the method <b>700</b> where only the first fine tuning delay setting is adjusted until the first measured output power associated with the first fine tuning delay setting is substantially equal to the second measured output power associated with the second fine tuning delay setting. In other embodiments of the method <b>700</b>, only the second fine tuning delay setting is adjusted until the first measured output power associated with the first fine tuning delay setting is substantially equal to the second measured output power associated with the second fine tuning delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As a non-limiting example, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may determine a difference between the first measured output power and the second measured output power. (Step <b>702</b>) In some embodiments, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may be configured to use the power difference calculated in the Step <b>624</b> to determine the difference between the first measured output power and the second measured output power. In this case, the Step <b>702</b> may be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Based on the power difference, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may adjust the first fine tuning delay setting. (Step <b>704</b>) As a non-limiting example, in order to simplify the description of the adjustment process, the first fine tuning delay setting corresponds to a first fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>FIRST</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>, which is assumed to be greater than a second fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>SECOND</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>. The processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may either increment or decrement the first fine tuning delay setting by a fine tuning delay setting step size to reduce the difference between the first measured output power and the second measured output power. The fine tuning delay setting step size may be configured by the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> dependent upon the magnitude of the power difference. As the magnitude of the power difference is reduced, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may reduce the fine tuning delay setting step size. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the fine tuning delay step size is equal to a minimum fine tuning delay setting step size. In this case, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may increment or decrement the first fine tuning delay setting by a value of one. If the power difference is greater than zero, the second measured output power is greater than the first measured output power. Accordingly, because the first fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>FIRST</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>, is assumed to be greater than the second fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>SECOND</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> reduces the value of the first fine tuning delay setting. If the power difference is less than zero, the second measured output power is less than the first measured output power. As a result, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> increases the first fine tuning delay setting. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, based on the above assumption, decreasing the first fine tuning delay setting will reduce the first fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>FIRST</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>, which will increase the first measured output power. In addition, increasing the first fine tuning delay setting will decrease the first fine tuning delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Alternatively, if the first fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>FIRST</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>, is assumed to be less than the second fine tuning delay setting time, T<sub>SECOND</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>DELAY</sub>, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> would decrease the first fine tuning delay setting in the case where the power difference is less than zero and increase the first fine tuning delay setting in the case where the power difference is greater than zero.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may configure the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> to provide a fine tuning delay, T<sub>FINE</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>TUNING</sub>, based on the adjusted value of the first fine tuning delay setting. Based on the updated value of the first fine tuning delay setting and the test signal, the digital baseband circuit <b>14</b> provides the control signal <b>48</b> to the envelope tracker power converter <b>16</b>. (Step <b>706</b>) In response to the control signal <b>48</b>, the envelope tracker power converter <b>16</b> generates the modulated power amplifier supply voltage <b>58</b>, V<sub>CC</sub>.

The detector <b>20</b> measures the output power at the output of the radio frequency power amplifier <b>18</b> to obtain the first measured output power based on the adjusted first fine tuning delay setting.

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Thereafter, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may be configured to determine whether the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power.

In the case where the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power, (YES), the method <b>700</b> is substantially complete. As a result, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, after completion of the method <b>700</b>, method <b>600</b> continues to the Step <b>628</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments of the Step <b>712</b>, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may be configured to subtract the first measured output power from the second measured output power to obtain a power difference to determine whether the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. In some embodiments, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may compare the magnitude of the power difference to the maximum power difference threshold. For the case where the magnitude of the power difference does not exceed the maximum power difference threshold, the first measured output power substantially equals the second measured output power. However, for the case where the magnitude of the power difference exceeds the maximum power difference threshold, the first measured output power is substantially unequal to the second measured output power.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In addition, some embodiments of the Step <b>712</b> of the method <b>700</b> may use different techniques to determine whether the first measured output power is substantially equal to the second measured output power.

In some embodiments, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may compare the previously calculated power difference to the current power difference to determine whether the present power difference associated with the present value of the first fine tuning delay setting is a minimum power difference.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As an example, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may determine whether the sign (+/&#x2212;) of the previously calculated power difference is the same as the sign (+/&#x2212;) of the present power difference.

Alternatively, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may retrieve the previous value of the first measured output power to determine the previously calculated power difference. In the case where the sign (+/&#x2212;) of the previously calculated power difference is different from the sign (+/&#x2212;) of the present power difference, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may determine whether the magnitude of the previously calculated power difference is greater than the magnitude of the present power difference. In the case where the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> determine that the magnitude of the present power difference is less than the magnitude of the previous power difference, the present value of the first fine tuning delay setting corresponds to the minimum power difference. However, in the case where the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> determine that the magnitude of the present power difference is greater than the magnitude of the previous power difference, the present value of the first fine tuning delay setting does not correspond to the minimum power difference. Instead, the previous value of the first fine tuning delay setting corresponds to the minimum power difference. Based on the determination that the previous value of the first fine tuning delay setting corresponds to the minimum power difference, the processor <b>28</b> or the controller <b>32</b> may set the first fine tuning delay setting equal to the previous value of the fine tuning delay setting.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As yet another alternative embodiment of the Step <b>712</b> of the method <b>700</b>, the processor <b>28</b> and the controller <b>32</b> may determine that the first measured output power and the second measured output power are substantially equal based on the determination that the sign (+/&#x2212;) of the previously calculated power difference is different from the sign (+/&#x2212;) of the present power difference.

The control of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> may be carried out by the processor <b>28</b>, the controller <b>32</b>, firmware within the digital baseband circuit <b>14</b>, and/or various combinations thereof. Accordingly, the specific description provided herein is a non-limiting example for the purposes of explanation. Accordingly, specific references to the processor <b>28</b> and the controller <b>32</b> are by ways of example and do not exclude the firmware within the digital baseband circuit <b>14</b> from carrying out the described functions.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">As previously discussed, in some embodiments, the fine tuning delay setting temperature compensation adjustment may be determined based on a group delay temperature adjustment function, the present temperature of the envelope tracker power converter <b>16</b> and the calibrated temperature, as described relative to the method <b>1400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A-B</figref>. As a non-limiting example, the method <b>1400</b> depicts a technique for determining a temperature compensation for the fine tuning delay offset setting of the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b>, which may be carried output prior to initiation of a data transmission. (Step <b>1402</b>) In some alternative embodiments of method <b>1400</b>, the fine tuning delay setting temperature adjustment may be carried out periodically between active transmissions of data by the communication device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">As previously discussed, in some embodiments of method <b>1400</b>, a group delay temperature adjustment function may be used to determine the fine tuning delay setting temperature adjustment. As a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> depicts a group delay temperature adjustment function that is described based on a plurality of coupled data measurements sets, wherein each of the plurality of coupled data measurements sets includes a measured temperature and a measured group delay of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> corresponding to the measured temperature. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> depicts a relationship between the overall group delay of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> versus temperature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> depicts that the calibrated temperature is associated with a temperature equal to 26&#xb0; C., which corresponds to a group delay of 13.9 nanoseconds for a modulated signal <b>56</b>, P<sub>IN</sub>, at 10 MHz. An example operating temperature is equal to 56&#xb0; C., which corresponds to a group delay of approximately 13.9 nanoseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The group delay temperature adjustment function may be developed by measuring a number of open loop envelope tracking systems <b>12</b>. In other embodiments, the plurality of coupled data measurements sets may be obtained based on a simulation of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b>. In addition, the group delay temperature adjustment function may be adjusted based on temperature characteristics of the integrated circuits of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> may have one or more group delay temperature adjustment functions, where each of the group delay temperature adjustment functions may depend on an operational mode of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b>. For example, the group delay temperature adjustment function may depend upon a frequency content of the modulated signal <b>56</b>, P<sub>IN</sub>, which may be related to a band of operation assigned to a communication device <b>10</b> in a communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">As a non-limiting example, a plurality of coupled data measurements sets may be provided in a memory location accessible to the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b>, wherein each of the plurality of coupled data measurements sets includes a measured temperature and a measured group delay of the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> corresponding to the measured temperature. (Step <b>1404</b>) The processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may obtain a calibrated temperature stored in association with the calibrated fine tuning offset delay setting. (Step <b>1406</b>) Thereafter, as previously described above, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may obtain an operating temperate from the envelope tracker power converter <b>16</b>. (Step <b>1408</b>) The operating temperature represents the present temperature of the envelope tracker power converter <b>16</b>. In some alternative embodiments, where the open loop envelope tracking system <b>12</b> is a module or a single integrated chip, the operating temperature may represent a present temperature of the module or the single integrated chip. The operating temperature may be obtained as either a digital temperature measurement or an analog temperature measurement, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Based on the operating temperature, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may determine a first coupled data point measurements set from among the plurality of coupled data measurements sets having a measured temperature nearest the operating temperature. (Step <b>1410</b>) For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the first coupled data point measurement set may correspond to a coupled data measurement set having a measured temperature of 60&#xb0; C. and a group delay of 14 nanoseconds. Based on the operating temperature, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may determine a second coupled data point measurements set from among the plurality of coupled data measurements sets having a measured temperature nearest the operating temperature. (Step <b>1412</b>) For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the second coupled data point measurement set may correspond to a coupled data measurement set having a measured temperature of 40&#xb0; C. and a group delay of around 13.75 nanoseconds. The processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may interpolate between the first coupled data point measurements set and the second coupled data point measurements set based on the operating temperature to obtain an operating temperature group delay. (Step <b>1414</b>) In some embodiments, the interpolation function may be a linear interpolation function.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Based on the calibrated temperature, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may determine a third coupled data point measurements set from among the plurality of coupled data measurements sets having a measured temperature nearest the calibrated temperature. (Step <b>1416</b>) For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the third coupled data point measurement set may correspond to a coupled data measurement set having a measured temperature of 20&#xb0; C. and a group delay of approximately 13.4 nanoseconds. Based on the operating temperature, the processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may determine a fourth coupled data point measurements set from among the plurality of coupled data measurements sets having a measured temperature nearest the calibrated temperature. (Step <b>1418</b>) For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the fourth coupled data point measurement set may correspond to a coupled data measurement set having a measured temperature of 40&#xb0; C. and a group delay of 13.75 nanoseconds. The processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may interpolate between the third coupled data point measurements set and the fourth coupled data point measurements set based on the operating temperature to obtain a calibrated fine tuning delay group delay. (Step <b>1420</b>) In some embodiments, the interpolation function may be a linear interpolation function. The processor <b>28</b> or controller <b>32</b> may then subtract the operating temperature group delay from the calibrated fine tuning delay group delay to obtain a fine tuning delay setting temperature compensation adjustment. (Step <b>1422</b>) Illustratively, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the fine tuning delay setting temperature compensation adjustment would be equal to approximately 0.4 nanoseconds, which may be used to adjust the fine tuning delay setting of the fine tuning delay circuit <b>72</b> in order to maintain a minimum group delay mismatch.</p>
