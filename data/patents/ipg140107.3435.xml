<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 35 U.S. &#xa7;371 national stage filing of International Application No. PCT/IB2010/053269, filed Jul. 19, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-173693, filed Jul. 24, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a power converter that receives a plurality of substantially same potentials and supplies power to a plurality of loads, and a vehicle lighting device, a vehicle headlight and a vehicle using the power converter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing power converters receive a single input and output a single output. However, as power sources or loads become more diverse, the need to generate a plurality of outputs in response to a plurality of inputs (which are input at various times) is becoming desirable. Particularly, in the field of a power converters mounted in vehicles, various control units have been integrated, and multi-input multi-output devices are becoming more desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a power converter that controls loads of two systems as an example of a vehicle lighting device having a plurality of light sources. The power converter receives a power <b>1</b> directly connected to a vehicle battery BT. A controller area network (CAN) communication <b>2</b> which is a vehicle communication controller, controls a light emitting diode (LED) <b>3</b> (reading light) and an LED <b>4</b> (foot light) of two systems. The respective inputs are received by an input connection unit <b>10</b>, and an output is output to the LEDs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> of two systems via an output connection unit <b>11</b>. The power converter is configured to include first and second power converting units <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> for converting a voltage of the battery directly-connected power <b>1</b> into a certain current required by the LEDs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, a control unit <b>7</b> for controlling the first and second power converting units <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, a control power supply unit <b>5</b> that receives the battery directly-connected power <b>1</b> and outputs the power <b>1</b> to the control unit <b>7</b>, and a transceiver <b>6</b> that receives the CAN communication <b>2</b> notifying lighting timing of the LEDs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. The control unit <b>7</b> controls the LEDs <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> by receiving detection signals corresponding to output current values from the first and second power converting units <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> and outputting driving signals to the first and second power converting units <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> illustrate the first power converting unit <b>8</b> and the second power converting unit <b>9</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates a configuration of a flyback circuit which is an example of the power converting unit. A direct current (DC) power (a voltage between +B and GND) is received by a condenser C<b>1</b>, and a series circuit of a primary side winding TP<b>1</b> of a transformer T<b>1</b> and a switch element SW<b>1</b> is connected in parallel to the condenser C<b>1</b>. A driving signal of the switch element SW<b>1</b> is input to the power converting unit. A series circuit of a secondary side winding TS<b>1</b> of the transformer T<b>1</b> and a diode D<b>1</b> are connected in parallel to a condenser C<b>2</b>. An output unit is installed to connect a series circuit of a load and a resistor R<b>1</b> in parallel to the condenser C<b>2</b>. An output current is detected by the resistor R<b>1</b> and output as the detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A description will be made below in connection with a circuit operation. A current flows from the condenser C<b>1</b> to the primary side winding TP<b>1</b> of the transformer T<b>1</b> and the switch element SW<b>1</b> at ON timing of the switch element SW<b>1</b>. A direction of the diode D<b>1</b> at the secondary side is set to a direction in which a secondary side current does not flow when the switch element SW<b>1</b> is turned on, so that energy is accumulated in the transformer T<b>1</b>. The energy accumulated in the transformer T<b>1</b> moves from the secondary side winding TS<b>1</b> of the transformer T<b>1</b> to the condenser C<b>2</b> via the diode D<b>1</b> at OFF timing of the switch element SW<b>1</b>. Power is supplied from the condenser C<b>2</b> to the load via the resistor R<b>1</b>. An output current is detected by the resistor R<b>1</b>, and the control unit <b>7</b> adjusts an ON/OFF time of the driving signal of the switch element SW<b>1</b>. Thus, the output current can be constantly controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a configuration of a boosting circuit using an auto transformer which is an example of the power converting unit. A DC power (a voltage between +B and GND) is received by a condenser C<b>3</b>, and a series circuit of a primary side winding TP<b>2</b> of a coil T<b>2</b> and a switch element SW<b>2</b> is connected in parallel to the condenser C<b>3</b>. A driving signal of the switch element SW<b>2</b> is input to the power converting unit. A secondary side winding TS<b>2</b> of the transformer T<b>2</b>, a diode D<b>2</b>, and a condenser C<b>4</b> are connected in series to one another and in parallel to the switch element SW<b>2</b>. The primary side winding TP<b>2</b> and the secondary side winding TS<b>2</b> of the coil T<b>2</b> are wounded to have an additive polarity, and the diode D<b>2</b> is installed in a direction in which a current flows from the power to the output side.

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A description will be made below in connection with a circuit operation.

For this reason, the Acc power <b>12</b> and the IGN power source <b>13</b> are input to a control power supply unit <b>5</b> via diodes D<b>4</b> and D<b>3</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a timing chart of lighting control of both loads by an input change of both powers. The operation is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When both the IGN power source <b>13</b> and the headlight switch power source <b>21</b> are turned off, nothing is input to the control power supply unit <b>5</b>, and both loads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are in an OFF state. When the IGN power source <b>13</b> is turned on when both loads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are in the OFF state, the high side switch <b>22</b> and the switch element SW<b>4</b> are turned on by driving signals d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b>, and the LED <b>25</b> is turned on through the resistor R<b>3</b>. In this case, the resistor R<b>3</b> is supposed to output a predetermined current limited to several milliamperes (mA) to tens of milliamperes (mA) and thus has a resistance in the tens of ohms (&#x3a9;) to thousands of ohms (&#x3a9;) (for example, 680 &#x3a9;).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thereafter, when the headlight switch power source <b>21</b> is turned on, the driving signal d<b>1</b> of the high side switch <b>22</b> is turned off, so that the power supply to the LED <b>25</b> is cut off. Further, a constant current is supplied to the LED <b>26</b> by turning on/off the switch element SW<b>4</b> through the driving signal d<b>2</b> (for example, by driving at tens of kHz to hundreds of kHz). When the switch element SW<b>4</b> is turned on, a current is supplied from the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch to the LED <b>26</b> while flowing through the coil L<b>1</b>, the LED <b>26</b>, the resistor R<b>4</b>, and the switch element SW<b>4</b>. When the switch element SW<b>4</b> is turned off, a regeneration current flows through the coil L<b>1</b>, the LED <b>26</b>, the resistor R<b>4</b>, and the diode D<b>5</b>. A change in the current is detected by the resistor R<b>4</b>, and turning on/off of the switch element SW<b>4</b> is controlled according to the detection signal s<b>1</b>, so that the constant current is implemented. In this case, the resistor R<b>4</b> is used for current detection and has a resistance in the tens of milliohm (m&#x3a9;) to several ohm (&#x3a9;) to reduce a loss in the resistor R<b>4</b> (in the case of a current of 1A, a loss is 10 mW to 1 W).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight is turned on in the OFF state of both loads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>, the constant current is supplied to the LED <b>26</b> by turning on/off the switch element SW<b>4</b> in a state in which the high side switch <b>22</b> remains turned off</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the present embodiment, lighting of the plurality of loads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> can be controlled by the common switch element SW<b>4</b>, and on/off of the load is judged by the power state. Thus, communication including timing for turning on/off the load is unnecessary. Thus, the size and the cost can be reduced compared to the conventional circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(Embodiment 1a)</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When only the power source <b>13</b> linked with the IGN is turned on, the driving signal d<b>2</b> is always in the ON state in Embodiment 1. However, by turning on/off lighting at a frequency (for example, 10 Hz) less than 50 Hz, blinking can be recognized by the human eye, and a glittering feeling can be improved, so that a recognition degree of a driver's vehicle during daylight hours can be improved (there is influence of the afterglow or the like, but when the LED blinks at 60 Hz or more, it looks like a dimming state of DC lighting. If a deviation of a control system or the like is considered, a glittering feeling can be implemented by performing lighting at 50 Hz or less).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A timing chart at this time is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Thus, it is understood that both visibility improvement by blinking control of the LED <b>25</b> and predetermined current control of the LED <b>26</b> can be implemented by the switch element SW<b>4</b>, and the size and the cost can be reduced compared to the case in which control is performed by the individual switch elements. It is understood that when only the IGN power source <b>13</b> is turned on, the same effect can be obtained even though the driving signal d<b>1</b> and the driving signal d<b>2</b> are switched.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(Embodiment 1b)</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, when only the IGN power source <b>13</b> is turned on, by increasing the frequency of the driving signal d<b>2</b> to 60 Hz, blinking is not seen by the human eye, so that dimming lighting can be implemented. When a predetermined current is supplied to the LED <b>25</b> via the resistor R<b>3</b>, the current value depends on the magnitude of the power voltage, but by varying an On duty of a pulse width modulation (PWM) according to the power voltage, it is possible to have substantially the same current during a predetermined time and make a light flux of the LED <b>25</b> substantially the same. In an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as the power voltage decreases, the On duty increases. In this disclosure, a circuit that applies a predetermined current using a resistor also includes the above described control.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">(Embodiment 1c)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In Embodiment 1, the LED is described as the load, but it is understood that the same effect can be obtained even when a halogen lamp <b>27</b> is used as the load instead of the LED <b>25</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this case, the resistor R<b>3</b> may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, in Embodiment 1, the high side switch <b>22</b> is involved in supplying the power from the power source <b>13</b> linked with the IGN to the LED <b>25</b>, but the current may be supplied without the high side switch <b>22</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this case, when both the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight and the power source <b>13</b> linked with the IGN are turned on, the switch element SW<b>4</b> is turned on/off to apply constant current to the LED <b>26</b>. Thus, the halogen lamp <b>27</b> is turned on/off at a high frequency (tens of kHz or more), so that the halogen lamp <b>27</b> can be turned on in the dimming lighting state.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, when the halogen lamp <b>27</b> is used as a width indicator, the power source <b>31</b> linked with the IGN functions as a power source linked with a width indicator switch, and when the headlight switch is turned on, the power from the power source linked with the width indicator switch is not input. Using this system, a state in which both power sources are turned on does not occur, and the high side switch can be removed. Accordingly, the size and the cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">(Embodiment 2)</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a circuit configuration of a power converter according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention. The same components as in Embodiment 1 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and a description thereof will be omitted. A description will be made below in connection with different points from Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the present embodiment, the flyback circuit illustrated in the conventional example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is used as the power converting unit for the LED <b>26</b>. The power converting unit for the LED <b>26</b> illustrated in Embodiment 1 is used as the power converting unit for the LED <b>25</b>, and a resistor RO is connected in series with a diode D<b>5</b>. A coil and a switch element of the power converting unit that supplies power to the LED <b>25</b> are configured with a primary side winding TP<b>1</b> and a switch element SW<b>1</b> of a flyback circuit that supplies to power to the LED <b>26</b>. A control unit <b>7</b> outputs a driving signal d<b>3</b> for driving the switch element SW<b>1</b>. The control unit <b>7</b> detects an output current to the LED <b>25</b> and an output current to the LED <b>26</b> by a resistor R<b>4</b> and a resistor R<b>1</b> as a detection signal s<b>1</b> and a detection signal s<b>2</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Operation of the control unit <b>7</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. When a power source <b>13</b> linked with an IGN is input, the control unit <b>7</b> detects the turning on of the power source <b>13</b> through the detecting unit <b>23</b> and outputs a PWM signal for driving the switch element SW<b>1</b> from the driving signal d<b>3</b>. Thus, the constant current is output to the LED <b>25</b>. The output current is detected by the resistor R<b>4</b> as the detection signal s<b>1</b>, and an ON time and an OFF time of the PWM signal are controlled, so that the constant current control is implemented. Further, blinking lighting of the LED <b>25</b> is performed by repetitively performing the constant current control at a certain frequency (for example, 10 Hz), a glittering feeling of the LED <b>25</b> is improved, and the recognition degree of a driver's vehicle is improved. Thereafter, when the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch is input, voltages of both terminals of the LED <b>25</b> have the same potential, so that the LED <b>25</b> is turned off. The input of the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch is detected by the detecting unit <b>24</b>, and the PWM signal for driving the switch element SW<b>1</b> from the driving signal d<b>3</b> is output. Thus, the constant current is output to the LED <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The output current is detected using the resistor R<b>1</b> as the detection signal s<b>2</b>, and the ON time and the OFF time of the PWM signal are controlled, so that the constant current control is implemented. Thereafter, the PWM signal of the driving signal d<b>3</b> is switched in tandem while turning on/off of the headlight switch. When the IGN power source <b>13</b> is turned off in a state in which both the IGN power source <b>13</b> and the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch are turned on, a reverse voltage is applied to the LED <b>25</b>, but the LED <b>25</b> remains turned off. When the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch is turned on in a state in which both the IGN power source <b>13</b> and the power linked with the headlight switch are turned off, the LED <b>26</b> is subjected to the constant current control by the driving signal d<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Through the above described circuit configuration and control, it is possible to share the switch element and the coil which are relatively large-scale components in the power converting unit for controlling the outputs to the LED <b>25</b> and the LED <b>26</b>. Thus, both loads can be controlled by the same switch element and coil, and thus the size and the cost of the lighting device can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Typically, the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch is turned on in a state in which the IGN power source <b>13</b> is turned on. In this case, both an anode side and a cathode side of the LED <b>25</b> are connected to the power sources, and potentials of both sides become equal at a vehicle battery voltage (several voltages to a score of voltages), so that a voltage applied to the LED <b>25</b> becomes zero. Thus, the LED <b>25</b> can be automatically turned off without depending on the state of the switch element SW<b>1</b>, and the communication function or the power monitoring function can be removed, so that the size and the cost can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Power of the headlight is about 35 W, and power of the DTRL is about 5 W. The flyback circuit having a boosting capability is suitable for outputting power higher than a power converting circuit having no boosting capability. Thus, the LED <b>26</b> is used as the headlight, and the LED <b>25</b> is used as the DTRL.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the present embodiment, the IGN power source <b>13</b> and the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch are used as the input. However, it is understood that even when any other power source (a power source directly connected to a battery or linked with an accessory) is added to supply power to another load, or communication such as LIN/CAN is used for load control, the same effect can be obtained. Further, it is understood that even when a power source is not added but switched (a power source linked with the IGN becomes a power directly connected to a battery or a power source linked with an accessory), the same effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present embodiment, it is understood that the LED is used as the load, but even when a light source such as a halogen lamp or a high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp is used as the load, the same effect can be obtained. It is understood that even when the power converter is for power supply to other electronic units, not the light source, the same effect can be obtained. For example, the power converter has a function as a power source for a DC/AC converter enabling an alternating current (AC) powered device to be used within a vehicle or for an engine control unit (ECU) having a higher voltage as an input.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment, the constant current control is performed as a control for the LED. Even when control such as constant voltage control or constant power control is performed instead of the constant current control, the same effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, it is understood that even when a circuit of the resistor R<b>4</b>, the transformer T<b>1</b>, the switch element SW<b>1</b>, the diode D<b>1</b>, and the condenser C<b>2</b> constitute a circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an effect which is the same as that of the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be obtained. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a coil TP<b>1</b>&#x2032; is used which is further wound in the same direction as the primary side winding TP<b>1</b>. Thus, it is possible to easily increase an inductance value of the coil when the LED <b>25</b> is turned on and to facilitate predetermined current control.</p>

The same components as in Embodiment 2 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and thus a description thereof will be omitted. A description is made below in connection with different points from Embodiment 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The LED <b>26</b> is replaced with a HID lamp <b>33</b>. In order to turn on the HID lamp <b>33</b>, an igniter <b>32</b> for applying a high voltage pulse is installed ahead of the HID lamp <b>33</b>. In order to turn on the HID lamp <b>33</b> by a rectangular wave, a full bridge inverter <b>31</b> for converting an output of the flyback circuit into the rectangular wave is installed behind the flyback circuit. A detection signal s<b>3</b> for detecting a lamp voltage is input to the control unit <b>7</b>. Driving signals d<b>5</b> and d<b>6</b> for controlling the full bridge inverter <b>31</b> are output from the control unit <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A circuit for applying a predetermined current to the LED <b>25</b> includes three components, a resistor R<b>5</b>, a coil TP<b>1</b>, and a switch element SW<b>1</b> which are installed in series with the LED <b>25</b>. In this case, a resistance value is in a range of hundreds of ohms (&#x3a9;) to several kilohm (k&#x3a9;) since a current has a predetermined value (a voltage value of the IGN power source <b>13</b>-<i>a </i>forward voltage drop Vf of the LED <b>25</b>)/(a resistance value of the resistor R<b>5</b>). Since control for causing a predetermined current to flow in the resistor R<b>5</b> is realized by the resistor R<b>5</b>, the detection signal s<b>1</b> for the LED current, the detecting unit <b>14</b>, and the current detecting resistor R<b>4</b> are not provided, unlike other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An operation of the control unit <b>7</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. When the power source <b>13</b> linked with the IGN is input, the control unit <b>7</b> detects turning on of the IGN power source <b>13</b> through the detecting unit <b>23</b> and outputs the PWM signal for driving the switch element SW<b>1</b> by the driving signal d<b>3</b>. At this time, the PWM signal is an ON/OFF signal of tens of Hz (for example, 10 Hz) so that the driver's vehicle is made more visible by highlighting the glittering feeling by blinking the LED <b>25</b>. Thus, a predetermined current is supplied to the LED <b>25</b></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thereafter, when the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch is input, voltages of both terminals of the LED <b>25</b> have the same potential, and thus the LED <b>25</b> is turned off. The input of the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch is detected by the detecting unit <b>24</b>, and the PWM signal for driving the switch element SW<b>1</b> by the driving signal d<b>3</b> is output (when the HID lamp <b>33</b> is turned on, driving is performed at tens of kHz to hundreds of kHz). By varying on/off of the PWM signal by the values of the detected lamp voltage and lamp current, constant power is supplied to the HID lamp <b>33</b>. Another control such as a pulse output at the start time is necessary for turning on the HID lamp <b>33</b>, but a description thereof will be here omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thereafter, the PWM signal of the driving signal d<b>3</b> is switched in tandem with turning on/off of the headlight switch. When the IGN power source <b>13</b> is turned off in a state in which both the IGN power source <b>13</b> and the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch are turned on, a reverse voltage is applied to the LED <b>25</b>, but the LED <b>25</b> remains off. When the headlight switch is turned on in a state in which both the IGN power source <b>13</b> and the power source <b>21</b> linked with the headlight switch are turned off, only the HID lamp <b>33</b> is controlled by the driving signal d<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Through the above described circuit configuration and control, it is possible to share the switch element and the coil which are relatively large-scale components in the power converting unit for controlling the outputs to the LED <b>25</b> and the HID lamp <b>33</b>. Thus, both loads can be controlled by the same switch element and coil, and thus the size and the cost of the lighting device can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Typically, the headlight switch is turned on in a state in which the IGN power source is turned on. In this case, both an anode side and a cathode side of the LED <b>25</b> are connected to the power, and potentials of both sides become equal at a vehicle battery voltage (several voltages to a score of volts), so that a voltage applied to the LED <b>25</b> becomes zero. Thus, turning off can be automatically performed without depending on the state of the switch element SW<b>1</b>, and the communication function or the power monitoring function can be removed, so that the size and the cost can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, the circuit for turning on the LED <b>25</b> can be simplified compared to Embodiment 2, and thus the size and the cost can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present embodiment, when the LED <b>25</b> is turned on, blinking lighting is performed in order to improve the recognition degree of the driver's vehicle. However, it is understood that when only the power source <b>13</b> linked with the IGN is input, even though lighting is constantly performed or dimming lighting is performed at a higher frequency, the same effect can be obtained.</p>
