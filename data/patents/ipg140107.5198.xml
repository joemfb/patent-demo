<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of and priority to previously filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/974,062, filed Sep. 20, 2007, which is entitled &#x201c;Apparatus and Methods For Charging An Implanted Medical Device Power Source&#x201d; and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Inventions</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present inventions relate generally to apparatus and methods for charging the rechargeable batteries (and/or other rechargeable power sources) in implanted medical devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of power consuming medical devices may be implanted into a patient. Examples of such implantable medical devices include, but are not limited to, microstimulators (e.g. occipital nerve stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators, and stimulators that may be positioned at various locations to treat rheumatoid arthritis), implantable pulse generators, drug infusion pumps, speech processors, pacemakers and defibrillators. In addition to their therapeutic and/or diagnostic components, the implantable medical devices include rechargeable power sources such as rechargeable batteries, capacitors, and combinations thereof. The length of time that an implantable medical device can operate between chargings of the rechargeable power source varies from device to device. For example, pacemaker batteries may only need to be recharged every few years, while microstimulators (e.g. an occipital nerve stimulator) may need to be recharged several times a day.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors have determined that conventional methods and apparatus for charging the rechargeable power sources in implanted medical devices are susceptible to improvement. For example, the present inventors have determined that conventional methods and apparatus for charging the rechargeable power sources can involve the use of large and bulky chargers that are difficult to incorporate into daily life. The present inventors have also determined that it can be difficult to maintain the proper position of conventional chargers on the body relative to the implanted medical device.</p>

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a medical device <b>10</b>, having an external housing <b>12</b>, an internal inductor <b>14</b> (e.g. a conductive coil and a core of air or a ferromagnetic material), a rechargeable power source <b>16</b>, and power consuming apparatus (e.g. a controller <b>18</b> and electrodes or other therapeutic devices <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>), may be implanted in a patient P. Examples of medical devices that may be implanted into a patient include, but are not limited to, occipital nerve stimulators, such as that illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 6,735,474, other microstimulators, implantable pulse generators, drug infusion pumps, speech processors, pacemakers and defibrillators. The power source <b>16</b> in the medical device <b>10</b> may be charged with a charging appliance <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">The exemplary charging appliance <b>22</b>, all or part of which may be positioned on or near the patient in close proximity to the implanted medical device <b>10</b>, includes one or more inductors <b>24</b> (herein after &#x201c;inductor&#x201d;), inductor related circuitry <b>25</b> (e.g. tuning capacitors, switches and temperature sensors), a power supply <b>26</b> (e.g. a primary battery, a replenishable or rechargeable battery such as a lithium ion battery, an electrolytic capacitor, a super- or ultra-capacitor, or some other power supply), a controller <b>28</b> and a user interface <b>30</b>. In those instances where the power supply is replenishable or rechargeable, apparatus for replenishing or recharging the power source (e.g., an RF link, an optical link, a thermal link, or other energy-coupling link, may be provided. The user interface <b>30</b> may consist of any suitable instrumentality including, for example, one or more buttons, a touch screen, one or more LEDs (or other visible indicators), and a buzzer (or other sound emitting device) or a vibrating mechanism. The power source <b>16</b> in the implanted medical device <b>10</b> may be charged by transferring power from the power supply <b>26</b> to the implanted power source <b>16</b> by way of the inductors <b>14</b> and <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0148">As is described in greater detail below, the charging appliance <b>22</b> (or at least a portion thereof) may be carried by, part of, secured to and/or otherwise related to an apparatus that is associated with the patient's everyday life. For example, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the inductor <b>24</b> and inductor related circuitry <b>25</b> may be incorporated into a device <b>32</b> that is carried by, part of, or secured to an apparatus that is associated with the patient's everyday life, while the power supply <b>26</b>, controller <b>28</b>, and user interface <b>30</b> will be included in a remote housing <b>34</b> that is connected to the inductor <b>24</b> by a cable <b>36</b> with an output line and a return line. The cable connection may, however, be replaced by wireless connection in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and in each of the embodiments described below that includes a cable connection. Alternatively, in the exemplary charging appliance <b>22</b><i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the inductor <b>24</b>, inductor related circuitry <b>25</b>, power supply <b>26</b>, controller <b>28</b>, and user interface <b>30</b> may be part of the same device <b>32</b><i>a</i>, which has a single common housing and may be carried by, part of, or secured to an apparatus that is associated with the patient's everyday life.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0149">The actual position of the inductor will depend on the location of the implanted medical device. An inductor that is positioned adjacent to the back of the neck may be used, for example, to charge the power source in an occipital nerve stimulator or an implantable pulse generator (IPG) with one or more leads for trigeminal nerve stimulation or deep brain stimulation. An inductor that is positioned near the front or side portion of the neck may be used, for example, to charge the power source in a vagus nerve stimulator. An inductor that is positioned on or behind the ear may be used, for example, to charge the power source in an IPG with one or more leads (e.g. for trigeminal nerve stimulation) implanted behind ear or to charge the power source in a cochlear implant, while an inductor that is positioned on or in front of the ear may be used, for example, to charge the power source in an auriculotemporal nerve stimulator. Inductors that are positioned on or adjacent to the chin or forehead may be used, for example, to charge the power source in a trigeminal nerve stimulator. Inductors that are positioned at various locations around the waist may be used, for example, to charge the power source in an ilioinguinal nerve stimulator or the power source in an IPG that is mounted at or near buttocks with leads that may be used in any of a wide variety of stimulation therapies. An inductor that is positioned just below the chest may be used, for example, to charge the power source in an intercostal nerve stimulator or the power source in a phrenic nerve stimulator. Inductors that are positioned on or adjacent to other portions of the torso (e.g. beneath the axilla, on the upper chest near the shoulder, or in the mid-back area) may be used, for example, to charge the power source in an IPG with one or more leads for spinal cord stimulation, occipital nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, or to charge the power source in a stimulator implanted to treat post thoracotomy pain. Inductors that are positioned on or adjacent to joints (e.g. the knee or the wrist) may be used, for example, to charge the power sources in stimulators that treat rheumatoid arthritis. An inductor that is positioned on or adjacent to the pelvic region may be used, for example, to charge the power source in a pudendal nerve stimulator.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">It should also be noted that a wide variety of inductors <b>24</b> may be employed. By way of example, the inductor <b>24</b><i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> includes a coil <b>38</b> and a ferromagnetic core <b>40</b>, while the inductor <b>24</b><i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> includes the coil <b>38</b> and an air core. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>includes a relatively flat, tightly wound coil <b>42</b> and a ferromagnetic core <b>44</b>. In each instance, the dimensions of the inductor may depend on the dimensions of the underlying charging appliance. For example, the inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>may have a relatively small diameter in some of the embodiments described below and a relatively large diameter in others.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">II. Charging Appliances that May be Associated with Wearable Devices</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">Wearable devices are one example of apparatus that charging appliances may be carried by, part of, secured to and/or otherwise associated with. As used herein, a &#x201c;wearable device&#x201d; refers to all clothing (or &#x201c;garments&#x201d;), clothing clasps, costumes, harnesses, jewelry, piercings, hats and other head coverings, eye glasses, uniforms, sporting goods that are carried by the body or are otherwise worn, prosthetics, footwear and shoe inserts, protective gear, bags (e.g. a backpack or purse), externally worn medical devices and externally worn non-medical electronic devices (e.g. headphones). Regardless of the type of wearable device, the wearable device and charging appliance will cooperatively position the associated inductor in close proximity to the implanted medical device to facilitate charging in, for example, the manner described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, an exemplary charging appliance <b>100</b> includes a magnetic clasp <b>102</b> that carries one or more inductors and inductor related circuitry (e.g. inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>and related circuitry <b>25</b>) and a remote housing <b>104</b> that carries the power supply and control apparatus (e.g. the power supply <b>26</b>, controller <b>28</b> and user interface <b>30</b>). A cable <b>106</b> connects the inductor and inductor related circuitry carried by the magnetic clasp <b>102</b> to the power supply and control apparatus carried by the remote housing <b>104</b>. The cable <b>106</b> may be replaced by wireless connection in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> and in each of the embodiments described below that includes a cable connection. The magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may be secured to a shirt or blouse collar <b>108</b>, any other garment or portion thereof, or any other wearable device, while the remote housing <b>104</b> includes a clip <b>110</b> that allows the remote housing to be mounted on, for example, a belt or other article of clothing.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">The exemplary magnetic clasp <b>102</b> in the illustrated embodiment has a main portion <b>112</b>, which includes the inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>and related circuitry <b>25</b>, and a backing <b>114</b>, which cooperates with the main portion to secure the magnetic clasp to the collar <b>108</b>. The inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>and inductor related circuitry <b>25</b> may be molded into an epoxy, silicone, or urethane structure that is carried within a plastic case <b>116</b>, thereby electrically insulating the main portion <b>112</b> from the wearer. Alternatively, the inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>and inductor related circuitry <b>25</b> may be carried within a polycarbonate case, that is itself coated with an insulating encapsulate such as silicone, rubber-like polymers, Teflon, and other plastics. Here too, the main portion <b>112</b> will be electrically insulated from the wearer. Turning to the backing, the exemplary backing <b>114</b> consists of a magnet <b>118</b> that is carried within a plastic housing <b>120</b> and attracted to the ferromagnetic core <b>44</b> of the inductor <b>24</b><i>c</i>. The backing may, alternatively, consist solely of a magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">The magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may, in some implementations, be provided with apparatus that centers the main portion <b>112</b> relative to the backing <b>114</b>. In the exemplary implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the main portion <b>112</b> includes a post <b>122</b> that is configured to pass through the associated article of clothing (i.e. is relatively sharp and thin) and the backing <b>114</b> includes an aperture <b>124</b> that is configured to receive the post. It should also be noted here that the main portion and the backing may, alternatively, be secured to one another through the use of non-magnetic instrumentalities, such as a snap, a button or thread, and that the backing <b>114</b> may be omitted and the main portion <b>112</b> secured to a garment or other wearable device with pins, hooks, buttons, clasps, buckles, clips, snaps or any other suitable mechanical fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">With respect to use, and as illustrated for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the main portion <b>112</b> of the exemplary magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may be placed on the inner surface of the collar <b>108</b>, so that the inductor <b>24</b><i>c </i>is close to the implanted medical device, while the backing <b>114</b> may be placed on the outer surface of the collar under the collar flap. As a result, the cable <b>106</b> will be located within the shirt or blouse and the charging appliance <b>100</b> will be completely, or almost completely depending on the location of the remote housing <b>104</b>, out of sight. The wearer may then charge the power source of the implanted medical device by operating the user interface on the remote housing <b>104</b> (e.g. by pressing a button). The locations of the main portion <b>112</b> and backing <b>114</b> may also be reversed, so that the cable <b>106</b> will be located on the outside of the shirt or blouse, if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">The charging appliance <b>100</b> may, of course, be used in combination with a wide variety of garments. By way of example, but not limitation, the charging appliance <b>100</b> may be used in combination with necktie <b>126</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), a coat <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a scarf <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), a turtleneck collar <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) so as to position an inductor adjacent to a medical device that is implanted within the neck.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">The charging appliance <b>100</b> may also be secured to caps, hats, helmets and other items that are typically worn on the head. One such hat, which is generally represented by reference numeral <b>134</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, includes a main portion <b>136</b>, an inner rim <b>137</b> and a bill <b>138</b>. The magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may be attached to any part of the main portion <b>136</b>, the inner rim <b>137</b> (as shown), or the bill <b>138</b>. Another exemplary hat is the safari hat <b>140</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, which includes a main portion <b>142</b>, a bill (not shown), and flap <b>144</b> that shades the back of the neck. In addition to the main portion <b>142</b> and the bill, the magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may be attached to the flap <b>144</b> (as shown).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">Turning to helmets, one example of a helmet to which the charging appliance <b>100</b> may be secured is the bicycle helmet <b>146</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, which includes a main portion <b>148</b> (e.g. a hard shell with an inner padded liner), a chin strap <b>150</b> and side straps <b>152</b> that are positioned in front of and behind the ear. The magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may be attached to the chin strap <b>150</b> (as shown), or to one of the side straps <b>152</b>, or to the main portion <b>148</b>. An exemplary equestrian helmet <b>154</b>, which includes a main portion <b>156</b> (e.g. a hard shell with an inner padded liner), a chin strap <b>158</b> and side straps <b>160</b> that are positioned in front of and behind the ear, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Here too, the magnetic clasp <b>102</b> may be attached to the chin strap <b>158</b> or to one of the side straps <b>160</b> (as shown).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">The charging appliance <b>100</b> may also be secured to belts and belt-like devices. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the charging appliance <b>100</b> may be secured to a belt <b>162</b> that includes an elongate strap <b>164</b>, which is sized to encircle the wearer's waist, and a mechanism to fasten one portion of the strap to another (e.g. the holes <b>166</b> and buckle <b>168</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, the magnetic clasp <b>102</b> is secured to one portion of the elongate strap <b>164</b>, while the clip <b>110</b> may be used to secure the remote housing <b>104</b> to another portion of the strap. A heart rate monitor <b>170</b> is one example of a belt-like device to which the charging appliance <b>100</b> may be secured. The exemplary heart rate monitor includes a sensor/display apparatus <b>172</b>, an elongate strap <b>174</b> formed from an elastomeric material such as that sold under the trade name Neoprene, and a mechanism to fasten one portion of the strap to another such as hook and loop strips <b>176</b> and <b>178</b> (e.g. the fastener strips commonly sold under the trade name Velcro). Here, the magnetic clasp <b>102</b> is secured to the elongate strap <b>174</b>. The heart rate monitor <b>170</b> will typically be positioned around the wearer's torso just below the chest. A similar constructed fetal monitor (not shown) is another example of a belt-like device to which the charging appliance <b>100</b> may be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">A joint brace, such as those commonly used to support the wrist, elbow, ankle or knee, is another example of a type of device to which the charging appliance <b>100</b> may be secured. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, one specific example of a joint brace is the knee brace <b>180</b>, which includes a cuff <b>182</b> formed from an elastomeric material such as that sold under the trade name Neoprene, an opening <b>184</b> for the wearer's patella, and adjustable straps <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">The exemplary charging appliances illustrated in FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>3</b>-<b>17</b> above and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64-95</figref> and <b>100</b> below include an inductor and inductor related circuitry which are located remotely from, and connected by a cable (or wireless connection) to, the user interface, controller and power supply.

The band <b>746</b> may also be provided in a variety of colors in order to allow the band color to be matched to the wearer's hair color.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0249">In other implementations, the spring biased reel <b>748</b> may be replaced with a reel that has a handle which may be turned to reduce the exposed length of the band <b>746</b>, a ratchet which maintains the band at the desired exposed length, and a ratchet release button which allows the exposed length of the band to be increased. The reel may also be omitted. Here, the length of the band <b>746</b> will be fixed. Regardless of the type of reel, or lack thereof, the other end of the band <b>746</b> may be releasably secured to the housing through the used of a twist lock arrangement instead of the above-described latch element <b>754</b>, latch <b>756</b> and release button <b>760</b>. The end of the band <b>746</b> opposite the reel may also be permanently secured to the housing. Here, the dull needle <b>752</b> may be omitted and, instead of threading the band <b>746</b> through the hair, the band <b>746</b> will simply be worn like a conventional hair band or sweat band.</p>
