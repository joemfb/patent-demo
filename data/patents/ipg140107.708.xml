<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The presently disclosed principles and inventions are related to interchangeable earrings for individuals with pierced sensitive or allergic ears.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Earrings are typically sold to consumers as finished products. Individuals with sensitive ears have restricted choices when shopping for earrings as many individuals with sensitive pierced ears can only wear products made of platinum or 14 kt gold up to 24 kt gold metals. There have been several attempts to modify earrings and create interchangeable jewelry. Erickson (U.S. Pat. No. 4,781,036) describes an earring in which an ornament can screw on and off from the base post. Green (U.S. Pat. No. 5,927,104) describes an earring in which the front ornament can screw on and off, being replaced with various front ornaments. Monahan (U.S. Pat. No. US 2009/0282867 A1) describes a kit consisting of interchangeable ornaments which can be placed individually or in combination to create an earring or necklace, organized in a designated box. Lichtenstien (U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,176) describes an interchangeable earring consisting of a looped pin secured to the earlobe and a kit containing pieces to assemble an ornament designed to attach to the looped pin. These inventions are different mechanically as they do not use a magnetic clasp to secure the ornament to the post or wire. They also are not said to be exclusively made of platinum, titanium or 14 kt gold through 24 kt gold metals, which would make them unacceptable for individuals to wear in sensitive pierced ears. These inventions are different in purpose, as the earrings described are not for specific use for individuals with allergic or sensitive earlobes, and are also different in mechanical function.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one general aspect, the invention provides an earring having a rod member passable through an ear-pierced hole of a wearer, a housing connected to the rod member, and a magnetic member positioned within the housing</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one specific aspect, the rod member is made of a high-quality non-allergenic material, and a low cost ornament can be attached thereto by the magnetic member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another specific aspect, the earring further includes an ornamental attachment piece having an attachment member configured to removably attach to the magnetic member so as to removably and interchangeably secure the ornamental attachment piece to the housing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent the same or similar elements, and, initially, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in which an exemplary post-style earring <b>10</b> is illustrated. As shown in the figures, post-style earring <b>10</b> preferably includes a post-style earring rod <b>12</b> securely attached to the housing <b>14</b>, an earring backing <b>16</b> slidably movable along the earring rod <b>12</b>, and a magnet <b>18</b> inserted into and fixedly secured within housing <b>14</b>. In use, the earring backing <b>16</b> is removed from the earring rod <b>12</b> to enable the wearer to insert the earring rod into a pierced ear hole. The backing is then placed back onto the earring rod and is slidably moved along the rod so as to secure a wearer's earlobe between the backing <b>16</b> and the housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the preferred embodiment, the earring rod <b>12</b> is made of a non-allergenic material, for example, platinum or 14-24 Kt gold, so as to prevent skin sensitivity of a wearer. The housing preferably has a cylindrical shape with a hollow interior and is made of a non-ferrous material. Magnet <b>18</b> is preferably disc-shaped and is secured within the housing with an adhesive. The magnet is preferably 3 mm-10 mm in diameter. It should be understood by a person skilled in the art that in a simplified embodiment, magnet <b>18</b> may be directly secured to the earring rod <b>12</b> without the use of housing <b>14</b>. Similarly, it should be understood that, although the magnet and the housing are described as being circular and cylindrical in shape, respectively, any other shape can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an interchangeable ornamental knob attachment <b>20</b> removably attachable to the post-style earring <b>10</b> is provided in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention. Ornamental knob attachment <b>20</b> preferably includes a front decorative side <b>22</b>, a rear panel <b>24</b> and an aperture <b>26</b> formed at the rear panel. Aperture <b>26</b> is shaped as an elongated tunnel having a length and a width, the width of the tunnel being is sized to snugly fit the housing <b>14</b> therein and the length of the tunnel being longer than a diameter of the housing. The tunnel preferably includes a ferrous metal portion <b>28</b> and a non-ferrous portion <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when housing <b>14</b> of the post-style earring <b>10</b> is inserted into the aperture <b>26</b>, it is positioned such that magnet <b>18</b> is located adjacent to the ferrous metal portion <b>28</b>, thereby magnetically attracting each other and removably attaching post-style earring <b>10</b> to the ornamental attachment <b>20</b>. Any suitable material can be used to manufacture the ornamental attachment. Because there is a space between the ornamental attachment and a wearer's skin, the material of the attachment is not placed into direct contact with the wearer's skin, and no allergic reaction occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although in the above-described embodiment the ornamental attachment <b>20</b> is secured to the post-style earring <b>10</b> by means of the aperture <b>26</b> and the inserted therein housing <b>14</b> with magnet <b>18</b>, it should be understood by a person skilled in the art that the removable attachment can be also be accomplished by simply forming at least a portion of the rear panel <b>24</b> of a ferrous metal and attaching magnet <b>18</b> to this portion of the rear panel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In use, a wearer would remove the earring backing from the earring rod <b>12</b>, insert the rod into an earring hole, and secure the earring <b>10</b> with the backing <b>16</b>. The wearer would then secure the ornamental attachment <b>20</b> to the earring <b>10</b>, thus creating a complete earring look. If the wearer decides to change the look, he/she can simply exchange one ornamental attachment <b>20</b> for another without changing the earring <b>10</b> and without risking an allergic reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, an exemplary hook-style earring <b>30</b> is provided in accordance with this embodiment. Hook-style earring <b>30</b> preferably includes a hook-style earring rod <b>34</b> insertable into a wearer's ear hole. Hook-style earring rod <b>34</b> is preferably made of a non-allergenic material, for example, platinum or 14-24K gold, so as to prevent skin sensitivity or an allergic skin reaction of a wearer. A non-ferrous housing <b>36</b> is removably secured to the earring rod <b>34</b> by a hook and loop attachment mechanism <b>38</b>. Any other suitable attachment mechanism may be utilized to secure housing <b>36</b> to the rod <b>34</b>. Similarly to the first embodiment, housing <b>36</b> is preferably cylindrically-shaped with a hollow interior into which a disc-shaped magnet <b>42</b> is inserted. The magnet is preferably fixedly secured in the housing with an adhesive. Similarly to the above, the diameter of the magnet is preferably between 3 mm and 10 mm. Any other suitable shape of the magnet may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>, an interchangeable ornamental pendant attachment <b>40</b> is provided in accordance with the second preferred embodiment of the invention. Ornamental pendant attachment <b>40</b> preferably includes a decorative member <b>44</b> and an attachment member <b>46</b>. Attachment member <b>46</b> is preferably made from a ferrous metal material so as to form magnetic attraction with the magnet <b>42</b> of the hook-style earring <b>30</b>, thereby, removably attaching the hook-style earring <b>30</b> to the ornamental pendant attachment <b>40</b>. The size and shape of the attachment member <b>46</b> is preferably selected to roughly correspond to the size and shape of the magnet <b>42</b>. Any suitable material can be used to manufacture the ornamental pendant attachment. In the preferred embodiment, the decorative member <b>44</b> is made of a non-ferrous metal material. Because, this material is not placed into direct contact with the wearer's skin, no allergic reaction occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Alternatively, an entire ornamental pendant attachment <b>40</b> can be made from a ferrous metal material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be noted that in both embodiments described above, a magnet provided on the earring portion adheres to a ferrous metal portion provided on the ornamental attachment. Although theoretically this can be reversed (or, alternatively, both sides can include magnets), it is not desirable to provide magnets on the ornamental attachment for two reasons: (1) this creates a greater possibility of assembly errors by providing pieces with incorrectly charged magnets, resulting in magnetic rejection, and (2) when ornamental attachments are stored together with other like attachments or other ferrous metal items, they would unintentionally adhere to one another, possibly damaging each other.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Finally, although the invention is described with respect to the two most popular earring styles, i.e., the post style and the hook style, other earring styles (e.g., lever back earrings, hoop earrings, snap-bar earrings, etc.) can be manufactured in the manner described in the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The figures in this disclosure are conceptual illustrations allowing for an explanation of the present invention. Notably, the figures and examples above are not meant to limit the scope of the present invention to a single embodiment, as other embodiments are possible by way of interchange of some or all of the described or illustrated elements. Moreover, where certain elements of the present invention can be partially or fully implemented using known components, only those portions of such known components that are necessary for an understanding of the present invention are described, and detailed descriptions of other portions of such known components are omitted so as not to obscure the invention. In the present specification, an embodiment showing a singular component should not necessarily be limited to other embodiments including a plurality of the same component, and vice-versa, unless explicitly stated otherwise herein.
