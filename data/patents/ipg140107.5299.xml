<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to vehicles powered by engines and more particularly to a grain cleaning assembly associated with a harvesting vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A grain-harvesting combine includes a header, which cuts the crop and feeds it into a threshing rotor. The threshing rotor rotates within a perforated housing, performing a threshing operation of the grain from the crop directed thereinto. Once the grain is threshed it falls through perforations in the housing onto a grain pan. From the grain pan the grain falls through a set of upper and lower sieves that are known as a cleaning shoe. The sieves are vibrating or oscillating, causing clean grain to fall through for the purposes of collection. A cleaning fan blows air through the sieves, discharging chaff toward the rear of the combine. Crop residue such as straw from the threshing section proceeds through a straw chopper and out the rear of the combine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a combine some of the chaff and straw is mixed with grain after the threshing operation. The cleaning assembly removes these contaminants from the grain. In most harvesting machines the cleaning assembly includes the blower, an upper sieve and a lower sieve. The blower has its own housing, whereas the upper sieve and lower sieve are part of a cleaning shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">What is needed in the art is an efficient and effective way of controlling the cleaning shoe and cleaning fan speeds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides an effective way to control the speeds of the cleaning system in a harvesting machine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention in one form is directed to a method for powering a system in a vehicle, the method including the steps of mechanically coupling, driving and controlling. The mechanically coupling step includes coupling a power unit with at least one primary load, the at least one primary load including a propulsion load. The driving step includes driving a cleaning fan and a cleaning shoe with at least one power source, the at least one power source being mechanically independent from the power unit. The controlling step includes controlling a speed of the at least one power source independent of a speed of the power unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention in another form is directed to a vehicle including a power unit, a cleaning fan, a cleaning shoe, a frame and at least one power source. The power unit is couplable with at least one primary load, the at least one primary load including a propulsion load. The frame provides support for the cleaning fan and the cleaning shoe. The at least one power source is drivingly coupled to the cleaning fan and/or the cleaning shoe. The at least one power source is mechanically independent from the power unit. The at least one power source is independent from the propulsion load.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One of the limiting factors of a combine's productivity is performance of the cleaning shoe. Typical combines have a cleaning shoe and a cleaning fan drive that is operated at a fixed ratio to the engine speed. If the engine speed varies, the fan and cleaning shoe speed vary by precisely the same percentage as the variation of the engine speed. For example the shoe shape frequency may be selected to be 300 rpm when the engine speed is 2200 rpm. The fan speed ratio is variable by the operator over a range, but once the fan speed ratio is set the rpm of the fan is dependent upon the engine rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rated operating speed of an engine is typically 2200 rpm, which is the normal speed where the engine develops the full rated power. The full range of the operating engine speed is typically 2000 rpm to 2340 rpm. This represents a range of +6%/&#x2212;9% in cleaning shoe speed. In many conditions, if the fan speed and shoe shake frequency vary by this amount, it can result in high losses, dirty grain in the tank and even premature shoe frame failure. In harvesting very light grains, like grass seed, if the fan speed increases even slightly, the light grain can be blown out and lost. Further, engine speed variations can occur when the machine varies in its angular attitude relative the ground, such as when traveling up a hill, going down a hill or even when the harvester is turning around at the end of the field. Further, power may drop suddenly or threshing power may drop because the machine is no longer cutting grain, but some of the harvested crop is still passing through the harvesting machine.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, there is shown a powered mechanism such as a working vehicle in the form of an agricultural harvesting machine, such as an agricultural combine <b>10</b>. The powered mechanism can have more than one power unit, such as an engine. The powered mechanism may include a propulsion system to move the powered mechanism from place to place. The working vehicle can also be in the form of a different type of vehicle using a grain cleaning system of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>12</b> with wheels <b>14</b>. Frame <b>12</b> provides support for the various elements of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. Agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> uses a power unit <b>36</b>, in the form of an internal combustion engine to drive the propulsion system including wheels <b>14</b>. The propulsion system places a propulsion load on the power unit, in the form of a direct mechanical load.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">There is attached to frame <b>12</b> a cutting mechanism <b>16</b>, a feeder house <b>18</b>, a cleaning assembly <b>20</b>, a grain tank <b>22</b>, an operator cab <b>24</b> and a grain auger <b>26</b>. Cutting mechanism <b>16</b> extends forward from combine <b>10</b> and serves to feed the harvested product into feeder housing <b>18</b>. Feeder housing <b>18</b> guides the harvested product to a threshing section, a separation section and a cleaning assembly <b>20</b>, which are arranged within harvester <b>10</b>. Engine <b>36</b> powers agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>, which may be in the form of an internal combustion engine and may be referred to as a primary power source <b>36</b>. For ease of understanding engine <b>36</b> is referred to in the singular herein, although it is also contemplated that agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> may have more than one engine.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Feeder housing <b>18</b> guides the harvested product into a threshing section and from there into a separating assembly, not illustrated, and the grain and chaff are then fed to cleaning assembly <b>20</b>. The threshing section may be driven by the engine, which may be the same power unit that provides propulsion power. After the grain is cleaned in cleaning assembly <b>20</b> the clean grain is transferred to grain tank <b>22</b> and the chaff and straw are fed out the rear of combine <b>10</b>. Clean grain is temporarily stored in grain tank <b>22</b> and is unloaded by an operator by way of controls contained in operator cab <b>24</b>. Operator controls contained in cab <b>24</b> allows for the grain to be transferred from grain tank <b>22</b> by way of grain auger <b>26</b> to a transporting vehicle, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Cleaning assembly <b>20</b> includes cleaning fan <b>28</b> and a cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. Cleaning shoe <b>30</b> includes an upper sieve <b>32</b> and a lower sieve <b>34</b>. Sieves <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are moved at a selected frequency to allow for the effective separation of the grain from the crop residue. Cleaning fan <b>28</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is driven by a motor <b>58</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> is driven by a motor <b>60</b>. Motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are power sources for cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. Motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are mechanically independent from the primary power unit. Although depicted as two separate motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, it is also contemplated that one separately driven power source may be configured to drive both cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. Whether one motor, or more, are utilized each of the motors are independent power sources that a controller <b>52</b> controls and which operate at speeds that are independent of the engine speed of the power unit of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. Cleaning shoe <b>30</b> is controlled to operate at a selected speed, which may be between 200 and 400 rpm, and particularly between 250 and 350 rpm. The use of the word &#x201c;independent&#x201d; is used to define that motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are not directly mechanically driven by engine <b>36</b> of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Controller <b>52</b> is part of cleaning control system <b>50</b> which is communicatively and operatively connected to operator controls <b>54</b>, a display <b>56</b>, motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>, and sensors <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. It can be appreciated that controller <b>52</b> may be embodied as firmware or software in a controller that is utilized to control other aspects of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>, as a microprocessor system or as separate electronic circuits dedicated to the control of the grain cleaning system. Operator controls <b>54</b> and display <b>56</b> are located within operator cab <b>24</b> allowing the operator to effectively control the operating speeds of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. Display <b>56</b> provides the operator information relative to the operating conditions of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> by way of sensors <b>62</b>. The operating conditions, such as the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b>, are conveyed from sensors <b>62</b> to controller <b>52</b> to display <b>56</b>, for the display of the information on display <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The operator can adjust conditions of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b>, such as the speed thereof, by way of inputting information on operator controls <b>54</b>. The operator may control the speeds of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> based on the type of crop, which is being harvested by agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. Sensors <b>62</b> may detect not only speed, but other elements and conditions, such as vibration frequencies of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b>, which may indicate bearing degradation or an imbalanced load. The effective control of the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and the speed of cleaning shoe <b>30</b> ensures effective efficient harvesting of the grain while maintaining superior quality of the grain process through cleaning assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Sensors <b>64</b> may sense various attributes of not only cleaning system <b>20</b> but other environmental and performance aspects of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. Even though sensors <b>64</b> are depicted as sensors associated with cleaning control system <b>50</b> the sensors may be a part of other systems of vehicle <b>10</b> and the information is communicated to cleaning control system <b>50</b>. The items sensed included grain damage, grain loss, humidity of the air, barometric pressure, temperature of the air, angular attitude of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> and grain moisture. These and other elements are important to the altering of the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. Feedback of the sensed elements may be automatically controlled by controller <b>52</b> upon criteria contained therein, or by way of information input by the operator, by way of operator controls <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The amount and type of grain damage may be detected by one of sensors <b>64</b> so that the damage that is occurring can be compensated for by cleaning assembly <b>20</b> to reduce the loss of the grain or the information is passed on, by way of controller <b>52</b>, so that other elements effecting the grain damage may be adjusted prior to the grain reaching cleaning system <b>20</b>. A grain loss sensor <b>64</b> detects grain that is being moved beyond cleaning system assembly <b>20</b>, which would indicate that some element of cleaning system <b>20</b> may need to be changed, such as the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or the speed of operation of cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. The humidity of the air can influence the density of the air, which can affect the speed at which cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> may effectively operate. Again, criteria obtained within controller <b>52</b> can be utilized to alter the speed of either cleaning fan <b>28</b> or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> based upon the density of the air which may be reflected partially by the humidity of the air.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The barometric pressure indication will provide information relative to the amount of air being moved through cleaning system <b>20</b> so that the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> may be altered based thereon. A temperature sensor may detect the temperature of the air and/or the temperature of the grain in order to effectively control the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> dependent upon the measured temperatures. The angular attitude of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> alters the angles of sieves <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, which can change the performance thereof. So the information from an angular attitude sensor <b>64</b> can be used by controller <b>52</b> to thereby alter the speeds of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> dependent upon the attitude of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. Grain moisture may influence the seperability and size of the harvested grain causing it to behave differently within cleaning system <b>20</b>, which can then be altered to optimize the recovery of the grain in cleaning system <b>20</b> by the adjusting of the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Cleaning control system <b>50</b> operates cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> independent of engine speed for a load on the engine to thereby reduce variability within cleaning system <b>20</b>. Motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> have shafts that turn at selected speeds under the control of controller <b>52</b> and each of which may have a substantially constant shaft speed independent of the speed of a shaft of engine <b>36</b> and of each other. There being no mechanical linkage directly from a moving portion of engine <b>36</b> to cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> thereby allowing cleaning control system <b>50</b> to operate independent of the speed of engine <b>36</b>. This advantageously allows for optimum performance of cleaning system <b>20</b> regardless of engine speed. The speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> may be set to operate at a default speed unless another speed is input by the operator by way of operator controls <b>54</b>. Further, the information received from sensors <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> can be utilized by controller <b>52</b> to automatically compensate the speeds of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> for optimal performance of cleaning assembly <b>20</b>. Controller <b>52</b> can switch the direction of motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> in order to move grain off of cleaning shoe <b>30</b> for the purpose of starting agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>, for example if grain was left on cleaning shoe <b>30</b> when agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> was powered down.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention eliminates the prior art mechanical drive, which is connected directly to the engine output through a series of belts, chains, pulleys, cranks and/or gears. Motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are independently driven and may be electrical in nature and may controlled by a controller <b>52</b> even if motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> are driven in some other manner, such as hydraulically or pneumatically. The information displayed on display <b>56</b>, for the operator may include the outputs from sensors <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> or selected outputs therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Engine <b>36</b> of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> may include a separate generator that provides power for cleaning control system <b>50</b>. This separate generator may be disengaged from the engine during startup times or other selected operation scenarios of agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>, which may part of a load shedding regime. For example, the cleaning shoe may require approximately 6 kilowatts of power during operation, however very high loads could be experienced when the machine is shut off with grain left on cleaning shoe <b>30</b>. In prior art systems this problem was solved by over-sizing the drive linkage from the engine to the cleaning shoe. To prevent the over-sizing of the electrical portion the present invention, the machine direction of motors <b>58</b> and/or <b>60</b> can be independently operated in the directions opposite to those in normal cleaning operations, for example with cleaning shoe <b>30</b> being reversed to move grain off of cleaning shoe <b>30</b> under less power than prior art systems. Alternatively, cleaning fan <b>28</b> may be driven at a high speed to blow grain and/or debris from cleaning shoe <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously the present invention enables a significant improvement in cleaning shoe and cleaning fan effectiveness. The shoe shake frequency and fan speed are controlled to run at optimum settings for maximum throughput, improved clean grain quality, reduction of structural stress due to excessive shake frequency and reduced power consumption. An additional feature is the ability to adjust shoe shake frequency and blower speed for different crops. With the present invention the frequency of the shoe and speed of the fan for different crops can be selected for optimal cleaning. Additionally, a close control on the range of variation of the selected frequency and speed is obtainable by way of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, there is shown a method <b>100</b> and a method <b>150</b> that operate independently and simultaneously. Method <b>100</b> illustrates an embodiment of a method of the present invention for the control of cleaning control system <b>50</b>. Method <b>150</b> illustrates that a power unit of vehicle <b>10</b> drives a propulsion load, at step <b>152</b>, such as a drive train that includes wheels <b>14</b>. The coupling of a power unit <b>36</b> to a propulsion load may be accomplished by way of a clutch system, not illustrated, to thereby drive the propulsion load. The power unit, which may be the engine <b>36</b> of vehicle <b>10</b> also supplies power to another power source at step <b>154</b>, the power from this power source being used by motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. However, there is no mechanical coupling between engine <b>36</b> and motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> for the driving of motors <b>58</b> and <b>60</b>. It will be appreciated that the particular location and order of execution of the steps may vary depending upon the application and sensor inputs available and deemed applicable to a particular crop.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Method <b>100</b> includes operator inputs being sent to system <b>50</b> at step <b>102</b>, the sensing of grain conditions at step <b>104</b> and the sensing of environmental conditions at step <b>106</b>. These steps can occur substantially simultaneously and depending on the application some may not occur with any regularity or even at all. Any of these steps may initiate the method when new inputs are issued that are then received by step <b>108</b>. At step <b>102</b>, an input to system <b>50</b> is generated by an operator by way of operator controls <b>54</b>. This can, for example, be for an adjustment of the speed of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and/or cleaning shoe <b>30</b> based on operator preference or change in the type of crop or perceived operating conditions. At step <b>104</b>, the condition of the grain is sensed by sensors <b>64</b>, which may include the moisture of the grain, the volume of the grain going through cleaning assembly <b>20</b>, the cleanliness of the grain, cracked grain and other measures of the condition of the grain. At step <b>106</b>, environmental operating conditions are sensed by sensors <b>64</b>, which may include the humidity of the ambient air, the barometric pressure, the attitude of vehicle <b>10</b> and other environmental operating elements related to vehicle <b>10</b>. Further conditions sensed at step <b>106</b> include the detection of a load on engine <b>36</b> and on any other mechanism of vehicle <b>10</b>, which is processed by controller <b>52</b>, to determine if a change in cleaning system <b>20</b> is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At step <b>108</b>, inputs are received by controller <b>52</b> from steps <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>114</b> and <b>122</b> allowing controller <b>52</b> to controllably drive cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> at steps <b>110</b> and <b>118</b>, respectively. At steps <b>112</b> and <b>120</b>, operating conditions of cleaning fan <b>28</b> and cleaning shoe <b>30</b> are respectively sensed. The conditions may include a speed, a vibration or other operating conditions sensed by sensors <b>62</b>. The information gathered by sensors <b>62</b> is conveyed by way of signals at steps <b>114</b> and <b>122</b> to display <b>56</b>, at steps <b>116</b> and <b>124</b>, by way of controller <b>52</b>. The signals sent at steps <b>114</b> and <b>122</b> also serve as inputs to step <b>108</b> and are used to alter the speed of fan <b>28</b> and/or shoe <b>30</b> dependent upon the information. Method <b>100</b> continuously repeats with the elements of cleaning control system <b>50</b> functioning without reference to or being dependent upon an engine speed of engine <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Controlling the speed of fan <b>28</b> and the frequency of shoe <b>30</b> is carried out by controller <b>52</b> utilizing steps <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> for the fan and steps <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> for the shoe. The controlling is dependent upon an input of the operator at step <b>102</b>, or at step <b>106</b> dependent upon information from sensors <b>64</b> regarding a load on engine <b>36</b> or another mechanism of vehicle <b>10</b>. A speed of either fan <b>28</b> or shoe <b>30</b> can be maintained by system <b>50</b> based on operator input at step <b>102</b> or at a default speed stored in a memory of controller <b>52</b>. Further, controller <b>52</b> can drive fan <b>28</b> and/or shoe <b>30</b> in a reverse direction at steps <b>110</b> or <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims.</p>
