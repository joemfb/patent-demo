<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Reference is made to commonly-assigned, co-filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/024,771, filed Feb. 10, 2011, entitled &#x201c;CHIPLET DISPLAY DEVICE WITH SERIAL CONTROL&#x201d; by R. Cok et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to digital display apparatus having a substrate with distributed, independent chiplets for controlling pixels in the display.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many modern computing devices employ graphic user interfaces shown on a display to provide user interaction. The displays can be one of many different peripheral elements controlled by a computer through a communication bus. The core element of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU). The CPU is a stored-program machine that executes software programs stored in memory devices connected to the CPU through the communication bus. Typically, the communication bus also connects the CPU to other computer peripherals, including for example disk drives, keyboards, and a pointing device such as a touch screen, mouse, joystick, touch pad, or track ball. Sometimes the peripherals are connected through single-connection ports, such as the universal serial bus (USB). Some connection ports and buses can connect serially or in parallel to multiple devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional architecture for computers is very adaptable but, because each computing element typically performs a single function and is connected to other computing elements through single communication paths, the conventional computer architecture is subject to performance limitations imposed by the performance of a single component, for example memory, memory access rates, a communication bus or port, or the speed of the central processing unit. Parallel computers have been designed to deal with the problem of limited CPU performance, memory access rates, and the interconnection between memory and the CPU. Some parallel computers employ a plurality of CPUs, each with its own memory, connected through communication ports, either point-to-point, or through a global access bus. Other parallel computers employ multiple CPUs and a large, globally accessible memory with a high-speed, multi-connection access bus. These designs address the problem of CPU performance and memory access.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, computers are increasingly employed in user-interactive, portable, graphic, display-and-image-centric applications, such as internet access, mobile communications, and entertainment such as video gaming and watching video sequences. These applications require a very high bandwidth to the display in a very small, thin, flexible, low-power form factor suitable for user and environmental interaction. Conventional computer architecture designs are not well suited to such applications. Specifically, most traditional designs employ a graphics processor, which can decode and decompress digital signals to a rasterized signal or render graphical objects to a rasterized signal. This rasterized signal is then provided to the display over a high-bandwidth connection. However, this high-bandwidth connection can be expensive and is often limited to a few megabits per second, making it difficult to render images to displays having more than a few million pixels at the required refresh rates.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Flat-panel display devices, for example plasma displays, liquid crystal displays, and area-emissive light-emitting diode (such as organic light-emitting diode or OLED) displays, are widely used in conjunction with computing devices, in portable electronic devices, and for entertainment devices such as televisions. Such displays typically employ a plurality of pixels distributed over a substrate in a display area to display images. Each pixel incorporates several, differently colored light-emitting elements commonly referred to as sub-pixels, typically emitting red, green, and blue light, to represent each image element. As used herein, pixels and sub-pixels are not distinguished and refer to a single light-emitting element. A controller external to the display area drives circuitry that activates each of the pixels, either with active-matrix or passive-matrix control. The controller can include multiple chips, for example as taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,361,939 and 6,582,980. The controller chips can be located on the display substrate, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application 2005/0073260. Active-matrix circuits include thin-film electronic circuitry on the flat-panel display substrate in the display area constructed using high temperature processes. Passive-matrix circuits employ controllers external to the display and are limited to relatively small displays. An alternative pixel-control method using crystalline silicon substrates used for driving LCD displays is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0055864. Such flat-panel displays and control methods are limited in the data rates at which the pixels can be controlled by the controller or the communication path between the controller and the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO2010046638 describes active matrix devices with chiplets connected in a logical chain.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many portable laptop computers integrate displays and computing elements in a folding clamshell, and it is known to integrate a display and computer in a common housing (see, e.g. U.S. Patent Publication 2008/0024971) but these systems are constructed on rigid substrates and are thicker and heavier than can be desired. While flat-panel display devices, particularly OLED displays, can be quite thin, it is difficult to build flat-panel displays on flexible structures. Flexible substrates are typically limited to low-temperature processes and require additional processing to construct conventional active-matrix thin-film electronic circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is known to affix conventional, packaged integrated circuits on a display substrate outside the display area to reduce external parts count and the number of physically separate system elements. A thin form factor is especially important in displays such as OLED displays which can be formed with a thickness of a few millimeters or less. In such displays, electronics packaged outside the display can require a thickness several times the thickness of the display and therefore increase the total display thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Externally accessible circuits that measure OLED pixel performance are known in the prior art. The performance measurements are then used to provide compensation, for example with an external lookup table that processes an image before the image is transferred to a display. These compensation designs suffer from the same bandwidth limitations as conventional display designs and also increase the computing needs for external display controllers. Sophisticated current-controlled pixel-driving circuits are also known, as are circuits that detect emitted light and adjust the driving circuit to provide the desired amount of light. These pixel-control circuits are useful for ensuring that a display emits the desired amount of light specified by a pixel value but do not actually modify the image content as specified by the image pixel values.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a need, therefore, for a computer and display architecture that provides a digital display device having improved display bandwidth, a reduced need for external image processing and bandwidth, a thin and flexible form factor, reduced power, a high level of integration, and interactivity.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in one embodiment of the present invention, a digital display device comprises a display substrate <b>10</b> having a device side <b>9</b> and a display area <b>11</b> on the device side <b>9</b>. An array of pixels <b>30</b> is formed on the device side <b>9</b> of the display substrate <b>10</b> in the display area <b>11</b>, each pixel <b>30</b> including a first electrode <b>12</b>, one or more layers <b>14</b> of light-emitting material located over the first electrode <b>12</b>, and a second electrode <b>16</b> located over the one or more layers <b>14</b> of light-emitting material, the pixels <b>30</b> emitting light in response to a current passed through the one or more layers <b>14</b> of light-emitting material by the first and second electrodes <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an array of driving circuits <b>31</b> is located on the device side <b>9</b> of the display substrate <b>10</b> within the display area <b>11</b>, each driving circuit <b>31</b> electrically connected to one or more pixels <b>30</b> for controlling a pixel current provided to each pixel <b>30</b>. An array of computing circuits <b>29</b> is located on the device side <b>9</b> of the display substrate <b>10</b> within the display area <b>11</b>, each computing circuit <b>29</b> including circuits for signal or image processing and for communicating with neighboring computing circuits <b>29</b>. A plurality of electrical conductors <b>34</b> are formed on the device side <b>9</b> of the display substrate <b>10</b> and connected to each of the driving circuits <b>31</b> and digital computing circuits <b>29</b>, wherein each computing circuit <b>29</b> is connected with an electrical conductor <b>34</b> to each of its neighbors in the array of computing circuits <b>29</b>. The electrical conductors <b>34</b> can be connected to the driving circuits <b>31</b> and digital computing circuits <b>29</b> through intervening connections or circuitry. Means is provided for providing an image signal, wherein the means is connected to one or more of the electrical conductors <b>34</b>. The image signal can be a digital, serial signal that is transferred to one or more of the driving or computing circuits <b>31</b>, <b>29</b> through the electrical conductors <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment of the present invention, the driving circuits <b>31</b> or computing circuits <b>29</b> are formed in chiplets <b>20</b>. Chiplets <b>20</b> are small, integrated circuits formed in crystalline silicon and located on the process side <b>9</b> of the display substrate <b>10</b> in the display area <b>11</b>. Each chiplet <b>20</b> includes a chiplet substrate <b>28</b> separate and distinct from the display substrate <b>10</b>. One or more connection pads <b>24</b> are formed over the chiplet substrate <b>28</b>. The connection pads <b>24</b> are electrically connected to pixel circuits <b>22</b> (that include driving circuits <b>31</b> or computing circuits <b>29</b>) formed within the chiplet <b>20</b> and physically contact electrical conductors, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> to form an electrical connection. The driving and computing circuits <b>31</b>, <b>29</b>, can be digital circuits. The electrical conductors <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> can form individual electrically distinct conductors that are connected separately to pixel circuits <b>22</b> (each electrical conductor forming a separate point-to-point connection) or can be connected to a plurality of pixel circuits <b>22</b> (forming a common bus). The electrical conductors can be electrode connections <b>32</b> that electrically connect the pixel circuits <b>22</b> to the first or second electrodes <b>12</b>, <b>16</b> through connection pads <b>24</b>. The electrical conductors can also be signal connections <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> that electrically connect the pixel circuit <b>22</b> in one chiplet <b>20</b> to another chiplet <b>20</b> through connection pads <b>24</b>. The chiplets <b>20</b> can be connected to a controller <b>60</b> external to the display area <b>11</b> through signal connections (e.g. <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>). The chiplets <b>20</b> can be adhered to the substrate with a planarization and insulating layer <b>18</b>. The planarization and insulating layer <b>18</b> can also insulate the electrical conductors <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> from each other and the electrodes <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each chiplet <b>20</b> includes at least one pixel circuit <b>22</b> formed in the chiplet <b>20</b> and electrically connected to the electrode connection pads <b>24</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the pixel circuit <b>22</b> in one chiplet <b>20</b> includes both driving circuit <b>31</b> and computing circuit <b>29</b>. In another embodiment of the present invention, the driving circuit <b>31</b> and computing circuit <b>29</b> are formed in pixel circuits <b>22</b> in different chiplets <b>20</b>. Pixel circuits <b>22</b> can also include information (e.g. signals and data) storage circuits (e.g. digital registers). The registers can be store-and-forward circuits <b>26</b> that are serially interconnected to form a serial shift register <b>25</b> that includes store-and-forward circuits <b>26</b> in multiple chiplets <b>20</b>. The store-and-forward circuits can be interface circuits that mediate the transfer of information into and out of a chiplet <b>20</b>, from one chiplet <b>20</b> to another chiplet <b>20</b>, or from a controller, or to a controller. A first store-and-forward circuit <b>26</b> can receive information from an input <b>27</b>A connected to a signal connector <b>34</b> through a connection pad <b>24</b>. The store-and-forward circuit <b>26</b> can be, for example a digital register such as a D flip-flop. The input information can be communicated to a driving circuit <b>31</b> or computing circuit <b>29</b> or to a second store-and-forward circuit <b>26</b>. The second store-and-forward circuit <b>26</b> can output information through an output <b>27</b>B to a connection pad <b>24</b> and signal connection <b>34</b> to another chiplet <b>20</b> where the information is received. In this manner, the serial shift register <b>25</b> can communicate the image signal from a controller through multiple chiplets <b>20</b> and to the driving circuit <b>31</b> and computing circuit <b>29</b> in each chiplet <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The driving circuit <b>31</b> can receive information from the serial shift register <b>25</b> and, in response to pixel value information in the image signal, drive the pixels <b>30</b> through a connection pad <b>24</b> and electrode connector <b>32</b> with a current or voltage to cause a current to flow between the electrodes <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> through the one or more layers of light-emitting material to emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The computing circuit <b>29</b> can also receive image signal information from the serial shift register <b>25</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The computing circuit <b>29</b> can process the image signal as desired with an image processing circuit <b>44</b>. The image signal information will typically include either compressed or uncompressed bitmap data. However, this is not necessary and in some embodiments, the image signal will include graphic commands, indicating for example the size, shape, color, and location of graphic objects to be presented on the display. Other characteristics, such as shading can also be provided. Further, the image signal can include multiple, independent signals, which for example, are provided from multiple external sources and each of which corresponds to a different graphic window, graphical overlay to be presented on the display. These multiple, independent signals, can correspond to graphic windows that overlap and can further include a priority signal for indicating the priority for rendering each independent signal, such that the independent signal having the highest priority is rendered on the display while another independent signal having a lower priority but overlapping a higher priority independent signal is not rendered on the display within the overlap area.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Image processing often includes pixel-level computations that will typically be performed within a single computing circuit <b>29</b> attached to a single pixel, such as localized tone-scale or color transformations. Such operations can be performed on a fully parallel basis, such that each computing circuit can perform the same manipulations for each pixel on the display. Image processing can also include local-area computations which involve multiple computing circuits <b>29</b> and will often require communication between multiple computing circuits <b>29</b> and between different chiplets. Such local-area computations can include region-based analysis of images to determine aim tone-scale or color transformations, spatial manipulations, such as sharpening, interpolation, panning, zooming, or rendering of shading gradients across graphical objects and decompression of bitmap data within discrete image blocks, such as the 16&#xd7;16 image blocks typically employed in JPEG compression. Image processing can also include large-area computations, such as rasterizing and rendering of graphical objects within the image. Each computing circuit <b>29</b> can include pixel value storage, for example a frame-store <b>42</b>. The individual computing circuit <b>29</b> within each pixel circuit <b>22</b> in a chiplet <b>20</b> can store a portion of a complete image, for example a tile that corresponds to the portion of the display that the same chiplet <b>20</b> or an associated or neighboring chiplet <b>20</b> can control. Computing circuit <b>29</b> can either be in the same chiplet as driving circuit <b>31</b> or be associated with a driving circuit <b>31</b> in another chiplet <b>20</b> and thereby control the manipulation and display of pixel tiles within an image. An entire image can be distributed among the pixel circuits <b>22</b> within the array of driving or computing circuits <b>31</b>, <b>29</b>. The computing circuit <b>29</b> can also transfer information to the serial shift register <b>25</b>, so that processed data can be communicated to other chiplets <b>20</b> or to a controller. Because image processing operations tend to be local, the distribution of an image between multiple computing circuits can provide an efficient means of image processing. Because the multiple computing circuits are locally connected to neighboring computing circuits, image data required for local image processing operations can be readily communicated to and from neighboring computing circuits. Interconnections between neighboring computing circuits or driving circuits can be point-to-point, for example with a daisy-chained serial bus, so that each computing circuit can simultaneously communicate with a neighboring computing circuit, providing very high bandwidth in the display device. Because the multiple computing circuits can each be locally connected to an individual pixel driving circuit that locally and independently controls pixel activation, the display can be driven at very high data rates. Hence, the controller <b>60</b> serves a more limited function than is found in prior-art displays, for example serving as an image signal source. Multiple such controllers or image sources can be connected to separate bus connections to chiplets <b>20</b> to further increase the data rate at which an image signal can be transferred into the display device. Note that in prior art systems, the rasterized image signal is typically transmitted between the controller <b>60</b> and the display and this signal must be capable of providing a signal to each pixel at a rate that provides flicker free viewing and continuous motion, requiring data to be transmitted for each pixel at a rate of 30 Hz or higher and typically 70 Hz or higher. In the present invention, the controller <b>60</b> only needs to provide an updated signal for a pixel each time that new data is available, significantly reducing the bandwidth that is required between the controller <b>60</b> and the display.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should also be noted that typical pixel-level manipulations of bitmap data often include application of a degamma function to translate input bitmap data, which is typically stored in a nonlinear space, to a color space in which the values are linear with respect to display luminance. This manipulation can often be implemented as a relatively simple equation that can be readily performed by the pixel driving circuits. The translation from a linear space to the final display space, however, often involves a nonlinear lookup table, particularly when the pixel driving circuit provides an analog signal that is nonlinear with respect to the output luminance of the pixel. In prior-art architectures, this nonlinear lookup table is stored in a single location and accessed on a serial basis. However, in display architectures of the present invention, it can be necessary to either replicate this nonlinear lookup table for each pixel driving circuit or to permit parallel access to a common lookup table when such a nonlinear lookup table is necessary. Therefore, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the pixel driving circuit will provide a drive signal that is linear with the luminance output of the pixel <b>30</b>, such that this nonlinear lookup table is not required. For example the pixel driving circuit can provide either a current to each pixel <b>30</b>, which is linear with the luminance output of the pixel <b>30</b> or a digital-drive signal to pixel <b>30</b> wherein the luminance of the pixel <b>30</b> is controlled by the proportion of time that the pixel <b>30</b> receives a current. Hybrid approaches are also useful in which the pixel is driven with an analog signal (current or voltage) only in regimes in which the analog signal of the pixel is linear or approximately linear with luminance of the pixel <b>30</b> and the signal is time modulated to achieve low luminance values, where for example an analog voltage signals are known to be not linear with the luminance output of the pixel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A &#x201c;computing circuit&#x201d; is a closed path or paths formed by the interconnection of electronic components through which a signal can flow and that is capable of modifying the input signal values. Typically, modifying the input signal values will include providing a mathematical or logical operation. In some arrangements, the computing circuit modifies the input signal values to create a signal useful for driving the pixels in the display. In some arrangements, in addition to receiving a signal to be modified from an external source, the computing circuit also receives either instructions or parameters that affect the operation of the computing circuit either from an external source or a programmable memory. In some arrangements, the computing circuit includes a digital processor. An individual computing circuit can be associated with one or more pixels in the display. However, this is not required and the computing circuit can be capable of modifying a signal that affects numerous pixels on the display, and can provide a signal that is not displayed as visible information on the display but communicated externally to the display.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The computing circuit can also include one or more sensors <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The sensors can be environmental sensors, for example that sense ambient or emitted light incident on the chiplet, or support user-interactive functions such as an optical touch screen. Sensors can include, for example, an optical sensor, a pressure sensor, an inertial sensor, a temperature sensor, or a radiation sensor. In some arrangements, a portion of the display could be used to receive keyboard input information from touches on the screen corresponding to alphanumeric keys. The sensed information can be communicated to a controller, used within the local chiplet to process information, for example the image signal, or take an action, or can be communicated to other chiplets. Chiplets can also include a frame-store <b>42</b> for storing an image or portion of an image, as well as memory for storing a software program. Hence, the computing circuit can be programmable, essentially providing a stored-program computer. Programs within different computing circuits can be the same or different. The programs can be loaded into the chiplet from a controller through a bus as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An image signal can have more pixel values, or fewer, than the display has pixels. The computing circuit can select from among the image signal pixel values to display a subset of the image signal pixel values, or can interpolate between the available pixel values, to display an image signal with the number of pixels in the display. Thus, a frame store can store more pixel values than are in the display pixel array. This feature would allow faster response to instructions from the user to zoom in on the image being displayed in order to see additional details.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The driving circuit can implement an active-matrix control of the pixels, for example as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/191,478, filed Aug. 14, 2008, entitled &#x201c;OLED device with embedded chip driving&#x201d; by Winters et al. Alternatively, the driving circuit can provide a passive-matrix control. In a passive-matrix control method, the pixels are divided into mutually exclusive pixel groups with orthogonal arrays of row and column electrodes defining pixels where the row and column electrodes overlap. The pixels within each pixel group are organized in a two-dimensional array, and each pixel group is controlled by one or more chiplets having at least one driving circuit associated with the pixel group. In this arrangement, the column electrodes in the pixel group can be connected to a set of one or more chiplets while the row electrodes can be connected to a different set of one or more chiplets. The driving circuit can be a passive-matrix row or column control circuit and can be formed in one or separate chiplets.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one set of chiplets <b>20</b>A can provide column control to a pixel group <b>37</b> of pixels <b>30</b> formed on a substrate <b>10</b> in response to an image signal from a controller <b>60</b>, while another, different chiplet <b>20</b>B can provide row control to the pixel group. In various embodiments of the present invention, different chiplets can include different driving circuits; computing circuits can be included in all or only some of the chiplets, or in separate chiplets that do not include driving circuits. Alternatively, as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, passive matrix row and column driving circuits <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> can be included in one chiplet <b>20</b>, together with store-and-forward circuits <b>26</b>, in a pixel circuit <b>22</b>, connected to connection pads <b>24</b>. Thus, each of the driving circuits <b>31</b> has an associated and electrically connected computing circuit <b>44</b> forming a pixel circuit <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which separate chiplets <b>20</b> include driving circuits <b>31</b> and computing circuits <b>29</b> for processing image signals from a controller <b>60</b> through signal connections <b>35</b> and driving pixels <b>30</b> with the image signal. The controller connects to more than one row of chiplets. In this embodiment, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pixel circuits (not shown within the chiplets <b>20</b>) form a two-dimensional grid array in the display area <b>11</b> and the pixel circuits are electrically connected with each of its neighbors in the array by a serial communication bus formed of the electrical conductors <b>34</b>. Each signal connection is specific to each pair of chiplets. In contrast, electrical conductors <b>38</b> form a common connection connected to all of the pixel circuits within the chiplet <b>20</b>. Such common connection can provide common signals such as clock, power, or ground signals that assist in controlling the operation of the display device and activation of pixels <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In general, each computing circuit communicates with neighboring computing circuits through signal connections. Each signal connection can be point-to-point and connect with only a single nearest neighbor (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). Alternatively, the signal connections can be connected in common to more than two computing circuits (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), or even to all of the computing circuits through a common signal connection (e.g. signal connections connected like electrical conductors <b>38</b>). The driving and computing circuits are distributed over the substrate in the display area on the same side of the display substrate as the one or more layers of light-emitting material. The circuits are not located solely around the periphery of the pixel array but are located within the array of pixels, that is, beneath, above, or between pixels in the display area. Likewise, if chiplets are employed to form the driving and computing circuits, the chiplets are located within the pixel array in the display area on the same side of the display substrate as the one or more layers of light-emitting material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A serial bus is one in which data is re-transmitted from one circuit to the next on electrically separated electrical connections; a parallel bus is one in which data is simultaneously broadcast to all of the chiplets on an electrically common electrical connection. A plurality of serially-connected, store- and forward circuits can be included within a chiplet and connected to the electrical connections of the serial bus to form an independent set of store-and-forward circuits on a single serial bus. Moreover, a plurality of serial buses serially-connecting a plurality of chiplets <b>20</b> in a plurality of sets can be employed. It is also possible to connect multiple serial buses to a chiplet and to include multiple, serially-connected sets of store-and-forward circuits within one chiplet.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment of the present invention, a serial bus connects an image signal source (e.g. a controller) to a first store-and-forward circuit with an electrical conductor. Each store-and-forward circuit on the serial bus connects to the next store-and-forward circuit with an electrically independent electrical conductor, so that all of the electrical conductors can communicate different data from one store-and-forward circuit to the next at the same time, for example in response to a clock signal. The controller provides an image signal having a first digital pixel value and a control signal (e.g. clock) to the first store-and-forward circuit connected to the controller that enables the store-and-forward circuit to store the digital pixel value. Once the first store-and-forward circuit has stored the first digital pixel value, a second digital pixel value can be provided to the first store-and-forward circuit at the same time as the first store-and-forward circuit provides the first digital pixel value to a second store-and-forward circuit connected to the first store-and-forward circuit. The control signal (for example, a clock signal) can be provided to all of the store-and-forward circuits together or can be propagated from one store-and-forward circuit to the next, much as the digital pixel values are propagated. The first store-and-forward circuit then stores the second digital pixel value while the second store-and-forward circuit stores the first digital pixel value. The process is then repeated with a third digital pixel value and a third store-and-forward circuit, and so on, so that digital pixel values are sequentially shifted from one store-and-forward circuit to the next. Each chiplet includes one or more store-and-forward circuits so that the digital pixel values are shifted from one chiplet to the next.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The digital image signal can include control signals to aid in controlling the pixel circuits and store-and-forward circuits. For example, reset and clock signals can be useful. It can also be useful to transmit control signals on signal connectors that are separate from signal connectors on which digital pixel values are transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The signal connectors can be connected to connection pads on the chiplets. In one embodiment of the present invention, a signal can be connected with an electrically common connector to every chiplet in parallel. In this embodiment, every chiplet will receive the same information at the same time (ignoring propagation delays in the electrically common connector). The electrically common connector can pass through a chiplet. Such a parallel connection is useful for signals that need to be presented to each chiplet at the same time (e.g. a clock, select, reset, or enable signal). In an alternative embodiment, a signal can be connected to one or more chiplets using a serial connection in which the signal passes into a chiplet, is stored in that chiplet, and is then transferred at a later time (e.g. a clock cycle later) to the next serially connected chiplet. Such signals (e.g. data signals) can then be regenerated within a chiplet to maintain the signal integrity. Internal chiplet connections can be employed to connect each store- and forward circuit to the next in a serial fashion within and between chiplets. The internal chiplet connections can also connect to the driving circuits or computing circuits within a chiplet.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once an image signal is transferred into the computing or driving circuits, the display can be activated to display the image signal pixel values. At the same time as, or before, or after, the pixels are activated, the computing circuit can process the pixel values and transform the pixel values into a processed image. The processed image is caused to be displayed by the driving circuit. The computing circuit can receive more, or fewer, pixel values than the number of pixels an associated driving circuit can activate. Alternatively, the processed image can be communicated to the controller or to other driving and computing circuits for display or further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention provides an advantage over the prior art in providing integrated image processing and display, at high rates within a display device. Prior-art methods, for example using thin-film transistors, cannot provide the digital signal propagation, computation, and driving because the necessary thin-film logic is too large and has low performance. Thus, the present invention provides improved performance over techniques taught in the prior art. By employing a digital image signal, signal accuracy is maintained even when transmitting signals over large display areas, for example a meter in diagonal, or even more. Serial signal connections reduce the number of wires needed to interconnect the pixels in the display to a controller and chiplets formed in crystalline silicon provide high-speed, high-density circuits useful in communicating, processing, and displaying serial, digital pixel values. An array of chiplets enables relatively short, inter-chiplet connections (i.e. electrical connections), reducing signal propagation delays and increasing data transfer rates. Store-and-forward circuits can reconstruct serial digital signals, both data and control signals, as they are transmitted from one chiplet to another, further enabling high-speed communications. The high density of circuits within a chiplet enabled by crystalline silicon chiplet substrates enables complex computational and drive circuitry for the pixels, for example including digital-to-analog converters, active-matrix control circuits, and passive-matrix circuit controllers to be formed within the chiplets. Feedback or fault-detection circuits can also be formed within the chiplets to further improve the performance of the pixel driving circuits and the accuracy, stability, and uniformity of the pixel output. Such feedback signals can include measurements of pixel current or control voltage. Detection circuits can include light detection with photosensors.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In particular, OLED materials are known to age when used, with increased drive current for a given light output. By employing sophisticated current-controlled pixel circuits such as known in the art within the high-circuit-density chiplets, the light output can be consistently controlled over time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A controller can be implemented as a chiplet and affixed to the display substrate. The controller can be located on the periphery of the display substrate, or can be external to the display substrate and include a conventional integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to various embodiments of the present invention, the chiplets can be constructed in a variety of ways, for example with one or two rows of connection pads along a long dimension of a chiplet. The signal and electrode connectors can be formed from various materials and use various methods for deposition on the device substrate, for example a metal, either evaporated or sputtered, such as aluminum or aluminum alloys. Alternatively, the signal and electrode connectors can be made of cured conductive inks or metal oxides. In one cost-advantaged embodiment, the signal and electrode connectors are formed in a single layer.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The present invention is particularly useful for multi-pixel device embodiments employing a large device substrate, e.g. glass, plastic, or foil, with a plurality of chiplets arranged in a regular arrangement over the display device substrate. Each chiplet or set of chiplets can control a plurality of pixels formed over the device substrate according to the circuitry in the chiplet(s) and in response to control signals. Individual pixel groups or multiple pixel groups can be located on tiled elements, which can be assembled to form the entire display.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to the present invention, chiplets provide distributed pixel control and computing elements over a substrate. A chiplet is a relatively small integrated circuit compared to the device substrate and includes one or more pixel circuits including wires, connection pads, passive components such as resistors or capacitors, or active components such as transistors or diodes, formed on an independent substrate. Chiplets are separately manufactured from the display substrate and then applied to the display substrate. Details of these processes can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,879,098; U.S. Pat. No. 7,557,367; U.S. Pat. No. 7,622,367; US20070032089; US20090199960 and US20100123268.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The chiplets are preferably manufactured using silicon or silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers using known processes for fabricating semiconductor devices. Each chiplet is then separated prior to attachment to the device substrate. The crystalline base of each chiplet can therefore be considered a substrate separate from the device substrate and over which the chiplet circuitry is disposed. The plurality of chiplets therefore has a corresponding plurality of substrates separate from the device substrate and each other. In particular, the independent substrates are separate from the substrate on which the pixels are formed and the areas of the independent, chiplet substrates, taken together, are smaller than the device substrate. Chiplets can have a crystalline substrate to provide higher-performance active components than are found in, for example, thin-film amorphous or polycrystalline silicon devices. Chiplets can have a thickness preferably of 100 um or less, and more preferably 20 um or less. This facilitates formation of the adhesive and planarization material over the chiplet that can then be applied using conventional spin-coating techniques. According to one embodiment of the present invention, chiplets formed on crystalline silicon substrates are arranged in a geometric array and adhered to a device substrate (e.g. 10) with adhesion or planarization materials. Connection pads on the surface of the chiplets are employed to connect each chiplet to signal wires, power buses and row or column electrodes to drive pixels. Chiplets can control at least four pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Since the chiplets are formed in a semiconductor substrate, the circuitry of the chiplet can be formed using modern lithography tools. With such tools, feature sizes of 0.5 microns or less are readily available. For example, modern semiconductor fabrication lines can achieve line widths of 90 nm or 45 nm and can be employed in making the chiplets of the present invention. The chiplet, however, also requires connection pads for making electrical connection to the wiring layer provided over the chiplets once assembled onto the display substrate. The connection pads can be sized based on the feature size of the lithography tools used on the display substrate (for example 5 um) and the alignment of the chiplets to the wiring layer (for example +/&#x2212;5 um). Therefore, the connection pads can be, for example, 15 um wide with 5 um spaces between the pads. This means that the pads will generally be significantly larger than the transistor circuitry formed in the chiplet.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pads can generally be formed in a metallization layer on the chiplet over the transistors. It is desirable to make the chiplet with as small a surface area as possible to enable a low manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">By employing chiplets with independent substrates (e.g. comprising crystalline silicon) having circuitry with higher performance than circuits formed directly on the substrate (e.g. amorphous or polycrystalline silicon), a device with higher performance and greater functionality is provided. Since crystalline silicon has not only higher performance but also much smaller active elements (e.g. transistors), the circuitry size is much reduced. A useful chiplet can also be formed using micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) structures, for example as described in &#x201c;A novel use of MEMS switches in driving AMOLED&#x201d;, by Yoon, Lee, Yang, and Jang, Digest of Technical Papers of the Society for Information Display, 2008, 3.4, p. 13.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The device substrate can include glass and the wiring layers made of evaporated or sputtered metal or metal alloys, e.g. aluminum or silver, formed over a planarization layer (e.g. resin) patterned with photolithographic techniques known in the art. The chiplets can be formed using conventional techniques well established in the integrated circuit industry. Wiring and first electrodes can be formed using known photolithographic techniques. Layer of light emitting material and second electrodes can be formed using processes known in the OLED art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In embodiments of the present invention using differential signal pairs, the substrate can preferably be foil or another solid, electrically-conductive material, and the two serial buses forming a differential signal pair can be laid out in a differential microstrip configuration referenced to the substrate, as known in the electronics art. In displays using non-conductive substrates, the differential signal pair can preferentially be referenced to the second electrode, and routed so that no portion of the first electrode of any pixel is located between the second electrode and either serial bus in the differential pair. LVDS (EIA-644), RS-485 or other differential signalling standards known in the electronics art can be employed on the differential signal pairs. A balanced DC encoding such as 4b5b can be employed to format data transferred across the differential signal pair, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention can be employed in devices having a multi-pixel infrastructure. In particular, the present invention can be practiced with LED devices, either organic or inorganic, and is particularly useful in information-display devices. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is employed in a flat-panel OLED device composed of small-molecule or polymeric OLEDs as disclosed in, but not limited to U.S. Pat. No. 4,769,292 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,569. Inorganic devices, for example, employing quantum dots formed in a polycrystalline semiconductor matrix (for example, as taught in US 2007/0057263), and employing organic or inorganic charge-control layers, or hybrid organic/inorganic devices can be employed. Many combinations and variations of organic or inorganic light-emitting displays can be used to fabricate such a device, including active-matrix displays having either a top- or bottom-emitter architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As noted above, an important advantage of the present invention is to provide a display and computing structure that is extremely light weight and thin. However, as seen in prior-art display systems such as cellular telephones, a significant bulk is necessary to house electrical connectors and power supplies, in addition to computing circuits. Therefore, it is useful within embodiments of the present invention to form metal layers within the display that can serve as radio antennas to provide RF communication, so that data can be communicated to the display via wireless, electromagnetic communication. Similarly one or more resonant antennas can be formed on the display substrate or formed on another relatively thin substrate and attached to the display substrate to facilitate resonant electromagnetic energy transfer. Such resonant electromagnetic energy transfer methods are known in the art, such as those taught by U.S. Ser. No. 11/481,077.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In these or other embodiments, separate circuits can be formed on or attached to the display substrate for controlling power. In some useful embodiments, power circuits will be formed that are capable of switching and conditioning power from an external source to each of the power buses to supply power to the remaining elements of the display. Such power circuits can be formed from silicon but they can also be formed from other materials, including gallium. Such components can also be attached to the substrate to condition and control the flow of power to the display.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it should be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
