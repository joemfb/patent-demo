<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Exemplary embodiments provide microscope devices and methods for forming and using the microscope devices. The microscope device can include a light emitter array with each light emitter individually addressable to either emit or detect light signals. Magnified images of a sample object can be generated by a reflection mechanism and/or a transmission mechanism using one or more microscope devices in an imaging system. Real-time computer control of which microscope pixels are viewed can allow the user to digitally replicate the &#x201c;fovea&#x201d; function of human vision. Viewing an object from both sides in the double-sided microscope system and from multiple pixel positions can allow the microscope to reconstruct pseudo-3D images of the object.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention relates generally to solid-state microscope devices and, more particularly, relates to lens-less semiconductor-based digital microscope devices, systems, and methods for fabricating and using them.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional optical microscope uses optical lenses to gather light from an illuminated object and provide a magnified image of that object to the viewer. An additional light source, that itself may require conditioning optics, is often used to illuminate the sample for the conventional optical microscopes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such conventional optical microscopes, however, may have drawbacks and disadvantages for specific microscopic applications. For example, when conventional optical microscopes are used to observe biological samples, the strong illumination power of the conventional optical microscopes may irreversibly degrade biological samples, e.g., living cells. This is known as photo-toxicity in the prior art. In addition, it is desirable for modern microscopes to be small, light weight, and free of moving parts, which conventional optical microscopes are not.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, there is a need to overcome these and other problems of the prior art and to provide a compact, portable and robust lens-less microscope that has a high image resolution and a controllable illumination power.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to various embodiments, the present teachings include a microscope device. The microscope device can include a readout integrated circuit (ROIC); and a light emitting diode (LED) structure disposed on the ROIC. The LED structure can include a plurality of LED core-shell structures with each LED core-shell structure including a layered shell enveloping a nanowire core. The layered shell can include a multi-quantum-well (MQW) active region. A p-side electrode can envelop the layered core-shell structure and can be electrically connected with the ROIC. Each p-side electrode can have an average thickness ranging from about 100 nm to about 500 nm, and can be electrically isolated from adjacent p-side electrodes. A growth mask dielectric can be disposed on the plurality of LED core-shell structures with each nanowire core disposed through the growth mask dielectric to connect to an n-side semiconductor that is situated on the growth mask dielectric.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to various embodiments, the present teachings also include a method of forming a microscope device. In this method, an LED (light emitting diode) array can be formed to include a plurality of LED core-shell structures. Each LED core-shell structure can include a doped buffer layer disposed on a substrate; a growth mask dielectric disposed on the doped buffer layer; a nanowire core formed on the doped buffer layer through the growth mask dielectric; and a layered shell formed to envelop the nanowire core and to include a multi-quantum-well (MQW) active region. A p-side semiconductor can then be formed to envelop the layered shell of each LED core-shell, followed by forming a p-side electrode having a thickness ranging from about 100 nm to about 500 nm to envelop the p-side semiconductor. Adjacent p-side electrodes can be electrically isolated by a dielectric material, providing a surface including both the p-side electrodes and the dielectric material. The LED array can then be inverted to attach the surface having both the p-side electrodes and the dielectric material to a readout integrated circuit (ROIC). The substrate of the inverted LED array can then be removed to expose the doped buffer layer, which is then patterned to form a plurality of n-side semiconductors on the growth mask dielectric. Each n-side semiconductor can be connected with the nanowire core of a corresponding LED core-shell structure.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to various embodiments, the present teachings further include a method for producing a magnified image of an object. In this method, a first microscope device having an LED array and a second microscope device having an LED array can be provided and configured to allow simultaneous viewing of an object from both the first and the second microscope devices. When producing a magnified image of the object, a first image pixel can be formed by steps including: switching on a first LED of the LED array of the first microscope device to illuminate a first portion of the object; using a first plurality of LEDs surrounding the first LED of the first microscope device to collect a reflected light from the illuminated first portion of the object; and using a first plurality of corresponding LEDs of the LED array of the second microscope device to collect a transmitted light through the illuminated first portion of the object. A second image pixel can be formed by steps including: switching on a second LED of the LED array of the first microscope device to illuminate a second portion of the object; using a second plurality of LEDs surrounding the second LED of the first microscope device to collect a reflected light from the illuminated second portion of the object; and using a second plurality of corresponding LEDs of the LED array of the second microscope device to collect a transmitted light through the illuminated second portion of the object.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part thereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The following description is, therefore, merely exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Exemplary embodiments provide solid-state microscope devices and methods for forming and using them. The solid-state microscope devices can include a light emitter array having a plurality of light emitters with each light emitter individually addressable. During operation, each light emitter can be biased in one of three operating states including an emit state, a detect state, and an off state. The light emitter can be an LED (light emitting diode) including, but not limited to, a nanowire-based LED or a planar LED, to provide various desired image resolutions for the microscope devices. In an exemplary embodiment for near-field microscopy, the imaging resolution can be approximately defined by a pitch p, i.e., a center-to-center spacing between adjacent light emitters, of the light emitter array.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, the light emitters, for example, the nanowire-based LED or the planar LED, and/or the microscope devices can be formed using a III-V compound semiconductor materials system, such as, a Group III-N compound materials system including one or more materials of GaN, AlN, InN, InGaN, AlInGaN, AlGaN, InP, GaAs, and a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an exemplary embodiment, the light emitters can include a layered multi-quantum-well (MQW) structure having a MQW active region disposed between doped barrier layers. The MQW active region can include, for example, Group III-N quantum wells, such as InGaN/GaN quantum wells, AlGaN/GaN quantum wells, or other III-N quantum wells. For example, the MQW active region can include alternating layers of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N and GaN, or In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N and GaN, where x can be any number less than or equal to 1.00.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various dopants can be used for the layered MOW structure or for the light emitters to provide a desired conductivity. The dopant can be, for example, a p-type dopant chosen from Group II of the periodic table (e.g. Mg, Zn, Cd or Hg); a p-type dopant chosen from Group IV of the periodic table, (e.g., C); or an n-type dopant chosen from a group consisting of Si, Ge, Sn, S, Se and Te.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The MQW active region can be disposed between a first doped layer, e.g., n-doped GaN or n-doped Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N, and a second doped layer, e.g., p-doped Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N. A third doped layer can also be formed on the second doped layer and can be formed of, for example, p-doped GaN.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In embodiments, the light emitters can include a substrate formed of a material including, but not limited to, sapphire, silicon carbide (SiC), silicon (Si), silicon-on-insulator (SOI), III-V semiconductor compounds such as GaN or GaAs, metal, ceramic, or glass.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The light emitters and/or the microscope devices can be formed by various crystal growth techniques including, but not limited to, metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) (also known as organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE)), pulsed MOCVD, molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE), gas source MBE (GSMBE), metal-organic MBE (MOMBE), atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), and/or hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The dielectric materials can be involved in formation of the disclosed light emitters and/or microscope devices. For example, dielectric materials can be used for electrical isolation between the nanowire core-shell LEDs and/or planar LEDs, and for electrical isolation between the p-side electrodes (or n-side electrodes) of individual LEDs. The dielectric materials can also be used for a selective growth mask when forming nanowire-based structures or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, the dielectric materials can include, but are not limited to, silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), silicon oxynitride (SiON), fluorinated silicon dioxide (SiOF), silicon oxycarbide (SiOC), hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), hafnium-silicate (HfSiO), nitride hafnium-silicate (HfSiON), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), barium strontium titanate (BST), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), zirconium silicate (ZrSiO<sub>2</sub>), tantalum oxide (TaO<sub>2</sub>) or other insulating materials.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments, conductive materials and structures can be used for forming the exemplary microscope devices. For example, conductive materials and structures can be used as bump bonds, electrodes, and/or electrical contacts. The conductive materials and structures can include metals such as indium (In), titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni) or gold (Au), for example, in a number of multi-layered combinations such as Al/Ti/Pt/Au, Ni/Au, Ti/Al, Ti/Au, Ti/Al/Ti/Au, and/or Ti/Al/Au using techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, the disclosed microscope devices can be light weight and small in size. For example, a microscope device can have a weight and size both less than 1/1000 of the weight and size of a conventional optical microscope. In addition, the disclosed microscope devices can be highly portable and robust with desired image resolutions. In embodiments, the lens-less digital microscope devices can be placed in chemical aggressive environments, underwater, or even be configured for in-vivo observation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the disclosed microscope devices can include a plurality of nano-photonic light emitting devices, such as nanowire-based LEDs, having an image resolution of about 1 micron or greater, for example, from about 1 micron to about 10 microns. In another embodiment, the disclosed microscope devices can include a planar LED array having an image resolution of about 10 microns to about 50 microns or greater. Note that the above resolution values are &#x201c;raw&#x201d; values that do not include improvements gained by subsequent digital processing that is known to one of ordinary skill in the related art. In various embodiments, the subsequent digital processing of the data from these microscope devices can take place in a connected computer control system to further improve the above resolution values. For example, the image resolution, after the digital processing, can range from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, although the image resolution is not limited according to various embodiments of the present teachings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a schematic of an exemplary light emitter system <b>100</b>A in accordance with various embodiments of the present teachings. It should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the system <b>100</b>A depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> represents a generalized schematic illustration and that other layers/light emitters can be added or existing layers/light emitters can be removed or modified.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown, the exemplary light emitter system <b>100</b>A can include a plurality of light emitters <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, or <b>126</b>, which can be configured as a light emitter array <b>120</b> over a substrate <b>110</b>. Sample object <b>130</b> placed over the light emitter array <b>120</b> can thus be viewed and/or examined as a magnified image.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The substrate <b>110</b> can be, e.g., any substrate on which Group III-N materials or other light-emitting semiconductors can be grown. The substrate <b>110</b> can include, but is not limited to, Si, SiC, Sapphire, GaN and/or GaAs.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The light emitters <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, or <b>126</b> can include, for example, a nanowire-based LED, a planar LED, or any other suitable light emitters depending on the microscopic applications. In various embodiments, each light emitter can be biased in one of three operating states including an emit state, a detect state, and an off state, in order to operate the system <b>100</b>A. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the plurality of light emitters can include sets of light emitters including a first set of the light emitters <b>122</b> surrounded by a second set of light emitters <b>124</b>, and a third set of light emitters <b>126</b>. In various embodiments, each set of light emitters can include one or more light emitters.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light emitter system <b>100</b>A can build a digital image using a reflection mechanism and/or a transmission mechanism. In embodiments for reflection based operations, the first set of light emitters <b>122</b> can be &#x201c;on&#x201d; emitters that can illuminate a small area of the sample object <b>130</b>. For example, the small area can have an area on an order of &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. The emitted light <b>127</b> from the &#x201c;on&#x201d; light emitters <b>122</b> can then be reflected, scattered, and/or diffracted from the sample object <b>130</b> and the returned light, e.g., the reflected light <b>129</b>, can then be collected immediately by the surrounding set of light emitters <b>124</b>, which are electrically reverse-biased to function as photo-detectors. The first set of emitters <b>122</b> can be forward biased so that they emit light. The third set of light emitters <b>126</b>, i.e., the remaining light emitters of the light emitter array <b>120</b> can be unbiased, e.g., switched off during this step.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The image resolution of the light emitter system <b>100</b>A can correspond to the size of the illuminated light spot on the sample object <b>130</b>. The size of the illuminated spot (not illustrated) can correspond approximately to the pitch p of the light emitter array <b>120</b> and also depend on how much diffraction, reflection, and/or absorption occur in the sample object <b>130</b>. As shown, the plurality of light emitters <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> can possess a controllable pitch p and thus to control the resulting image resolution. In some embodiments, the light emitter array <b>120</b> can be in a high density having a pitch p, e.g., of about 1 micron to 10 microns for an image resolution of about 10 microns or less. In other embodiments, the pitch p can be, for example, in a range of about 10 microns to about 50 microns, or greater, according to an image resolution requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an exemplary embodiment for the reflection type mechanism, several &#x201c;rings&#x201d; of light emitters <b>124</b> can surround one light emitter <b>122</b> and can be biased as detectors to detect the reflected light <b>129</b> from the illuminated spot on the sample object <b>130</b>, wherein the sample object is illuminated by the light emitter <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another exemplary embodiment for operations that involve transmission mechanism, a conventional photodetector (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) can be placed above the sample object <b>130</b>. Such photodetector can have large area for detecting the transmitted light through an optically clear sample object <b>130</b>. For example, one light emitter <b>122</b> can be biased as an &#x201c;on&#x201d; emitter that can illuminate a small area of the sample object <b>130</b>. The emitted light <b>127</b> from the &#x201c;on&#x201d; light emitter <b>122</b> can be transmitted through the sample object <b>130</b> and the transmitted light (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) can then be collected immediately by the photodetector placed thereabove.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a third exemplary embodiment, a detector array having a detector pitch that is identical to the pitch p of the LED emitter array, can be placed above the emitter array (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). The spacing between the underlying emitter array and the overlying detector array can be adjusted and used to define a channel. The height of this channel can further be adjusted to provide a degree of filtering of a specimen, allowing only objects with a size smaller than the channel height to enter the viewing area. The resolution of this arrayed emitter plus arrayed detector arrangement can be superior to that of the two previous single emitter array embodiments described above and can be used, for example, to create pseudo-3D microscope images.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic for an exemplary microscope device <b>100</b>B in accordance with the present teachings. It should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the device <b>100</b>B depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> represents a generalized schematic illustration and that other layers/light emitters/circuit cells can be added or existing layers/light emitters/circuit cells can be removed or modified.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown, the device <b>100</b>B can include the microscope light emitter array <b>120</b> connected with a CMOS integrated circuit <b>102</b> through a plurality of bump bonds <b>108</b>. The CMOS integrated circuit <b>102</b> can be a read out integrated circuit (ROIC) including a plurality of ROIC cells <b>105</b> and peripheral circuits <b>107</b>. The light emitter array <b>120</b> can further include a plurality of electrical contacts <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> used as p-side electrodes and n-side electrodes for the light emitters in the array <b>120</b>. For example, each light emitter in the array <b>120</b> can be connected to a corresponding ROIC cell <b>105</b> through one bump bond <b>108</b>. The plurality of ROIC cells <b>105</b> can thus be configured having the same pitch p as that for the light emitter array <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In various embodiments, the disclosed microscope configuration can build a magnified pixel-by-pixel digital image of the sample object. Specifically, the action of switching on one (or more) light emitter (e.g., the light emitter <b>122</b>) in the plurality of light emitters, and detecting and storing the intensity of the reflected or transmitted light from the sample object, can create one pixel in the digital image. For example, the photocurrent of the light detectors (e.g., the light emitters <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) in the light emitter array <b>120</b> can be summed by, for example, related ROIC cells <b>105</b> and transferred at <b>109</b> to a control computer <b>155</b> to fix the intensity of the first pixel. In one embodiment, the control computer <b>155</b> can receive image data via a hi-speed connection and the image can be reconstructed and displayed on the control computer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Following the creation of the first pixel in the digital image, the light emitter <b>122</b> can then be switched off, one of its neighboring light emitters can be switched on, and the operation procedure can be repeated to build up a second pixel in the digital image. This process can be repeated across the area of light emitter array <b>120</b> to build the full digital image of the sample object <b>130</b>. In various embodiments, for objects close to the array surface, the image resolution can be similar to the pitch p between adjacent light emitters.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The peripheral circuits <b>107</b> can be used for multiplexing and transferring data from the ROIC cells <b>105</b> to the control computer <b>155</b>. For example, after the image has been collected by some of the light emitters (e.g., <b>124</b>) in the array <b>120</b>, various image data manipulation algorithms can be applied to the resulting digital images. Patterns within the image, the image contrast or other image parameters, can be recognized and/or controlled. Unlike conventional optical microscope, the disclosed microscope algorithms can further process the image data in a real-time feedback loop, which can manipulate the switching sequence or switching speed of the individual light emitter to optimize image resolution, enhance specific regions of the image, etc. Due to the sequential switching of light emitters, the microscope devices can provide an average illumination power onto the sample object, which is particularly advantageous for examining biological samples (e.g., living cells) that may be irreversibly degraded by over-illumination. The image resolution can also be improved through advanced digital-imaging processes, some of which are known to one skilled in the art, and additional imaging processes that form the basis of claims discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the light emitters, such as the LEDs, can be constructed to emit light with a specific wavelength, e.g., chosen to excite a specific mechanism or process in the sample object. For example, various fluorescent dyes or other fluorophores can be used to &#x201c;stain&#x201d; specific parts of living cells. The disclosed microscope system <b>100</b>A can emit a specific wavelength to excite a specific fluorescence in these certain fluorophores. In various embodiments, each light emitter used in the microscope system can be an individually addressable light emitter to provide a specific emission wavelength. With the use of advanced fluorophores, such as NQDs (nanoscale quantum dots) that can be excited by a wide range of wavelengths yet emit only over a narrow wavelength band, various different fluorescences in one sample object can be examined by a single microscope device.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an exemplary light emitter <b>200</b> that includes a nanowire core-shell structure in accordance with the present teachings. In various embodiments, the exemplary light emitter <b>200</b> can be the nanowire devices as described in the related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/684,264, entitled &#x201c;Pulsed Growth of Catalyst-Free Growth of GaN Nanowires and Application in Group III Nitride Semiconductor Bulk Material,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the device <b>200</b> can include a layered shell <b>235</b> having a MQW &#x201c;shell&#x201d; structure formed on the sidewalls of a nanowire core <b>230</b>. The MQW core-shell structure can be formed over a doped buffer layer <b>220</b> over a substrate <b>210</b>. It should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the device <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents a generalized schematic illustration and that other nanowires/layers/shells can be added or existing nanowires/layers/shells can be removed or modified.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown, the substrate <b>210</b> can be a substrate including, but not limited to, sapphire, silicon carbide, silicon and 111-V substrates such as GaAs, or GaN. The doped buffer layer <b>220</b> can be formed over the substrate <b>210</b>. The doped buffer layer <b>220</b> can be formed of, for example, GaN, AlN, InN, AlGaN, InGaN or AlInGaN, by various crystal growth methods. In various embodiments, the doped buffer layer <b>220</b> can be doped with a conductivity type similar to the doped nanowire core <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The nanowire <b>230</b> can have an elongated conductive or semiconductive material that includes at least one minor dimension, for example, one of the cross-sectional dimensions such as width or diameter, of less than or equal to about 1000 nm. The nanowires can have an aspect ratio (e.g., length:width and/or major dimension:minor dimension) of about 1 or greater. The nanowires can have various cross-sectional shapes, such as, for example, a rectangular, polygonal, square, oval, or circular shape. The doped nanowire <b>230</b> can be formed of, for example, GaN, AlN, InN, AlGaN, InGaN or AlInGaN, which can be made an n-type by doping with various impurities such as silicon, germanium, selenium, sulfur and tellurium or a p-type by introducing beryllium, strontium, barium, zinc, or magnesium.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is also intended that the term &#x201c;nanowires&#x201d; encompasses other elongated structures of like dimensions including, but not limited to, nanoshafts, nanopillars, nanoneedles, nanorods, and nanotubes (e.g., single wall nanotubes, or multiwall nanotubes), and their various functionalized and derivatized fibril forms, such as nanofibers in the form of thread, yarn, fabrics, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In various embodiments, a p-side electrode <b>245</b> can be formed on dielectric materials <b>250</b> to envelop a portion of the shelled layer <b>235</b> such that the p-side electrode <b>245</b> can be electrically isolated from adjacent n-side electrodes <b>280</b> by the dielectric materials <b>250</b>, when a number of core-shell structures are included in a large area such as a wafer. The dielectric materials <b>250</b> can be formed over the doped buffer layer <b>220</b> and on a portion of the sidewalls of the layered shell <b>235</b>. In addition, n-side electrodes <b>280</b> can be formed to assure the conduction between the n-side contact (e.g., the doped buffer layer <b>220</b>) and the central conductive region including the nanowire core <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At <b>299</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the emitted light of the nanowire-based LED <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be extracted through the substrate <b>220</b>, which can be transparent at the emitted light wavelengths. Alternatively, light output can occur on the top side of the device <b>200</b> (not shown). Since the nanowire-based LED device <b>200</b> has a small diameter that is comparable or even less than the wavelength of emitted light, a diffracted, diffuse light output can be expected. While this diffuse light output can be advantageous in solid-state lighting applications, a more collimated light beam can be obtained by a thicker metal electrode (not shown) that would form a collimation tube.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although a single nanowire is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for the purpose of description, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a number of nanowires can be formed simultaneously with a high density in a large area (e.g., a whole wafer).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic for an exemplary III-N nanowire array in accordance with the present teachings. The exemplary GaN nanowire <b>330</b> can have high quality (e.g., essentially free of threading defects) and large scale uniformity of position, crystallographic orientation, length, cross-sectional features (e.g., the dimensions and/or shapes). For example, the GaN nanowire <b>330</b> can have single crystal GaN with a diameter ranging from about 200 nm to about 300 nm. In addition, the nanowire sidewall facets can be of the non-polar family, which creates an opportunity for eliminating the quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) from LEDs by using a radial, core-shell LED geometry.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the microscope system <b>400</b> can include, for example, an LED array having a plurality of nanowire LEDs <b>200</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

An ROIC <b>402</b> can be connected to the plurality of nanowire LEDs <b>200</b> through, for example, a plurality of conductive structures <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">During the exemplary reflection type operation, the LED <b>422</b> can be an &#x201c;on&#x201d; emitter to illuminate a small area of the sample object <b>430</b>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The photocurrent from the light detectors <b>424</b> can be summed by the ROIC <b>402</b> and transferred to a control computer (not shown) fixing the intensity of an image pixel.

In various embodiments, the device configuration, the ROIC circuit board, the operation process, along with the data process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be similar to that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>.</p>

In an exemplary embodiment, the layered MQW structure <b>535</b> can include an InGaN based MQW active region disposed between an n-doped GaN layer <b>531</b> and a p-doped AlGaN layer. P-doped GaN layer <b>536</b> can be formed over the p-doped AlGaN layer over the InGaN based MQW active region. The n-doped GaN layer <b>531</b> can be formed on the substrate <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, a plurality of LED mesas <b>530</b> can then be defined by etching the structure <b>500</b>A to the n-doped GaN layer <b>531</b> and having recessed spaces <b>550</b> between any two adjacent LED mesas. In various embodiments, during this etching, the etching damage can be minimized and thereby providing a small diameter, for example, about 5 microns or less, of each LED and rendering the proximity of the LED active region an etched-mesa sidewall-surface. Several suitable strategies can be used for minimizing such damage. For example, an RIE (reactive ion etch) etching process can be first conducted and followed by a passivation process to the RIE damage. This is because the RIE process can damage the surface and subsurface of the mesa sidewalls, although the RIE process can provide a shape control to the LED mesas. The passivation process can then be performed by either a wet-etch treatment, a surface passivation layer <b>540</b>, or by both of these. The surface passivation layer <b>540</b>, for example, a dielectric layer including such as silicon nitride, can be formed on the entire surface of the etched structure <b>500</b>A including the LED mesas and the recessed spaces between the LED mesas. In various embodiments, the etching process can include, for example, standard ICP (i.e., inductively coupled plasma) mesa etch techniques known to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various embodiments, the dimensions of the LED mesas <b>530</b> and the recessed spaces <b>550</b> can determine the pitch p of the microscope array (e.g., configured similarly as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and thus determine the resulting image resolution. For example, if an LED array is designed to have a pitch p of about 20 microns, the LED mesa diameter/width can be etched to be about 5 microns leaving a recessed space <b>550</b> of about 15 microns wide between adjacent mesas <b>530</b>. In various embodiments, the recessed space can provide a sufficient space to subsequently run, e.g., the n-side contact metal contacts out to the edges of the microscope device/chip.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the passivation layer <b>540</b> within the recessed spaces <b>550</b> can then be patterned by photolithography and etched to allow deposition and definition of a plurality of n-side metal contacts <b>534</b>. These lower n-side contacts <b>534</b> can thus be connected to a first doped layer <b>531</b>, e.g., an n<sup>+</sup> GaN layer, of the layered MQW structure <b>535</b> and can run as stripes that are perpendicular to the plane of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> page.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the n-contacts <b>534</b> can be buried, for example, under a spin-on, curable and etchable dielectric material <b>545</b> that completely fills the recessed space <b>550</b> between the mesas <b>530</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B-5C</figref>). The passivation layer <b>540</b> and spin-on-dielectric <b>545</b> can then be patterned by photolithography and etched to allow deposition and definition of the p-side metal contact stripes <b>532</b>. The lithographically defined p-side electrode recess <b>537</b> in the p-side metal <b>532</b> can keep the metal transparent over the central part of each LED mesa to allow light emission. The p-side metal contact <b>532</b> can be in the form of stripes and can run in a direction parallel to the plane of the figure page, e.g., in a direction of left-to-right. This can create an X-Y contact array where each stripe can be accessible at the edge of the microscope &#x201c;chip&#x201d; and all LEDs in the array can be individually addressable.</p>

Each nanowire <b>625</b> of the array <b>601</b> can be formed on the doped buffer layer <b>620</b> through the growth mask dielectric <b>630</b>. The growth mask dielectric <b>630</b> can be made of dielectric materials as disclosed herein during the formation of the plurality of nanowires and/or nanowire arrays.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a p-side semiconductor <b>645</b> can be formed on the shell surface of each core-shell structure of the array <b>601</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. For example, the p-side semiconductor <b>645</b> can be formed by depositing a semiconductor layer (not shown) on the entire surface of the device <b>600</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and then patterning the semiconductor layer to form the plurality of p-side semiconductors <b>645</b> each enveloping the layered shell <b>635</b>. The p-side semiconductor <b>645</b> can also cover surface portions of the selective growth mask <b>630</b> that are adjacent to the shell structure <b>635</b>.

For example, each p-side electrode <b>647</b> can be electrically connected to a corresponding bond pad <b>652</b> on the ROIC <b>602</b> through conductive structures <b>608</b>. The conductive structures <b>608</b> can be formed by, such as, for example, solder balls, indium bump-bonds, metals, or other conductive structures as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In embodiments, by controlling the bonding methods, composition, and/or annealing process of the conductive structures <b>608</b>, a stress free or strain free bonding between each p-side electrode <b>647</b> and the ROIC <b>602</b> can be obtained. The stress/strain free bonding is important because residual stress/strain generated in the conductive structures or bump bonds may crack and therefore damage the final LED structure.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The substrate <b>610</b>, for example, a sapphire substrate, can then be removed from the device <b>600</b>D by techniques known to one skilled in the art, to expose the doped buffer layer <b>620</b>. The exposed doped buffer layer <b>620</b> can then be patterned to form a plurality of n-side semiconductors <b>628</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>. The n-side semiconductors <b>628</b> can remain connected with the nanowire core <b>625</b> and situating on surface portions of the growth mask dielectric <b>630</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, n-side electrodes <b>680</b> can be formed by depositing an electrode material such as metal(s) on the entire surface of the device <b>600</b>E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, followed by a patterning process to expose a portion of each n-side semiconductors <b>628</b>.

The n-side electrodes <b>680</b> can be formed to assure the conduction between the n-side semiconductor <b>628</b> and the central conductive region including the nanowire core <b>625</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In this manner, an array of LED structures <b>666</b> can be formed over the ROIC <b>602</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>. The LED structure <b>666</b> can include an LED array and can be sufficiently thin such that the microscope device <b>600</b>F can be placed close enough to sample objects for a magnified observation. For example, the LED structure <b>666</b> can have a height H ranging from about 2 &#x3bc;m to about 20 &#x3bc;m, e.g., about 6 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The LED structure <b>666</b> can include an LED array having a plurality of LEDs <b>622</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>. In embodiments, a pitch p between adjacent LEDs <b>622</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can, e.g., range from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, to provide desired optical resolution. In embodiments, the pitch p can be determined by dimensions of the LEDs <b>622</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, e.g., the sidewall electrode thickness, and/or by dimensions of interconnect width between adjacent conductive bond pads <b>652</b> on the ROIC <b>602</b>, which can in turn be defined by the LED current that is required.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Each LED <b>622</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be electrically connected to the ROIC <b>602</b> and can include the core-shell structure <b>635</b>, the n-side semiconductor <b>628</b>, the n-side electrode <b>680</b>, the p-side semiconductors and electrodes <b>645</b>-<b>647</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>. In embodiments, the n-side electrodes <b>680</b> and the p-side electrodes <b>647</b> can use an absorbing metal that is thick enough to reduce or avoid light leakage between adjacent LEDs. The absorbing metal can include, for example, gold, or alloys of gold, or other metals known by one of ordinary skill in the art to form ohmic contacts to the semiconductor material that they are contacting. Eliminating the light leakage in this way can increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio) of the LED detectors. For example, an absorbing metal gold can have an index at blue (&#x3bb;=450 nm) of about 1.4 to about 1.88 and can have an absorption coefficient of about 0.0525 nm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(4&#x3c0;k/&#x3bb;). A gold film will have a transparency (I/I<sub>0</sub>) of I/I<sub>0</sub>=10<sup>&#x2212;0.0525t</sup>, where t is film thickness in nanometer. So, for a 100 nm thick gold film the transparency can be about 5.6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In embodiments, each of the p-side electrode <b>647</b> and the n-side electrode <b>680</b> can have an average thickness ranging from about 100 nm to about 500 nm, although the thickness of the p-side electrode <b>647</b> or the n-side electrode <b>680</b> is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In embodiments, the growth mask dielectric <b>630</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6F</figref>) can have a thickness sufficient to provide isolation between LEDs <b>622</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and to avoid electrical leakage across the selective growth dielectric <b>630</b>. For example, breakdown field for exemplary SiNx thin films is about 3 MV/cm. A 30 nm SiNx will then breakdown at 9V. Breakdown field for SiNx thin films having a thickness of about 100 nm can be about 30V. In embodiments, the growth mask dielectric <b>630</b> can have a thickness of about 30 nm or greater, e.g., about 100 nm or greater. In embodiments, the integrity of this dielectric layer can be independently checked by, e.g., a test structure on the mask-set that is processed during fabrication of the LED.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In embodiments, a common contact can be used for the n-side electrodes <b>680</b> or the p-side electrodes <b>647</b> of the LED array <b>605</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts an exemplary microscope device <b>700</b> formed according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6F</figref> in accordance with various embodiments of the present teachings.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the imaging system <b>800</b>A can include an LED array <b>805</b> having LEDs <b>822</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, for example. The imaging system <b>800</b>A can be used to observe and image a sample object <b>830</b>. In an exemplary embodiment for producing a magnified image (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a first image pixel can be formed by switching on a first exemplary LED <b>822</b><i>c </i>of the LED array <b>805</b> to illuminate a first portion of a sample object <b>830</b> through an emitted light <b>827</b> from the LED <b>822</b><i>c</i>. The emitted light <b>827</b> from the &#x201c;on&#x201d; light emitter <b>822</b><i>c </i>can then be reflected, scattered and/or diffracted from the sample object <b>830</b> and the returned light or reflected light <b>829</b> can be detected and collected immediately by a first plurality of LEDs <b>822</b><i>b </i>and <b>822</b><i>d </i>surrounding the first LED <b>822</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Likewise, a second image pixel can be formed by switching off the first LED <b>822</b><i>c </i>and switching on, for example, a second LED <b>822</b><i>b </i>to illuminate a second portion of the sample object <b>830</b> and using a second plurality of LEDs <b>822</b><i>a </i>and <b>822</b><i>c </i>that surrounds the second LED <b>822</b><i>b </i>to collect a reflected light from the illuminated second portion of the sample object <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The photocurrent detected by the LED light detectors can be summed by the ROIC <b>802</b> and transferred to a control computer <b>855</b> to fix the intensity of each image pixel. By repeating such process, a pixel-to-pixel magnified image of the sample object <b>830</b> can be built. The control computer <b>855</b> can, for example, receive image data and can include data handling algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> depicts another exemplary imaging system in accordance with various embodiments of the present teachings. In this example, double-sided imaging can be performed by using two microscope devices to illuminate and detect one sample object <b>830</b>. For example, a second microscope device <b>800</b>B including an LED array <b>805</b>B can be placed above the first device <b>800</b>A having an LED array <b>805</b>A. The LED array <b>805</b>B can include a plurality of LEDs <b>822</b><i>m</i>-<b>822</b><i>r</i>. The LED array <b>805</b>B can be a detector array having a detector pitch p that is identical to the pitch p of the LED array <b>805</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The two microscope devices having LED arrays <b>805</b>A-B can be configured in parallel or forming an angle such that both of them can be exposed to the sample object <b>830</b>. In an exemplary embodiment for a parallel configuration, the spacing between the underlying LED array <b>805</b>A and the overlying detector array <b>805</b>B can be adjusted to define a sample channel. In embodiments, the height of this channel can further be adjusted to provide a degree of filtering of a specimen, allowing only objects with a size smaller than the channel height to enter the viewing area. For example, the channel can have a height ranging from about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, although other height ranges can be included. Such configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> can provide high image resolution e.g., ranging from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m; and can be used, for example, to create pseudo-3D microscope images.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">During an imaging operation, exemplary LED <b>822</b><i>c </i>can be turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; to illuminate a portion of the sample object <b>830</b> providing reflected light <b>829</b> and transmitted light <b>823</b>. The reflected light <b>829</b> from the illuminated portion of the sample object <b>830</b> can be collected by LEDs <b>822</b><i>b </i>and <b>822</b><i>d </i>surrounding the LED <b>822</b><i>c</i>. The transmitted light <b>823</b> through the illuminated portion of the sample object <b>830</b> can be detected and collected by corresponding LEDs <b>822</b><i>n</i>, <b>822</b><i>o</i>, and <b>822</b><i>p </i>of the second LED array <b>805</b>B to form a first image pixel. As similarly described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, another image pixel can be formed by switching off the LED <b>822</b>C but switching on other LEDs and using surrounding LEDs of the first LED array <b>805</b>A to collect the reflected light from the illuminated sample object and using corresponding LEDs of the second LED array <b>805</b>B to collect transmitted image information from the sample object.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Likewise, the photocurrent detected each time by switching on different LEDs can be summed by the ROIC <b>802</b>A and <b>802</b>B, and both transferred to a control computer <b>855</b> to fix the intensity of each image pixel. By repeating such process, a pixel-to-pixel magnified image of the sample object <b>830</b> can be built and/or displayed on the control computer <b>855</b>. In embodiments, the double-sided imaging configuration can create a channel for liquid samples (e.g., biological cells suspended in an aqueous solution) by adjusting the spacing between the two microscope devices. In various embodiments, the device configuration, the ROIC circuit board, the operation process, along with the data process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8B</figref> can be similar to that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In embodiments, when using either the single-sided (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) or double-sided microscope (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) the ability to control in real time, which pixels are active, allows the disclosed microscope to replicate the &#x201c;fovea&#x201d; function that is a key feature of human vision. At the control computer, the user can select which part, or parts, of the full image field are of interest. The microscope can then activate only those pixels (LEDs) required to view that part(s) of the image field. This imaging strategy can avoid collecting redundant data, which helps to reduce the data rate flowing from the microscope to the control computer thereby keeping the data rate more manageable. In this manner, the real-time selection and focusing of only a portion of the full image field can replicate the action of the fovea in human vision.</p>
