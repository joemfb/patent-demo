<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. As those skilled in the art would realize, the described embodiments may be modified in various different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Constituent elements having the same structures throughout the embodiments are denoted by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, as the size and thickness of the respective structural components shown in the drawings are arbitrarily illustrated for explanatory convenience, and not considered limiting. In the drawings, for better understanding and ease of description, the thickness of layers, films, panels, regions, etc., may be exaggerated for clarity. It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, film, region, or substrate is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Hereinafter, a display device <b>101</b> according to an embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display device <b>101</b> includes a display panel <b>50</b> and an integrated receiving member <b>890</b> supporting the display panel <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the display panel <b>50</b> is a liquid crystal display panel. Thus, the display device <b>101</b> further includes a light source unit <b>76</b> required for light supply to the display panel <b>50</b>, a light guiding plate <b>74</b>, a reflective member <b>79</b>, and a plurality of optical sheets <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, an organic light emitting display panel may be used as the display panel <b>50</b> instead of the liquid crystal display panel. In this case, the light source unit <b>76</b>, the light guiding plate <b>74</b>, the reflective member <b>79</b>, and the plurality of optical sheets <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, the display device <b>101</b> further includes a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) <b>40</b> connected to one side of the display panel <b>50</b> to transmit a driving signal to the display panel <b>50</b> and an integrated circuit (IC) chip <b>515</b> installed on the display panel <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, a protective layer is coated around the IC chip <b>515</b> to protect the IC chip <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the display device may further include a fixing member <b>60</b> for fixing the display panel <b>50</b> to the integrated receiving member <b>890</b>, and other parts may further be included depending on the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The display panel <b>50</b> includes a first substrate <b>51</b>, a second substrate <b>53</b> arranged opposite to the first substrate <b>51</b>, and a liquid crystal layer (not shown) disposed between the first and second substrates <b>51</b> and <b>53</b>. Here, the first substrate <b>51</b> is a rear-side substrate and the second substrate <b>53</b> is a front-side substrate. In one embodiment, the second substrate <b>53</b> is smaller than the first substrate <b>51</b> in size.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The display panel <b>50</b> displays an image through a plurality of pixels. Here, the pixel is a minimum unit displaying an image. The first substrate <b>51</b> includes a thin film transistor (TFT) that is a switching element formed in each pixel and a pixel electrode connected with the thin film transistor. The second substrate <b>53</b> includes a common electrode. In one embodiment, at least one of the first substrate <b>51</b> and the second substrate <b>53</b> further includes a color filter. The liquid crystal layer (not shown) may be disposed between the pixel electrode of the first substrate <b>51</b> and the common electrode of the second substrate <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the thin film transistor is turned on, an electric filed is formed between the pixel electrode and the common electrode. Due to the electric field, the liquid crystal layer (not shown) disposed between the first and second substrates <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> is changed and light transmittance of each pixel in the display panel <b>50</b> is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With such a configuration, the display device <b>101</b> acquires a desired image by controlling transmittance of light passing through the display panel <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, although it is not shown, the display panel <b>50</b> may further include polarizing plates respectively attached to a rear side of the first substrate <b>51</b> and a front side of the second substrate <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The IC chip <b>515</b> is mounted on an edge of the substrate <b>51</b> without being overlapped with the second substrate <b>53</b>. In addition, the FPC board <b>40</b> is connected to the edge of the first substrate <b>51</b> where the IC chip <b>515</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The FPC board <b>40</b> includes a substrate main body <b>41</b>, a connection portion <b>42</b>, and a connector portion <b>44</b>. The substrate main body <b>41</b> is mounted with several circuit elements, and supplies a driving signal to the display panel <b>50</b>. The connection portion <b>42</b> extends from one side of the substrate main body <b>41</b> and electrically connects the substrate main body <b>41</b> and the display panel <b>50</b>. A connector <b>46</b> is formed at one end of the connector portion <b>44</b>. Through the connector <b>46</b>, the FPC board <b>40</b> receives a signal according to the degree of the opening of a folder window for a mobile phone and other signal information.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The light guiding plate <b>74</b> is arranged opposite to the rear side of the display panel <b>50</b>. The light guiding plate <b>74</b> guides light emitted from the light source unit <b>76</b> and substantially transmits uniform light to the rear side of the display panel <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light source unit <b>76</b> is disposed at one edge of the light guiding plate <b>74</b> and supplies light thereto. The light source unit <b>76</b> includes a plurality of light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>761</b> and a substrate <b>762</b> used as a light source and installing the light emitting diodes <b>761</b>. The substrate <b>762</b> used as a light source is connected with the FPC board <b>40</b> and receives a light source control signal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates three light emitting diodes <b>761</b>, but the embodiment is not limited thereto. Thus, the number of light emitting diodes <b>761</b> may be variously controlled as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the light source unit <b>76</b> is formed separately from the FPC board <b>40</b>, but the present embodiment is not limited thereto. Thus, the FPC board <b>40</b> and the light source unit <b>76</b> may be integrally formed. That is, the light source unit <b>76</b> may be directly installed on the FPC board <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The reflective member <b>79</b> is arranged opposite to the rear side of the light guiding plate <b>74</b>. The reflective member <b>79</b> functions to substantially reflect light incident from the light source unit <b>76</b> to the light guiding plate <b>74</b> and moving toward an opposite direction of the display panel <b>50</b> back to the light guiding plate <b>74</b>. Thus, the reflective member <b>79</b> substantially reduces light loss and helps light diffusion in the light guiding plate <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The optical sheets <b>72</b> are disposed between the light guiding plate <b>74</b> and the display panel <b>50</b>. The optical sheets <b>72</b> further diffuse light moving toward the display panel <b>50</b> from the light guiding plate <b>74</b> and reinforce luminance. In one embodiment, the optical sheets <b>72</b> include a diffusion sheet and a pair of prism sheets. In one embodiment, the diffusion sheet is arranged on the light guiding plate <b>74</b> opposite to each other to further diffuse light emitted from the light guiding plate <b>74</b>. The prism sheets may be disposed on the diffuse sheet and collect light toward a front side direction. In one embodiment, the pair of prism sheets have waves formed in directions crossing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, the optical sheets <b>72</b> have include various configurations known to a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The integrated receiving member <b>890</b> includes a press molding portion <b>90</b> and an injection molding portion <b>80</b>. The press molding portion <b>90</b> is formed with a metallic material, and the injection molding portion <b>80</b> is formed with a resin-based material. The press molding portion <b>90</b> and the injection molding portion <b>80</b> are integrally formed through an insert injection method.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The press molding portion <b>90</b> includes a bottom portion <b>92</b> in the shape of a plate and a side wall portion <b>94</b> bent and extended from the bottom portion <b>92</b>. In addition, at least one through-hole <b>95</b> is formed in the side wall portion <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The injection molding portion <b>80</b> includes a frame portion <b>84</b> integrally attached to at least one side of the press molding portion <b>90</b> and a flange portion <b>85</b> extended from the frame portion <b>84</b> and protruded while being penetrating through the through-hole <b>95</b>. In this case, the flange portion <b>85</b> is partially or wholly separated from the side wall portion <b>94</b> in the through-hole <b>95</b>. In further detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the flange portion <b>85</b> is partially or wholly separated from the side wall portion <b>94</b> in the through-hole <b>95</b> by a distance d greater than about 0.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, the flange unit <b>85</b> protrudes to a direction crossing the side wall portion <b>94</b>. That is, the flange portion <b>85</b> protrudes to a direction substantially perpendicular to the side wall portion <b>94</b>. In addition, the flange portion <b>85</b> is formed along a length direction of the side wall portion <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, a side of the flange portion <b>85</b>, substantially parallel with a side of the display panel <b>50</b> displaying an image is formed in the shape of a trapezoid.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, corners between the frame portion <b>84</b> and the flange portion <b>85</b> protruded and extended from the frame portion <b>84</b> are at least partially rounded. In this case, the rounded corner has a radius R greater than about 0.3 mm. The rounded corner improves the strength of the flange portion <b>85</b> protruded from the frame portion <b>84</b>. That is, the rounded corner suppresses the flange portion <b>85</b> from being easily separated from the frame portion <b>84</b>. Further, the strength of the flange portion <b>85</b> is sufficiently improved when the radius of the rounded corner is greater than about 0.3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The flange portion <b>85</b> protruding through the side wall portion <b>94</b> may be used when the display device <b>101</b> is assembled to the module.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With such a configuration, the durability of the display device <b>101</b> can be improved and suppress possible device failure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During a cooling process after the insert injection process for forming the integrated receiving member <b>890</b>, an injection molding portion <b>80</b> cooled in the state of contacting the press molding portion <b>90</b> made of a metallic material and an injection molding portion <b>80</b> cooled in the state of not-contacting the press molding portion <b>90</b> have different cooling speed and thus a thermal stress occurs at the boundary therebetween and the injection molding portions <b>80</b> become easily broken. For example, the injection molding portion <b>80</b> is mostly cooled while being in contact with the press molding portion <b>90</b>, but the flange portion <b>85</b> of the injection molding portion <b>80</b> is protruded so that it is cooled without being in contact with the press molding portion <b>90</b>. In this case, as the flange portion <b>85</b> protruded through the through-hole <b>95</b> is adjacent to the side wall portion <b>94</b> and as the adjacent portion is increased, thermal stress is concentrated on a relatively weak portion in the injection molding portion <b>80</b>, that is, the flange portion <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, the flange portion <b>85</b> is wholly or partially separated from the side wall portion <b>94</b> within the through-hole <b>95</b> so that the thermal stress is dispersed to the frame portion <b>84</b> rather than being concentrated on the flange portion <b>85</b>. Thus, the flange portion <b>85</b> can be prevented from being easily broken by external impact.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">However, when the flange portion <b>85</b> is wholly or partially separated from the side wall portion <b>94</b> within the through-hole <b>95</b> by a distance d of less than about 0.5 mm, the thermal stress concentrated on the flange portion <b>85</b> cannot be sufficiently dispersed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to at least one of the disclosed embodiments, durability of the display device <b>101</b> can be wholly improved. Further, occurrence of a failure can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the described embodiments have been described in connection with the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are not considered limiting. Thus, various modifications and equivalent arrangements are included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
