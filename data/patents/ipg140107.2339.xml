<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Protection devices use padding to absorb impact energy and protect against injury to soft tissue, organs, and property. Protection devices including helmets, kneepads, elbow pads, and chest protectors contain padding to absorb impact energy. Designers of passenger compartments install impact-absorbing padding for occupant protection. Other protection devices include padding that is attached to walls and corners in corridors of buildings and padding associated with posts, utility poles, and equipment in recreational areas. Protection devices include padding material to protect devices from impact energy during shipment and/or in use. Padding material can undergo elastic and/or plastic deformation while absorbing compressive force and energy in response to an impact. Known padding used in protection devices is fabricated using homologous materials having a capacity for impact-absorption that varies with material temperature, which changes in response to changes in ambient temperature.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the purpose of limiting the same, embodiments of an energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> configured to absorb energy associated with a compressive force between first and second impact surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are shown. Like numerals refer to like elements in the various drawings and embodiments. The energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> includes a polymeric material <b>20</b> that commingles with a structural element <b>30</b> to form a unitary piece that can absorb energy associated with compressive force created by an impact between the first and second impact surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Preferably the polymeric material <b>20</b> overfills the structural element <b>30</b> when they are commingled.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The polymeric material <b>20</b> is a material having a first temperature-responsive stiffness. The first temperature-responsive stiffness is a stiffness of the material, e.g., modulus of elasticity, that is temperature-responsive, i.e., the stiffness of the material changes with a change in material temperature. In one embodiment, the first temperature-responsive stiffness of the polymeric material <b>20</b> decreases in response to an increase in the material temperature. In one embodiment, the polymeric material <b>20</b> is a crushable foam material. Alternatively, the polymeric material <b>20</b> is an active material (AM), e.g., a shape memory polymer (SMP) formulated to have the first temperature-responsive stiffness including a stiffness that decreases in response to an increase in material temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The structural element <b>30</b> is a fabricated element constructed from an active material (AM), e.g., a shape memory alloy (SMA). The active material is preferably formulated such that the structural element <b>30</b> achieves a second temperature-responsive stiffness that is converse to the first temperature-responsive stiffness associated with the polymeric material <b>20</b>. This includes formulating the active material to have a transformation temperature range such that the structural element <b>30</b> achieves the second temperature-responsive stiffness that is converse to the first temperature-responsive stiffness associated with the polymeric material <b>20</b>. In one embodiment the second temperature-responsive stiffness of the structural element <b>30</b> fabricated from the active material increases in response to an increase in material temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second temperature-responsive stiffness is said to be converse to the first temperature-responsive stiffness in that the second temperature-responsive stiffness increases in response to an increase in material temperature whereas the first temperature-responsive stiffness decreases in response to an increase in material temperature. Preferably a rate of increasing stiffness associated with the first temperature-responsive stiffness corresponds to a rate of decreasing stiffness associated with the second temperature-responsive stiffness such that the overall stiffness of the energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> including the polymeric material <b>20</b> commingled with the structural element <b>30</b> is substantially constant over an expected range of material and ambient temperatures. Preferably the predetermined range of material and ambient temperatures correspond to material and ambient temperatures associated with applications of the energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b>. In one embodiment the first temperature-responsive stiffness associated with the polymeric material <b>20</b> decreases with increased material temperature and the second temperature-responsive stiffness associated with the structural element <b>30</b> increases with the increased material temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The structural element <b>30</b> is fabricated from a shape memory alloy that has a transformation temperature range and an associated temperature-responsive stiffness. In one embodiment the structural configuration of the fabricated structural element <b>30</b> in combination with the formulated temperature-responsive stiffness of the shape memory alloy achieves the second temperature-responsive stiffness. Thus an overall stiffness of the energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> is substantially unchanged over the predetermined range of ambient temperatures. The first and second temperature-responsive stiffnesses of the active materials (AM) forming the polymeric material <b>20</b> and the structural element <b>30</b> of the energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> are preferably passive, i.e., there is no active temperature monitoring and associated control.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The structural element <b>30</b> is fabricated using an active material, which preferably includes a shape memory alloy (SMA). As used herein the term active material (AM) includes a material or polymeric composite that undergoes a reversible change in a characteristic property when activated by an external stimulus. As described herein, the external stimulus for the active material includes a change in material temperature. Active materials include shape memory alloys (SMA) and shape memory polymers (SMP), and other materials as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferably, the structural element <b>30</b> is fabricated using a shape memory alloy (SMA) having martensite and austenite transformation temperature ranges that are substantially coincident with a range of ambient temperatures at which the energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A shape memory alloy can exist in several different temperature-dependent phases, including martensite and austenite phases. The martensite phase refers to a more deformable and less stiff phase that occurs at lower material temperatures. The austenite phase refers to a stiffer and more rigid phase that occurs at higher material temperatures. There are transformation temperature ranges including start temperatures and end temperatures over which a shape memory alloy transforms between the martensite and austenite phases. A shape memory alloy in the martensite phase changes into the austenite phase over an austenite transformation temperature range with increasing material temperature. The material temperature at which the change from the martensite phase to the austenite phase begins is referred to as austenite start temperature T(A<sub>S</sub>). The material temperature at which the change to the martensite phase is complete is called the austenite finish temperature T(A<sub>F</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A shape memory alloy in the austenite phase changes into the martensite phase over a martensite transformation temperature range with decreasing temperature. The material temperature at which the change from the austenite phase to the martensite phase begins is referred to as martensite start temperature T(M<sub>S</sub>). The material temperature at which the change to the austenite phase is complete is called the martensite finish temperature T(M<sub>F</sub>). A shape memory alloy has a lower modulus of elasticity and is more easily deformable in the martensite phase and has a higher modulus of elasticity and is thus less easily deformable in the austenite phase.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Active materials that exhibit an intrinsic shape memory effect are fabricated from a shape memory alloy composition that will automatically reform as a result of the above noted phase transformations.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the structural element <b>30</b> is fabricated using a shape memory alloy (SMA) having martensite and austenite transformation temperature ranges that allow the structural element <b>30</b> to achieve the second temperature-responsive stiffness over the range of ambient temperatures at which the energy-absorbing pad <b>10</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Intrinsic two-way shape memory behavior is preferably induced in the active material through processing. Such procedures include extreme deformation of the material while in the martensite phase, heating-cooling under constraint or load, or surface modification such as laser annealing, polishing, or shot-peening. Once the active material has been trained to exhibit the two-way shape memory effect, the shape change between the low and high temperature states is generally reversible and persists through a high number of thermal cycles. Active materials that exhibit the extrinsic two-way shape memory effects are composite or multi-component materials that combine a shape memory alloy composition that exhibits a one-way effect with another element that provides a restoring force to reform the original shape. The temperature at which the shape memory alloy remembers its high temperature form when heated can be adjusted by slight changes in the composition of the alloy and through heat treatment. In nickel-titanium shape memory alloys, for example, it can be changed from above about 100&#xb0; C. to below about &#x2212;100&#xb0; C. The shape recovery process occurs over a range of just a few degrees and the start or finish of the transformation can be controlled to within a degree or two depending on the desired application and alloy composition. The mechanical properties of the shape memory alloy vary greatly over the temperature range spanning their transformation, typically providing the active material with shape memory effects as well as energy damping capacity. The energy damping capacity of the shape memory alloys can be used to counteract changes in the energy absorbing properties of the crushable foam material of the polymeric material <b>20</b>. One skilled in the art is capable of formulating shape memory alloys to have transformation temperature ranges that counteract changes in the energy absorbing properties of the crushable foam material of the polymeric material <b>20</b>.</p>
