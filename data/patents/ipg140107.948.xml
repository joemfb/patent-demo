<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and related systems are described relating to monitoring particulates downhole at in-situ conditions. Solid particles being carried in the fluid as the fluid is produced from the reservoir formation are monitored. The downhole solid particle monitoring can include measuring the quantity (e.g., volume fraction, weight fraction, or the like) of solid particles, measuring the distribution of sizes of the solid particles, and/or measuring the shape of the particles. The solid particles can be monitored using one or more of sensors such as optical spectrometers, acoustic sensors, video cameras, and erosion probes. A sanding prediction is generated based at least in part on the monitoring of the solid particles, and the sanding prediction is then used to design a completion, lift system, and surface facilities for the wellbore and/or select operating conditions so as to control sanding during production.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This patent specification generally relates to downhole fluid analysis and in-situ formation evaluation. More particularly, this patent specification relates to in-situ evaluations of reservoir sanding and fines migrations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The design of the completion of a producing well is a complex process that uses multiple sources of reservoir information. Similarly, the design of the production system, including artificial lift and surface facilities, relies on such information. A common problem for many wells is the tendency to produce solid particles from the reservoir formation, such as sand grains, fine particles, and the like. The production of solid particles is usually termed &#x201c;sanding&#x201d;, although the particles need not be sand; for example, a carbonate reservoir that produces solid particles is said to produce &#x201c;sand&#x201d;. Known methods for predicting sanding potential include using a stress-based mechanical model of the formation. Important inputs to such models are pore pressure, stress conditions, rock strength, and rock material properties. Rock material properties include grain sorting, shape, and size distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The rock material properties are typically determined from mechanical testing on reservoir core samples. The tests are conducted at a surface laboratory. However, once a core is extracted from underground, it is impossible to restore it to exactly the same stress state as existed in the reservoir. Furthermore, it is possible for the core sample to undergo irreversible changes before it can be tested, including total collapse of the core. Although techniques exist for in-situ measurement of rock properties, these are limited mainly to measuring stress conditions. M. A. Addis et al. discuss a &#x201c;Sand Influx Test&#x201d; in which sand is deliberately produced from the reservoir; see &#x201c;Sand Quantification: The Impact on Sandface Completion Selection and Design, Facilities Design and Risk Evaluation,&#x201d; paper SPE 116713 presented at the 2008 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, Colo., September 21-24, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Addis (2008)&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein. However, this test requires sand to be produced to the surface, where all monitoring takes place. There is no guarantee that all the sand produced by the reservoir will flow to the surface. In fact, in most cases some portion of the produced sand flowing from the reservoir falls back into the well before it reaches the surface, making the test results unreliable. In addition, because all monitoring is at the surface (which is many thousands of feet away from the reservoir), there is a lengthy and unquantifiable time delay between what happens downhole and what is monitored at the surface. Furthermore, since all the control is performed at the surface, the range of flow rates and pressure drawdowns is limited. There are currently no methods for in-situ measurement of rock material properties such as grain sorting, shape, and size distribution, or measurement of the sanding potential of a reservoir formation. The lack of this information impacts the ability to design an optimal well completion, lift system, and surface facilities.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to embodiments, a system for making measurements relating to particulates downhole at in-situ conditions is provided. The system includes a tool body adapted to be deployed in a borehole formed within a fluid containing subterranean formation, and a particulate measurement system housed within the tool body and adapted and positioned to monitor solid particles being carried in the fluid as the fluid is produced from the formation. The solid particle monitoring can include measuring downhole the quantity (e.g., volume fraction, weight fraction, or the like) of solid particles within the produced fluid, measuring downhole the distribution of sizes of the solid particles within the produced fluid, and/or measuring downhole the shape of the particles within the produced fluid. The solid particles can be monitored using one or more of sensors such as optical spectrometers, acoustic sensors, video cameras, and erosion probes. A processing system can generate a sanding prediction based at least in part on the monitoring of the solid particles in the produced fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to embodiments a method for making downhole in-situ evaluations relating to particulates is provided. The method includes deploying a tool body in the wellbore formed within a fluid containing subterranean formation; drawing the fluid from the formation into the tool body; and monitoring solid particles being carried in the fluid as the fluid is produced from the formation. According to some embodiments, a sanding prediction is generated based at least in part on the monitoring of the solid particles, and the sanding prediction is then used to design a completion, lift system, and surface facilities for the well and/or select operating conditions so as to control sanding during production.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice. Further, like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicated like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This patent specification generally relates to the field of downhole fluid analysis and in-situ formation evaluation. According to some embodiments, these activities are practiced during a formation test. According to some other embodiments, the analysis is performed as part of a well test (e.g., drillstem test; production test), production logging operation, or any other operation where reservoir fluids can be evaluated at downhole conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In recent years, downhole fluid characterization techniques, including contamination monitoring, composition measurement, and single-phase assurance, have provided real-time fluid property information during formation testing. Downhole fluid analysis helps ensure that representative samples are obtained, and allows an unlimited number of zones to be evaluated in a &#x201c;fluid scanning&#x201d; mode. An important benefit of downhole fluid analysis is that the reservoir fluid is characterized at in-situ conditions. This eliminates the risk that by the time a captured sample arrives at a surface laboratory, the sample is no longer representative (due to leaks, irreversible changes caused by changing temperature, etc.). According to some embodiments, an in-situ particulate evaluation system is provided that is analogous to downhole fluid analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to some embodiments, a process is provided for determining optimal design of the completion, lift system, and surface facilities for a well based on in-situ evaluation of reservoir sanding and fines migration. The process uses the in-situ analysis of rock material properties such as grain sorting, shape, and size distribution, and a test procedure to measure the sanding potential of a formation as a function of drawdown pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The most typical sand production problems are found in poorly-consolidated formations. Formations having poor cementation will usually produce sand if the effective in-situ stress exceeds the formation strength. For further information, see Morita, N., and Boyd, P. A.: &#x201c;Typical Sand Production Problems: Case Studies and Strategies for Sand Control,&#x201d; paper SPE 22739 presented at the 1991 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Dallas, Tex., October 6-9 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Morita (1991)&#x201d;), which is incorporated by reference herein. However, sand failure does not always cause sand production; failed sand can remain stable due to capillary forces holding the particles together. See Palmer, I., Vaziri, H., Willson, S., Moschovidis, Z., Cameron, J., and Ispas, I.: &#x201c;Predicting and Managing Sand Production: A New Strategy,&#x201d; paper SPE 84499 presented at the 2003 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Denver, Colo., October 5-8 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Palmer (2003)&#x201d;), incorporated by reference herein. Following water breakthrough, there is a loss of capillary force and sand production will often begin. For further information, see Morita (1991); Farrow, C., Munro, D., and McCarthy, T.: &#x201c;Screening Methodology for Downhole Sand Control Selection,&#x201d; paper SPE 88493 presented at the 2004 SPE Asia Pacific Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition, Perth, Australia, October 18-20 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Farrow (2004)&#x201d;); and Oyeneyin, M. B., Peden, J. M., Hosseini, A., and Ren, G.: &#x201c;Factors to Consider in the Effective Management and Control of Fines Migration in High Permeability Sands,&#x201d; paper SPE 30112 presented at the 1995 SPE European Formation Damage Conference, The Hague, The Netherlands, May 15-16 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Oyeneyin (1995)&#x201d;), each of which is incorporated by reference herein. The volume of sand produced from a poorly-consolidated formation may reach 10 to 20% of the total fluid production, resulting in sand-up within a few days. See, e.g. Morita (1991).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to some embodiments, systems and methods for predicting sanding potential and the effects of sand production on the reservoir, completion, lift system, and surface facilities are provided. The onset of sanding can be predicted using a stress-based model of shear failure around a perforation or an openhole wellbore. One common input to the model is data from a thick-walled cylinder test (TWC) obtained from cores; a second input is unconfined compressive strength (UCS), which can be measured from cores or can be predicted from wireline logs. An estimation of whether the produced sand will be carried to the surface or if it will accumulate in the wellbore can be made by estimating the drag force the fluid will have on the sand particles, which in-turn relies on the particle size being known. See, e.g. Palmer (2003). Erosion modeling can be used in deciding whether downhole sand control needs to be applied. See, e.g. McPhee, C., Farrow, C., and McCurdy, P.: &#x201c;Challenging Convention in Sand Control: Southern North Sea Examples,&#x201d; <i>SPE Production &#x26; Operations</i>, May 2007, Volume 22, Number 2, 223-230 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;McPhee (2007)&#x201d;), which is incorporated herein by reference. Particle size distribution is also important; it is not enough to know only the average particle size of the reservoir sand. Formation sand grain sorting, shape (well-rounded vs. angular), size, and size distribution should be obtained. See, e.g. Oyeneyin (1995). Particle size information can be determined from core samples. See, e.g. Farrow (2004); and Constien, V. G., and Skidmore, V.: &#x201c;Standalone Screen Selection Using Performance Mastercurves,&#x201d; paper SPE 98363 presented at the 2006 SPE International Symposium and Exhibition on Formation Damage Control, Lafayette, La., February 15-17, which is incorporated by reference herein. However, according to embodiments, as is described in further detail below, particle size information is analyzed in-situ downhole.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a downhole system for analyzing particulates in-situ with a formation testing tool, according to embodiments. Wireline logging system <b>100</b> is shown including multiple tools containing sensors for taking geophysical measurements. Wireline <b>103</b> is a power and data transmission cable that connects the tools to a data acquisition and processing system <b>105</b> on the surface. The tools connected to the wireline <b>103</b> are lowered into an uncased section of well borehole <b>107</b> to obtain measurements of geophysical properties for the surrounding subterranean rock formation <b>110</b>. The wireline <b>103</b> supports tools by supplying power to the tool string <b>101</b>. Furthermore, the wireline <b>103</b> provides a communication medium to send signals to the tools and to receive data from the tools.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The tools, sometimes referred to as modules, are typically connected via a tool bus <b>193</b> to telemetry unit <b>191</b> which in turn connects to the wireline <b>103</b> for receiving and transmitting data and control signals between the tools and the surface data acquisition and processing system <b>105</b>. Commonly, the tools are lowered to a particular depth of interest in the borehole and are then retrieved by the data acquisition and processing system <b>105</b>. For sampling and testing operations a tool such as Schlumberger's Modular Formation Dynamics Tester tool (MDT) tool may be used. The tool is positioned at the desired location and data are collected while the tool is stationary. The data are sent via wireline <b>103</b> to data acquisition and processing system <b>105</b> at the surface, usually contained inside a logging truck or logging unit (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Electronic power module <b>120</b> converts AC power from the surface to provide DC power for all modules in the tool string <b>101</b>. Pumpout module <b>130</b> is used to pump unwanted fluid, for example mud filtrate, from the formation to the borehole via a flowline within the modules (not shown), so that representative samples can be taken from formation <b>110</b>. Pumpout module <b>130</b> can also be used to pump fluid from the borehole into the flowline for inflating packers in a module containing inflatable packers. Pumpout module <b>130</b> can also be configured to transfer fluid from one part of the tool string to another via the flowline. Hydraulic module <b>132</b> contains an electric motor and hydraulic pump to provide hydraulic power as may be needed by certain modules.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Single-probe module <b>136</b> contains a selectively extendable fluid admitting probe assembly <b>138</b> having a packer, and telescoping backup pistons <b>140</b> which are selectively extendable for anchoring and are arranged on opposite sides of the tool body. The probe assembly <b>138</b> is configured to selectively seal off or isolate selected portions of the wall of the wellbore to fluidly couple the adjacent formation <b>110</b> and draw fluid samples from the formation <b>110</b>. Also included is a fluid analysis module <b>180</b> through which the obtained fluid samples can flow. The fluid may thereafter be expelled through a port (not shown) or it may be sent to one or more sample chamber units <b>170</b>, which may receive and retain the formation fluid for subsequent testing at the surface or a testing facility. Module <b>136</b> may also contain pressure gauges, fluid resistivity, and temperature sensors, and a pretest chamber (not shown). Examples of a fluid sampling system using probes and packers are depicted in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,936,139 and 4,860,581, which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Dual-packer module <b>150</b> includes an upper inflatable packer element <b>152</b>, lower packer element <b>154</b>, valve body <b>160</b> and electronics <b>162</b>. Inflatable packer elements <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> seal against the borehole wall <b>107</b> to isolate an interval of the borehole. Pumpout Module <b>130</b> inflates the packers with wellbore fluid. Inlet <b>155</b> is provided to draw fluid from the packer interval to the interior of the tool body. The length of the test interval (i.e., the distance between the packers) is about 3.2 ft (0.98 m) and can be extended by inserting spacers between the packer elements. The area of the isolated interval of the borehole is many orders of magnitude larger than the area of the borehole wall isolated by a probe such as probe <b>138</b>. For fluid sampling, the large area results in flowing pressures that are only slightly below the reservoir pressure, which avoids or reduces phase separation for pressure-sensitive fluids such as gas condensates or volatile oils. In low-permeability formations, high pressure drop (drawdown) usually occurs with the probe, whereas the fluid can be withdrawn from the formation using the dual-packer module <b>150</b> with minimum pressure drop through the larger flowing area. Dual-packer module <b>150</b> can also be used to create a micro-hydraulic fracture that can be pressure tested to determine the minimum in-situ stress magnitude. The fracture is created by pumping wellbore fluid into the interval between the inflatable packer elements. Below dual-packer module <b>150</b> are one or more sample chamber units <b>170</b> for holding fluid samples collected downhole. Although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> both a single-probe module <b>138</b> and a dual-packer module <b>150</b> are shown, in practice, according to some embodiments one or the other could be used alone in toolstring <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the illustrated example, the data acquisition and processing system <b>105</b> and/or a downhole control system housed within tool string <b>101</b> are configured to control either the single-probe assembly <b>136</b> or dual-packet module <b>150</b> to draw fluid samples from the formation <b>110</b> and to control the fluid analysis module <b>180</b> to measure the fluid samples. In some example implementations, the fluid analysis module <b>180</b> may be configured to analyze the measurement data of the fluid samples as described herein. In other example implementations, the fluid analysis module <b>180</b> may be configured to generate and store the measurement data and subsequently communicate the measurement data to the surface for subsequent analysis at the surface. Note that the downhole control system can be implemented separate from the modules <b>136</b> and <b>150</b>, or in some example implementations, the downhole control system may be implemented in the modules <b>136</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are shown and described above as being communicatively coupled and arranged in a particular configuration, the components of the tool string <b>101</b> can be communicatively coupled and/or arranged differently than depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the example methods described herein are not limited to a particular conveyance type but, instead, may be implemented in connection with different conveyance types including, for example, coiled tubing, wireline, wired-drill-pipe, and/or other conveyance means known in the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>show farther detail of a fluid analysis module for in-situ particulate analysis, according to embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, fluid analysis module <b>180</b> includes various types of measurement systems such as video camera <b>240</b>, optical spectrometer <b>242</b>, acoustic sensor <b>244</b> and erosion probe <b>246</b>. Each of the types of measurement systems can be used to collect particulate information on the fluid flowing in flowline <b>212</b>. Processing unit <b>248</b> is used to control the measurement systems and also to collect, store and process data from the measurement systems. Unit <b>248</b> is also connected to tool bus <b>193</b> so as to enable control and communication of data to with the surface and other parts of the tool string. By providing the ability to control the tool and measurement process downhole, the reservoir can be tested at a much wider range of flow rates and pressure drawdowns than can be achieved with surface control. Although four types of measurement systems are shown as part of module <b>180</b>, in practice any number or combination of measurement systems can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>shows further detail of a video camera measurement system <b>240</b>, according to some embodiments. The camera <b>222</b> includes a lens <b>226</b> and lighting source <b>228</b> (for example, LED's). The light source <b>228</b> is positioned at the top of the camera <b>222</b> to provide backlighting. The window <b>220</b> on flowline <b>212</b> has a non-reflective coating. According to some embodiments, window <b>220</b> is made from sapphire. The camera <b>222</b> can be controlled and programmed to take single-shot images or continuous video, or both of the formation fluid <b>208</b> flowing in flowline <b>212</b>. Electrical and/or fiber optic connection lines <b>224</b> are used to control the camera <b>222</b> and to transmit electronic and/or optical information from camera <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>shows farther detail of an optical spectroscopy measurement system <b>242</b>, according to some embodiments. Light from a tungsten halogen lamp <b>230</b> is directed along either of two paths. One path, source path <b>236</b> is used for downhole calibration, while the other path, measure path <b>232</b> directs the light to the flowline <b>212</b> for measurement. Light passes through the formation fluid <b>208</b> within flowline <b>212</b> by way of sapphire windows <b>234</b><i>a </i>and <b>234</b><i>b </i>and shutter <b>250</b> to a spectral distributor <b>238</b> where photodiode detectors <b>252</b>, each tuned to a different wavelength, measure the transmission intensity. The system <b>242</b> can provide measurements in the ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared wavelength regions. For further details on downhole optical analysis of formation fluids, see Badry, R., Fincher, D., Mullins, O., Schroeder, B., and Smits, T.: &#x201c;Downhole Optical Analysis of Formation Fluids,&#x201d; Oilfield Review 6, no. 1 (January 1994), 21-28, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d </i>shows further detail of an acoustic measurement system <b>244</b>, according to some embodiments. A pulse generator or pulser <b>260</b> generates an electrical signal which is transmitted to an acoustic probe <b>262</b> that transforms the electrical signal into an acoustic signal that is transmitted into the formation fluid <b>208</b> flowing in flowline <b>212</b>. The same probe <b>262</b> or optionally a separate acoustic sensor <b>264</b>, detects an &#x201c;echo&#x201d; of the acoustic signal, which is caused by scattering of the signal as it encounters sand particles in the fluid <b>208</b>. An amplifier <b>266</b> amplifies the detected scattered signal and transmits the amplified signal to an oscilloscope <b>268</b> which converts the signal from analog to digital, selects that part of the detected scattered signal that results from scattering in the focal region of the probe (which selection step is termed &#x201c;gating&#x201d;), and transforms the amplitude vs. frequency distribution. This distribution is transmitted to processing unit <b>248</b> that compares the distribution with a standard and thereby detecting, determining, or otherwise quantifying particle size of the sand in formation fluid <b>208</b>.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>e </i>shows further detail of an erosion probe <b>246</b>, according to some embodiments. The probe is based on the electrical resistance principle, where metal loss on the metal-covered probe <b>284</b> is measured by electronics <b>280</b> as increased electrical resistance. The metal loss is caused by sand erosion. That is, as the sand particles in formation fluid <b>208</b> flowing in flowline <b>212</b> erode the metal on probe <b>284</b>, the resistance increases as the metal loss increases. Electronics <b>280</b> is controlled by and transmits data via connection <b>282</b>. Sand production rates can be quantified by combining measured metal loss rates with average sand particle size and flow data. According to some embodiments, the probe <b>284</b> is made of corrosion-resistant materials so that sand erosion can be distinguished from corrosion due to acidic fluids, hydrogen sulphide, etc.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, there is almost no production of solid particles, which are identified as the dark spots such a spot <b>310</b>. As the flowing pressure is lowered at the wellbore, the formation produces a significant amount of solid particles such as dark spots <b>320</b> and <b>322</b>, as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. An image analysis of pictures such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>provides an estimate of the quantity of solids being produced, as well as the distribution of the size and shape of the solid particles.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plot showing optical density versus optical spectrometer wavelength, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that a downhole optical spectrometer, such as optical spectrometer <b>242</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, can be used to identify the production of sand. Curve <b>410</b> shows the optical spectrum (i.e., plot of optical density vs. wavelength) of a medium-weight crude oil that contains no solid particles. Curve <b>412</b> shows the optical spectrum of the same fluid containing solid particles. This fluid exhibits &#x201c;optical scattering&#x201d;, which is an increase in the value of optical density due to the effect of the solid particles scattering the optical spectrometer light. Note that the amount of scattering (i.e., difference curve <b>410</b> and curve <b>412</b>) is not a constant. This is due to the fact that the solid particles are not all the same size and shape, so the amount of scattering will be different for each wavelength of the light.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows results obtained from an in-situ test to measure the sand production as a function of pressure drawdown, using a tool such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to some embodiments. The term &#x201c;pressure drawdown&#x201d; refers to the difference between static reservoir pressure and the flowing pressure at the wellbore. This example curve <b>510</b> shows a reservoir that produces sand-free until a critical drawdown pressure of approximately 350 psi. At this point sand production commences, and increasingly larger amounts of sand are produced as the pressure drawdown increases (i.e., as the flowing pressure at the wellbore is reduced by increasing the pump rate).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart showing steps associated with measuring at in-situ conditions the sanding potential of an underground formation, according to some embodiments. In step <b>610</b> fluid is extracted from the reservoir formation (e.g., pumping out with a formation testing tool). In step <b>612</b>, the production of solid particles from the reservoir, including the amount of solid particle flow, particle size distribution, and particle shape are monitored (qualitatively &#x26; quantitatively). According to some embodiments, in step <b>614</b> the drawdown pressure is changed and steps <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> are repeated. In this way, the production of solid particles can be monitored at varying levels of pressure drawdown, so as to determine sanding potential as a function of drawdown. In step <b>616</b>, according to some embodiments, a stress test is conducted to measure in-situ stress conditions. For example, a dual-packer wireline tool such as shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used to inject fluid into the formation thereby initiating cracking of rock in the formation, while monitoring the injection rate and pressure. In step <b>618</b>, according to some embodiments, a core sample is captured that can be used for surface laboratory measurements. For example, a core sample can be obtained using a tool such as Schlumberger's Mechanical Sidewall Coring Tool (MSCT). The MSCT cuts cores from the borehole wall using a miniature synthetic diamond rotary coring bit. The rotary action of the coring bit does not impact the formation; therefore, petrophysical parameters are not altered and high quality cores are retrieved. In step <b>620</b>, according to some embodiments, a fluid sample is captured that can be analyzed at a surface laboratory for solids content, particle size distribution, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As is described in greater detail below, the described monitoring of the production of solid particles from the reservoir can be preformed using any one/combination of sensors, such as optical spectrometers, acoustic sensors, video cameras, and erosion probes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, according to some embodiments, a video camera is used downhole to gather particle information. For further details on the use of a video camera for the detection of fluid and sand entry, see Tague, J. R., and Hollman, G. F.: &#x201c;Downhole Video: A Cost/Benefit Analysis,&#x201d; paper SPE 62522 presented at the 2000 SPE/AAPG Western Regional Meeting, Long Beach, Calif., June 19-23, which is incorporated by reference herein. Further information can be obtained from Jones, C. M. and Elrod, L. W.: &#x201c;In Situ Optical Computation Fluid Analysis System and Method,&#x201d; United States patent application, US 2006/0142955 A1, published Jun. 29, 2006, incorporated by reference herein, which states that optics can be used to detect solid particles and solid types in crude petroleum; and from Drakeley, B. K., Johansen, E. S., Zisk, E. J., and Bostik, F. X. III: &#x201c;In-Well Optical Sensing-State-of-the-Art Applications and Future Direction for Increasing Value in Production-Optimization Systems,&#x201d; paper SPE 99696 presented at the 2006 SPE Intelligent Energy Conference and Exhibition, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, April 11-13, incorporated by reference herein, which suggests that based on optical flow meters the technology has the promise in detecting sand production.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to some further embodiments, an acoustic sensor can be used to gather particulate information in-situ. For example, see Stuivenwold, P. A., and Mast, H.: &#x201c;New Instrumentation for Managing Sand-Problem Prone Fields,&#x201d; paper SPE 9368 presented at the 1980 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Dallas, Tex., September 21-24, incorporated by reference herein, which discusses a detector based on a steel sensor that incorporate a piezo-electric transducer which was developed to monitor sand production at surface or downhole. The acoustic impact of a sand grain impinging on the sensor rod deforms the piezo crystal, which produces an electrical signal. For quantitative sand production data, the tool should be calibrated; grain size distribution affects the results. Impact energy is recorded; this provides an indication of grain size distribution because impact energy is a function of mass and velocity of the particles. Further, in designing a tool, it should be considered that this type of acoustic sensor is not particularly well suited to noisy environments, such as multiphase flow.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to some embodiments, acoustic measurements of scattering of acoustic energy is used to detect, determine, and otherwise quantify particle size of sand. For further details, see European Patent Specification EP 1021710, which is incorporated by reference herein, which discusses a method for measuring the agglomeration state of asphaltenes in oil. The method involves applying to the oil a signal of acoustic energy, which gets scattered by the asphaltenes; the scattered energy is detected at various frequencies. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,672,163, which is incorporated by reference herein, a method and apparatus are discussed that uses acoustic transducers to detect and identify gas bubbles, solid particles, and/or liquid droplets in fluids. According to some further embodiments, one or more erosion probes are used to monitor sand production. See, e.g. McPhee (2007).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, according to some embodiments, a core sample is taken downhole to aid in the sanding prediction estimation. Various rock mechanical testing methods can be used on reservoir core for sand production prediction, including unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing, confirmed strength testing (CST), and thick-walled cylinder (TWC) testing. See, FracTech Laboratories (http://www.fractech.co.uk/consortiaPEA135.html; accessed Nov. 18, 2007), which is incorporated by reference herein. In using these techniques, it should be noted that these testing methods can exhibit the following drawbacks: (1) UCS method: the core will exhibit a lower strength than it would in the reservoir and will be susceptible to failure along the bedding planes; (2) CST method: the test will produce a stress-strain curve from the reservoir core; however, it may not be clear at which point this curve will intersect with the onset of sanding; and (3) TWC method: the onset of sanding usually occurs when the sidewall fails; this produces over-conservative results and makes it necessary to apply a sanding factor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, according to some embodiments, a stress test can be executed to measure in-situ stress conditions. For further information, see Desroches, J., and Kurkjian, A. L.: &#x201c;Applications of Wireline Stress Measurements,&#x201d; <i>SPE Reservoir Evaluation </i>&#x26; <i>Engineering</i>, October 1999, Volume 2, Number 5, 451-461, incorporated by reference herein, which discusses applications of wireline stress measurements based on microhydraulic fracturing and packer fracturing techniques. Reliable measurements can be obtained of the minimum horizontal stress and the maximum horizontal stress in a near-vertical openhole well, and tests can be conducted in a eased-hole environment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to some embodiments, techniques for determining optimal or improved design of the completion, lift system, and surface facilities are provided. The techniques preferably make use of estimates of sanding potential that rely on in-situ particulate evaluations as described elsewhere herein. The predicted sanding information is used to model the expected performance of various completion/production systems. According to some embodiments, the predicted sanding information is also used to select appropriate hardware and operating conditions. Thus, a method for controlling sanding potential is provided which comprises measuring at in-situ conditions the sanding potential of an underground formation and then, acting to control sanding potential through installation of hardware and/or selection of operating conditions (flow rate, pressure, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When sand production is predicted or expected, according to embodiments, various methods can be used for its management and control. The use of screens and gravel packs at the sandface/wellbore interface can reduce or eliminate sand production. See, e.g. Oyeneyin (1995). For soft formations, frac-packing can be used to control sand influx to the wellbore. See, e.g. Blauch, M., Weaver, J., Parker, M., Todd, B., Glover, M.: &#x201c;New Insights Into Proppant-Pack Damage Due to Infiltration of Formation Fines,&#x201d; paper SPE 56833 presented at the 1999 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, Houston, Tex., October 3-6 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Blauch (1999)&#x201d;), which is incorporated by reference herein. However, in designing a completion it has to be considered that these methods can get plugged and/or damaged by sand and fine particles. In Blauch (1999) &#x201c;micro fines&#x201d; is defined as particle size of 1 to 20 micrometers, and &#x201c;macro fines&#x201d; as being larger than 20 micrometers. Solids migration can often be reduced by proper perforating (penetration; entrance hole, etc.). See, e.g. Oyeneyin (1995). In some cases it may be best to do sand control at the surface, and have no downhole restriction to sand production. See, e.g. Farrow (2004).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For further information on the optimal selection of a hydrocarbon well completion, see U.S. Pat. No. 7,181,380, which is incorporated by reference herein. Material modeling (using input of stress state information) can be used to predict rock failure, and the mechanism of failure; such models can be used for sand production prediction. There are various completion options based on the planned strategy to manage sand production.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to embodiments, further detail of the impact of sand production on artificial lift systems will now be provided. Very few wells will flow naturally throughout their entire life; as reservoir pressure declines, artificial lift is usually required to augment the energy of the reservoir. According to embodiments, the sanding potential based on particulate measurements at in-situ conditions is used to develop an effective artificial lift plan. The artificial lift plan, additionally is based on other technical as well as economic factors, and a thorough risk analysis. For further information, see Ramirez, M., Zdenkovic, N., and Medina, E.: &#x201c;Technical/Economic Evaluation of Artificial Lift Systems for Eight Offshore Reservoirs,&#x201d; paper SPE 59026 presented at the 2000 SPE International Petroleum Conference and Exhibition, Villahermosa, Mexico, February 1-3, which is incorporated by reference herein. Of all the artificial lift systems, only gas lift can handle a large volume of solids with only minor problems; this is because only gas lift does not require the sand-laden fluid to pass through the lifting mechanism. See, Brown, K.: &#x201c;Overview of Artificial Lift Systems,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Petroleum Technology</i>, October 1982, Volume 34, Number 10, 23842396, which is incorporated by reference herein. Downhole pumps, properly equipped, can handle sand; useful modifications include self-lubricating plungers, ring valves or &#x201c;sand valves&#x201d;, and two-stage hollow valve rod pumps. The severity of sand abrasion depends on a number of factors: quantity of sand, acid solubility, particle size distribution, quantity of quartz, and particle geometry (angularity). Hydraulic jet pumps are a solution for wells producing with a high percentage of sand where other means of sand control cannot be used. See, Hirschfeldt, M., Martinez, P., and Distel, F.: &#x201c;Artificial-Lift Systems Overview and Evolution in a Mature Basin: Case Study of Golfo San Jorge,&#x201d; paper SPE 108054 presented at the 2007 SPE Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Engineering Conference, Buenos Aires, Argentina, April 15-18, which is incorporated by reference herein. In deepwater Gulf of Mexico the artificial lift system choices are only gas lift and electric submersible pumps. See, Stair, C. D.: &#x201c;Artificial Lift Design for the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico,&#x201d; paper SPE 48933 presented at the 1998 SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition, New Orleans, La., September 27-30, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the measurements of particulate properties at in-situ conditions have so far been described in the context of using a wireline sampling tool such as Schlumberger's Modular Formation Dynamics Tester tool (MDT), the invention is not so limited. According to some embodiments other types of downhole tools are used to make the described particulate measurements at in-situ conditions. For example, according to some embodiments a drillstem testing (DST) platform is used to make the particulate measurements at in-situ conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows portions of a DST system that is used to make particulate measurements at in-situ conditions, according to some embodiments. DST is a method of gathering data on the potential productivity of a reservoir before a permanent completion string is installed. The equipment for a DST includes a string <b>712</b> (tubing or drillpipe), a retrievable packer <b>730</b> and a tester valve <b>722</b>, a reversing valve <b>720</b>, jars <b>726</b>, pressure and temperature gauge carrier <b>724</b>, and safety joint <b>728</b>. In operation the DST tool is deployed, via rig <b>708</b>, in a cased or openhole borehole <b>710</b> made within the earth <b>704</b>. In the case of a borehole that is cased, the lower section <b>706</b> of borehole <b>710</b> is perforated in the region of reservoir rock <b>702</b>. According to embodiments, the DST tool also includes a fluid analysis module <b>718</b> that contains equipment used to make particulate measurements at in-situ conditions. The module <b>718</b> can contain any of the equipment of fluid analysis module <b>180</b> as shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, including a downhole video camera, optical spectrometer, acoustic sensor, and erosion probe. The string <b>712</b> channels the flow from reservoir <b>702</b> and borehole section <b>706</b> to the surface. The packer <b>730</b> is a rubber element used to isolate the zone <b>702</b> to be tested. The tester valve <b>722</b> provides a method of controlling the well near the reservoir. For example, the amount by which the tester valve <b>722</b> is opened can be used to control the pressure drawdown (i.e., the flowing pressure at the wellbore is reduced by increasing the amount by which the tester valve <b>722</b> is opened.)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart showing decision logic for sandface completion, according to some embodiments. For further detail on decision logic schemes, see Addis (2008). In step <b>802</b>, various input data is provided, preferably including the following: (1) in-situ sanding evaluation data: quantity of &#x201c;sand&#x201d; (solid particles) production vs. pressure drawdown; distribution of sizes of the solid particles and shapes of the particles; (2) wellbore configuration (e.g., hole diameter, depth, deviation); (3) reservoir description (e.g., permeability, porosity, fluid type); and (4) expected range of operating conditions of the well (e.g., what flow rate is required for the well to be economic).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>804</b>, the expected performance (&#x201c;Inflow&#x201d;) is modeled for an openhole well completion (&#x201c;Barefoot&#x201d;). Then the question is asked&#x2014;do the model results show that the reservoir will produce sand at the expected operating conditions? In step <b>806</b>, if &#x201c;no,&#x201d; then a &#x201c;barefoot&#x201d; completion is chosen (it is typically the most productive and lowest cost) and no surface facilities will be required to handle sand production. In step <b>808</b>, if &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; the model results show the reservoir will produce sand. Next, the question is asked&#x2014;will the amount of produced sand exceed the capability of the current (or proposed) surface facilities, such as a sand separator or sand trap? In step <b>810</b>, if &#x201c;no,&#x201d; then the &#x201c;barefoot&#x201d; completion with current (or proposed) surface sand handling facilities is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>812</b>, if &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; then a &#x201c;barefoot&#x201d; completion cannot be used. Next, model the expected performance (&#x201c;Inflow&#x201d;) for a &#x201c;natural completion&#x201d; (i.e., the wellbore is cased, cemented, and then perforated). Then the question is asked&#x2014;do the model results show that the reservoir will produce sand at the expected operating conditions? In step <b>814</b>, if &#x201c;no&#x201d;, then a &#x201c;natural completion&#x201d; is chosen and no surface facilities will be required to handle sand production. In step <b>816</b>, if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, the model results show the reservoir will produce sand. Next, the question is asked&#x2014;will the amount of produced sand exceed the capability of the current (or proposed) surface facilities, such as a sand separator or sand trap? In step <b>818</b>, if &#x201c;no&#x201d;, then the &#x201c;natural completion&#x201d; with current (or proposed) surface sand handling facilities is selected. In step <b>820</b>, if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, then a &#x201c;natural completion&#x201d; cannot be used. Next, the expected performance is modeled for a Stand Alone Screen (SAS). Then the question is asked&#x2014;is the SAS feasible (i.e., reservoir will not produce sand, or if it does, surface facilities can handle the sand produced)? In step <b>822</b>, if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, the SAS is selected. In step <b>824</b>, if &#x201c;no&#x201d;, so a &#x201c;sand control completion&#x201d; must be selected. The choices include openhole gravel pack (OHGP), expandable sand screen (ESS), inside casing gravel pack (IGP) where no gravel is placed into the perforations, and fracture and pack with sand (F&#x26;P). Each method is modeled, and the one with optimum production (largest flow rate with least sand production) is selected.</p>
