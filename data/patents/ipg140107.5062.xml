<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mobile device and location registration method for registering location information of the device itself.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, such mobile devices as portable telephones that can conduct voice communications and packet communications are widely known. At predetermined cycle this mobile device can register the location of the device itself to a control server for packet communications (for example, a SGSN, specifically, a Serving GPRS Support Node), and in addition, can register the location of the device itself to a control server for voice communications (for example, a VLR/MSC, specifically, a Visitor Location Register/Mobile Switching Center).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the mobile device can register location information to the respective control servers at predetermined cycle in this way, the server side can ascertain where the mobile device is located, and can conduct call out processing to the mobile device. Further, the well-known technology according to Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2000-23232 is technology that can register location information. Disclosed in this patent literature is a location information notification method and device that can conduct highly precise and efficient control of the location of a mobile station with the minimum necessary communications for location registration even if the mobile station is moving at a slow velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this regard, the access restriction, which comprises outgoing call restriction and incoming call restriction, is executed in order to prevent network congestion. Concretely, system information, which is information for confirming the location of the mobile device, is delivered from the base station to the mobile device. This system information comprises information indicating that communications to an certain terminal have been restricted, and the mobile device that has received this system information can determine whether or not the device itself is the target of the access restriction. This access restriction may be either the restriction of packet communications, the restriction of voice communications, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, the location is registered with the control server for packet communications and control server for voice communications at every predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) based on the mobile device registering the location with the control server for packet communications every predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) timed by a timer, and then the location is registered with the control server for voice communications from the control server for packet communications (the so-called combined update).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, this kind of combined update cannot be conducted when the control server for packet communications is under access restriction. For this reason, in current systems, if the control server for packet communications is under access restriction, the mobile device is configured to switch the interval of the timer, and to register the location at least with the control server for voice communications (including the control server for packet communications if the access restriction of the control server for packet communications has been released) every predetermined time (for example, 180 minutes, which is set to be longer than the aforementioned 54 minutes). By registering the location with the control server for voice communications in this way, at least the control server for voice communications can conduct call out processing for executing voice communications.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to this configuration, if the control server for packet communications is under access restriction, the control server for packet communications can ascertain the location of the mobile device after 180 minutes have elapsed. Namely, the location of the mobile device cannot be ascertained for a long period of time. For this reason, the problem arises that, for example, call out processing cannot be executed in relation to the mobile device because the location has not been registered even though the control server for packet communications has released access restriction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, in order to resolve the problem described above, the present invention has an object of providing a mobile device and location registration method that, even when packet communications are being restricted and the location cannot be registered, the location can be registered rapidly when the access restriction is released.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to resolve the problem described above, the mobile device of the present invention is a mobile device that registers location to a control server for packet communications that memorizes location information of a communication terminal for executing packet communications, and to a control server for voice communications that memorizes location information of a communication terminal for executing voice communications, comprising: timing unit for packet communications that times a predetermined time; location registration unit that registers location to the aforementioned control server for packet communications; timing control unit that, if the aforementioned control server for packet communications has restricted communications, controls timing operations of the timing unit for packet communications to temporarily stop when the aforementioned timing unit for packet communications times the predetermined time; and location registration control unit that controls the aforementioned location registration unit to register the location to the aforementioned control server for packet communications for each time when aforementioned timing unit for packet communications times, and also controls the aforementioned location registration unit to register the location to he aforementioned control server for packet communications if the aforementioned control server for packet communications is released the access restriction and if the timing operations of the aforementioned timing unit for packet communications are stopped by the aforementioned timing control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the location registration method of the present invention is a location registration method that registers location to control server for packet communications that memorizes location information of a communications terminal for executing packet communications and to a control server for voice communications that memorizes location information of a communications terminal for executing voice communications, the method comprising: a packet communications timing step for timing for a predetermined time; a location registering step for registering a location to the aforementioned control server for packet communications; a timing control step for, if the aforementioned control server for packet communications has restricted communications, controlling timing operations to temporarily stop when the predetermined time is timed in the aforementioned packet communications timing step; and a location registration control step for controlling the location to be registered to the aforementioned control server for packet communications in the aforementioned location registering step for each time timed in the aforementioned packet communications timing step, and also controls the location to be registered to the aforementioned control server for packet communications in the aforementioned location registering step if the access restriction is released by the aforementioned control server for packet communications, and if the timing operations of the aforementioned packet communications timing step are stopped by the aforementioned timing controlling step.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the mobile device or location registration method of the present invention, at every predetermined time the location is first registered with the control server for packet communications, and if packet communications have been restricted, control is executed such that the predetermined time is not repeated, and once the predetermined time has been timed, the timing operations are temporarily stopped. Then, control can be executed to register the location with the control server for packet communications if the restriction of packet communications is released and if the timing operations have been stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is thereby possible to prevent the control server for packet communications from being unable to ascertain the location of the mobile device, and mistakenly determining that the mobile device is not present in the control area of the control server for packet communications. Consequently, when the access restriction has been released, the control server for packet communications can immediately execute location registration and correctly ascertain the presence of the mobile device. As a result, call out processing to the applicable mobile device can be reliably executed, and the mobile device can reliably receive incoming calls.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, preferably the mobile device further comprises a voice communications timing unit that begins timing operations when the location registration with the control server for voice communications has been completed; and when the set time has been timed by the voice communications timing unit, said location registration control unit controls the location registration unit to register the location with the control server for voice communications.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Timing operations for registering the location with the control server for voice communications are thereby executed with the location registration with the control server for voice communications has been completed.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention can be easily understood by considering the following detailed description while referring to the added diagrams that are indicated for one embodiment. Next, an optimal embodiment of the present invention will be explained while referring to the added diagrams. When possible, the same codes will be added to the same parts, and redundant description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A mobile device that is an embodiment of the present invention will be explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram schematically indicating the relationship between a mobile device <b>1</b>, a control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, and a control server for voice communications of the present embodiment 3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a configurational diagram of the functions of the mobile device <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a configurational diagram of the hardware of the mobile device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mobile device <b>1</b> is a communications terminal such as a portable telephone that registers the location thereof with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. When executing communications such as voice communications and packet communications with another mobile device (not indicated in the diagram), the mobile device <b>1</b> needs to register the location of the device itself to the respective control servers. As long as the mobile device <b>1</b> is a communications terminal that conducts this kind of location registration, the device is not particularly limited, and may be a PDA, personal computer or the like. In the explanation given here, the mobile device <b>1</b> is a portable telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, mediating between the mobile device <b>1</b> and the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> or the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> is a wireless control apparatus <b>19</b> (for example, an RNC, specifically, a Radio Network Controller) that controls the mobile device <b>1</b> and the communications network NW that relays communications, namely, voice communications, packet communications, and location registration communications, that are executed between the mobile device <b>1</b> and these control servers. The wireless control apparatus <b>19</b> controls the mobile device <b>1</b> through a base station in the control area.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is a server (for example, a SGSN) that memorizes the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> (communications terminal) for packet communications use. Specifically, the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is a server (PS domain server) that receives location registration executed from the mobile device <b>1</b> through the communications network NW, and memorizes the location information of this mobile device <b>1</b> for packet communications use. This location information passes through route R<b>1</b> or route R<b>2</b> (the conditions for selecting the respective route R<b>1</b> and route R<b>2</b> will be described later). Packet communications between the mobile device <b>1</b> and another mobile device becomes possible by memorizing the location information for packet communications use and then communicating. The control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is configured as a computer (or, a unit that integrates a computer) that physically comprises a computing apparatus such as a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a memory apparatus such as a memory, a storage apparatus such as a hard disk, commutations apparatus such as a modem or LAN card, input apparatuses such as a mouse and keyboard, a display apparatus such as a display, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The control server for voice communications <b>3</b> is a server (for example, VLR/MSC) that memorizes the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> (communications terminal) for use in voice communications. Specifically, the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> is a server (CS domain server) that receives location registration executed from the mobile device <b>1</b> through the communications network NW, and memorizes the location information of this mobile device <b>1</b> for packet communications use. This location registration may be indirectly executed from the mobile device <b>1</b> by passing through the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (route R<b>1</b>), or may be directly executed from the mobile device <b>1</b> without passing through the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (route R<b>3</b>) (the conditions for selecting the respective route R<b>1</b> and route R<b>3</b> will be described later). Voice communications between the mobile device <b>1</b> and another mobile device becomes possible by memorizing the location information for use in voice communications and then communicating. The control server for voice communications <b>3</b> has the same physical configuration as that of the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Continuing, the essential configurational elements of the mobile device <b>1</b> will be explained. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mobile device <b>1</b> functionally comprises: a receiver <b>11</b>, a timing control unit <b>12</b> (timing control means), a packet timing unit <b>13</b> (timing means for packet communications), a voice timing unit <b>14</b> (voice communications timing means), a location registration control unit <b>15</b> (location registration control means), and a location registration unit <b>16</b> (location registration means). Further, these respective functional configurational elements may be physically distributed, and the aggregate of these configurational elements may be taken as the mobile device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Moreover, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mobile device <b>1</b> is configured as a portable telephone comprising a computing apparatus CPU <b>101</b> (Central Processing Unit), memory apparatuses RAM <b>102</b> and ROM <b>103</b>, a manipulation unit <b>104</b> comprising 10-key buttons and the like, a wireless communications module <b>105</b> capable of communications with a base station, and a display <b>106</b> that displays the status of the device itself to the user of the mobile device <b>1</b>. The various functions of the timing control unit <b>12</b>, the packet timing unit <b>13</b>, the voice timing unit <b>14</b>, and the location registration control unit <b>15</b> explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are realized by reading specified computer software on the hardware of the CPU <b>101</b>, RAM <b>102</b>, ROM <b>103</b> and the like indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by the operations of the wireless communications module <b>105</b> and the display <b>106</b> controlled by the CPU <b>101</b> based on the manipulation unit <b>104</b>, and by reading and writing data in the RAM <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The various functional elements will be explained below in detail using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The receiver <b>11</b> is a unit that receives through a base station (not indicated in the diagram) various types of information comprising system information and the like from servers such as the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. system information comprises location confirmation information for confirming the location of the mobile device <b>1</b>, communications restriction information indicating that communications with an optional mobile device have been restricted (including outgoing call restriction and incoming call restriction), and time information indicating the time cycle of location registration with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. The system information is sent to the mobile device <b>1</b> every predetermined time (for example, several seconds to several minutes). By receiving this system information the mobile device <b>1</b> can determine whether or the device itself is the target of the access restriction. Further, this access restriction may be restriction of packet communications, restriction of voice communications, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The timing control unit <b>12</b> is a part that controls the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> to temporarily stop after the packet timing unit <b>13</b> has timed (if measuring) the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) if the receiver <b>11</b> has received system information indicating that the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has restricted packet communications (specifically, if the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has restricted packet communications comprising an incoming call). The packet timing unit <b>13</b> is a unit that times the predetermined time as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The packet timing unit <b>13</b> is a timer that repeatedly times the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes). As will be described later, while the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is not under access restriction, this time stipulates the cycle at which the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> for packet communications use.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The voice timing unit <b>14</b> is a timer that begins execution of timing operations for processing location registration with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, and begins the timing operations when the location registration processing for the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> has been completed. The length of time that the voice timing unit <b>14</b> times may be set longer than the time of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> (for example, 54 minutes), and is, for example, 180 minutes. This length of time, as will be described later, is the time during which the automatic communication of the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> for use in voice communications <b>3</b> is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The location registration control unit <b>15</b> is a part that controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> for each time (for example, 54 minutes) that the packet timing unit <b>13</b> times. The location registration unit <b>16</b>, as will be described later, is a part that registers the location with the aforementioned two control servers. Moreover, the location registration control unit <b>15</b> controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> if the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has released the access restriction and if the timing control unit <b>12</b> has stopped the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b>. When this location registration is executed, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> restarts the timing operation. Further, the location registration control unit <b>15</b> controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> when the set time (for example, 180 minutes) has been timed by the voice timing unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The location registration unit <b>16</b> is a part that registers the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. If the system information indicates that communications is not being restricted by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, the location registration unit <b>16</b> registers the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (including combined update procedure) at the predetermined times (for example, every 54 minutes). Moreover, if the voice timing unit <b>14</b> has timed the set time (for example, 180 minutes), the location is registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Continuing, the timing of the timing operations and location registration, which changes corresponding to when both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> are under access restriction, will be explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram schematically indicating the timing of the timing operations and of the location registration that changes corresponding to one example of being when communications are being restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> comprises the four parts <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>. Moreover, each of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref> comprises the following 3 parts. Specifically, each comprises: a part that indicates when both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> are under access restriction; a part that indicates timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> (white arrow) and the timing of the registration of location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>; and a part that indicates timing operations of the voice timing unit <b>14</b> (black arrow) and the timing of the registration of location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. Each of the aforementioned two control servers is circled when communications are not being restricted and it is possible to communicate, and is marked with an &#x201c;X&#x201d; when communications are being restricted and it is not possible to communicate. Moreover, location registration timing is indicated by Q<b>1</b> to Q<b>5</b>. Further, the horizontal axis in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> indicates the time axis (time), and in addition to the passage of time from T<b>1</b> to T<b>8</b>, indicates the orderly transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">First, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, in both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, if communications are not being restricted and communication is possible, after location registration with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has been executed from the mobile device <b>1</b>, location registration with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> is executed from the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (route R<b>1</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This is the type of location registration called &#x201c;combined update&#x201d;, and is executed cyclically. In this way, while communications are not being restricted by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> for packet communications use every predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) (T<b>1</b>). Moreover, after this location registration, the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> automatically registers to the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> for use in voice communications (Q<b>1</b>). In addition, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> restarts the timing operations when this location registration is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, when communications is being restricted by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (T<b>2</b>), this kind of access restriction is recognized in the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. At this time, the timing control unit <b>12</b> controls the packet timing unit <b>13</b> to temporarily stop timing operations after the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) has been timed (T<b>3</b>). Following this control, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> temporarily stops timing operations. Moreover, at this time (T<b>3</b>) when the mobile device <b>1</b> has been notified that the location cannot be registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, control is begun to register the location at least with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, which is not under access restriction. If the location is successfully registered with the control server for voice communications and the mobile device <b>1</b> receives a response to this location registration, the voice timing unit <b>14</b> begins to execute timing operations following the time information (for example, 180 minutes) indicated by the system information.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, when the access restriction is released by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, and when the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> is under access restriction (T<b>4</b>), this kind of access restriction is recognized in the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. Here, the mobile device <b>1</b> determines whether or not the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has releases the access restriction, and whether or not the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> have been temporarily stopped. If the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is under access restriction, or if the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> are advancing, the mobile device <b>1</b> waits until new system information is received. On the other hand, if the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has released the access restriction, and if the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> have been temporarily stopped, the location registration control unit <b>15</b> controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>. For this reason, the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (Q<b>3</b>, route R<b>2</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Moreover, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> restarts the timing operations when this location registration is executed. Then, when the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) has elapsed using the packet timing unit <b>13</b> (T<b>5</b>), the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (Q<b>4</b>, route R<b>2</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Moreover, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> restarts the timing operations when this location registration is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, if the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is under access restriction, and if the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> has released the access restriction (T<b>6</b>), this kind of access restriction is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. At this time, no location registration can be executed because the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> and the voice timing unit <b>14</b> have not been completed. Later, when the voice timing unit <b>14</b> has timed the set time (for example, 180 minutes) (T<b>7</b>), the location registration control unit <b>15</b> controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. For this reason, the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> for use in voice communications (Q<b>5</b>, route R<b>3</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). When receiving a response that this communication is completed, the voice timing unit <b>14</b> times the predetermined time again.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, when the voice timing unit <b>14</b> has timed the set time (for example, 180 minutes), if the access restriction has also been released by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, this kind of access restriction is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. Then, the location is registered with the control server for packet communications, and the location is next registered with the control server for voice communications from the control server for packet communications (the so-called combined update).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, subsequently, the timing control unit <b>12</b> controls the packet timing unit <b>13</b> to temporarily stop timing operations after the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) has been timed (T<b>8</b>). Following this control, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> temporarily stops timing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Described next is the transition from when the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is under access restriction and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> has released the access restriction as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> to when both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> have released the access restriction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram schematically indicating the timing of the timing operations and of the location registration that changes corresponding to one example of being when communications are being restricted. The difference from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the situation when both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> have released the access restriction as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, when the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has released the access restriction, and when the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> as released the access restriction (T<b>6</b>), this kind of release state is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. At this time, no location registration can be executed because the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> and the voice timing unit <b>14</b> have not been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, after the voice timing unit <b>14</b> has timed the predetermined time (T<b>7</b>), when the access restriction has been released by both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. At this time, the location is registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> from the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (the so-called combined update) (Q<b>5</b>, route R<b>1</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Moreover, the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> and the voice timing unit <b>14</b> are reset in conjunction with this operation. Then, only the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> are started again.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, after the packet timing unit <b>13</b> has timed the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) (T<b>8</b>), the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>. At this time, the location is registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> from the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (the so-called combined update) (Q<b>7</b>, route R<b>1</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Then, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> begins executing timing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, when the restriction of packet communications is released, and when the control server <b>3</b> for voice communications has been released and the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> have been stopped (T<b>9</b>), in conjunction with control to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, control can be executed for the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> to register the location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (combined update) (Q<b>8</b>). When the mobile device <b>1</b> receives responses to these location registrations, the timing operations of the voice timing unit <b>14</b> are ended.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, when the packet timing unit <b>13</b> times the predetermined time (T<b>10</b>), in conjunction with control to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, control can be executed for the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> to register the location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (combined update) (Q<b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Continuing, the respective operation of the mobile device <b>1</b>, control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, and control server for voice communications <b>3</b> will be explained using the sequence diagram indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sequence diagram indicating the operations of registering the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> in the example of when communications are being restricted as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">First, if communications are not being restricted and communication is possible for both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, the mobile device <b>1</b> executes location registration processing (S<b>10</b>), and the location is registered from the mobile device <b>1</b> to the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (S<b>11</b>, location registration step). In addition, when executing this location registration processing, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> (called the PS timer hereinafter) begins timing operations (S<b>10</b>, packet communications timing step). When this location registration processing has been completed (S<b>10</b> to <b>11</b>), the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> is registered from the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> to the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (S<b>12</b>, location registration step).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, when the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> executes access restriction (S<b>20</b>), this kind of access restriction is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. At this time, after the PS timer has timed the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes), the timing control unit <b>12</b> controls the timing operations to be temporarily stopped (timing control step). Following this control, the timing operations of the PS timer are temporarily stopped (S<b>30</b>). Moreover, at the same time, in conjunction with automatically registering the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> for use in voice communications, (S<b>30</b> to S<b>31</b>, location registration step), the voice timing unit <b>14</b> (called the CS timer hereinafter) begins executing timing operations (S<b>30</b>, timing for voice communications step).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In more detail, at S<b>30</b>, after the access restriction performed by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has been notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information, the PS timer times the predetermined time, and the operations thereof expire. Here, the location cannot be registered with both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (combined update). Then, the location is registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>, which is not restricting, and the voice timing unit <b>14</b> begins to execute timing operations for the predetermined time (for example, 180 minutes) at the point when the mobile device <b>1</b> has received a response indicating that the location registration with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Next, when the access restriction has been released by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (S<b>40</b>), and when the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> is under access restriction (S<b>41</b>), this kind of access restriction is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. Here, the mobile device <b>1</b> determines whether or not the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has released the access restriction, and whether or not the timing operations of the PS timer have been temporarily stopped (S<b>42</b>). If the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is under access restriction, or if the timing operations of the PS timer are advancing, the mobile device <b>1</b> waits until new system information is received.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the other hand, the location registration control unit <b>15</b> controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> if the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> has released the access restriction and if the timing operations of the PS timer have temporarily stopped. For this reason, the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (S<b>43</b> to S<b>44</b>, location registration step).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, when this location registration is executed and the completion response thereof has been received, the PS timer restarts the timing operations (S<b>43</b>, packet communications timing step). Then, when the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) has elapsed on the PS timer (S<b>50</b>), the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (S<b>50</b> to S<b>51</b>, location registration step). In addition, when this location registration is executed and the completion response thereof has been received, the PS timer restarts the timing operations (S<b>50</b>, packet communications timing step).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, if the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is under access restriction (S<b>60</b>) and if the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> has released the access restriction (S<b>61</b>), this kind of access restriction is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. At this time, no location registration can be executed because the timing operations of the PS timer and the CS timer have not been completed. Subsequently, when the CS timer has timed the set time (for example, 180 minutes) (S<b>70</b>), the location registration control unit <b>15</b> controls the location registration unit <b>16</b> to register the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (S<b>70</b>). For this reason, the location information of the mobile device <b>1</b> is automatically registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> for use in voice communications (S<b>70</b> to S<b>71</b>, location registration step).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, after the PS timer has timed the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) (S<b>80</b>), the timing control unit <b>12</b> controls the timing operations to be temporarily stopped (timing control step). Following this control, the timing operations of the PS timer are temporarily stopped (S<b>80</b>). Here, because the timing of the PS timer has expired, the location registration with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is suspended, and the location cannot be registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the operations after <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> when the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> release the access restriction will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sequence diagram indicating the operations of registering the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> at that time.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> releases the access restriction (S<b>90</b>), this kind of release of access restriction is notified to the mobile device <b>1</b> by system information. Because restriction has been released by both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> and because the timing operations were temporarily stopped at S<b>80</b>, mobile device <b>1</b> determines that location registration can be processed (so-called combined update), and the mobile device <b>1</b> executes processing to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (S<b>91</b>, location registration step).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In conjunction with registering the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> (S<b>92</b>), the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> executes the so-called combined update by registering the location of the mobile device <b>1</b> with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b>(S<b>93</b>). Wen this location registration processing is executed, the packet timing unit <b>13</b> starts timing operations and the voice timing unit <b>14</b> stops operations (S<b>94</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Continuing, the action and effects of the present embodiment will be explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>. First, the location is registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> every predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) (Q<b>1</b>), and if packet communications are restricted (T<b>2</b>), control is executed such that the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) is not repeated, and once the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) has been timed, the timing operations are temporarily stopped (T<b>3</b>). Then, control can be executed such that, if the restriction of packet communications has been released (T<b>4</b>), and if registration has been executed with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> and the timing operations have been stopped (T<b>4</b>), the location is registered with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (Q<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Moreover, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, if the restriction of packet communications has been released, and if restriction has been released by the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> and the timing operations of the packet timing unit <b>13</b> have been stopped (T<b>9</b>), in conjunction with control to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, control can be executed for the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> to register the location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (combined update) (Q<b>8</b>). In addition, when the packet timing unit <b>13</b> times the predetermined time (T<b>10</b>), in the same way, in conjunction with control to register the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b>, control can be executed for the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> to register the location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (combined update) (Q<b>9</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is thereby possible to prevent the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> from being unable to ascertain the location of the mobile device <b>1</b>, and mistakenly determining that the mobile device <b>1</b> is not present in the control area of the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> for a long period of time (a maximum of 180 minutes in the example above). Consequently, when the access restriction has been released (T<b>4</b>), the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> can immediately execute location registration (Q<b>3</b>) and correctly ascertain the presence of the mobile device <b>1</b>. As a result, call out processing to the applicable mobile device <b>1</b> can be reliably executed, and the mobile device <b>1</b> can reliably receive incoming calls.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Moreover, when timing operations for registering the location with the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> have stopped (T<b>3</b>), the mobile device <b>1</b> registers the location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (Q<b>2</b>), and after a completion response has been received, in conjunction with executing timing operations for registering location by starting the operations of the voice timing unit <b>14</b> (T<b>3</b>), the time stipulated for voice communications set by the system information (for example, 180 minutes) is timed. Then, when the set time (for example, 180 minutes) has been timed (T<b>7</b>), the location can be registered with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (Q<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For this reason, it is possible to prevent the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> from being unable to ascertain the location of the mobile device <b>1</b>, and mistakenly determining that the mobile device <b>1</b> is not present in the control area of the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> for a long period of time (a maximum of 180 minutes in the example above). Consequently, because the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> can correctly ascertain the presence of the mobile device <b>1</b>, call out processing of voice communications to the applicable mobile device <b>1</b> can be reliably executed, and the mobile device <b>1</b> can reliably receive incoming calls. As a result, the location can be registered either by the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> when the predetermined time (for example, 54 minutes) has elapsed, or by the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> when the predetermined time (for example, 180 minutes) has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Moreover, when packet communications have been restricted (T<b>2</b>), in conjunction with temporarily stopping the timing operations (T<b>3</b>), location registration is also stopped, and therefore, it possible to control as much as possible unnecessary location registration request messages (specifically, information requesting location registration) from the mobile device <b>1</b> during the access restriction (specifically, during convergence). Further, there is no unnecessary exchange of information between the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> when packet communications have been restricted (T<b>2</b>), and communications can be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, if both the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> and the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> have released restriction, when the predetermined time has been timed by the voice timing unit <b>14</b> (T<b>7</b>), in conjunction with registering the location with control server for packet communications <b>2</b> (Q<b>5</b>), the control server for packet communications <b>2</b> is directed to register the location with the control server for voice communications <b>3</b> (combined update).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present invention has been concretely described above based on an embodiment, but the present invention is not limited by the aforementioned embodiment, and may have a variety of variations. Further, the aforementioned embodiment and the follow variations do not limit the scope of the present invention, and a person skilled in the art may develop these embodiments and variations without deviating from the thrust of the claims of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the mobile device <b>1</b> may comprise a registration communications unit, which combines the function of the receiver <b>11</b> and the function of the location registration unit <b>16</b>, and which substitutes for the receiver <b>11</b> and the location registration unit <b>16</b>.</p>
