<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/CN2010/070709, filed on Feb. 23, 2010, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 200910119111.3, filed on Mar. 3, 2009, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of communications technologies, and in particular, to a technology for a relay node (RN) to access a network.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the process of broadband and mobilization development of a network, the 3rd Generation Partnership Program (3GPP) organization proposes a Long Term Evolution (LTE) solution, that is, Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) Territorial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) in a mobile access network and a System Architecture Evolution (SAE) solution, that is, Evolved Packet Core (EPC), in a mobile core network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The E-UTRAN adopts a single layer structure including only an evolved base station (Node B, eNB), so as to simplify the network and reduce network delay. The structure actually approaches a typical Internet Protocol (IP) broadband network structure. A traditional cellular network is a star topology network centering on a base station and adopts centralized control, so a User Equipment (UE) directly access the network through the eNB in the current LTE protocol.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for an RN to access a network, an RN, and a device for an RN to access the network, so that when the RN needs to access the network, the RN can access the network through an eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for an RN to access a network.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A method and a device for an RN to access a network according to embodiments of the present invention are described in detail in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the embodiments of the present invention, an RN waiting for access may access the network through an eNB directly, or access the network through multiple RNs and then through an eNB. A situation that a UE is directly connected to a base station is called a single-hop, and a link between the UE and the base station is called a direct connection. A situation that the UE is connected to the base station through one RN is called a double-hop. A situation that the UE is connected to the base station through multiple (for example, three) RNs is called a multi-hop.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An LTE is taken as an example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is a simple schematic diagram of network architecture of an LTE according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, an LTE communication system <b>10</b> may include a relay layer <b>11</b>, a transport layer <b>12</b> and an access gateway (AGW) <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The relay layer <b>11</b> may include one or more RNs <b>110</b> coupled through air interfaces. Similarly, the transport layer <b>12</b> may include one or more base stations <b>120</b> coupled with each other through optical fibers. Moreover, the base stations <b>120</b> may be connected to the AGWs <b>14</b> through optical fibers. In another embodiment of the present invention, the base station <b>120</b> and the AGW <b>14</b> may communicated with each other in an optical, electrical, or wireless manner. Multiple signals may be transmitted in the transport layer <b>12</b> through an optical path, and transmitted through the base station <b>120</b> to the AGW <b>14</b>, the RN <b>110</b> or other base stations, or transmitted to a UE <b>100</b>A, a UE <b>100</b>B, or a UE <b>100</b>C through the air interface. The multiple signals may be transmitted in the transport layer <b>11</b> through the air interface, and transmitted through the RN <b>110</b> to the base station <b>120</b>, the UE <b>100</b>A, the UE <b>100</b>B, or the UE <b>100</b>C, or other RNs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The UE <b>100</b>A, the UE <b>100</b>B, and the UE <b>100</b>C may access the network through the base station <b>120</b> or first through the RN <b>110</b> and then through the base station <b>120</b>. For example, the UE <b>100</b>A, the UE <b>100</b>B, and the UE <b>100</b>C may access the network through the same base station or RN or through different base stations or RNs.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The AGW <b>14</b> may be connected to a core network through optical fibers, and the core network may also connect to other networks, such as a Public Data Network (PDN), a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and an Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, at least some RNs, for example, the RNs located in an edge of the relay layer <b>11</b>, may be used to transmit data to other base stations or other RNs, where the data is applied to the relay layer <b>11</b>. Similarly, at least some base stations, for example, the base stations located in an edge of the transport layer <b>12</b>, may be used to transmit data to other base stations or other RNs, where the data is applied to the transport layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The LTE communication system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>only displays four RNs <b>110</b>, two base stations <b>120</b>, and one AGW <b>14</b>. The LTE communication system <b>10</b> may include any number of RNs <b>110</b>, base stations <b>120</b>, and AGWs <b>14</b>. Moreover, when multiple base stations <b>120</b> correspond to multiple RNs <b>110</b> in a one-to-one manner, the multiple base stations <b>120</b> may be connected to one RN <b>110</b>, or the multiple RNs <b>110</b> may be connected to one base station <b>120</b>. Similarly, the LTE communication system <b>10</b> may include multiple AGWs <b>14</b>, and the base station <b>120</b> may be connected to one or more AGWs <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another embodiment of the present invention, the UE <b>100</b>A and the UE <b>100</b>B may communicate with the RN <b>110</b> through a u<sub>u </sub>interface, and the UE <b>100</b>C may directly communicate with the base station <b>120</b> through a u<sub>n </sub>interface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, a situation that the UE <b>100</b>C is directly connected to the base station <b>120</b> is called a single-hop, and a link between the UE <b>100</b>C and the base station <b>120</b> is called a direct connection. A situation that the UE <b>100</b>A is connected to the base station <b>120</b> through one RN is called a double-hop. A situation that the UE <b>100</b>B is connected to the base station <b>120</b> through multiple (for example, three) RNs is called a multi-hop.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The RN <b>110</b> may communicate with the base station <b>120</b> through the u<sub>n </sub>interface. The u<sub>u </sub>interface and the u<sub>n </sub>interface both are the air interfaces. The base station <b>120</b> may communicate with the AGW <b>14</b> through an S<b>1</b> interface. For example, the base station <b>120</b> and the AGW <b>14</b> may be connected through optical fibers or in other manners. Definitely, these devices may also communicate with each other through other interfaces or user-defined interfaces, and the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the multi-hop exits, the RNs are connected with each other through u<sub>n </sub>interfaces or other interfaces.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A base layer transmission between the base stations <b>120</b> is IP transmission, and the base stations <b>120</b> are connected with each other through an X<b>2</b> interface or other interface (for example, an S<b>1</b> interface).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows a method for an RN to access a network according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method may be described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><b>101</b>: A base station receives a network access message including information for identifying the RN.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, in this embodiment, the network access message including the information for identifying the RN may be a random access request message dedicated to the RN or an initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message carrying RN identifier (ID) information.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, in an initial network access process of the RN, an eNB distinguishes the RN from a UE in two manners, and either manner may be selected to implement the distinguishing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(1) RN adopts a random access preamble dedicated to the RN, where the preamble is distinguished from that of the UE. For example, the preamble is divided into two subsets, one subset is assigned to the UE, and the other is assigned to the RN.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Therefore, the network access information is the random access request message.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(2) The information for identifying the RN is included in the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message, where the information for identifying the RN is an RN ID. For example, an optional tag bit may be added to identify that it is an RN rather than a UE to access the network initially.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><b>102</b>: Enable, according to the information for identifying the RN, an RN waiting for access to access the network.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the method and the device for the RN to access the network provided by the embodiments of the present invention, the RN accesses the network through the information for identifying the RN, where the information is included in the network access message. The base station performs information interaction with a core network entity and the RN through the received network access message, where the message includes the information for identifying the RN, so that when the RN needs to access the network, the RN can directly access the network through the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows another method for an RN to access a network according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method may be described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><b>201</b>: Receive a network access message sent by an RN waiting for access, where the message includes information for identifying the RN.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><b>202</b>: Sent the network access message, which includes the information for identifying the RN, to a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To illustrate the present invention more clearly, the method for the RN to access the network, which is provided by the present invention, is described in the following through a specific access process.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a method for an RN to access a network according to an embodiment of the present invention. A process that one RN directly accesses the network through an eNB is taken as an example in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The detailed implementation process that the RN directly accesses the network through the eNB is described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><b>301</b>: When the RN needs to access the network, the RN and the eNB complete downlink synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><b>302</b>: The RN sends a random access request message including a preamble to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, if a preamble dedicated to the RN is assigned to the RN, the preamble is used. If a preamble dedicated to the RN is not assigned to the RN, the RN selects a group in preamble subsets, which is dedicated to the RN, in an internal cell, and then the RN sends the selected preamble to the eNB on a Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) according to a PRACH location read from an eNB system broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><b>303</b>: After receiving the preamble from the RN, the eNB sends a random access response message to the RN as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the random access response message includes uplink grant (UL Grant), indication of an initial signaling bearer establishment request message, uplink timing advance (TA), and a Temporary Cell-Radio Network Temporary Identifier (TC-RNTI) assigned to the RN.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><b>304</b>: The RN sends an initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message to the eNB on UL grant resources indicated in the random access response message.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the RN monitors a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) within a window time to obtain downlink assignment (DL assignment) indication. The RN receives the random access response message on a physical downlink share channel (PDSCH) according to the DL assignment indication. After the RN receives the random access response message, the RN and the eNB are synchronized on an uplink. The initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message carries a TC-RNTI assigned by the eNB for the RN and a user ID of a non-access stratum (NAS).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, if the random access request message does not carry the preamble dedicated to the RN, the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message may carry an RN ID bit, where the RN ID bit may be used for the eNB to distinguish whether the RN or the UE accesses the network initially.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><b>305</b>: After receiving the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message from the RN, the eNB may establish a temporary routing table entry for the RN by using the TC-RNTI of the RN carried in the message and send an initial signaling bearer connection establishment message to the RN as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><b>306</b>: After receiving the initial signaling bearer connection establishment message correctly, the RN upgrades the TC-RNTI to a Cell Radio Network Temporary ID (C-RNTI).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the RN sends an initial signaling bearer connection establishment completion message to the eNB as a response. The initial signaling bearer connection establishment completion message carries a message provided for a core network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, the core network entity may be a mobile management entity (MME) or other entities capable of completing information configuration at a network side.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><b>307</b>: After receiving the initial signaling bearer connection establishment completion message, the eNB updates the routing table entry of the RN correspondingly.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this embodiment, the eNB also forwards an NAS message provided by the RN for the core network entity to the core network entity to trigger the RN to perform context interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><b>308</b>: Security authentication is performed between the RN and the core network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><b>309</b>: After the security authentication is completed, the core network entity sends an RN context establishment message to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><b>310</b>: After receiving an RN context, the eNB stores a security context related to the RN, starts a security configuration process, and sends a security mode command to the RN.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><b>311</b>: After receiving the security mode command, the RN performs acknowledgment (Ack) and sends a security mode completion Ack to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><b>312</b>: After receiving the security mode completion Ack of the RN, the eNB sends a context establishment completion message to the core network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><b>313</b>: The core network entity configures RN attributes through the eNB according to capability reported by the RN. The process for configuring the RN attributes is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><b>314</b>: The eNB sends an initial data bearer connection establishment command to the RN to establish an initial data bearer.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><b>315</b>: The RN sends an initial data bearer connection establishment completion message to the eNB as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to the embodiment of the present invention, in the method for the RN to access the network, the RN accesses the network through the information for identifying the RN, where the information is carried in the network access message. The base station performs information interaction with the core network entity and the RN through the received network access message carrying the RN ID, so that when the RN needs to access the network, the RN can directly access the network through the base station, and at the same time, the information interaction can be performed between the RN waiting for access and the core network entity to complete an RN capability reporting and configuration process.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a process of configuring RN attributes in a method for an RN to access a network according to an embodiment of the present invention. The detailed process of configuring the RN attributes is described as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><b>401</b>: The RN reports hardware and air interface capability information of the RN to an eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><b>402</b>: The eNB forwards the hardware and air interface capability information reported by the RN to a core network entity.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><b>403</b>: The core network entity makes a configuration decision according to the capability information of the RN and an actual network situation.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><b>404</b>: The core network entity delivers an RN configuration message carrying the configuration decision made for the RN to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><b>405</b>: The eNB forwards the RN configuration message delivered by the core network entity to the RN for configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><b>406</b>: The RN completes attribute configuration according to the received RN configuration message and sends a configuration completion Ack to the eNB as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><b>407</b>: The eNB sends an RN attribute configuration completion message to the core network entity as a response, so that an RN capability reporting process and a configuration process are completed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a method for an RN to access a network according to an embodiment of the present invention. A process for at least two RNs to access the network in a distributed access manner is taken as an example in the following:</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><b>501</b>: When an RN waiting for access needs to access the network, the RN waiting for access and an upper-level RN complete downlink synchronization.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><b>502</b>: The RN waiting for access sends a random access request message including a preamble to the upper-level RN.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this embodiment, a detailed implementation process for the RN to send the random access request message to an eNB is described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The RN waiting for access selects a preamble. If a preamble dedicated to the RN is assigned to the RN waiting for access, the preamble is used. If a preamble dedicated to the RN is not assigned to the RN waiting for access, the RN waiting for access selects a group in preamble subsets, which is dedicated to the RN, in an internal cell, and then the RN waiting for access sends the selected preamble to the upper-level RN on a PRACH according to a PRACH location read from an eNB system broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><b>503</b>: After receiving the random access request message from the RN waiting for access, the upper-level RN of the RN waiting for access sends an Uplink Source Require (UL SR) message of a relay link to a further upper-level RN.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, the UL SR message of the relay link is forwarded through RNs at many levels until the message reaches the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><b>504</b>: After receiving the random access request message from the RN waiting for access, the RN sends a random access response message to the RN waiting for access.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, the RN waiting for access monitors a PDCCH channel within a window time of one or more TTIs to obtain DL assignment indication. The RN waiting for access receives the random access response message on a PDSCH according to the DL assignment indication. After the RN waiting for access receives the random access response message, the RN waiting for access and the upper-level RN are synchronized on an uplink. The random access response message includes UL grant, indication of sending an RRC connection establishment request message, TA, and a TC-RNTI.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><b>505</b>: After receiving the UL SR message of the relay link from the RN, the eNB feeds back the UL grant for transmitting a next initial signaling bearer connection establishment request signaling to a lower-level RN of the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">For example, the RNs at each level forward the UL grant until the message is sent to the upper-level RN of the RN waiting for access.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><b>506</b>: The RN waiting for access sends an initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message to the upper-level RN of the RN waiting for access according to the UL grant carried in the random access response message received in <b>504</b>, and the message is forwarded through the RNs at many levels until the message is sent to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message carries the TC-RNTI assigned by the eNB for the RN waiting for access and carries a user ID of an NAS. Each time the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message passes through one RN, the RN establishes a routing table entry for the RN waiting for access until the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message is sent to the eNB. In addition to the TC-RNTI assigned by the RN to the RN waiting for access and the user ID of an NAS layer in the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message sent by the RN waiting for access, the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message also carries an initial signaling bearer connection establishment reason entry and relevant information of the RNs that the message passes through.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For example, if the random access request message in <b>502</b> does not include the preamble dedicated to the RN, the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message may carry an RN ID bit, where the RN ID bit may be used for the eNB to distinguish whether the RN or the UE accesses the network initially.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><b>507</b>: After receiving the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message from the RN waiting for access, the upper-level RN of the RN waiting for access continues to forward the message to an upper-level RN and sends an initial signaling bearer connection establishment message to the RN waiting for access as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, after receiving the initial signaling bearer connection establishment request message sent by the lower-level RN of the eNB, the eNB may establish a routing table entry for the RN waiting for access by using the TC-RNTI of the RN waiting for access carried in the message and the relevant information of the RNs that the message passes through, and send the initial signaling bearer connection establishment message to the lower-level RN as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, the eNB may also send the initial signaling bearer connection establishment message to the lower-level RN as the response before the upper-level RN of the RN waiting for access sends the initial signaling bearer connection establishment message to the RN waiting for access as the response, and the sending sequence is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><b>508</b>: After receiving the initial signaling bearer connection establishment message correctly, the RN waiting for access sends an initial signaling bearer connection establishment completion message to the upper-level RN as a response.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, the RN waiting for access upgrades the TC-RNTI to a C-RNTI, that is, the RN waiting for access determines the TC-RNTI as the C-RNTI, and the upper-level RN cannot assign the TC-RNTI to other RN waiting for access.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For <b>509</b>-<b>517</b>, reference may be made to <b>307</b>-<b>315</b>, and the details will not be described herein again.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the embodiment of the present invention, in the method for the RN to access the network, the RN accesses the network through the RN ID carried in the network access message. The base station performs information interaction with the core network entity and the RN through the received network access message carrying the RN ID, so that when the RN needs to access the network, the RN can directly access the network through the base station, and at the same time, the information interaction can be performed between the RN waiting for access and the core network entity to complete an RN capability reporting and configuration process.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a method for an RN to access a network according to an embodiment of the present invention. A process for at least two RNs to access the network in a centralized access manner is taken as an example in the following:</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><b>606</b>: After receiving the random access request of the RN waiting for access, the upper-level RN of the RN waiting for access sends an RN network access request message to the eNB.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><b>607</b>: After receiving the RN network access request message, the eNB delivers an RN network access request Ack message.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this embodiment, the RN network access request Ack message is used for the eNB to establish a temporary routing table for the RN waiting for access on a relay link according to RN routing information included in the received RN network access request message.</p>
