<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment, there is provided a label issuing device including imaging means, image output means for outputting images captured by the imaging means, object recognition means for recognizing a specific object by reading a feature amount of the output images, information reading means for reading information for the recognized object from a file storing information related to the object, and label issuing means for printing the read information for the object on a label and issuing the label.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Hereinafter, a label issuing device and a label issuing method according to the embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings by exemplifying a label printer. The label issuing device according to the embodiment is applied to a label printer issuing a label on which product information such as a product name or a price of a product is printed, in a supermarket or a food processing plant.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an exterior of a label printer <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment. The label printer <b>1</b> prints information related to a product on a label and issues the printed label. A display such as a display device <b>3</b> is provided at an upper part of a main body <b>2</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>. The display device <b>3</b> displays a label registration screen for editing product information printed on a label. In addition, a touch panel <b>4</b> is provided on a surface of the display device <b>3</b>. A keyboard <b>5</b> is provided at an upper surface of the main body <b>2</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>. In addition, a weighing scale <b>8</b> which places a product thereon and weighs the product is provided at a front lower part of the main body <b>2</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>.</p>

Although details are described later, using the threshold value of &#x201c;similarity: 0.XX&#x201d;, it is possible to determine that, if a product is a fruit or a fresh vegetable, and the freshness thereof is lowered and is thus discolored, the product is different from a normal state product through the comparison with a product image of the product which is stored in the PLU file F<b>1</b> in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> again, the CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b> is connected to a communication interface <b>25</b> for executing data communication with the store computer SC via the input and output circuits (not shown). The store computer SC is installed at the backyard of the store or the like.

Operations of the imaging portion <b>104</b> and the sound output portion <b>105</b> are controlled by the CPU <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The imaging portion <b>104</b> is a color CCD image sensor, a color CMOS image sensor, or the like, and is imaging means for performing imaging from the reading window <b>9</b> under the control of the CPU <b>101</b>. For example, the imaging portion <b>104</b> captures moving images at 30 fps. Frame images which are sequentially captured by the imaging portion <b>104</b> at a predetermined frame rate are preserved in the RAM <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sound output portion <b>105</b> includes a sound circuit, a speaker, and the like for generating a warning sound or the like set in advance.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, functional portions of the CPU <b>101</b> and the CPU <b>61</b> realized by the CPU <b>101</b> and the CPU <b>61</b> sequentially executing programs will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a functional configuration of the CPU <b>101</b> and the CPU <b>61</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the CPU <b>101</b> sequentially executes the programs and thereby functions as a captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b>, a product detection portion <b>1012</b>, and an image output portion <b>1013</b> which is image output means. In a similar manner, the CPU <b>61</b> functions as an object recognition portion <b>611</b> which is object recognition means, a product display portion <b>612</b> which is notification means, a similarity determination portion <b>613</b> which is similarity determination means, a defective product notification portion <b>614</b> which is defective notification means, an information reading portion <b>615</b> which is information reading means, and a label issuing portion <b>616</b> which is label issuing means.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b> outputs an imaging start signal to the imaging portion <b>104</b> such that the imaging portion <b>104</b> starts an imaging operation. The captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b> sequentially incorporates frame images which are captured by the imaging portion <b>104</b> and are preserved in the RAM <b>103</b> after the start of the imaging operation. The incorporation of the frame images by the captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b> is performed in an order to be preserved in the RAM <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The product detection portion <b>1012</b> detects the overall product or a part thereof included in the frame images incorporated by the captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b> using a pattern matching technique or the like. Specifically, the product detection portion <b>1012</b> extracts an outline or the like from a binarized image of the incorporated frame image. Next, the product detection portion <b>1012</b> compares an outline from the previous frame image with an outline from this frame image, and detects a changed part, that is, a ghost image of a product facing the reading window <b>9</b> for registration for sales. In addition, as other methods of detecting a product, whether or not there is a skin color region is detected from read frame images. Then, if the skin color region is detected, that is, if a ghost image of a hand of the store clerk is detected, an outline of the product which is assumed to be grasped by the hand of the store clerk is tried to be extracted by performing the above-described outline detection. At this time, if an outline indicating a shape of the hand and other outlines are detected, a ghost image of the product is detected from a state where the store clerk grasps the product with the hand.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The image output portion <b>1013</b> outputs the frame images incorporated by the captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b> to the CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>. The image output portion <b>1013</b> may sequentially output the frame images incorporated by the captured image incorporation portion <b>1011</b> to the CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>; however, in the embodiment, it is assumed that frame images where the overall product or a part thereof is detected by the product detection portion <b>1012</b> are output to the CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>. As such, by outputting the frame images where the overall product or a part thereof is detected by the product detection portion <b>1012</b> to the CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b>, it is possible to prevent the CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b> from performing the object recognition by referring to the PLU file F<b>1</b> using frame images which do not include any or a part of the product. Since the recognition process of a specific object takes processing time, it is possible to reduce the processing time by preventing frame images which have no probability of recognizing a specific object and do not include any or a part of the product, from being processed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The object recognition portion <b>611</b> refers to product images of the PLU file F<b>1</b>, and recognizes a product as a specific object by reading a surface state such as a tone or an unevenness situation of the surface as a feature amount from images of the overall product or a part thereof captured by the imaging portion <b>104</b> of the product reading portion <b>10</b>. In addition, it is assumed that the object recognition portion <b>611</b> does not take into consideration of an outline or a size of a product in order to reduce processing time. The CPU <b>61</b> of the label printer <b>1</b> can specify a product read by the product reading portion <b>10</b> among products set in the PLU file F<b>1</b> in advance, based on a result recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The similarity determination portion <b>613</b> calculates similarity of the product recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b>, and determines whether or not the similarity exceeds a threshold value which is set in the PLU file F<b>1</b> in advance.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the product A casts a glare on the reading region R in the course of the movement of the product A, the overall product A or a part thereof is detected from frame images obtained by capturing the reading region R in ACT <b>3</b>. In ACT <b>4</b>, the frame images obtained by capturing the reading region R are output to the CPU <b>61</b> due to the detection of the overall product A or a part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the CPU <b>61</b> receives the frame images where the overall product A or a part thereof is detected, output from the product reading portion <b>10</b> (ACT <b>11</b>) Thereafter, the object recognition portion <b>611</b> refers to a product image of the FLU file F<b>1</b>, and recognizes the product A as a specific object from the image of the overall product A or a part thereof, output from the product reading portion <b>10</b> (ACT <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the similarity determination portion <b>613</b> calculates similarity of the product A recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b> (ACT <b>13</b>).

Through the screen display, since the kind of fish can be grasped without having professional knowledge, for example, if fish fillets are packed in the backyard, it is possible to assist in determining the kind of fish fillets or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thereafter, the CPU <b>61</b> determines whether or not the work is completed due to an operation instruction of the keyboard <b>5</b> or the like (ACT <b>16</b>).

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">On the other hand, if the similarity determination portion <b>613</b> determines that the similarity calculated in ACT <b>13</b> does not exceed the threshold value (&#x201c;similarity: 0.XX&#x201d;) set in advance (ACT <b>14</b>: No), the defective product notification portion <b>614</b> notifies a store clerk that the product is not recognized as a normal product (ACT <b>17</b>), and demands the store side to take measures such as sales stop. Specifically, the defective product notification portion <b>614</b> notifies the store clerk of errors through screen display on the display device <b>3</b>, an output of a warning sound from the sound output portion <b>105</b>, or the like.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if the product A recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b> is a &#x201c;banana&#x201d;, and the threshold value is stored in the PLU file F<b>1</b> as &#x201c;similarity: 0.50&#x201d;, since the similarity of a product shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is 0.717, it is determined that the calculated similarity exceeds the preset threshold value. On the other hand, the similarity of a product shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is 0.252, and thus it is determined that the calculated similarity does not exceed the preset threshold value. Therefore, the product shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is registered for sales as a &#x201c;banana&#x201d; as usual. On the other hand, the product shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is temporarily recognized as a &#x201c;banana&#x201d;, but is not registered for sales due to a defective product which is old and discolored, damaged, and deformed, that is, of which a tone or an unevenness situation of a surface is not normal. In a similar manner, for ready-made foods, a product image based on a normal baked state or fried state is stored in the PLU file F<b>1</b>, and if insufficient or excessive baking, insufficient or excessive frying, or the like is deviated from a threshold value, the ready-made food may be determined as being a defective product.</p>

Thereafter, the object recognition portion <b>611</b> refers to a product image of the PLU file F<b>1</b>, and recognizes the product A as a specific object from the image of the overall product A or a part thereof, output from the product reading portion <b>10</b> (ACT <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, the similarity determination portion <b>613</b> calculates similarity of the product A recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b> (ACT <b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thereafter, the similarity determination portion <b>613</b> determines whether or not the similarity calculated in ACT <b>13</b> exceeds a threshold value (&#x201c;similarity: 0.XX&#x201d;) set in advance (ACT <b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the similarity determination portion <b>613</b> determines that the similarity calculated in ACT <b>13</b> exceeds the threshold value (&#x201c;similarity: 0.XX&#x201d;) set in advance (ACT <b>14</b>: Yes), in ACT <b>15</b>, the information reading portion <b>615</b> reads information (a product ID, a product classification, a product name, a unit price, and the like) related to the product image of the product A which is a specific object recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b>, and the product display portion <b>612</b> displays the information related to the product image of the product A on the display device <b>3</b> (ACT <b>15</b>). In addition, an operator places the product A on the weighing scale <b>8</b> until the information (the product ID, the product classification, the product name, the unit price, and the like) related to the product image of the product A is displayed on the display device <b>3</b> at latest.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the CPU <b>61</b> measures the product placed on the weighing scale <b>8</b> by weight (ACT <b>20</b>), generates printing data based on the read information (the product ID, the product classification, the product name, the unit price, and the like) and the measured weight, and prints and issues a label based on the generated printing data (ACT <b>21</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of an issued label L<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the product name, the unit price, the weight, the price according to the weight, and the like are printed on the label L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the other hand, if the similarity determination portion <b>613</b> determines that the similarity calculated in ACT <b>13</b> does not exceed the threshold value (&#x201c;similarity: 0.XX&#x201d;) set in advance (ACT <b>14</b>: No), the defective product notification portion <b>614</b> notifies a store clerk that the product is not recognized as a normal product (ACT <b>17</b>), and demands the store side to take measures such as sales stop or a price cut sale. Specifically, the defective product notification portion <b>614</b> notifies the store clerk of errors through screen display on the display device <b>3</b>, an output of a warning sound from the sound output portion <b>105</b>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the CPU <b>61</b> determines whether or not there is an instruction for the price cut sale through an operation instruction of the keyboard <b>5</b> (ACT <b>22</b>: Yes), the information reading portion <b>615</b> reads the information (the product ID, the product classification, the product name, the unit price, and the like) related to the product image of the product A which is a specific object recognized by the object recognition portion <b>611</b>. The product display portion <b>612</b> displays the information related to the product image of the product A on the display device <b>3</b> (ACT <b>23</b>) and fixes a price cut amount of the product A which is not recognized as the normal product (ACT <b>24</b>). In addition, a price cut rate or the price cut amount used when the product A which is not recognized as the normal product is sold by cutting down the price may be set in a stepwise manner. The price cut rate or the price cut amount may be set according to the similarity in a stepwise manner by correlating with, for example, a plurality of threshold values (similarity: 0.XX) stored in the PLU file F<b>1</b> in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the other hand, if it is determined that there is an instruction for sales stop through an operation instruction of the keyboard <b>5</b> (ACT <b>22</b>: No), the process returns to ACT <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thereafter, the CPU <b>61</b> measures the product placed on the weighing scale <b>8</b> by weight (ACT <b>20</b>). The label issuing portion <b>616</b> generates printing data based on the read information (the product ID, the product classification, the product name, the unit price, and the like), the price cut amount, and the measured weight, and prints and issues a label based on the generated printing data (ACT <b>21</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of an issued label L<b>2</b>. In the label L<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, since the product is not recognized as the normal product, the price cut amount ($2.00) and a price obtained by subtracting the price cut amount ($2.00) from a usual price are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition, the embodiment is not limited to the case of displaying the price obtained by subtracting the price cut amount from the usual price on the label as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, but, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a price cut label L<b>3</b> indicating the price cut amount ($2.00) may be printed and issued separately from the normal label L<b>1</b> (the same as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A novel effect and modified example can be easily derived by a person skilled in the art. Therefore, wider aspects of the exemplary embodiments are not limited to the specific details and representative embodiment which have been shown and described hitherto. Accordingly, the accompanying claims and their equivalents are intended to cover such forms or modifications as would fall within the scope and spirit of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, although it is determined whether or not there is an instruction for sales stop through an operation instruction of the keyboard <b>5</b> in ACT <b>22</b> in the embodiments, the embodiment is not limited thereto, but a price cut process and a label issuing process may be performed or stopped directly depending on an object recognition result. For example, if a product is not recognized as a normal product, a price cut amount is fixed and price cut information is printed on a label depending on the object recognition result even if there is no instruction for a price cut sale through the operation instruction of the keyboard <b>5</b> or the like (alternatively, the price cut process or the label issuing process is stopped depending on the object recognition result).</p>
