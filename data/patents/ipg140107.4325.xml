<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from European Patent Application No. 11157267.3 filed Mar. 8, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention concerns a striking mechanism unit for a timepiece repeater striking mechanism, said unit including a drive plate with a pipe pivotally mounted about a pivot axis, said drive plate carrying a click comprising a hook provided with a beak, which is returned towards said axis by a spring, said unit further including a detent ratchet pivoting about said axis and carrying a pin which is in abutment, through a hole in said drive plate, on said click against said spring to operate said hook when said detent ratchet pivots, and said beak of said hook, depending upon the position thereof, allowing or preventing the pivoting of a pipe ratchet comprised in a downstream stage, said pipe ratchet being mounted to pivot coaxially on said pipe and also to pivot integrally about said axis with a first hour ratchet.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also concerns a repeater striking mechanism including a striking mechanism unit of this type.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention also concerns a timepiece including at least one timepiece movement and at least one striking mechanism of this type.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention concerns the field of horology, and more specifically the field of timepieces including striking mechanisms, particularly repeaters.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Repeater strike mechanisms are exceptional timepieces, as regards their large number of components and the care and time required for fabrication and assembly operations. Striking mechanism complications have been known since at least the XVIII century, but have only been the subject of a limited number of publications between 1763 and the middle of the XX century. The reference work well known to the practitioner of complications, in particular grand strikes and repeaters, to which reference will be made to avoid overloading the explanation of the invention, is the work &#x201c;Les montres compliqu&#xe9;es&#x201d; (Complicated watches) by Francois Lecoultre and edited by Editions Horlog&#xe8;res in Bienne.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">EP Patent Application No. 1 429 214 A1 in the name of ROTH &#x26; GENTA HAUTE HORLOGERIE discloses a mechanism which prevents activation of the time setting mechanism while a striking mechanism is playing, with a means of locking the time-setting lever connecting said lever to a movable part of the striking mechanism, which can be moved between a rest position and an operating position. This locking means locks the lever as soon as the movable part is moved away from its rest position. This mechanism includes a pipe ratchet, an hour ratchet and a detent ratchet, in addition to a toothed sector, which is intended to mesh with the quarter-rack, arranged to pivot freely and can be driven by a finger. This sector and the rack pinion are released after the striking mechanism has been started.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">CH Patent Application No. 689 337 A5 in the name of PATEK PHILIPPE SA discloses a chiming timepiece playing different tunes at each of the quarters, with four quarter-racks and four quarter-cams. The timepiece includes a pipe ratchet, an hour ratchet and a detent ratchet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP Patent Application No. 1 879 086 A1 in the name of SEIKO EPSON CORP discloses a striking watch with a drive ratchet, a detent ratchet and a single hour ratchet.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">EP Patent Application No. 1 770 453 A1 in the name of CHRISTOPHE CLARET presents a dual striking mechanism, for producing a choice of strikes corresponding to two time zones.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">CH Patent No. 633 376 D in the name of DUBOIS &#x26; DEPRAZ discloses a repeater watch wherein the mechanism is entirely carried by an independent frame fixed to the movement plate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention proposes to go beyond the state of the art by proposing a timepiece allowing varied strikes or sounds to be played according to different circumstances, for example which are different in the morning and afternoon, or night and day, or for first and second time zones.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention therefore concerns a striking mechanism unit for a timepiece repeater striking mechanism, said unit including a drive plate with a pipe pivotally mounted about a pivot axis, said drive plate carrying a click comprising a hook provided with a beak which is returned towards said axis by a spring, said unit further including a detent ratchet pivoting about said axis and carrying a pin which is in abutment, through a hole in said drive plate, on said click against said spring to operate said hook when said detent ratchet pivots, and said beak of said hook, depending on the position thereof, allowing or preventing the pivoting of a pipe ratchet, comprised in a downstream stage, said pipe ratchet being mounted to pivot coaxially on said pipe and also to pivot integrally about said axis with a first hour ratchet, characterized in that said pivoting downstream stage further includes at least a second hour ratchet pivoting about said axis, the toothing of said second hour ratchet being inclined in the same direction as the toothing of said first hour ratchet.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention further concerns a repeater striking mechanism, comprising a striking mechanism unit of this type, characterized in that it further includes, on the one hand a first lifting piece driving a first hammer cooperating with said first hour ratchet, and on the other hand, a second lifting piece driving a second hammer and distinct from said first lifting and drive piece and cooperating with said at least one second hour ratchet, and in that it includes a striking mechanism control mechanism controlling the pivoting of said striking mechanism unit by operating said hook.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention further concerns a timepiece including at least one timepiece movement and at least one striking mechanism of this type, wherein said timepiece movement controls said striking mechanism.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention concerns the field of horology, and more specifically the field of timepieces including repeater striking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the composition of a complicated timepiece <b>1000</b>, particularly a watch. This timepiece <b>1000</b> includes, in a conventional manner, a timepiece movement <b>200</b> controlling a repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b>. Said repeater striking mechanism includes a striking mechanism control mechanism interfaced with the timepiece movement <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> partially shows a repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b> according to the invention. The conventional components of a grand strike or repeater striking mechanism, in particular a minute repeater, are not all shown, since those skilled in the art may refer to the aforecited work &#x201c;Les montres compliqu&#xe9;es&#x201d; to find the usual combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the information gathering members of the striking mechanism: the hour snail <b>101</b>, quarter snail <b>102</b> and minute snail <b>103</b> with the surprise <b>103</b>A. A release lever <b>105</b> is shown with its spring <b>107</b> and with a click <b>109</b> intended to cooperate with a detent ratchet <b>9</b>, which will be presented hereinafter. The minute-rack <b>110</b> and quarter-rack <b>111</b> are visible, in addition to, for striking the hours, a first lifting piece <b>58</b> driving a first hammer <b>108</b> against a gong (not shown in the Figures), located underneath gong <b>117</b>, which is the only one shown to avoid overloading the Figure, and a second lifting piece <b>56</b> for driving a second hammer <b>106</b> which cooperates with said gong <b>117</b>. For striking the minutes a lifting piece <b>112</b> drives a small hammer <b>113</b>. A rack <b>115</b> for winding the striking mechanism is partially visible. It is intended to cooperate with a rack pinion <b>14</b> which will be presented hereinafter. A minute hook <b>116</b> is fixed to the quarter-rack <b>111</b> to limit the striking mechanism according the number of minutes and quarters to be struck, to prevent the mechanism from rotating idly between the quarters and minutes. The minute-rack <b>110</b> thus always stops in the same rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A striking mechanism <b>100</b> includes a drive means, which is preferably distinct from that of the actual timepiece movement <b>200</b>. This drive means is not described in detail here. It may take the form of a barrel, a spring or similar, in general powered by the action of the user on a rack push piece or similar. This drive means provides the energy necessary to operate the strike or strikes. It is represented here simply by a drive arbour <b>120</b> transmitting energy to the sound generating wheel sets of the striking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a conventional manner, this drive arbour <b>120</b> sets in motion a striking mechanism unit <b>2</b>. The present invention concerns more specifically a particular arrangement of this unit <b>2</b> which allows new functions to be created. More specifically, the invention concerns a downstream stage <b>1</b> of said unit <b>2</b>, which is the stage the furthest downstream from said striking mechanism unit <b>2</b>, i.e. the stage which communicates energy straight to one or more hammer lifting pieces <b>58</b>, <b>56</b> comprised in striking mechanism <b>100</b>, to actuate the strike of one or several hammers on gongs <b>117</b>, bells or similar.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and described here is of the conventional type. However, the invention can be adapted without difficulty to different compositions. In the usual manner, this unit <b>2</b> includes a drive plate <b>3</b> with a pipe <b>4</b> pivotally mounted about a pivot axis D.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This drive plate <b>3</b> carries a click <b>5</b>. Click <b>5</b> includes a hook <b>6</b> with a beak <b>6</b>A returned towards axis D by a spring <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Unit <b>2</b> includes a detent ratchet <b>9</b>, which is arranged to cooperate with a striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b>, in particular, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to be driven by click <b>109</b> of release lever <b>105</b>. This detent ratchet <b>9</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, carries a pin <b>8</b>, which can act, through a hole <b>3</b>A in drive plate <b>3</b>, on click <b>5</b>. This click <b>5</b> is thus mobile, preferably substantially radially, against spring <b>7</b>, i.e. towards the periphery of plate <b>3</b>, by the action of this pin <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, downstream stage <b>1</b> includes a pipe ratchet <b>11</b>, which is arranged to be pivotally mounted on pipe <b>4</b> of drive plate <b>3</b>, about axis D. This pipe ratchet <b>11</b> is devised to cooperate, via a toothing <b>12</b> comprised therein, with the beak <b>6</b>A of hook <b>6</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. Depending on its position, said beak <b>6</b>A allows or prevents the pivoting of pipe ratchet <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">This pipe ratchet <b>11</b> is mounted to pivot integrally about axis D with a first hour ratchet <b>13</b>, which is arranged to cooperate with a first lifting piece <b>58</b> for driving a hammer comprised in this type of repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The invention concerns more specifically a striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> for a timepiece repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b>, said unit <b>2</b> including a drive plate <b>3</b> with a pipe <b>4</b> pivotally mounted about a pivot axis D, said drive plate <b>3</b> carrying a click <b>5</b> including a hook <b>6</b> provided with a beak <b>6</b>A returned towards axis D by a spring <b>7</b>. This unit <b>2</b> further includes a detent ratchet <b>9</b> pivoting about axis D and carrying a pin <b>8</b>, which is in abutment, through a hole <b>3</b>A in drive plate <b>3</b>, on click <b>5</b> against spring <b>7</b> for operating hook <b>6</b> when detent ratchet <b>9</b> pivots. Depending on its position, said beak <b>6</b>A of hook <b>6</b> allows or prevents the pivoting of a pipe ratchet <b>11</b> comprised in a downstream stage <b>1</b>, said pipe ratchet <b>11</b> being mounted to pivot coaxially on pipe <b>4</b> and also to pivot integrally about axis D with a first hour ratchet <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the invention, this pivoting downstream stage <b>1</b> further includes at least a second hour ratchet <b>15</b>, pivoting about axis D, the toothing of the second hour ratchet <b>15</b> being inclined in the same direction as the toothing of the first hour ratchet <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the invention, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, downstream stage <b>1</b> further includes at least a second hour ratchet <b>15</b>, which is arranged to be pivotally movable about axis D and to cooperate with a hammer lifting and drive piece comprised in this type of repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b>. This hammer lifting and drive piece may be the same first lifting piece <b>58</b> but, preferably, it is a second hammer lifting and drive piece <b>56</b> belonging to the same striking mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The invention is described hereinafter for the preferred case of a single second hour ratchet. However, it is evident to those skilled in the art that if necessary the design can be extrapolated to a higher number of hour ratchets, to control actuation of different lifting pieces. Indeed, the principle of the invention, as it will be described hereinafter, is to allow distinct strikes or sounds to be produced according to different circumstances. The invention is described here for the case of a distinction between the morning and afternoon, or AM-PM, but may equally well be applied to other periods, which may or may not be of equal duration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, this at least one second hour ratchet <b>15</b> is mounted to pivot integrally about axis D with the first hour ratchet <b>13</b>. In a variant that is not described in detail here, the second ratchet <b>15</b> may have angular mobility to pivot about axis D relative to first ratchet <b>13</b>, by combining an oblong hole with a pin, or similar.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Preferably, and as is shown in the Figures, the first hour ratchet <b>13</b> includes a toothing <b>33</b> on at least a first angular sector centred on axis D. The second hour ratchet <b>15</b> also includes a toothing <b>35</b> on at least a second angular sector centred on axis D. Advantageously, at least one part of the first angular sector, or the second angular sector respectively, is distinct from the second angular sector or first angular sector respectively, so as to allow the first hour ratchet <b>13</b> and said at least one second hour ratchet <b>15</b> to cooperate with distinct lifting pieces, and, in the particular case illustrated by the Figures, so as to allow said at least one second hour ratchet <b>15</b> to cooperate with a second lifting and drive piece <b>56</b>, distinct from the first lifting and drive piece <b>58</b> with which the first hour ratchet <b>13</b> is arranged to cooperate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Preferably, toothing <b>33</b> extends over at least a first angular sector centred on axis D, with triangular teeth, one side of which is directed towards pivot axis D, at a first angular pitch P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Similarly, the toothing <b>35</b> preferably extends over at least a second angular sector centred on axis D, with triangular teeth one side of which is directed towards pivot axis D, at a second angular pitch P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferably, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to allow hammers <b>108</b> and <b>106</b> to be moved apart, in order to limit the thickness of timepiece <b>1000</b>, the corresponding lifting pieces <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are set apart. Thus, preferably, toothing <b>33</b> of first ratchet <b>13</b> and toothing <b>35</b> of second ratchet <b>15</b> are angularly shifted by an angle at centre relative to axis D which is the sum of, on the one hand the value of the angle at centre AC formed relative to pivot axis D by the pivot axes about which the first lifting and drive piece <b>58</b> and the second lifting and drive piece <b>56</b> pivot, and, on the other hand an angular shift DA of lower value than the smallest between first angular pitch P<b>1</b> and the second angular pitch P<b>2</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This value DA may be zero, but the acoustic effect is better with a value allowing transmission of a sequenced or modulated sound which is clearly audible, for example with a value DA corresponding to a time difference on the order of a millisecond.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a preferred configuration, seen in the Figures, the second angular pitch P<b>2</b> is equal to the first angular pitch P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Preferably, the downstream stage <b>1</b> further includes a rack pinion <b>14</b>, mounted to pivot integrally about axis D with the first hour ratchet <b>13</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and arranged to cooperate with rack <b>115</b> comprised in this type of repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The invention further concerns a striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> of this type for a repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b> including a drive plate <b>3</b> with a pipe <b>4</b> pivotally mounted about a pivot axis D, the drive plate <b>3</b> carrying a click <b>5</b> comprising a hook <b>6</b> with a beak <b>6</b>A returned towards axis D by a spring <b>7</b>, click <b>5</b> being mobile against spring <b>7</b> by the action of a pin <b>8</b> comprised in a detent ratchet <b>9</b> of unit <b>2</b> and which is arranged to cooperate with a striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b>. According to the invention, this unit <b>2</b> includes at least one downstream stage <b>1</b> as described hereinbefore.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Preferably, the pipe <b>16</b> of pipe ratchet <b>11</b> includes a cylindrical shoulder <b>17</b> arranged to receive a pivotally movable quarter-rack pinion <b>19</b>, which is comprised in unit <b>2</b> and seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This pinion <b>19</b> is arranged to cooperate with a quarter-rack <b>111</b> of a striking mechanism <b>100</b> of this type and carries a pin <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> thus includes a quarter-rack pinion <b>19</b> pivotally movable on a pipe <b>16</b> comprised in pipe ratchet <b>11</b>, said quarter-rack pinion <b>19</b> preferably carrying a pin <b>21</b>. This pipe <b>16</b> includes a means <b>18</b> of pivoting a finger <b>22</b> comprised in unit <b>2</b>, finger <b>22</b> being pivotally movable about axis D and including a bearing face <b>23</b> for cooperating with pin <b>21</b>, to pivot unit <b>2</b> when the quarter-rack pinion <b>19</b> pivots in a single direction of pivoting able to drive finger <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">This pipe <b>16</b> includes pivot drive means <b>18</b>, for example, in the form of a Kelly bushing or similar, for a finger <b>22</b> comprised in unit <b>2</b>. This finger <b>22</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, includes a bearing face <b>23</b>, which is arranged to cooperate with pin <b>21</b>, in order to drive pinion <b>19</b>. Finger <b>22</b> is integral with or fixed to downstream stage <b>1</b> via the Kelly bushing thereof, and it allows pinion <b>19</b> to stop in a position which is set only by a quarter-rack <b>111</b>. The angular shift between bearing face <b>23</b> and pin <b>8</b> thus increases according to the number of hours to be struck, before the striking mechanism starts.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The pipe <b>4</b> of drive plate <b>3</b> preferably includes pivot drive means for example in the form of a Kelly bushing or similar, arranged to cooperate with drive arbour <b>120</b> of repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Drive plate <b>3</b> includes a hole <b>3</b>A for the passage of pin <b>8</b> of detent ratchet <b>9</b> for operating hook <b>6</b>, by the action of a striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b> or a release lever <b>105</b> or a click <b>109</b> of a lever <b>105</b> of this type, comprised in a repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b> of this type.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 19</figref> illustrate the detailed assembly of the bottom sub-assembly of striking mechanism unit <b>2</b>, which is intended to carry downstream stage <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 18</figref> illustrate a particular variant, wherein detent ratchet <b>9</b> is juxtaposed with an independent wheel <b>118</b> used for other functions of striking mechanism <b>100</b>, each being able to act on hook <b>5</b> via a pin, but never at the same time. This particular variant also includes a drive plate <b>3</b> with a peripheral toothing <b>119</b> for other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The mechanism according to the invention can be used for a minute repeater, or for a grand strike, as shown in the Figures. In the particular case of a grand strike, timepiece movement <b>200</b> drives snails <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, which supply an exact time reference at any time. Whether it occurs automatically or manually, the release of the striking mechanism causes the action of first click <b>109</b> of release lever <b>105</b> on detent ratchet <b>9</b>, causing said ratchet to pivot. Consequently, the pin <b>8</b> carried by said ratchet <b>9</b> moves in hole <b>3</b>A in drive plate <b>3</b>, and pushes hook <b>6</b> thus releasing toothing <b>12</b> of pipe ratchet <b>11</b>, which, in the rest position of spring <b>7</b>, was meshed with beak <b>6</b>A of hook <b>6</b>. The downstream stage <b>1</b> can then pivot freely about axis D. By the action of springs which cooperate with quarter-rack <b>111</b> and minute-rack <b>110</b>, downstream stage <b>1</b> is pivoted by the action of rack pinion <b>14</b>, which is permanently driven by rack <b>115</b> until a rack arm stops on the hour snail <b>101</b>. The spring of quarter-rack <b>111</b> drives the quarter-rack pinion <b>19</b> until an arm of quarter-rack <b>111</b> is stopped on quarter snail <b>102</b>. The arm of minute-rack <b>110</b> is positioned on minute snail <b>103</b> in a conventional manner, via the movement of the quarter-rack <b>111</b>. When the striking mechanism is set in motion, pin <b>8</b> is released, and spring <b>7</b> couples downstream stage <b>1</b> again, via toothing <b>12</b> of pipe ratchet <b>11</b>, which is meshed on beak <b>6</b>A of hook <b>6</b>, which activates the various lifting pieces on the respective hammers.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The invention also concerns a repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b> including a striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> of this type. According to the invention, the repeater striking mechanism also includes, on the one hand, a first lifting piece <b>58</b> driving a first hammer <b>108</b> cooperating with the first hour ratchet <b>13</b>, and, on the other hand, a second lifting piece <b>56</b> driving a second hammer <b>106</b> distinct from the first lifting and drive piece <b>58</b> and cooperating with said at least one second hour ratchet <b>15</b>, and it comprises a striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b> which controls the pivoting of striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> by operating hook <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">This repeater striking mechanism <b>100</b> includes a drive arbour <b>120</b> pivotally mounted about a pivot axis D, and on which a striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> is fitted, for controlling a first lifting piece <b>58</b> and a second lifting piece <b>56</b> comprised in striking mechanism <b>100</b>, to actuate at least one hammer <b>108</b>. The striking mechanism <b>100</b> includes a main striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b> and/or a release lever <b>105</b>, and/or a click <b>109</b> of a said lever <b>105</b>, which is arranged to control the pivoting of striking mechanism unit <b>2</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b> includes a release lever <b>105</b> controlling the pivoting of striking mechanism unit <b>2</b>, either directly, or via a click <b>109</b> comprised in said lever <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Striking mechanism <b>100</b> includes at least a first hammer <b>108</b> arranged to be actuated by the first lifting piece <b>58</b> and preferably at least a second hammer <b>106</b> arranged to be actuated by the second lifting piece <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to an advantageous feature of the invention, the striking mechanism <b>100</b> includes a cam <b>51</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, and which is arranged to give the striking mechanism <b>100</b> information that differentiates between a first period and a second period, to operate, during the first period or second period respectively, only one of the first <b>13</b> or second <b>15</b> hour ratchets, and to operate, during the second period or first period respectively, either the other of the first <b>13</b> or second <b>15</b> hour ratchets, or both of the first <b>13</b> and second <b>15</b> hour ratchets at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, cam <b>51</b> pivoting about an axis D<b>1</b>, includes a first path <b>52</b> corresponding to the first period and a second path <b>53</b> corresponding to the second period, which are travelled in succession by a finger <b>54</b>A, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, comprised in a pivoting feeler spindle <b>54</b>. This feeler spindle <b>54</b> pivoting about an axis D<b>2</b>, preferably parallel to axis D<b>1</b>, which is preferably parallel to axis D, includes a beak <b>55</b>. This beak <b>55</b> is arranged to cooperate with a lifting piece beak <b>57</b> comprised in the second lifting piece <b>56</b> to hook the lifting piece beak <b>57</b> so as to lock said lifting piece, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, when finger <b>54</b>A travels the path corresponding to the first period, or second period respectively, and to allow the lifting piece beak <b>57</b> to pass and the second lifting piece <b>56</b> to pivot, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> when finger <b>54</b>A travels the path corresponding to the second period, or first period respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a particular application, the first period is the morning and the second period is the afternoon, or vice versa. Cam <b>51</b> is then a 24 hour cam, located underneath the striking mechanism, driven by the hour wheel in a gear ratio of 1/2. The cam completes one revolution in 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">This cam <b>51</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> with a spring <b>59</b> for ensuring hold while the finger <b>54</b>A of feeler spindle <b>54</b> rises from path <b>52</b> onto path <b>53</b>. Thus beak <b>55</b> of feeler spindle <b>54</b> is prevented from floating in relation to beak <b>57</b> of lifting piece <b>56</b> during this abrupt upward movement.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Cam <b>51</b> further includes a release finger <b>114</b> for a date mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The second lifting and drive piece <b>56</b> is arranged to drive the first hammer <b>108</b> and/or a second hammer <b>106</b>. Preferably, as illustrated in the Figures, it drives only second hammer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this preferred but non limiting application of striking mechanisms that differentiate between morning and afternoon, when finger <b>54</b>A reads the path corresponding to the morning, lifting piece <b>56</b> is locked, via the beak <b>57</b> thereof, by beak <b>55</b> of finger <b>55</b> of feeler spindle <b>54</b>. This lifting piece <b>56</b> cannot, therefore, tip in the morning, which prevents the second hammer <b>106</b> from operating in the morning. The striking mechanism is thus played, in a conventional manner, with a single hammer on a single gong or similar.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the afternoon, feeler spindle <b>54</b> releases, via beak <b>55</b>, beak <b>57</b> of lifting piece <b>56</b>, which can therefore pivot freely. When the striking mechanism control mechanism <b>10</b> acts on striking mechanism unit <b>2</b> and starts the pivoting of downstream stage <b>1</b>, ratchets <b>13</b> and <b>15</b> respectively actuate lifting pieces <b>58</b> and <b>56</b>, which starts the operation of hammers <b>108</b> and <b>106</b>. It would be possible for the lifting pieces to act on a single gong, but the resonance effects may prove acoustically unpleasant, and it is preferable, and more gratifying for the user, to strike separate gongs with the two hammers <b>108</b> and <b>106</b>. If the angular shift DA is zero, the strike is synchronous. If shift DA is not zero, a more pleasant effect is produced, in the form of a sound extended by modulation, like the overlapping notes of the baroque lute or harpsichord pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It will be noted that if, by design, the ratchet <b>13</b> and ratchet <b>15</b> are angularly mobile in unit <b>1</b>, and if a position locking means is provided, the watchmaker can adjust a particular shift DA as desired by the client.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Preferably, in striking mechanism <b>100</b>, the pivot axes about which the first lifting and drive piece <b>58</b> and second lifting and drive piece <b>56</b> pivot form an angle at centre AC relative to axis D, and the first hour ratchet <b>13</b> has a toothing <b>33</b> at a first angular pitch P<b>1</b> on at least a first angular sector centred on axis D, the second hour ratchet <b>15</b> includes a toothing <b>35</b> at a second angular pitch P<b>2</b> on at least a second angular sector centred on axis D, and toothing <b>33</b> and toothing <b>35</b> are angularly shifted by an angle at centre relative to axis D which is the sum of, on the one hand, the value of the angle at centre AC, and on the other hand, an angular shift DA of lower value than the smallest between first angular pitch P<b>1</b> and the angular pitch P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The invention further concerns a timepiece <b>1000</b> including at least one timepiece movement <b>200</b> and at least one striking mechanism <b>100</b>, the timepiece movement <b>200</b> being arranged to control the striking mechanism <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The invention allows distinct striking mechanisms/strikes to be created without any significant modification of the existing repeater striking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It is also possible to use a plurality of cams, or cams with a plurality of paths. In particular, by coupling a time zone push piece with the release of the striking mechanism on demand, it is possible to select a cam peculiar to the time zone concerned. By using hammers and gongs dedicated to the second time zone it is easy to distinguish which time is being displayed by the striking mechanism. This time zone application could evidently be coupled with the AM-PM application described here, or even with a day-night or other application, since there is no limit to the use of the invention. For example, the time of sunrise in the northern or southern hemisphere could be struck by creating a suitable application.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Returning to the example of the AM-PM application described here, in a variant of the invention, the cam can also be used to start the uncoupling of lifting piece <b>58</b>. In such case, the striking mechanism plays the morning on one gong and the afternoon on a different gong.</p>
