<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a porous electrically conductive fluid distribution plate, a method of making a porous electrically conductive fluid distribution plate, and systems using a porous electrically conductive fluid distribution plate according to the present invention. More specifically, the present invention is related to the use of a porous electrically conductive fluid distribution plate in addressing water transport difficulties in fuel cells and other types of devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fuel cells are being developed as a power source for many applications including vehicular applications. One such fuel cell is the proton exchange membrane or PEM fuel cell. PEM fuel cells are well known in the art and include in each cell thereof a membrane electrode assembly or MEA. The MEA is a thin, proton-conductive, polymeric, membrane-electrolyte having an anode electrode face formed on one side thereof and a cathode electrode face formed on the opposite side thereof. One example of a membrane-electrolyte is the type made from ion exchange resins. An exemplary ion exchange resin comprises a perfluoronated sulfonic acid polymer such as NAFION&#x2122; available from the E.I. DuPont de Nemeours &#x26; Co. The anode and cathode faces, on the other hand, typically comprise finely divided carbon particles, very finely divided catalytic particles supported on the internal and external surfaces of the carbon particles, and proton conductive particles such as NAFION&#x2122; intermingled with the catalytic and carbon particles; or catalytic particles, without carbon, dispersed throughout a polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) binder.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multi-cell PEM fuel cells comprise a plurality of the MEAs stacked together in electrical series and separated one from the next by a gas-impermeable, electrically-conductive fluid distribution plate known as a separator plate or a bipolar plate. Such multi-cell fuel cells are known as fuel cell stacks. The bipolar plate has two working faces, one confronting the anode of one cell and the other confronting the cathode on the next adjacent cell in the stack, and electrically conducts current between the adjacent cells. Electrically conductive fluid distribution plates at the ends of the stack contact only the end cells and are known as end plates. The bipolar plates contain a flow field that distributes the gaseous reactants (e.g. H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>/air) over the surfaces of the anode and the cathode. These flow fields generally include a plurality of lands which define therebetween a plurality of flow channels through which the gaseous reactants flow between a supply header and an exhaust header located at opposite ends of the flow channels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A highly porous (i.e. ca. 60% to 80%), electrically-conductive material (e.g. cloth, screen, paper, foam, etc.) known as &#x201c;diffusion media&#x201d; is generally interposed between electrically conductive fluid distribution plates and the MEA and serves (1) to distribute gaseous reactant over the entire face of the electrode, between and under the lands of the electrically conductive fluid distribution plate, and (2) collects current from the face of the electrode confronting a groove, and conveys it to the adjacent lands that define that groove. One known such diffusion media comprises a graphite paper having a porosity of about 70% by volume, an uncompressed thickness of about 0.17 mm, and is commercially available from the Toray Company under the name Toray 060. Such diffusion media can also comprise fine mesh, noble metal screen and the like as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an H<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O<sub>2</sub>/air PEM fuel cell environment, the electrically conductive fluid distribution plates can typically be in constant contact with mildly acidic solutions (pH 3-5) containing F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;&#x2212;</sup>, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;&#x2212;</sup>, and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, etc. Moreover, the cathode typically operates in a highly oxidizing environment, being polarized to a maximum of about +1 V (vs. the normal hydrogen electrode) while being exposed to pressurized air. Finally, the anode is typically constantly exposed to hydrogen. Hence, the electrically conductive fluid distribution plates should be resistant to a hostile environment in the fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of the more common types of suitable electrically conductive fluid distribution plates include those molded from polymer composite materials which typically comprise 50% to 90% by volume electrically-conductive filler (e.g. graphite particles or filaments) dispersed throughout a polymeric matrix (thermoplastic or thermoset). Recent efforts in the development of composite electrically conductive fluid plates have been directed to materials having adequate electrical and thermal conductivity. Material suppliers have developed high carbon loading composite plates comprising graphite powder in the range of 50% to 90% by volume in a polymer matrix to achieve the requisite conductivity targets. Plates of this type will typically be able to withstand the corrosive fuel cell environment and, for the most part, meet cost and conductivity targets. One such currently available bipolar plate is available as the BMC plate from Bulk Molding Compound, Inc. of West Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternatively, discrete conductive fibers have been used in composite plates in an attempt to reduce the carbon loading and to increase plate toughness. See copending U.S. Pat. No. 6,607,857 to Blunk, et. al., issued Aug. 19, 2003 which is assigned to the assignee of this invention, and is incorporated herein by reference. Fibrous materials are typically ten to one thousand times more conductive in the axial direction as compared to conductive powders. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,827,747 to Lisi, et. al., issued Dec. 7, 2004 which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another one of the more common types of suitable electrically conductive fluid distribution plates include those made of metal coated with polymer composite materials containing about 30% to about 40% by volume conductive particles. In this regard, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,376 to Fronk et al., issued Apr. 16, 2002, which (1) is assigned to the assignee of this invention, (2) is incorporated herein by reference, and (3) discloses electrically conductive fluid distribution plates made from metal sheets coated with a corrosion-resistant, electrically-conductive layer comprising a plurality of electrically conductive, corrosion-proof (i.e. oxidation-resistant and-acid resistant) filler particles dispersed throughout a matrix of an acid-resistant, water insoluble, oxidation-resistant polymer that binds the particles together and to the surface of the metal sheet. Fronk et al-type composite coatings will preferably have a resistivity no greater than about 50 ohm-cm and a thickness between about 5 microns and 75 microns depending on the composition, resistivity and integrity of the coating. The thinner coatings are preferred to achieve lower IR drop through the fuel cell stack.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As discussed above, a great percentage of the electrically conductive fluid distribution plates comprise either a conductive polymeric composite material or a metallic base layer coated with a conductive polymer composite material. While these types of plates currently have acceptable water management properties, there is a desire to provide an electrically conductive fluid distribution plate having increased water management properties.</p>

It is to be appreciated that while one particular fuel cell stack <b>15</b> design is described, the present invention may be applicable to any fuel cell stack designs where fluid distribution plates have utility.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a two fuel cell, fuel cell stack <b>15</b> having a pair of membrane-electrode-assemblies (MEAs) <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> separated from each other by an electrically conductive fluid distribution plate <b>30</b>. Plate <b>30</b> serves as a bi-polar plate having a plurality of fluid flow channels <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> for distributing fuel and oxidant gases to the MEAs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. By &#x201c;fluid flow channel&#x201d; we mean a path, region, area, or any domain on the plate that is used to transport fluid in, out, along, or through at least a portion of the plate. The MEAs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, and plate <b>30</b>, may be stacked together between clamping plates <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, and electrically conductive fluid distribution plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> serve as end plates having only one side containing channels <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>, respectively, for distributing fuel and oxidant gases to the MEAs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, as opposed to both sides of the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Nonconductive gaskets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b> may be provided to provide seals and electrical insulation between the several components of the fuel cell stack. Gas permeable carbon/graphite diffusion papers <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, and <b>66</b> can press up against the electrode faces of the MEAs <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Plates <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> can press up against the carbon/graphite papers <b>60</b> and <b>66</b> respectively, while the plate <b>30</b> can press up against the carbon/graphite paper <b>64</b> on the anode face of MEA <b>20</b>, and against carbon/graphite paper <b>60</b> on the cathode face of MEA <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment, an oxidizing fluid, such as O<sub>2</sub>, is supplied to the cathode side of the fuel cell stack from storage tank <b>70</b> via appropriate supply plumbing <b>86</b>. While the oxidizing fluid is being supplied to the cathode side, a reducing fluid, such as H<sub>2</sub>, is supplied to the anode side of the fuel cell from storage tank <b>72</b>, via appropriate supply plumbing <b>88</b>. Exhaust plumbing (not shown) for both the H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>/air sides of the MEAs will also be provided.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary electrically conductive fluid distribution plate <b>30</b> comprising a first sheet <b>102</b> and a second sheet <b>104</b>. First and second sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> comprise a plurality of fluid flow channels <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> on their exterior sides/surfaces through which the fuel cell's reactant gases flow typically in a tortuous path along one side of each plate. The interior sides of the first and second sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may include a second plurality fluid flow channels <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> through which coolant passes during the operation of the fuel cell. When the interior sides of first sheet <b>102</b> and second sheet <b>104</b> are placed together to form a plate body <b>120</b>, the fluid flow channels connect and form a series of channels for coolant to pass through the plate <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The plate body <b>120</b> may be formed from a single sheet, or plate, rather than the two separate sheets illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the plate body <b>120</b> is formed from a single plate, the channels may be formed on the exterior sides of the plate body <b>120</b> and through the middle of the plate body <b>120</b> such that the resulting plate body <b>120</b> is equivalent to the plate body <b>120</b> configured from two separate sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The plate body <b>120</b> may be formed from a metal, a metal alloy, or a composite material, and has to be conductive. In one embodiment, a passivating metal or a passivating alloy forms the plate body <b>120</b>. By &#x201c;passivating metal&#x201d; or &#x201c;passivating alloy&#x201d; we mean a metal or an alloy that forms an inactive passivating layer as a result of reaction with ambient substances such as air or water. For example, the passivating layer (not shown) may be a metal oxide. Metal oxides typically act as barriers to further oxidation by requiring oxygen to diffuse through the layer to reach the metal or alloy surface. Thus, the passivating layer can protect the integrity of the metal or metal alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Suitable metals, metal alloys, and composite materials should be characterized by sufficient durability and rigidity to function as a fluid distribution plate in a fuel cell. Additional design properties for consideration in selecting a material for the plate body include gas permeability, conductivity, density, thermal conductivity, corrosion resistance, pattern definition, thermal and pattern stability, machinability, cost and availability.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Available metals and alloys include aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, nickel based alloys, and combinations thereof. Composite materials may comprise graphite, graphite foil, graphite particles in a polymer matrix, carbon fiber paper and polymer laminates, polymer plates with metal cores, conductively coated polymer plates, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">First and second sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are typically between about 51 to about 510: (microns) thick. The sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be formed by machining, molding, cutting, carving, stamping, photo etching such as through a photolithographic mask, chemical etching or any other suitable design and manufacturing process. It is contemplated that the sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may comprise a laminate structure including a flat sheet and an additional sheet including a series of exterior fluid flow channels. An interior metal spacer sheet (not shown) may be positioned between the first and second sheets <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the schematically illustrated plate <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the substrate <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> forming the structural component of the body <b>120</b> comprises a corrosion-susceptible metal such as aluminum, titanium, stainless steel, and nickel based alloys. The working faces of the plate <b>30</b> are covered with a conductive polymeric composite coating <b>125</b>. In at least one embodiment, the polymeric conductive coating <b>125</b> comprises an electrically-conductive, oxidation resistant, and acid-resistant protective material having a resistivity less than about 50 ohm-cm<sup>2</sup>, and comprises a plurality of oxidation-resistant, acid-insoluble, conductive particles (i.e. less than about 50 microns) dispersed throughout an acid-resistant, oxidation-resistant polymer matrix. Any suitable conductive polymeric coating <b>125</b> may be employed. Suitable examples of such coatings and their manner of application can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,376.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In at least one embodiment, the conductive filler particles can be at least one of gold, platinum, graphite, carbon, palladium, niobium, rhodium, ruthenium, and the rare earth metals. In at least certain embodiments, the particles may comprise conductive carbon and graphite at a loading of 25% by weight. The polymer matrix may comprise any water-insoluble polymer that can be formed into a thin adherent film and that can withstand the hostile oxidative and acidic environment of the fuel cell. Hence, such polymers, as epoxies, polyamide-imides, polyether-imides, polyphenols, fluro-elastomers (e.g., polyvinylidene flouride), polyesters, phenoxy-phenolics, epoxide-phenolics, acrylics, and urethanes, inter alia are seen to be useful with the composite coating. Cross-linked polymers may be employed for producing impermeable coatings, with polyamide-imide thermosetting polymers being most preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In at least one embodiment, the polymer composite layer <b>125</b> may be applied by dissolving polyamide-imide in a solvent comprising a mixture of N-methylpyrrolidone, propylene glycol and methyl ether acetate, and 21% to 23% by weight of a mixture of graphite and carbon black particles added thereto. In at least one embodiment, the graphite particles may range in size from 5 microns to 20 microns and the carbon black particles may range in size from 0.5 micron to 1.5 microns. In at least one embodiment, the mix may be sprayed on to the substrate, dried (i.e. solvent vaporized), and cured to provide 10 to 30 micron thick coating having a carbon-graphite content of 38% by weight. It may be cured slowly at low temperatures (i.e. &#x3c;400&#xb0; F.), or more quickly in a two step process wherein the solvent is first removed by heating for ten minutes at about 300&#xb0; F. to 350&#xb0; F. (i.e., dried) followed by higher temperature heating (500&#xb0; F. to 750&#xb0; F.) for various times ranging from about &#xbd; min to about 15 min (depending on the temperature used) to cure the polymer. As described hereinafter, the porous surface layer <b>130</b> of the invention is applied before drying and curing while the composite layer <b>125</b> is still tacky.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The conductive polymer coating <b>125</b> may be applied directly to the substrate metal and allowed to dry/cure thereon, or the substrate metal (e.g., Al) may first be covered with an oxidizable metal (e.g., stainless steel) before the electrically conductive polymer composite layer <b>125</b> is applied (see Li et al. supra). The composite layer <b>125</b> may be applied in a variety of ways, e.g., brushing, spraying, spreading, or laminating a preformed film onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electrically conductive fluid distribution plate <b>30</b> includes a porous conductive coating <b>130</b> adhered to and covering polymeric conductive coating <b>125</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electrically conductive fluid distribution plate <b>30</b> of the present invention can be made by providing the porous conductive layer <b>130</b> of the plate <b>30</b> having at least one of the porosity ranges discussed above. The average porosity of the surface of a conventional plate is typically below 5% and has a water contact angle of above 80&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The manner in which the desired level of porosity of the porous conductive layer <b>130</b> is achieved is not necessarily important. The porous conductive layer <b>130</b> can be provided in any suitable manner, such as chemically or mechanically. One exemplary manner is to provide a wet layer of polymeric conductive coating of the same or similar composition as used to form conductive polymeric composite coating <b>125</b> over conductive polymeric composite coating <b>125</b>. The wet polymeric conductive layer can be provided in any suitable manner such as by spraying. Prior to the wet polymeric conductive layer fully drying, a suitable pore producing agent can be embedded within the wet polymeric conductive layer. The pore producing agent can be embedded in any suitable manner, such as by spraying, Doctor Blade coating, and screen printing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The wet polymeric layer with the pore producing agent embedded within can then be dried or cured. If excess pore producing agent is remaining on the surface of the cured polymeric layer with the pore producing agent embedded therein after curing, the surface layer can be wiped or cleaned of the excess pore producing agent in any suitable manner. After the wet polymeric conductive layer is cured, the suitable pore producing agent can be exposed to a removal media to cause the pore producing agent to form pores within the conductive polymeric layer to form a porous conductive coating <b>130</b>. Any suitable amount of pore producing agent can be added to wet polymeric conductive layer to result in the porous conductive coating <b>130</b> having the desired porosity.</p>

In at least one embodiment, the removal media can be any suitable media, such as heat, and solvent for removing the pore producing agent to form pores in the coating <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In at least one embodiment, the pore producing agent is in the form of a solid granular pore forming agent with a predetermined particle diameter, such as 0.1 to 10 microns. Some examples of suitable pore forming agents include, but are not necessarily limited to, any suitable inorganic salt such as carbonates and bicarbonates. Some examples of suitable carbonates include, but are not necessarily limited to sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, calcium bicarbonate, zinc carbonate, barium carbonate, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some examples of other suitable pore forming agents include nitrites, such as sodium nitrites.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Some examples of other suitable pore forming agents include certain organic pore forming compounds such as camphor, urea and derivatives of camphor or urea, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Examples of suitable solvent removal medias include, but are not necessarily limited to, acid, water and bases.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In at least one embodiment, the pore producing agent comprises a foaming agent. Any suitable foaming agent and process may be used. Suitable foaming agents include physical and chemical foaming agents, such as azo compounds, azodicarbonamide, hydrazines, such as trihydrazinotriazine, tetrazoles, such as 5-phenyltetrazole, benzoxazines and semicarbazides.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, the pore surface layer <b>130</b> could be formed by forming pores in the outer surface layer <b>130</b> after it has been cured and formed. In this embodiment, pins or other protrusions could be penetrated into a heated and/or softened layer <b>130</b> to form pores therein. In this embodiment, the pins or protrusions may also be heated either in addition to, or in lieu of, heating the layer <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In at least one embodiment, when a lower contact resistance is desired, the pore producing agent can be mixed with a conductive material such as graphite, gold, platinum, carbon, palladium, niobium, rhodium, ruthenium and the rare earth metals. In this embodiment, the mixture of the pore producing agent and the conductive material could be in any suitable proportion. However, it is anticipated that a 75/25 mixture of pore producing agent and conductive material to a 25/75 mixture of pore producing agent and conductive material is likely to find utility. In at least one embodiment, a particularly preferred mixture comprises a 50/50 mixture of graphite (superior graphite BG-34) and sodium carbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the present invention. The plate <b>30</b>&#x2032; and body <b>120</b>&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are similar in construction and use to the plate <b>30</b> and body <b>120</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The body <b>120</b>&#x2032; of the electrically conductive fluid distribution plate <b>30</b>&#x2032; is made (e.g. molded) entirely of composite material, and the porous surface layer <b>130</b> is formed on the exterior surface of the composite that engages the diffusion media. In this embodiment, conductive coating <b>125</b> is not necessary. The composite material of the plate <b>30</b>&#x2032; can be any suitable conductive composite material for forming plates, such as a polymer composite material comprising 50% to 90% by volume electrically-conductive filler (e.g. graphite particles or filaments) dispersed throughout a polymeric matrix (thermoplastic or thermoset).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In another embodiment, the porous surface layer <b>130</b> could be formed by molding the composite plate <b>30</b>&#x2032; in a textured mold that would render the exterior surface of the composite plate <b>30</b>&#x2032; with the desired porosity. In this embodiment, when employing the use of a textured mold, the porous layer <b>130</b> can extend into the composite plate body <b>120</b>&#x2032; to a depth of 1 to 5 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An electrically conductive fluid distribution plate according to the various embodiments of the present invention has excellent water management properties. It should be understood that the principles of the present invention apply equally as well to unipolar plates and bipolar plates.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention will be further explained by way of example. It is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the example.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A metal bipolar plate is first coated with a conductive protective polymeric coating such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,376. This first coating helps to protect the underlying metal (e.g. stainless steel) from corroding in the aggressive fuel cell environment and is flashed for 10 minutes at 150&#xb0; C. and then cured at 260&#xb0; C. for 15 minutes. After the plate cools down, a second layer of the same polymeric coating is then sprayed onto the first coating. This wet layer is then dusted with a mixture (50/50 by weight) of graphite (e.g. superior graphite BG-34) and sodium carbonate and is then cured using the same curing cycle as the first coating. After curing, dry extra dust (graphite and sodium carbonate) is wiped off the plate. The coated plate is then dipped in an acidic solution of 0.1M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>to dissolve the sodium carbonate particles that are embedded in the top layer, evolving gases (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>) that forms pores inside the top layer. The plate is then washed and dried to remove any salt that might remain on the surface as a result of the dissolution of the sodium carbonate. The exterior coating has a porosity of &#x3e;30% as measured by BET measurement techniques. The water contact angle on this plate is measured to be less than 10&#xb0;.</p>

Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
