<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase entry of PCT/EP2009/001505 filed Mar. 3, 2009, and claims priority to German Patent Application No. 102008014311.1 filed Mar. 14, 2008, each of which is incorporated herein by references hereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to embedders for embedding a watermark into an information representation, to detectors for detecting a watermark in an information representation, to methods for embedding a watermark into an information representation, to methods for detecting a watermark in an information representation, to corresponding computer programs and to an information signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some embodiments of the present invention relate to devices and methods for repeated watermark embedding and watermark extraction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many fields of information processing, it is desirable today to add a watermark to the information. A watermark is, for example, a piece of information which may be added to the actual useful information without substantially interfering with the actual information. When adding a watermark, for example the data format of the useful information may be maintained, for example by overlaying the watermark onto the useful information. In some known methods, overlaying the watermark onto the useful information is executed such that an interference with the useful information is kept so low that, for example, it does not interfere, or only very weakly, in a reproduction of the useful information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Watermarks may, for example, be added to an information representation which represents an audio signal. Further, watermarks may, for example, be added to an information representation representing a video signal. A watermark may, however, also be added to an information representation, for example representing a computer program. Still further information representations representing different data forms may be provided with a watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Special challenges result when several watermarks are to be embedded into one single useful information. In this case, frequently a mutual influencing of the watermark results, whereby in some case detection is made more difficult or even impossible. The mutual influencing of the watermarks may further lead to an interference of the actual useful information becoming unacceptably high.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in some conventional methods the effort necessitated to extract several watermarks from an information representation is strongly increased.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one aspect, the present invention provides an embedder for embedding a watermark to be embedded into an input information representation having an information adder which is implemented to provide the input information representation with the watermark and an additional information to be added, to obtain an information representation provided with the watermark and the additional information to be added. The additional information to be added includes a descriptive information regarding an embedding of at least one watermark into the input information representation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The mentioned aspect is based on the finding that an extraction of a watermark embedded into the information representation by a descriptive information describing the embedding of at least one watermark into the input information representation may be facilitated. By adding the additional information, thus, within the information representation provided with the watermark to be embedded, information is provided which may be used by a watermark detector for controlling the watermark detection and/or watermark extraction. The describing additional information may, for example, carry information about whether, how, when or from whom the watermark was added to the input information representation. Thus, the additional information may serve a watermark detector or watermark extractor for deciding whether the watermark is to be extracted and/or in which way (e.g. using which detection parameters) the watermark is to be extracted. The presence of the additional information describing the embedding of a watermark into the information representation provided with the watermark may, for example, make it unnecessary to search the information representation provided with the watermark to be embedded for any possible watermarks known to the watermark detector. Rather, the watermark detector may, for example, already detect, using the additional information, which watermarks are contained at all in the information representation provided with the watermark. Thus, the watermark detector may, for example, accordingly narrow a search, whereby the effort in the search for watermarks in the watermark detector is considerably reduced. The additional information may further include, for example, information on resources used in the embedding (e.g. frequency resources, time resources or code resources), so that, in the detection of a watermark in the information representation provided with the watermark to be embedded, the detector may evaluate the additional information to set detection parameters suitably and/or pointedly for a detection of the watermark to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The additional information may further, for example, carry information about how many watermarks are embedded in the information representation. Thus, for example a watermark detector, after evaluating the corresponding information, may obtain a termination criterion, so that the watermark detector may, for example, terminate a search for watermarks when so many watermarks have been found as are described by the additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In summary it may thus be stated that, by adding additional information describing the embedding of watermarks into the input information representation or into the information representation provided with the watermark to be embedded, efficiency in the detection of watermarks may be substantially improved in a watermark detector.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, according to a further aspect, the present invention provides a detector for detecting at least one watermark in an input information representation, wherein the detector comprises an embedding information extractor which is implemented to extract embedding information including descriptive information regarding the embedding of at least one watermark into the input information representation (or into the information representation provided with the watermark) from the information representation. The corresponding detector further includes a watermark extractor which is implemented to extract one or several watermarks contained in the input information representation depending on the embedding information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The corresponding detector is, for example, able to extract the additional information added by the above-described embedder to the information representation as embedding information from the information representation and to control the watermark extraction depending on the embedding information. Thus, the mentioned detector is, for example, able to use the additional information and to realize the advantages described above with reference to the corresponding embedder.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to some further embodiments, the present invention provides an information signal including at least one watermark and a descriptive information regarding the embedding of the at least one watermark into the information signal. The corresponding information signal, due to the presence of the descriptive information regarding the embedding of the at least one watermark into the information signal, enables a substantially easier (for example faster or more resource-economical) extraction of the watermark embedded into the information signal than is conventionally possible.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram of an embedder for embedding a watermark to be embedded or to be added into an input information representation. The embedder according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is designated by <b>100</b> in its entirety. The embedder <b>100</b> is implemented to receive an input information representation <b>110</b>. The embedder <b>100</b> includes a watermark information detector <b>120</b> which is implemented to detect watermark information already contained in the input information representation <b>110</b>. Thus, the watermark information detector <b>120</b> for example provides information <b>122</b> about watermark information detected in the input information representation <b>110</b>. The embedder <b>100</b> further includes a watermark adder <b>130</b> which is implemented to provide the input information representation <b>110</b>, depending on the watermark information detected by the watermark information detector <b>120</b>, with a watermark <b>132</b> to be added, to obtain an information representation <b>134</b> provided with the watermark <b>132</b> to be embedded. The watermark adder <b>130</b> may thus, for example, be implemented to receive the input information representation <b>110</b> and the information <b>122</b> from the watermark information detector <b>120</b>. Further, the watermark adder <b>130</b> may, for example, be implemented to receive the watermark <b>132</b> to be added. The watermark <b>132</b> to be added may, however, also be firmly stored in the watermark adder <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Regarding the functioning of the embedder <b>100</b>, it is to be noted that the watermark adder <b>130</b> may add the watermark <b>132</b> to be added depending on the watermark information already contained in the input information representation <b>110</b>, to the input information representation <b>110</b>. The embedder <b>100</b> thus enables the watermark <b>132</b> to be added to be added to the input information representation <b>110</b> not in a random way but considering the watermark already contained in the input information representation <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Regarding the way in which the watermark already contained in the input information representation <b>110</b> is considered by the watermark adder <b>130</b>, different possibilities exist which are explained in the following, for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>d </i>in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a detector for detecting at least two watermarks in an information representation provided with one watermark. The detector according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is designated by <b>200</b> in its entirety. The detector <b>200</b> is implemented to receive an information representation <b>210</b> provided with a watermark. The detector <b>200</b> further includes a detection information detector <b>220</b> which is implemented to identify reusable watermark information in the information representation <b>210</b> provided with the watermark. The detection information detector <b>220</b> is thus, for example, implemented to receive the information representation <b>210</b> and to provide information <b>222</b> about reusable watermark information. The detector <b>200</b> further includes a watermark extractor <b>230</b> which is implemented to extract a first watermark using the reusable watermark information from the information representation <b>210</b> and to extract a second watermark using the reusable watermark information from the input information representation <b>210</b>. The watermark extractor <b>230</b> is, for example, implemented to receive the information representation <b>210</b> and the information <b>222</b> provided by the detection information detector <b>220</b> and, based thereon, to provide information <b>232</b> about a first watermark and information <b>234</b> about a second watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Regarding the functioning of the detector <b>200</b>, it is to be noted that the watermark extractor <b>230</b> is, for example, implemented to use information common to both watermarks for the detection of the first watermark described by the information <b>232</b> and for the detection of the second watermark described by the information <b>234</b>. For example, the common reusable information may be synchronization information which is for both watermarks. Thus, it is sufficient in this case, for example, to detect the synchronization information only once, whereupon the detection of the at least two watermarks may be executed based on the common synchronization information.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The common, reusable information may, for example, additionally or alternatively be information which indicates that the first watermark and the second watermark may be detected with at least one common detection parameter. For example, the information representation <b>210</b> may contain information which indicates that at least two watermarks were embedded into the information representation <b>210</b> according to a common embedding method, so that the watermark extractor <b>230</b> may assume that at least two watermarks may be extracted with a corresponding common extraction method from the information representation <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, for example, the information representation <b>210</b> may carry information about how many watermarks are embedded in the information representation <b>210</b>. The corresponding number information may, for example, be regarded as common information which commonly describes the at least two watermarks contained in the information representation <b>210</b>. The number information may, for example, be extracted by the detection information detector <b>220</b> and may further be used, for example, to set one or several extraction parameters for the watermark extractor <b>230</b> to correctly extract several watermarks from the information representation <b>210</b>. In other words, the number information may be used to correctly set detection parameters of the watermark extractor <b>230</b> for the extraction of two different watermarks.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If it is know, for example, that three watermarks are contained in the information representation <b>210</b>, then, for example, in the extraction of the first watermark and in the extraction of the second watermark such detection parameters which are provided for embedding a fourth to n<sup>th </sup>watermark may be left out of consideration. Rather, it is sufficient to limit the range of detection parameters to be considered according to the number of watermarks present.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further details are again described in the following, for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows a block diagram of an embedder for embedding a watermark to be embedded into an input information representation according to an embodiment of the invention. The embedder according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is designated by <b>300</b> in its entirety. The embedder <b>300</b> is implemented to receive an input information representation <b>310</b> and to provide an information representation <b>320</b> provided with a watermark and additional information. The embedder <b>300</b> includes an information adder <b>330</b> which is implemented to receive the input information representation <b>310</b> and to provide the information representation <b>320</b> provided with the watermark and the additional information. The information adder <b>330</b> is all in all implemented to provide the information representation <b>310</b> with the watermark <b>341</b> to be added and additional information <b>343</b> to be added to obtain the information representation <b>320</b> provided with the watermark and the additional information. The additional information to be added includes descriptive information regarding an embedding of at least one watermark into the information representation. For example, the descriptive information describes embedding at least one watermark into the information representation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows an exemplary topology of the information adder <b>330</b>. The information adder <b>330</b> may, for example, in a parallel structure, comprise a watermark adder <b>340</b> and an additional information adder <b>342</b>. For example, both the watermark adder <b>360</b> and also the additional information adder <b>342</b> may receive the input information representation <b>310</b> to add the watermark to be added or the additional information to be added. For example, the watermark adder <b>340</b> may be implemented to receive the input information representation <b>310</b> and the watermark <b>341</b> to be added or to be embedded and, based thereupon, to generate an information representation <b>344</b> provided with the watermark to be added. The additional information adder <b>342</b> may, for example, be configured to receive the input information representation <b>310</b> and the additional information to be added <b>343</b> and, based thereupon, to generate an information representation <b>346</b> provided with the additional information. The information representation <b>344</b> provided with the watermark may further, for example, be combined with the information representation <b>346</b> provided with the additional information to obtain the information representation <b>320</b> provided with the watermark and additional information, as is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. Alternatively, it is also possible, however, that the watermark adder <b>340</b> provides as an output signal watermark information adapted to the information representation <b>310</b>, that the additional information adder <b>342</b> provides additional information adapted to the information representation <b>310</b> and that the output signals of the watermark adder <b>340</b> and the additional information adder <b>342</b> are subsequently combined with the input information representation <b>310</b> to obtain the information representation <b>320</b> provided a watermark and additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Alternatively, the information adder <b>330</b> may also comprise other structures, as are described, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>c</i>. For example, the information adder of the embedder <b>300</b> may be replaced by an information adder <b>330</b><i>b </i>according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. The information adder <b>330</b><i>b </i>includes, for example, a series arrangement of a watermark adder <b>340</b><i>b </i>and an additional information adder <b>342</b><i>b</i>. The watermark adder <b>340</b><i>b </i>is configured, for example, to receive the input information representation <b>310</b> and to provide the input information representation <b>344</b><i>b </i>provided with a watermark to the additional information adder <b>342</b><i>b</i>. The additional information adder <b>342</b><i>b </i>may be configured, for example, to add the additional information to be added to the information representation <b>344</b><i>b </i>provided with the watermark and to thus provide the information representation <b>320</b> provided with the watermark and additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As it may be gathered from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>, the order of the additional information adder and the watermark adder may, of course, also be changed with respect to the order illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. In this case, an additional information adder <b>342</b><i>c </i>is, for example, arranged in front of a watermark adder <b>340</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In summary, it is to be noted that different structures may be used to add both the watermark to be added and also the additional information to be added to the input information representation <b>310</b>. Adding these two pieces of information may, apart from that, also be done by a common information adder in which the blocks &#x201c;watermark adder&#x201d; and &#x201c;additional information adder&#x201d; are combined or summarized. In other words, no separate adder is necessitated for the watermark and the additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">However, the additional information to be added may well depend on embedding parameters of the watermark adder. Thus, for example, the additional information may encode how the watermark adder is configured or parametrized to add the watermark to be added. For example, the additional information may contain information on which watermark method the watermark adder used for adding the watermark to be added. Further, the additional information may also describe individual parameters which the watermark adder uses when providing the input information representation <b>310</b> with the watermark to be added. Thus, the additional information may, for example, carry information about which embedding code the watermark adder <b>340</b> is using, which frequency resources (e.g. frequency bands) the watermark adder <b>340</b> is using for embedding the watermark, or which time resources (e.g. time slots) the watermark adder is using for embedding the watermark. Further, the watermark adder <b>340</b> and the additional information adder <b>342</b> may, for example, also use different embedding methods when it is, for example, requested according to a specification that the additional information is to be embedded according to a predetermined embedding method, independent of which embedding method the watermark adder <b>340</b> is using. In this case, the watermark adder <b>340</b> and the additional information adder <b>342</b> are, for example, implemented such that no substantial mutual interference results when adding the watermark and when adding the additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further details regarding the embedding of a watermark and additional information are explained in more detail in the following, for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram of a detector for detecting at least one watermark in an input information representation provided with a watermark. The detector according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is designated by <b>400</b> in its entirety. The detector <b>400</b> is implemented to receive an information representation (or input information representation) provided with a watermark. The detector <b>400</b> includes an embedding information extractor <b>420</b> which is implemented to receive the information representation <b>410</b> provided with the watermark and to extract embedding information <b>422</b>, including descriptive information regarding the embedding of at least one watermark into the information representation, from the information representation <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The detector <b>400</b> further includes a watermark extractor <b>430</b> which is implemented to receive the information representation <b>410</b> provided with the watermark and the descriptive information <b>422</b> with respect to the embedding of at least one watermark into the information representation <b>410</b>. The watermark extractor <b>430</b> is further implemented to extract one or several watermarks contained in the information representation <b>410</b> depending on the embedding information <b>422</b> and to thus provide information <b>432</b> about at least one watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The watermark extractor <b>430</b> may thus pointedly identify a watermark in the information representation <b>410</b> based on the embedding information <b>422</b>. Based on the descriptive information <b>422</b>, the watermark extractor <b>430</b> has, for example, information <b>422</b> regarding the fact using which embedding method a watermark present in the information representation <b>410</b> is embedded into the information representation. Alternatively or additionally, information <b>422</b> may, for example, be provided to the watermark extractor <b>430</b> from the embedding information extractor <b>420</b> about the fact which detection code or extraction code is to be used for the extraction of a watermark from the information representation <b>410</b>. Further, the embedding information extractor <b>420</b> may, for example, provide information to the watermark extractor <b>430</b> about how many watermarks are contained in the information representation <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The embedding information extractor <b>420</b> may, for providing the descriptive information <b>422</b>, evaluate, for example, additional information contained in the information representation. Additional information may, for example, be information not belonging to the actual information content of the watermark but describing in which way one or several watermarks are embedded in the information representation <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a block diagram of an embedder for embedding a watermark into an information representation or into an input information representation according to an embodiment of the invention. The embedder according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is designated by <b>500</b> in its entirety. The embedder <b>500</b> is implemented to receive an input information representation <b>510</b> and to generate an information representation <b>534</b> provided with a watermark to be embedded or to be added. The embedder <b>500</b> includes an embedding parameter determiner <b>520</b>. The embedding parameter determiner is implemented to apply a schematically indicated derivation function <b>522</b> one or several times to an initial value <b>524</b> to obtain an embedding parameter <b>526</b> for embedding the watermark to be embedded into the information representation. The embedder <b>500</b> further includes a watermark adder <b>530</b> which is implemented to receive the input information representation <b>510</b> and the embedding parameter <b>526</b>. Further, the watermark adder <b>530</b> may be implemented to receive the watermark <b>532</b> to be added or to be embedded. The watermark to be added or to be embedded may further also be firmly stored in the watermark adder <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Thus, the watermark adder <b>530</b> provides, for example by embedding the watermark <b>532</b> to be added into the input information representation <b>510</b> using the embedding parameters <b>526</b>, an information representation <b>534</b> provided with the watermark to be embedded.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The embedder <b>500</b> thus enables the determination of the embedding parameters <b>526</b> based on an initial value <b>524</b>, wherein a derivation function <b>522</b> is evaluated. By the possibility of evaluating the derivation function <b>522</b> several times, there is the possibility, based on one single initial value <b>524</b>, of generating different sets of embedding parameters <b>526</b> in a simple way. By the use of a derivation function, which may, for example, be a cryptographic one-way function, it may be achieved that access rights are allocated to different embedders. Details in this respect are given in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a block diagram of a detector for detecting a watermark in an information representation provided with a watermark. The detector according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is designated by <b>600</b> in its entirety. The detector <b>600</b> is implemented to receive an information representation or an input information representation <b>610</b> provided with a watermark and to provide information <b>634</b> about a watermark contained in the information representation <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The detector <b>600</b> includes a detection parameter determiner <b>620</b>. The detection parameter determiner <b>620</b> is implemented to apply a schematically illustrated derivation function <b>622</b>, one or several times, to an initial value <b>624</b> which may be given externally or which may be stored in the detection parameter determiner <b>620</b>, and thus obtain a detection parameter <b>626</b> for the detection of the watermark in the information representation.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The detector <b>600</b> further includes a watermark extractor <b>630</b> which is implemented to receive the information representation <b>610</b> provided with the watermark and the detection parameter <b>626</b>. The watermark extractor <b>630</b> is further configured to extract the information <b>634</b> about a watermark contained in the information representation <b>610</b> from the information representation <b>610</b> provided with the watermark using the detection parameter <b>626</b>. In other words, the detection parameter <b>626</b> serves for setting the watermark extractor <b>630</b>. The detection parameter may here, for example, indicate which resources (e.g. which time slots or frequency bands) are applied in the detection of the watermark. Alternatively or additionally, the detection parameter <b>626</b> may, for example, be used to determine a detection code, if, for example, in the information representation <b>610</b> different watermarks with different codes are separate from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, the detection parameter determiner <b>620</b> may, for example, be implemented to decide, for example, based on an (optional) index parameter <b>640</b>, how often the derivation function <b>622</b> is to be applied to the initial value <b>624</b> to obtain the detection parameter <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Apart from that, it is to be noted that, when determining the detection parameter <b>626</b> from the initial value <b>624</b>, also additional algorithms may be used, for example. Thus, for example, an intermediate result obtained by the application of the derivation function to the initial value may serve as an input value for a calculation regulation which maps the intermediate result to a detection code. By the application of the corresponding function regulation it may, for example, be achieved that the thus obtained detection parameter comprises certain characteristics which are advantageous, or necessitated, for a watermark extraction. For example, the intermediate value, obtained by an application, once or several times, of the derivation function <b>622</b> to the initial value <b>624</b>, may serve as an initial value (seed) for a spread code generator which determines different spread codes based on different seeds, wherein the spread codes are, for example, at least approximately orthogonal to each other. The corresponding spread codes may serve, for example, as detection parameters <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">However, many other possibilities are possible for mapping the intermediate result, obtained by the application of the derivation function to the initial value, to a detection parameter <b>626</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>shows a block diagram of an embedder for embedding the watermark to be added into an information representation or into an input information representation. The embedder according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a </i>is designated by <b>700</b> in its entirety. The embedder <b>700</b> is implemented to receive an input information representation <b>710</b> and to generate, based thereon, an information representation <b>720</b> provided with a watermark. The information representation <b>720</b> provided with the watermark may further be optionally provided with additional information, for example describing the embedding.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The embedder <b>700</b> includes a watermark information detector <b>730</b> which is implemented to receive the input information representation <b>710</b> and to obtain information regarding the embedding of a watermark therefrom. The embedder <b>700</b> further includes a watermark adder <b>740</b> which is implemented, for example using information provided by the watermark information detector <b>730</b>, to add a watermark to be added to the input information representation <b>710</b> to obtain the information representation <b>720</b> provided with the watermark. The embedder <b>700</b> further includes, for example, an embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> which is implemented to receive information from the watermark information detector <b>730</b> and to thus provide one or several embedding parameters to the watermark adder <b>740</b> so that, for example, the watermark adder <b>740</b> may be set depending on the setting parameters provided by the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The embedder <b>700</b> further includes an additional information provider <b>760</b> which is implemented to receive, from the watermark information detector, information regarding a watermark contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> and to provide additional information to the watermark adder <b>740</b> which may, for example, be added by the watermark adder <b>740</b> to the input information representation <b>710</b>, so that the information representation <b>720</b> provided with the watermark further includes the additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the following, details are described regarding which information may be obtained by the watermark information detector <b>730</b> from the input information representation <b>710</b>, and how this information may be used by the watermark adder <b>740</b>, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> and the additional information provider <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The watermark information detector <b>730</b> may, for example, include a detector <b>731</b> for the detection of reusable watermark information. The detector <b>731</b> for reusable watermark information may, for example, be implemented to detect synchronization information in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The synchronization information may, for example, exist when a watermark is already present in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The synchronization information may, for example, be a certain pattern contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> which may, for example, precede a watermark embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b> or which may, for example, be interleaved with a watermark embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b>. The synchronization information may, for example, be a firmly given pattern which may be contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> encoded according to a certain encoding. For example, the synchronization information may be embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b> according to a predetermined synchronization embedding code. For example, the synchronization information may occur simultaneously (or at least overlapping in time) in several individual frequency bands in the information representation, whereby the synchronization information is, for example, especially well detectable. The detector <b>731</b> for the reusable watermark information may thus, for example, provide information <b>732</b> about the reusable watermark information to the watermark adder <b>740</b>. The watermark adder <b>740</b> may, for example, be implemented, in response to the presence of reusable watermark information in the input information representation, to prevent a renewed embedding of the reusable watermark information. For example, the watermark adder <b>740</b> may be configured to only add synchronization information to the input information representation <b>710</b> when the information <b>732</b> of the detector <b>731</b> for the reusable watermark information indicates that in the input information representation <b>710</b> no watermark information is yet present or detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the information <b>732</b> of the determiner <b>731</b> for reusable watermark information indicates, for example, that in the input information representation <b>710</b> synchronization information is already present, then the watermark adder <b>740</b> may, for example, add the watermark to be added synchronized with the already existing synchronization information in the input information representation. For this purpose, the detector <b>731</b> may, for example, provide information for the reusable watermark information to the watermark adder <b>740</b> with regard to where in the input information representation (for example at what time or in which frequency bands) synchronization information already exists. Based thereon, the watermark adder <b>740</b> may, for example, calculate or determine where (for example in which time interval or in which frequency bands) the watermark to be added is to be added to the input information representation <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, the watermark adder <b>740</b> may be configured to add synchronization information to the input information representation <b>710</b> when the information <b>732</b> of the detector <b>731</b> for reusable watermark information indicates that, in the input information representation <b>710</b>, no reusable synchronization information was detected.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">By the repeated use of the synchronization information when embedding a further watermark by the watermark adder <b>740</b> into an input information representation, in which synchronization information (and thus in many cases also watermark information) already exists, on the one hand a negative influencing of the information representation <b>710</b> by embedding the watermark to be embedded may be minimized and, on the other hand, a resource-saving detection of several watermarks may be enabled in the information representation <b>720</b> provided with a watermark. Thus, conventionally, the influence on an information representation is less, the less information is embedded into the same. If thus synchronization information already existing in the information representation <b>720</b> is reused instead of embedding new additional synchronization information, an influence on the information content of the information representation may be minimized. On the side of a watermark detection it is, apart from that, sufficient in the reuse of the synchronization information to detect the synchronization information once. Thus, the detection effort may be kept low as compared to when two different pieces of synchronization information would have to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The watermark information detector may further comprise, for example, a detector <b>733</b> for detecting additional information contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The detector <b>733</b> may, for example, provide information <b>734</b> about the additional information. The additional information may, for example, be page information describing the embedding of one or several watermarks into the input information representation <b>710</b>. For example, the additional information may carry information about how many watermarks are already embedded in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The additional information here does not necessarily have to describe the overall number of embedded watermarks, but may be restricted to indicating how many watermarks were embedded according to a certain watermark embedding method into the input information representation. The information about the number of the existing watermarks may further be restricted to indicate how many watermarks were embedded by a certain watermark embedder into the input information representation. In an ideal case which may, however, not be achieved, the information about the number of existing watermarks may also carry information about an overall number of watermarks. In some embodiments, thus the information about the number of existing watermarks at least provides information about a minimum number of existing watermarks, wherein more watermarks may in fact exist.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The detector <b>733</b> may further be implemented, for example, to detect additional information which indicates according to which watermark embedding method or according to which watermark embedding methods the watermarks existing in the input information representation <b>710</b> are embedded. This information may, for example, exist in connection with the synchronization information in the input information representation <b>710</b>. For example, the synchronization information may contain information, for example by the selection of the synchronization pattern, according to which watermark embedding method the watermark information contained in the information representation <b>710</b> is embedded. Alternatively or additionally, also subsequent to the synchronization information or parallel to the synchronization information, corresponding additional information may exist in the input information representation <b>710</b> which indicates according to which watermark embedding method one or several watermarks are embedded in the input information representation <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Alternatively or additionally, the additional information may, for example carry information about what resources (e.g. time slots, frequency bands or embedding codes or spread codes) were used for embedding one or several watermarks into the input information representation. This information may be contained in additional information which may, for example, comprise the above-described structure. In other words, corresponding additional information may, for example, be contained within the synchronization information, parallel in time to the synchronization information or subsequent to the synchronization information (for example directly subsequent to the synchronization information) in the input information representation. In some embodiments, the additional information is encoded separately to the associated watermark information described by the additional information. While the watermark information thus, for example, encodes a certain useful information which is, for example, freely selectable on the embedder side, the additional information may, for example, be determined on the basis of the fact by which parameters the actual useful information of the watermark is encoded or embedded. In other words, in some embodiments a strict logical separation between the additional information directed to the type of representation of the useful information in the watermark, and the actual useful information itself which is encoded by the watermark may exist. In other words, using the additional information, for example embedding parameters, using which the useful information to be encoded by the water was embedded into the information representation, are identified without having to decode the useful information of the watermark. In other words, the additional information is in some embodiments independent of the useful information encoded by the watermark and only depends on parameters according to which an embedder is operated.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, the watermark information detector <b>730</b> includes a detector <b>735</b> for embedding parameters of embedded watermarks. The detector <b>735</b> may, for example, receive the input information representation <b>710</b> and thereupon provide information <b>736</b> on embedding parameters, using which one or several watermarks are embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b>. The detector <b>735</b> may, for example, be implemented to analyze the input information representation <b>710</b> in order to find out, using which settings or parameters watermarks were embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b>. For this purpose, the detector <b>735</b> may, for example, also analyze the watermarks themselves. For example, the detector may apply a pattern recognition method to the input information representation in order to determine whether watermarks were embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b> according to a certain embedding method. As a pattern-recognizing method, for example a correlation method may be used, according to which the input information representation <b>710</b> is correlated with one or several comparative values. Further, the detector may also apply other algorithms in order to obtain information <b>736</b> on an embedding parameter of at least one watermark already contained within the input information representation <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In other words, while the detector <b>733</b> may, for example, be implemented to evaluate additional information which is different from the useful information represented by the watermark, the detector <b>735</b> may, for example be implemented to analyze the watermark information represented by the useful information. Thus, different possibilities exist as to the way in which information may be obtained on a watermark contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. Apart from evaluating the additional information by the detector <b>733</b>, also a direct analysis of the watermark information (or, in some embodiments, of the complete watermark information including the useful information) is available.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one further embodiment, the watermark information detector <b>730</b> may (alternatively or additionally) include a detector <b>737</b> which is implemented to determine a number of watermarks embedded in the input information. The detector <b>737</b> may, for example, be implemented to receive the input information representation <b>710</b> and to provide information <b>738</b> about the number of embedded watermarks (or detected embedded watermarks).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As was already described above, it is not compulsory for the information <b>738</b> to describe all the watermarks contained in the input information representation. Rather, it is sufficient in some embodiments if the information <b>738</b> describes a number of watermarks detected in the input information representation.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In summary it is to be noted that there is a multitude of possibilities for obtaining information by the watermark information detector <b>730</b> which describes the embedding of watermarks in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The corresponding information <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> may be used in different ways, as is described in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">For example, the information <b>732</b> may directly be transferred to the watermark adder <b>740</b> via reusable watermark information, so that the same may decide, for example based on the information on reusable watermark information, whether reusable watermark information is contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The possibly reusable information may then be directly used by the watermark adder <b>740</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, the additional information provider <b>760</b> may receive the information <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> provided by the watermark information detector <b>730</b> (or maybe only one or several pieces of the mentioned information) and derive therefrom additional information to be added to the input information representation <b>710</b>. The additional information may, for example, include information regarding the embedding of watermarks or watermark information already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. For example, the additional information <b>762</b> may comprise a reference to the additional information <b>734</b> already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> and detected by the detector <b>733</b>. Further, the additional information <b>762</b> to be added may, for example, include a copy of the additional information <b>734</b> contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> and further be supplemented by other information related, for example, to the embedding of the watermark to be added. Further, the additional information <b>732</b> may, for example, describe a number of watermarks contained in the information representation <b>720</b> provided with the watermark to be added. If thus, by the watermark information detector <b>730</b>, information about a number of watermarks embedded in the input information representation <b>710</b> is provided, then, for example, the additional information provider <b>760</b> may increment the mentioned number and thus generate the additional information <b>762</b> so that the same describes a number of watermarks contained after adding the watermark to be added in the information representation <b>720</b>. Further, the additional information <b>762</b> may include information on embedding parameters of watermarks already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> about embedding parameters, according to which the watermark to be added is embedded.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">It is to be noted that the additional information <b>762</b> does, of course, not have to include all of the mentioned information, but that it is sufficient if the additional information only includes one or several of the mentioned pieces of information.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, however, advantages result when the additional information <b>762</b> not only describes how the watermark to be added is added to the input information representation <b>710</b>, but when the additional information <b>762</b> further also includes information on watermarks already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. This combined information describing both the watermarks already existing in the input information representation <b>710</b> and also the embedding of the watermark to be embedded may be evaluated in an especially efficient way by a detector. Thus, a detector may, for example, by evaluating one single additional information, obtain extensive information on the embedding of all watermarks contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> (or at least with respect to a plurality of watermarks contained in the input information representation). It is thus not necessitated to evaluate many individual pieces of additional information and to compile their information.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may further be implemented to set or adapt embedding parameters for the embedding of the watermark to be added by the watermark adder <b>740</b> depending on one or several pieces of information <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> provided by the watermark information detector <b>730</b>. If, for example, the additional information <b>734</b> includes information on using which resources (e.g. using which time slots, using which frequency bands or using which embedding codes) the watermarks already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> are embedded, then the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may, for example, select suitable embedding parameters or embedding resources for embedding the watermark to be added. For example, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may be configured to select the resources for the embedding of the watermark to be added so that no unacceptable intersections whatsoever result between the resources used in the embedding of the watermark to be added and the resources used in the embedding of the already existing watermarks. Based on the information regarding which time slots are used by the watermarks already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may, for example, select a free time slot for the embedding of the watermark to be added. In a similar way, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may select suitable (free or only relatively weakly occupied) frequency bands for the embedding of the watermark to be added, when the information provided by the watermark information detector <b>730</b> indicates the occupation of frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If the information provided by the watermark information detector <b>730</b> indicates which embedding code or which embedding codes were used for embedding information into the input information representation <b>710</b>, then the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may, for example, further select an embedding code for embedding the watermark to be added which is, for example, different from the embedding codes used in the input information representation <b>710</b>. For example, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may select an embedding code for the embedding of the watermark to be added, which is at least approximately orthogonal to embedding codes which were used for the embedding of watermarks already contained in the input information representation. Thus it may, for example be guaranteed by the evaluation of the input information representation <b>710</b> by the watermark information detector <b>730</b> that the watermark to be added is embedded using an embedding code which is different from the embedding codes of the already existing watermarks.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one embodiment, the embedding parameter determiner may be implemented to also generate embedding parameters for an embedding of additional information as is, for example, provided by the additional information provider <b>760</b>. In this case, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may, for example, be configured to set the embedding parameters for the embedding of the additional information <b>762</b> such that the additional information <b>762</b> is embedded substantially using the same embedding parameters as additional information already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. For this purpose, for example the watermark information detector <b>730</b> may also provide information on embedding parameters, using which additional information already contained in the information representation <b>710</b> was embedded into the input information representation <b>710</b>. In this way, it may, for example, be enabled that both the additional information already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b> and also the additional information <b>762</b> to be added may be detected efficiently by a detector.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In a further embodiment, the information <b>738</b> about the number of embedded watermarks may be evaluated to determine or specify the embedding parameters. For example, the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b> may comprise a functionality, corresponding to a functionality of the embedding parameter determiner <b>520</b>, as was explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The information <b>738</b> about the number of embedded watermarks (which may, for example, be determined either based on additional information in the input information representation or based on an analysis of the input information representation) may, for example, be used to decide how often the derivation function <b>522</b> is applied to the initial value <b>524</b> in order to obtain the embedding parameter <b>526</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In summary it may thus be noted that, by the embedding parameter determiner <b>750</b>, for example one or several embedding parameters <b>752</b> may be generated which may then be supplied to the watermark adder <b>740</b>. The embedding parameters may here, for example, be selected based on information <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>736</b>, <b>738</b> on watermarks already contained in the input information representation <b>710</b>. The embedding parameters may, for example, serve for selecting an embedding method. Further, the embedding parameters may also describe details regarding the embedding, e.g. an embedding code, an embedding time slot or an embedding frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Further details regarding individual aspects of the embedder <b>700</b> are described in the following with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>b</i>-<b>7</b><i>d</i>. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>shows a graphical representation of resources which are available for an embedding of watermark information. The graphical illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>is designated by <b>770</b> in its entirety. The graphical illustration <b>770</b> illustrates a time/frequency band representation of an information representation. At an abscissa <b>772</b>, for example time is plotted, and at an ordinate <b>774</b>, for example frequency is plotted. The time/frequency representation may, for example, represent an audio signal which may be divided into individual time sections and frequency bands. A corresponding representation of an audio signal may, for example, take place by a spectral analysis as may, for example, be achieved by a filter bank. Different time sections are, for example, designated by <b>776</b><i>a</i>-<b>776</b><i>f</i>. Different frequency bands are, by the way, designated by <b>777</b><i>a</i>-<b>777</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one time section <b>776</b><i>b</i>, for example in the frequency bands <b>777</b><i>a</i>-<b>777</b><i>f</i>, basically synchronization information (SYNC) is contained. Further, for example in another frequency band <b>777</b><i>g </i>in the time section <b>776</b><i>b </i>(i.e. parallel in time to the synchronization information), additional information may be contained describing the embedding of a watermark. The additional information in the frequency band <b>777</b><i>g </i>during the time interval <b>776</b><i>b </i>may, of course, be regarded as optional. Further, additional information may also, for example, be contained in a time slot after the synchronization information (SYNC). For example, the synchronization information in the frequency bands <b>777</b><i>a</i>-<b>777</b><i>f </i>may be contained during the time section <b>776</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, the additional information for different embedded watermarks may be contained in different frequency bands (or time slots). For example, the additional information describing a first embedded watermark or inserted in a first watermark embedding, may be contained in the frequency band <b>777</b><i>f </i>during the time section <b>776</b><i>c</i>. Additional information relating to the embedding of a second watermark, or added in the embedding of a second watermark, may, for example, be inserted in the frequency band <b>776</b><i>e </i>during the time section <b>776</b><i>c</i>. In general, additional information describing the embedding of different watermarks, or those which are embedded in different embedding steps, may be added to the information representation using different resources (here: using different frequency bands). Thus, for example when adding a further watermark, the existing additional information is supplemented by adding further additional information, for example using hitherto unused resources. Thus, for example an overlapping of additional information is prevented, whereby it is, for example, achieved that the information representation is not unnecessarily strongly affected, and whereby it is further achieved that the individual additional information is readable without mutual interferences. In this respect it is to be noted that, in the embedding of watermark information in an information representation, it is generally difficult or even impossible to remove or change information (e.g. additional information) again once inserted into the information representation. For this reason, in some embodiments of the invention, when adding a watermark to be added, additional information is added to possibly already existing additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The graphical illustration <b>770</b> further shows different resources used for the embedding of different watermarks. For example, useful information of the first watermark may be inserted into resource sections designated by a first hatching <b>778</b><i>a</i>. For example, the information of the first watermark in the first time section <b>776</b><i>d </i>may be contained in the frequency bands <b>777</b><i>b</i>, <b>777</b><i>d </i>and <b>777</b><i>f</i>. Further, the information of the first watermark during the fourth time section <b>776</b><i>f </i>may be contained in the frequency bands <b>777</b><i>b</i>, <b>777</b><i>d </i>and <b>777</b><i>f</i>. Information of a second watermark may, for example, be contained, or encoded, using the resources designated by a second hatching <b>778</b><i>b </i>(time section <b>776</b><i>d</i>: frequency bands <b>777</b><i>a</i>, <b>777</b><i>c</i>, <b>777</b><i>e</i>; time section <b>776</b><i>f</i>: frequency bands <b>777</b><i>a</i>, <b>777</b><i>c</i>, <b>777</b><i>e</i>). Useful information of the third watermark may, for example, be contained in resources designated by a third hatching <b>778</b><i>c</i>, and useful information of a fourth watermark may, for example, be contained in resources designated by a fourth hatching <b>778</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">From the graphical illustration <b>770</b> it may, for example, be gathered that the useful information of the watermarks (described by the fields of the graphical illustration <b>770</b> designated by hatchings <b>778</b><i>a</i>, <b>778</b><i>b</i>, <b>778</b><i>c</i>, <b>778</b><i>d</i>) saved separate from corresponding additional information in the watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In summary it may be noted that the graphical illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b </i>may describe an information signal, wherein, in addition to underlying useful information (for example including an audio signal, image information, text information or computer program information), a watermark and, for example, additional information is contained in the information signal. The information signal may be supplemented by all those features and aspects described within the scope of the present specification with regard to the embedders or detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c </i>shows a graphical illustration of a procedure in a determination of an embedding parameter using a one-way function. The graphical illustration according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c </i>is designated by <b>780</b> in its entirety. In the following it is first of all assumed that a first value <b>782</b> is known to an embedder (or a detector), wherein the first value <b>782</b> may also be regarded as the first initial value, or &#x201c;initial value 1&#x201d;. By applying the mentioned one-way function, a second value <b>784</b> may, for example, be obtained from the first value <b>782</b>. Here, for example, an algorithm is known as to how the second value <b>784</b> may be obtained from the first value <b>782</b> with comparatively low computational effort. In some embodiments, however, it is not possible, or only possible with extreme effort, to calculate the first value <b>782</b> from the second value <b>784</b>. For this reason, the one-way function is partially also referred to as a &#x201c;cryptographic one-way function&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">From the second value <b>784</b>, however, by a further application of the one-way function, for example a third value <b>786</b> may be obtained. In other words, the same algorithm is applied to the second value <b>784</b> which was applied to the first value <b>782</b> for determining the second value <b>784</b>, and thus, for example, from the second value <b>784</b> the third value <b>786</b> is obtained. By a further application of the one-way function to the third value <b>786</b>, for example a fourth value <b>788</b> may be obtained. The one-way function is again applied to the fourth value <b>788</b>, and thus, for example, a fifth value <b>789</b> is obtained. It thus remains to be noted that it is sufficient to know the first value <b>782</b> and the one-way function (or the algorithm described by the one-way function) to obtain the second to fifth values <b>784</b>-<b>789</b> from the first value <b>782</b> by a repeated application of the one-way function.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The values <b>782</b>-<b>789</b> may, apart from that, for example be used to serve as a description for embedding parameters or detection parameters of an embedder or detector, as was already explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, an administration of different access rights may be implemented. If, for example, a first embedder (or detector) knows the first value <b>782</b> (initial value 1), it may, based thereon, using the one-way function, determine all the values <b>782</b>-<b>789</b> with low computational effort. If, however, an embedder (or detector) only knows the third value <b>786</b> (initial value 2), then the corresponding embedder (or detector) may only determine the fourth value <b>788</b> or the fifth value <b>789</b> (or subsequent values) using reasonable computational effort. The mentioned detector, which only knows the third value <b>786</b> (initial value 2) and the one-way function, but not the first value <b>782</b> or the second value <b>784</b>, can thus not determine the first value <b>782</b> and the second value <b>784</b> using reasonable computational effort. Accordingly, the mentioned detector only knowing the initial value 2 cannot execute the embedding or detection of a watermark, so that the embedding parameters correspond to the embedding parameters belonging to the first value <b>782</b> or the second value <b>784</b>. Thus, it may, for example, be guaranteed that an embedder which only knows the third value <b>786</b> (initial value 2) may not execute in an unauthorized way an embedding of a watermark according to the embedding parameters belonging to the first value <b>782</b> or according to the embedding parameters belonging to the second value <b>784</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the following it is briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d </i>how, using a one-way function, an embedding parameter may be obtained. For this purpose, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d </i>shows a graphical illustration of a procedure when determining an embedding code or a detection code from an initial value using a one-way function. The graphical illustration according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>d </i>is designated by <b>790</b> in its entirety. The graphical illustration <b>790</b> shows that, based on an initial value <b>792</b>, an intermediate result <b>794</b> may be obtained by the application of a one-way function once or several times. The intermediate result <b>794</b>, for example, corresponds to the second value <b>784</b>, the third value <b>786</b>, the fourth value <b>788</b> or the fifth value <b>789</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>c</i>. The intermediate result <b>794</b> may, of course, also correspond to other values, which may, for example, be obtained by an application of the one-way function more than four times to the first value <b>782</b> or to the initial value <b>782</b>. The intermediate result <b>794</b> may, for example, serve as a seed (starting parameter) for an embedding code generation. For example, based on the intermediate result <b>794</b>, an embedding code may be generated by supplying the intermediate result as a seed to a code generator. As a code generator, here, for example, a feedback shift register arrangement may serve, as it may be known for the generation of pseudo-random numbers. Different initial values for the feedback shift register arrangement in some embodiments leads to different code sequences at an output of the feedback shift register arrangement, wherein the different code sequences may, for example, form the different embedding codes. In other words, for example a first code sequence is generated by a feedback shift register arrangement when the feedback shift register arrangement is provided or pulsed with the first initial value. Further, a second bit sequence or code sequence is generated when the feedback shift register arrangement is provided with a second initial value. The different bit sequences, for example, form the different code sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">For the determination of the embedding code or detection code <b>796</b> from the intermediate result <b>794</b>, however, generally any algorithm may be used which enables obtaining different codes based on different seeds <b>794</b>, wherein the codes, for example at least approximately, comprise default characteristics (e.g. stochastic characteristics). For deriving an embedding parameter from the intermediate result <b>794</b>, also other algorithms may be applied. For example, individual bits of the intermediate result <b>794</b> may be directly used to directly form the embedding parameters. Further, different mappings (which may, for example, be defined by associated mapping tables or logic tables) are possible for determining an embedding parameter from the intermediate result <b>794</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a block diagram of a detector for extracting a watermark from an information representation provided with a watermark. The detector according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is designated by <b>800</b> in its entirety. The detector <b>800</b> is, for example, implemented to receive an information representation <b>810</b> provided with a watermark and to provide at least one watermark contained in the information representation <b>810</b>. In some embodiments, the detector <b>800</b> may be implemented, however, to provide information on a plurality of watermarks contained in the information representation <b>810</b>. For example, the detector <b>800</b> may be implemented to provide information <b>820</b> on a first watermark and to provide information <b>822</b> on a second watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The detector <b>800</b> includes, for example, a watermark information detector <b>830</b> which is implemented to receive the information representation <b>810</b> provided with the watermark and to provide, based thereupon, information on watermark information contained in the information representation <b>810</b>. For example, the watermark information detector <b>830</b> may comprise the same basic functionality as the watermark information detector <b>730</b> of the embedder <b>700</b>. Apart from that, the watermark information detector <b>830</b> may, for example, correspond to the detection information detector <b>220</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Thus, the watermark information detector <b>830</b> may, for example, be implemented to provide information <b>832</b> on the reusable watermark information. Further, the watermark information detector <b>830</b> may be implemented to provide additional information <b>834</b>, for example corresponding to the additional information <b>734</b>, based on the information representation <b>810</b> provided with at least one watermark. Further, the watermark information detector <b>830</b> may be implemented to provide, based on the information representation <b>810</b>, information <b>836</b> on embedding parameters basically corresponding to the information <b>736</b>, for example. Alternatively or additionally, the watermark information detector <b>830</b>, based on the information representation <b>810</b>, may provide information <b>838</b> on a number of watermarks embedded in the information representation <b>810</b>. In this respect it is to be noted that it is, for example, sufficient for the watermark information detector to provide one of the mentioned pieces of information <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b>. However, there are embodiments in which the watermark information detector provides all mentioned information, wherein in this case an especially powerful overall system results.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The detector <b>800</b> further includes a watermark extractor <b>840</b> which is implemented to receive the information representation <b>810</b> provided with a watermark. The watermark extractor <b>840</b> may further be implemented, for example, to receive information <b>832</b> on reusable watermark information, as far as such information is provided by the watermark information detector <b>830</b>. Further, the watermark extractor is, for example, implemented to receive embedding parameter information <b>852</b> from an embedding parameter determiner <b>850</b>. The watermark extractor <b>840</b> is thus, for example, implemented, based on the information representation <b>810</b> and depending on the information <b>832</b> and the embedding parameters <b>852</b>, to extract at least one watermark and to provide corresponding information <b>820</b> on the extracted watermark. A synchronization of the watermark extractor <b>840</b> may here, for example, take place through the information <b>832</b> on reusable watermark information if the information <b>832</b>, for example, relates to the presence of synchronization information. In this case, for example, the watermark extractor <b>840</b> may be instructed by the information <b>832</b> to extract two different watermarks using the same synchronization information. If only one watermark is to be extracted, for example the evaluation of the information <b>832</b> on reusable watermark information may be rendered unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The embedding parameter determiner <b>850</b> may, for example, be implemented to determine the embedding parameters or detection parameters <b>852</b> based on the information <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b>. The embedding parameter determiner <b>850</b> may, of course, also evaluate only one of the mentioned pieces of information <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b> to determine the embedding parameter <b>852</b>. The embedding parameter determiner <b>850</b> is, for example, implemented to set the embedding parameters <b>852</b> such that a watermark is extracted from the information representation <b>810</b> which is actually contained in the information representation <b>810</b> or the presence of which is indicated by at least one of the pieces of information <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b>. In other words, the embedding parameter determiner <b>852</b> may, for example, be configured to prevent the attempt to extract a watermark from the information representation <b>810</b> which is not contained in the information representation <b>810</b> or the presence of which is not indicated by at least one of the pieces of information <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b>. Thus, the embedding parameter determiner <b>852</b>, based on the information <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b> may control the watermark extractor <b>840</b> to extract the existing watermarks pointedly. Thus, a substantial advantage regarding power or advantage regarding speed may be achieved as compared to arrangements in which the information representation <b>810</b> is searched for any possible watermarks.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The detector <b>800</b> further includes, for example, a sequence control <b>860</b> which is implemented, for example, to control an extraction of several watermarks. The sequence control <b>860</b> may, for example, be configured to terminate a watermark extraction from the information representation <b>810</b> when all watermarks assumed to exist in the information representation <b>810</b> have been identified. If the watermark information detector <b>830</b>, for example, provides information <b>838</b> on a number of watermarks embedded in the information representation, then, for example, the sequence control <b>860</b> may terminate a search for watermarks in the information representation if a number of watermarks has been identified which is the same as the number described by the information <b>838</b>. Although the watermark information detector <b>830</b> may fail when providing the information <b>838</b>, i.e. for example indicates the presence of less watermarks than are actually contained in the information representation <b>810</b>, the information <b>838</b> may still in many cases be regarded as a reliable termination criterion for terminating a search for further watermarks. By a corresponding sequence control terminating the search for watermarks depending on the information <b>838</b>, apart from that an unnecessary and futile search for further watermarks may be avoided if, for example, all watermarks have already been extracted by the watermark extractor <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">It may be gathered from the above description that the detector <b>800</b> offers substantial advantages as compared to conventional detectors. By employing reusable watermark information, a watermark extraction may be accelerated. By employing the information provided by the watermark information detector <b>830</b>, apart from that the search for embedded watermarks may take place in a very systematic way, so that, for example, only actually existing watermarks are extracted, and a futile search for non-existing watermarks is not necessitated.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Further advantages may, for example (optionally), be achieved when the embedding parameter determiner <b>850</b> is implemented to determine one or several embedding parameters using a one-way function. Here, for example, the initial value may be given, and the information <b>838</b> on the number of embedded watermarks may be used in order to decide how often the one-way function is to be applied to the initial value. If the information <b>838</b> indicates, for example, that three watermarks are contained in the information representation <b>810</b>, the one-way function may, for example, be applied to the initial value once to obtain the extraction parameters for the extraction of the first watermark. Extraction parameters for the extraction of the second watermark are, for example, obtained by applying the one-way function again to the value which was obtained by the first application of the one-way function to the initial value. Thus, for example, a detection parameter for the extraction of a subsequent watermark may be derived from the detection parameters for the extraction of a preceding watermark, which leads to an especially efficient realization of a mechanism for determining the detection parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Apart from that, it is to be noted that the terms embedding parameter and detection parameter may be basically used synonymously regarding the detection of a watermark. If, for example, embedding parameters are known, using which a watermark was embedded into an information representation or into an information signal, in many cases it may be assumed that thus also detection parameters are known, using which the watermark may be detected or extracted again. Determining or detecting of extraction parameters or detection parameters thus in many cases corresponds to the determination of embedding parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a block diagram of an embedder for embedding a watermark into an audio signal. The embedder according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is designated by <b>900</b> in its entirety. The embedder <b>900</b> is implemented to embed watermark information, i.e. for example a useful signal which is to be embedded into a watermark, via a data input <b>910</b>. The embedder <b>900</b> further includes a data stream generator <b>920</b> which is implemented to receive the watermark useful information from the data input <b>910</b> and to generate, based thereupon, a parallel data stream, for example including m bits. The data stream generator <b>920</b> is, for example, implemented to apply a forward error correction (FEC) to the watermark useful information from the data input <b>910</b>, to obtain an error-protected data stream representing the watermark useful information. Further, the data stream generator <b>920</b> is, for example, implemented to apply a time interleaving to the error-protected data stream to thus obtain a time-interleaved data stream. The time-interleaved data stream is less prone to certain errors (e.g. bundling errors) than the mere error-protected data stream. Further, the data stream generator <b>920</b> is, for example, implemented to spread the interleaved data stream with a first spread code (spread code C). For example, the data stream generator <b>920</b> may be implemented to generate a plurality of bits from one bit of the time-interleaved data stream by applying a spread code. Thus, from the watermark useful information from the data input <b>910</b> a once spread data stream results, as is, for example, known from telecommunications. In summary it may be noted that the once spread data stream, by applying a forward error correction (FEC), by applying time interleaving and by applying a first spread procedure using spread code C, results from the watermark useful information from the data input <b>910</b>. The individual bits of the once spread data stream are then divided into a parallel data stream, for example including m parallel data streams having associated bits (bit <b>1</b>, bit <b>2</b>, . . . , bit m&#x2212;1, bit m). The mentioned bits are, for example, designated by <b>922</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>922</b><sub>m</sub>. Each of the parallel bits <b>922</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>922</b><sub>m </sub>is then subjected to spreading. The corresponding spreading takes place in respective spreaders <b>930</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>930</b><sub>m</sub>. In one of the spreaders <b>930</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>930</b><sub>m</sub>, for example, depending on the value of the associated bit <b>922</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>922</b><sub>m</sub>, a first sequence (sequence <b>1</b>) or a second sequence (sequence <b>2</b>) is selected. The first sequence and the second sequence may, for example, be complementary to each other. The sequences may, for example, be a spread sequence M and the inverse of the spread sequence M. Thus, for example, each bit <b>922</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>922</b><sub>m </sub>is spread by the associated spreader <b>930</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>930</b><sub>m </sub>so that, for example, m spread bit sequences <b>932</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>932</b><sub>m </sub>result. The spread bit sequences <b>932</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>932</b><sub>m </sub>are then supplied to respective level setters <b>940</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>940</b><sub>m </sub>so that corresponding level-controlled and spread bit sequences <b>942</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>942</b><sub>m </sub>result. In one embodiment, a level of each level-controlled, spread bit sequence <b>941</b><sub>i </sub>is individually settable as compared to the level of the associated non-level-controlled spread bit sequence <b>932</b><sub>i </sub>(i=1, . . . , n). However, a level setting may also take place for a group of spread bit sequences together.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The embedder <b>900</b> further includes a synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> which may, for example be implemented to execute an inverse Fourier transformation. The synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> is, for example, configured to receive the level-controlled and spread bits <b>942</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>942</b><sub>m</sub>. Further, the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> may additionally be implemented to receive one or several (e.g. level-controlled) synchronization frequencies. The synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> is thus, for example, implemented to receive the level-controlled bit sequences <b>942</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>942</b><sub>m </sub>and the level-controlled synchronization bit sequences, for example as frequency range input signals and, based thereupon, for example by forming an inverse Fourier transformation, generate a corresponding time signal <b>952</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The embedder <b>900</b> further includes a summator <b>960</b> which is, for example, implemented to add the output signal <b>952</b> of the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> to a main audio signal <b>962</b> to obtain an audio signal or sum audio signal <b>964</b> provided with a watermark (according to the watermark useful information).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The embedder <b>900</b> further includes, for example, a psychoacoustic control unit <b>970</b>. The psychoacoustic control unit <b>970</b> is, for example, implemented to receive the main audio signal <b>962</b> and to generate level control signals <b>972</b> for the level setters <b>940</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>940</b><sub>m</sub>. For this purpose, the psychoacoustic unit <b>970</b> may, for example, process the main audio signal <b>962</b> to determine masking thresholds in the main audio signal. In other words, the psychoacoustic unit <b>970</b> may, for example, determine according to a psychoacoustic model how loud a signal (e.g. the output signal <b>952</b> of the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b>) added to the main audio signal <b>962</b> may be in different frequency bands, so that no substantial interference results in the sum audio signal <b>964</b>. The psychoacoustic unit <b>970</b> is thus, for example, implemented to set the level setter <b>940</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>940</b><sub>m </sub>such that an interference of a hearing impression in the sum audio signal <b>964</b> by the output signal <b>952</b> of the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> does not exceed a certain boundary. In other words, the output signal <b>952</b> of the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> ought to be embedded into the main audio signal <b>962</b> so that the signal <b>952</b> only slightly impairs a hearing impression caused by the sum audio signal <b>964</b> as compared to a hearing impression caused by the main audio signal <b>962</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The embedder <b>900</b> further includes, for example, a synchronization sequence generator <b>980</b> which is implemented to generate one or several bit sequences, for example serving for a synchronization in a watermark extraction from the sum signal <b>964</b>. The synchronization sequence generator <b>980</b> thus generates one or several synchronization sequences <b>982</b> which are, for example, in a level setter <b>990</b>, subjected to a level setting (for example controlled by the psychoacoustic unit <b>970</b>). Thus, level-controlled synchronization sequences result which, as explained above, may be supplied to the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The embedder <b>900</b>, as already indicated above, may be improved in different ways. For example, the synchronization sequence generator may be controlled depending on whether a synchronization sequence is already present in the main audio signal <b>962</b>. In other words, the main audio signal <b>962</b> corresponds, for example, to the input information representation <b>110</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the input information representation <b>310</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>c</i>, the input information representation <b>510</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> or the input information representation <b>710</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>. If the embedder <b>900</b> is thus provided with a corresponding watermark information detector which is implemented to identify a synchronization signal present in the main audio signal <b>962</b>, the synchronization sequence generator <b>980</b> may, for example, be activated or deactivated depending on the presence of a synchronization signal in the main audio signal <b>962</b>. If, in the main audio signal <b>962</b>, a synchronization sequence already exists, no additional synchronization sequence has to be embedded into the audio signal. Further, apart from that, also the generation of the bit streams (e.g. the bit streams <b>922</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>922</b><sub>m </sub>and the bit streams derived therefrom) may be synchronized with the synchronization signal detected in the main audio signal <b>962</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Further, parameters of the embedder <b>900</b>, for example the used spread sequences or the frequency bands used for the generation of the signal <b>952</b>, may be set depending on information describing a watermark contained in the main audio signal <b>962</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Apart from that, the selection of these parameters used by the embedder <b>900</b> may be done using an embedding parameter, as was explained, for example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Regarding details as to how spreading a signal using different spread codes may be achieved, reference is, for example, made to the textbook &#x201c;Digital Communication&#x201d; by J.

Also adding a forward error correction and time interleaving are described in the above-mentioned book and further in the conventional textbooks on telecommunications. Also the realization of a synthesis filter bank, for example executing an inverse Fourier transformation or a similar transformation, may be gathered from the telecommunication textbooks.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a block diagram of a watermark detector according to one embodiment of the invention. The watermark detector according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> designated by <b>1000</b> in its entirety. The watermark detector <b>1000</b> is implemented to receive an audio signal provided with at least one watermark at a signal input <b>1010</b> and to form, based thereupon, a watermark useful information <b>1020</b>. The detector <b>1000</b> includes an analysis filter bank <b>1030</b> which is implemented to receive the audio signal provided with the watermark and divide the same into individual spectral bands. For example, the analysis filter bank <b>1030</b> may be implemented to execute a Fourier transformation or a fast Fourier transformation. At an output of the analysis filter bank, thus, for example, individual signals for a plurality of bands are applied, some of which serve as useful signal frequency band signals <b>1032</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1032</b><sub>m </sub>and some of which serve as synchronization frequency band signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>n</sub>. The detector <b>1000</b> further includes a plurality of, for example, m despreaders and normalizers <b>1040</b><sub>i</sub>. An i-th despreader and normalizer <b>1040</b><sub>i </sub>may, for example be implemented to correlate an associated useful signal frequency band signal <b>1034</b> to a detection spread code (in general: a detection code or extraction code) to thus reverse the spreading by the spreader <b>930</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>930</b><sub>m</sub>. By the correlation with the corresponding spread code, or detection code or extraction code, for example one bit may be detected. The detection of the bit may, apart from that, also include normalizing, for example to reverse the level setting in the embedder-side level setters <b>940</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>940</b><sub>m</sub>. At the outputs of the despreaders and normalizers <b>1040</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1040</b><sub>m</sub>, for example bit information <b>1042</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1042</b><sub>m </sub>may be applied, for example carrying bit information normalized and despread by the despreader and normalizer <b>1040</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1040</b><sub>m</sub>. The detector <b>1000</b> further includes a watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b>, for example implemented to receive the bit signals <b>1042</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1042</b><sub>m </sub>and to recover based thereupon the watermark useful information <b>1020</b>. The watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b> may, for example, comprise a despreader which is, for example, implemented to reverse the spreading (Spreizen-C; spreading C) executed in the bit stream generator <b>920</b> of the watermark embedder <b>900</b>. The watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b> may further comprise, for example, a de-interleaver which is implemented to reverse the time interleaving of bits executed in the bit stream generator <b>920</b>. Further, the watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b>, for example, includes an error corrector, or a forward error correction, which is implemented to use the error correction information added by the bit stream generator <b>920</b> to thus obtain the watermark useful information <b>1020</b> based on the bit signals <b>1042</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1042</b><sub>m</sub>, so that in the watermark useful information <b>1020</b> the effects of bit errors in the bit signals <b>1042</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1042</b><sub>m </sub>are reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The decoder <b>1000</b> further includes a synchronizer <b>1080</b> which is implemented to receive the synchronization signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>n</sub>. The synchronizer includes, for example, one or several synchronization correlators <b>1082</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1082</b><sub>n</sub>, wherein the synchronization correlators <b>1082</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1082</b><sub>n </sub>are implemented to receive respective synchronization signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>n </sub>and correlate the same with a predetermined synchronization signal detection code. Thus, the synchronization correlators <b>1082</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1082</b><sub>n </sub>may detect the presence of a synchronization mark in the synchronization signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>n</sub>. The synchronization unit <b>1080</b> further includes, for example, a post-processing <b>1084</b> which is, for example, implemented to receive, from the synchronization correlators <b>1082</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1082</b><sub>n</sub>, information on whether a correlation between the synchronization signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>n </sub>and predetermined synchronization codes reaches or exceeds a threshold value to provide, based on the information provided by the synchronization correlators <b>1082</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1082</b><sub>n</sub>, an extracted synchronization signal <b>1086</b> which indicates a position, regarding which a synchronization mark occurs in the synchronization signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The extracted synchronization signal <b>1086</b> is then, for example, supplied to the despreaders and normalizers <b>1040</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1040</b><sub>m </sub>to synchronize the function of the despreaders and normalizers <b>1040</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1040</b><sub>m </sub>with the synchronization information contained in the input signal <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The decoder <b>1000</b> may be expanded in many ways to achieve one or several of the above-described additional functionalities. For example, the decoder <b>1000</b> may be supplemented by a detector which is implemented to identify reusable information in the input signal <b>1010</b> and to provide the reusable identification for an extraction of several watermarks. If the detector, for example, detects for the reusable information that in the input signal <b>1010</b> synchronization information is contained which may be used for a detection or extraction of several watermarks, the detector may provide the corresponding information (e.g. the corresponding synchronization information) for the detection of several watermarks. In this case, for example, a first set of despreaders and normalizers may receive the reusable information (e.g. synchronization information) to extract a first watermark. A second set of despreaders and normalizers may receive the reusable information to extract a second watermark. The first set of despreaders and normalizers is, for example, configured to detect a watermark which is embedded according to a first embedding method or according to a first embedding code into the input information <b>1010</b>. The second set of despreaders and normalizers may further, for example, be implemented to extract from the input information <b>1010</b> a watermark which, according to a second embedding method or using a second embedding code, is embedded into the input information <b>1010</b>. Thus, the reusable information may again be used and a one-time detection of the synchronization information for a detection of several different watermarks is sufficient (e.g. embedded using different embedding methods or using different embedding codes).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Further, in the decoder <b>1000</b> different advantageous concepts may be used to set extraction parameters used for the extraction of a watermark. For example, the detector <b>1000</b> may include a watermark information detector, for example corresponding to the watermark information detector <b>830</b> of the detector <b>800</b>. Further, the detector <b>1000</b> may, for example, comprise an embedding parameter determiner, for example basically corresponding to the embedding parameter determiner <b>850</b> of the detector <b>800</b>. Apart from that, the detector <b>1000</b> may also comprise a sequence control, for example basically corresponding to the sequence control <b>860</b> of the detector <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Thus, it may, for example, be determined by the embedding parameter determiner which detection code is used for despreading the signals <b>1032</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1032</b><sub>m</sub>. Alternatively or additionally, it may, for example, be determined by the embedding parameter determiner which detection code is used for despreading the signals <b>1042</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1042</b><sub>m </sub>in the watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b>. Alternatively or additionally, it may also be determined by the embedding parameter determiner which length the corresponding detection codes for despreading the corresponding signals comprise. Apart from that, also information regarding how the time interleaving in the watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b> may be reversed may be determined by the embedding parameter determiner. Apart from that, by the embedding parameter determiner also different detection methods for different watermarks may be determined. Apart from that, the embedding parameter determiner may, for example, also provide information on which frequency bands are to be used for the extraction of the watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the following, briefly some details regarding an overall system consisting of the embedder <b>900</b> and the detector <b>1000</b> are described. At the input of the embedder <b>900</b>, for example, PCM-encoded audio signals or audio signals encoded according to a pulse code modulation are applied. This audio signal (for example the main audio signal <b>962</b>) is analyzed using a psychoacoustic method, for example by the psychoacoustic unit <b>970</b>. The psychoacoustic method, for example, guarantees inaudibility of the watermark to be embedded or sees to it that the watermark to be embedded is only perceived very weakly. Data to be transmitted, for example applied to the data input <b>910</b>, are added to the original audio signal (or the main audio signal <b>962</b>). The embedder <b>900</b> is, for example, not exclusively targeted to offline signal processing, i.e. for broadcasting applications also a real-time embedding may take place. Only by internal block processing a certain delay may, for example, be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The input signal at the input <b>1010</b> of the extractor may, for example, be recorded by a microphone. This microphone of the extractor may, for example, comprise a frequency response from 10 Hz to 10 kHz (typically with a frequency response of +/&#x2212;5 dB). As a suitable sampling rate, 24 kHz may, for example, be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the following, a basic functioning of the embedder <b>900</b> or the extractor <b>1000</b> is described. A useful band for watermark transmission is, for example, delimited by the microphone of the extractor to a frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. A lower boundary frequency of the useful band is, for example, designated by fmin. An upper boundary frequency is, for example, designated by fmax. In some embodiments, the following applies: fmin&#x3c;100 Hz and fmax&#x3e;10 kHz. A frequency band from 0 to fmax is, for example, divided into M subbands of equal width, and in these subbands watermark partial signals are transmitted. A subband having the number k for example extends from (k&#x2212;1)*fmax/M to k*fmax/M, with k=1, 2, . . . , M. Due to an attenuation of the microphone at low frequencies, for example the subband having the number 1 (k=1) is not used for data transmission. A watermark may thus consist of M&#x2212;1 subband signals. These subband signals are converted into the individual subbands by means of a synthesis filter bank. A sampling rate of these subband signals at an input of the synthesis filter bank, for example designated by fs<b>1</b>, is a fraction of a sampling rate at the output (fs<b>1</b>:=24/K kHz, K being an integer number).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As in one embodiment, in the watermark extractor <b>1000</b>, the subband signals (i.e., e.g., the signals <b>1032</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1032</b><sub>m </sub>or <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>m</sub>) are further processed at a sampling rate fs<b>1</b>, with regard to a favorable realization of the watermark extractor it may be sensible to select fs<b>1</b> to be as small as possible. A bandwidth of the subbands may, for example, be fmax/M, wherein fmax may, for example, be smaller than 10 kHz. According to the sampling theorem, for example the condition fs<b>1</b>&#x2267;2 fmax/M has to be fulfilled. Thus, for example for a quotient 24 kHz/fs<b>1</b> of the two sampling rates, the following applies:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>24 kHz/<i>fs</i>1<i>&#x2267;M*</i>12 kHz/<i>f</i>max.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">An efficient implementation of the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> is, for example, possible when the quotient 24 kHz/fs<b>1</b> is an integer multiple of M. As fmax=12 kHz is not an option, for example fmax=6 kHz is selected. Apart from that, M=16 is set, for example. A bandwidth of one single subband is thus 375 Hz, and from the request for a minimum sampling rate for example fs<b>1</b>=750 Hz results.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The M&#x2212;1 subband signals (for example the signals <b>942</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>942</b><sub>m</sub>) together with the signals provided by the synchronization generator <b>980</b> and the level setter <b>990</b> contain, for example, encoded information (for example the useful information of the watermark) and known training symbols which may, for example, be used on a receiver side, i.e., for example, in the watermark extractor, for synchronization. In one embodiment, in every subband data symbols may be transmitted with synchronization symbols in a time multiplexing. In another embodiment, however, data symbols and synchronization symbols are transmitted in separate subbands. There are thus r synchronization signals (e.g. with r=3) and M&#x2212;1&#x2212;r data signals. The corresponding subbands are thus also referred to as data channels or synchronization channels.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">An output signal of the synthesis filter bank <b>950</b> is, for example, the actual watermark (including synchronization information and watermark useful information), added to the audio signal (e.g. to the main audio signal <b>962</b>). For the watermark not to be audible, for example the individual subband signals (for example the signals <b>932</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>932</b><sub>m </sub>or <b>982</b>) may still be changed in the amplitude (i.e., e.g., decreased). This time-variable weighting (for example by the level setters <b>940</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>940</b><sub>m </sub>or <b>980</b>) depends, for example, on the respective audio signal (e.g. on the main audio signal <b>962</b>) and on the psychoacoustic perception of a person. In this connection, reference is made to psychoacoustic weighting.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows, for example, the basic setup of the watermark embedder. The encoded bits (<b>0</b> and <b>1</b>) (for example represented by the bit signals <b>922</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>922</b><sub>m</sub>) are represented, for example, by two orthogonal spread sequences of the length Spreizen-M (spreading-M) (e.g. spreading-M=32). These spread sequences consist, for example, of the symbols +1 or &#x2212;1. Thus, the subband data signals before a psychoacoustic weighting (PAW) are BPSK signals (each with a power of 1). Also the synchronization signals before the psychoacoustic weighting are, for example, BPSK signals (each power 1).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In the following, briefly the mechanisms each regarding the forward error correction (FEC), the spreading (spreading-M) and the synchronization frequencies are described. For details, reference is made to the textbook &#x201c;Digital Communications&#x201d; by J. G. Proakis (3<sup>rd </sup>Edition, Mc Graw-Hill, New York, 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The bit stream generator <b>920</b> consists, for example, of three parts, or implements three processing steps:</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">1. convolution encoder or turbo encoder having the code rate R</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">2. spreading by the factor Spreizen C (spreading-C)</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">3. time interleaver (interleaver).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The encoder (convolution encoder or turbo encoder) for example generates n&#x3e;k encoded bits from k information bits. A code rate is, for example, defined as a quotient R=k/n. If, for example, the case k=1 is considered, it is assumed that 1&#x3c;n&#x2266;5 applies.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Lower code rates may, for example, be generated by a spreading of the encoded bits with a bit sequence of the length spreading-C. Here, for example, each code bit of the value 1 is replaced by the bit sequence sc[k], and each code bit of the value 0 is replaced by the negated bit sequence sc<sub>not</sub>[k] (k=0, 1, . . . , spreading-C&#x2212;1). An effective code rate is then, for example, R/spreading-C. For example, for R=1/3 and spreading-C=12 an effective code rate of 1/36 results. In this number example, an information bit is represented by 36 code bits. By the interleaver, the sequence of the code bits is changed in a defined way. Using an inverse operation, the reversal of the interleaving (de-interleaver), the bits in the receiver (watermark extractor) are again brought into the correct order.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In the following, briefly the spreading &#x201c;Spreizen-M&#x201d; (spreading-M) is described. In one embodiment, the encoded bits (<b>0</b> or <b>1</b>) coming from the bit stream generator <b>920</b> or from the forward error correction (FEC) are represented by two orthogonal spread sequences of the length spreading-M (e.g. spreading-M=32). These spread sequences consist of the symbols +1 or &#x2212;1. Thus, for example the subband data signals before the psychoacoustic weighting are BPSK signals (each with the power of 1).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">For example, s0[k] or s1[k] (k=0, 1, . . . , spreading-M&#x2212;1) are the spread sequences represented by a zero or a one, respectively. Orthogonality here means that the inner product &#x3c;s0, s1&#x3e;=0.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the following, some more details regarding the synchronization sequences are described, as they are provided by the synchronization sequence generator <b>980</b>, and as they are, for example, evaluated by the synchronization unit <b>1080</b>. For a decoding of the data on the receiver side (for example in the watermark extractor) it is, for example, advantageous when points in times are known at which a code word beings. These points in time may, for example, be determined by a transmission of known sequences and by a correlation to these sequences in the receiver. These sequences are, for example, transmitted on the synchronization channels. Here, for example, the following procedure may be chosen:</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">A sequence p[k] (k=0, 1, . . . , L&#x2212;1) is generated by L BPSK symbols with good autocorrelation characteristics. By a periodic repetition of p[k], it results for the signal u[n]:=p[n modulo L] (n=0, 1, . . . ). In the embodiment, on all synchronization channels the same signal u[n] is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In the following, briefly some details regarding the psychoacoustic weighting are described. It is, for example, enabled by a spread band modulation to reduce the average signal power by spectral spreading. Additionally the data signal is evaluated and modified according to psychoacoustic principles. Thereby, for example, the inaudibility of the signal added to the original audio signal <b>962</b> is guaranteed. This inaudibility of the watermark information in the combined audio signal <b>964</b> is, for example, guaranteed by the use of the level setters <b>940</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>940</b><sub>m </sub>and <b>990</b> under the control of the psychoacoustic unit <b>970</b>, as already explained briefly above. A detailed description is omitted here, as the same is not essential for understanding the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In the following, some details regarding the watermark detector or watermark extractor <b>1000</b> are described. The watermark-including audio signal, for example generated by the embedder <b>900</b>, may, for example, be distributed conventionally via existing transmission channels (e.g. via broadcasting or also via the internet) and is, for example, finally supplied to the watermark detector or watermark extractor <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">An input signal at the input <b>1010</b> of the detector <b>1000</b> includes, for example, a sum signal transmitted via the audio channel (for example the combined audio signal <b>964</b>) including an audio signal and a watermark.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">By the analysis filter bank <b>1030</b> the input signal is, for example, divided by the input <b>1010</b> into M subband signals at a sampling rate of, for example, 12/M kHz. The signals in the unused subbands (e.g. subbands Nos. <b>17</b>-<b>32</b>) are, for example, not calculated. The subband signal No. <b>1</b> is, for example, calculated but not evaluated, however, as it does not carry any information. The remaining M&#x2212;1 subband signals, for example, are divided into M&#x2212;1&#x2212;r data signals, for example, and r synchronization signals and subsequently further processed.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">From the synchronization signals (for example from the signals <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>m</sub>) points in time are determined, for example, by means of correlation, at which the data signals (for example the signals <b>1032</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1032</b><sub>m</sub>) are despread (Entspreizen-M; despreading-M).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Output signals of the blocks <b>1040</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1040</b><sub>m </sub>designated by despreading-M are, for example, logarithmic likelihood ratios (LLR), i.e. soft bits. A positive logarithmic likelihood ratio (LLR) indicates one bit is a logical one, and a negative logarithmic likelihood ratio (LLR) indicates, for example, that this is a logical zero. The higher the amount of a logarithmic likelihood ratio, for example, the more reliable the value.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The logarithmic likelihood ratios are, for example, further processed in the watermark recovery unit <b>1050</b> or in a forward error correction (FEC).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In the following, reference is briefly made to the characteristics of the received subband signals (for example the signals <b>1032</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1032</b><sub>m </sub>and <b>1034</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>1034</b><sub>m</sub>). Here, x<sub>k</sub>[n] (k=1, 2, . . . , M) are the subband signals in the watermark embedder after spreading (spreading-M) and before psychoacoustic weighting. y<sub>k</sub>[n] (k=1, 2, . . . , M) are the output signals of the analysis filter bank. The signals x<sub>k</sub>[n] are interfered with by three effects:

<p id="p-0177" num="0179">Here, c<sub>k</sub>[n] is a (time-dependent) channel coefficient and r<sub>k</sub>[n] is additive noise.

<p id="p-0178" num="0180">A useful signal from the point of view of telecommunications is, for example, the signal x<sub>k</sub>[n&#x2212;D]. The rest are noise-type interferences.

a sequence sc1[k] only consisting of the numbers 1 and &#x2212;1 is generated. Here, for example, the number sc[k]=0 is mapped into the number sc1[k]=&#x2212;1, and the number sc[k]=1 is mapped into the number sc1[k]=1. Using the spread sequence sc1[k] for example, the logarithmic likelihood ratios are despread analog to the procedure described with reference to despreading-M.

<p id="p-0201" num="0206">The logarithmic likelihood ratios after despreading-M and despreading-C, for example with the code rate R (e.g. R=1/3) represent encoded information bits. The forward error correction decoder provides back, for example, at its output the decoded information bits. To decode the information bits with an error likelihood which is as low as possible, it is desirable for the ratio Eb/N0 to be sufficiently high. Here, Eb designates an energy per information bit and N0 a one-sided noise power density. The following applies, for example:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Eb/N</i>0<i>/dB=C/N/dB+</i>10*log 10(Spreizen-<i>M</i>*Spreizen-<i>C/R</i>).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<p id="p-0202" num="0207">Here, C/N is an average signal/noise ratio across all data channels at an output of the analysis filter bank <b>1030</b>, i.e. before despreading-M. The second addend is, for example, the sum of the spreading gain (spreading-M) and the encoding gain (Spreizen-C/R; spreading-C/R). For example, for spreading-M=32, spreading-C=12 and R=1/3, the value of Eb/N0 is above C/N by 30.6 dB.</p>

<p id="p-0204" num="0211">For the turbo decoder the same boundary values apply.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0212">If, for example, a reserve of 2-3 dB is added to the above-mentioned values of Eb/N0 to compensate interfering noise, there is, for example, a request for Eb/N0 to be 5 dB, for example. Referring to the above-mentioned number values for spreading-M, spreading-C and R, for example C/N before despreading-M may be &#x2212;25 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0213">It may be seen from the above-mentioned description that, in particular by spreading the watermark useful data in embedding and by despreading the watermark useful data in decoding, it may be achieved that the watermark information is, for example, embedded in an audio signal such that the audio signal, by the embedding of the watermark useful information, is only changed in an inaudible or only slightly audible way. By the use of different spread codes it may further be enabled to embed different watermarks into the same audio signal (or into another information representation). A reliable decoding or extraction of the watermark necessitates, however, on the side of the decoder or extractor, the despreading (both despreading-M and also despreading-C) to take place using suitable spread codes which are adapted at the embedder-side spread codes or which correspond to the embedder-side spread codes. With reference to the consideration above, it is obvious that the above-described mechanisms for setting extraction parameters, which are, for example, suitable for the selection of spread codes used for the extraction, may be used advantageously to enable despreading.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0214">In the following, some aspects of the present invention are summarized. The concept described within the scope of the present description may, for example, be used for watermark embedding into carrier data and for the extraction, for example, of embedded watermark data.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0215">In conventional watermark embedding, the watermark embedding takes place, for example, without examining a carrier signal (e.g. an audio signal or an image signal) with respect to existing watermarks. In some embodiments, a watermark has the characteristic of being able to contain several independent watermarks without an influence occurring. Further, it is desirable in some conventional concepts for a detector to know about the embedding information of the different embedders.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0216">If it is desired for a repeated embedding of watermarks to be possible, special requirements exist. For example, each further inserted watermark may not make already existing watermarks unusable. Further, a detector, or watermark detector, has to be able to differentiate the watermarks of different embedders.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0217">From the relevant expert publications, different watermark methods are known. The following watermark methods, for example, can be used in conventional embedders or extractors and also in the inventive embedders or extractors:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">

        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0222">phase modification.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0223">In conventional methods, several disadvantages can arise. For example, conventionally, every embedder adds information (or watermark information) independently to an information representation (for example to an audio signal). Hence, conventionally, a detector or watermark detector has to perform the complete detection method for every embedder. Further, conventionally, a detector needs to have exact information on the embedder that enables him to detect the watermark. For example, when using a spread band method, a conventional detector needs the spread sequence used by the embedder.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0224">Hence, in a conventional detector, a detection complexity and memory requirements increase with each watermark since a conventional detector attempts, for example, one extraction for every possible embedder. Hence, conventionally, it is not possible that a number of possible embedders is, for example, unlimited (which does not necessarily mean that an unlimited number of watermarks can exist in a carrier signal). Therefore, conventionally, the embedders are frequently limited. If the number of possible embedders is very high, conventionally, all embedders will have to be sought for, even when finally only one watermark is contained (for example in the examined information representation).</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0225">Subsequently added embedders are, for example, not known to a conventional extractor and, for example, an update of the detectors is needed when an embedder is subsequently added.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0226">In the following, several aspects of the present invention will be summarized. According to several embodiments of the invention, the detector or watermark detector can share all information and detection methods necessitated for all watermarks as far as possible, which reduces complexity, memory requirements, time requirements, and/or energy requirements. In several embodiments, redundant information does not have to be superimposed in the carrier signal (e.g. the audio signal).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0227">Additionally, in several embodiments, the detector or watermark detector has information on the embedders and can, for example, limit a search for watermarks to the significant detection steps.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0228">In several embodiments, detection information (or detection parameters) can be calculated dynamically by defined derivation steps of the embedder information. Thus, in several embodiments, newly added embedders do not need a subsequent change of the detector information.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0229">In the following, several aspects of different embodiments will be described. The different aspects can be combined within a detector, within an extractor or within an overall system including a detector and an extractor.
<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0230">1. According to one aspect, prior to every embedding process (or at least prior to several embedding processes), a carrier signal (e.g. an audio signal or an image signal or a video signal or a computer program signal, or generally an information representation) is examined for possibly existing watermarks. If an already existing watermark is detected, then, for example, the new watermarks will be inserted, depending on the original watermark, in a manner that enables the detector to use common computing operations for all watermarks. For example, a synchronization sequence (generally: synchronization information) is not re-embedded, but an existing synchronization sequence (or synchronization information) is used and only the actual data (for example the watermark payload data) are embedded (for example synchronously to the existing sequence or synchronization sequence).
    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0231">Hence, for example, an extractor has to search for only a single synchronization sequence (or synchronization information) that is the same (or the only one) for all contained watermarks. At the same time, this synchronization sequence can, for example, be an indication for existing watermarks for subsequent embedders.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0232">2. According to one aspect, embedder information is added with a method that is the same for every embedder. In other words, at least two different embedders use the same method for embedding embedder information. The embedder information can, for example, be generation information. The generation information can describe, for example, a number of previous watermarks. Hence, for example, a first embedder can indicate that it has added the first watermark. A second embedder can indicate, for example, that now two watermarks are contained. According to one aspect, this information (i.e. for example the generation information) can be detected independent of the embedder.</li>
    <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0233">3. According to one aspect, the data (or the watermark payload data or watermark payload information) are now added by the embedder (for example to the carrier signal), so that the watermarks do not (or only slightly) influence each other. For that, different methods can be used. For example, a CDMA method or a code multiplex multiple access method) can be used. In a respective spread method, for example, every embedder (of a plurality of embedders) uses its own spread sequence, which is orthogonal to the sequences or spread sequences of other embedders. The data share, for example (but not necessarily), a common frequency domain and also a common time domain.
    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0234">Alternatively (or additionally), embedding can be performed in time multiplex, frequency multiplex or by using a combination of the same. Since the sequences overlap, for example when using the CDMA method, an overall embedded signal energy will increase with every further watermark. Thereby, for example, the watermark energy can increase to such an extent that detection of the watermark becomes more likely. According to one aspect, every watermark can be embedded in a different frequency band or in a different time slot to avoid an overlay. Here, it is advantageous when every embedder knows what watermarks are already contained, so that no overlay takes place (or only takes place to an acceptable extent). In other words, here, the above-stated generation information is not only helpful for the detector, but for every further embedder.</li>
        <li id="ul0011-0002" num="0235">If multiple embedding of watermarks is to take place, further embedders will start again, for example, at point 1.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0009-0004" num="0236">4. In several embodiments, the detector extracts, similar to every further embedder, the embedder information (that comprises, for example, information on the embedding parameters used by the embedder or the detection parameters to be used by the detector). According to one aspect, a detector can read out the generation information of all embedders in the same manner with the same method or the same spread sequence.
    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0237">Information that can be used for all watermarks (also referred to as reusable information) can, for example, also be obtained from the carrier signal. For example, a synchronization signal valid for all watermarks (or at least for a plurality of watermarks) can be obtained from the carrier signal. Further, based on the embedder information, contained watermarks can be specifically searched for (e.g. by the detector).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li id="ul0009-0005" num="0238">5. Since a conventional detector does not have any information on how many watermarks are contained in the carrier signal, the detector would have to search for all possible embedder information. In order to solve this problem, this number (i.e. the number of possible watermarks) can, for example, be limited in advance. According to one aspect of the invention, however, a certain time slot (or another resource) can be left unoccupied, for example following the synchronization sequence, where every embedder, for example, is allowed to insert generation information.
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0239">According to one aspect, it is advantageous that the embedding method (for several embedders) is the same. For example, every embedder of generation information can use the same synchronization band. Further, for example, every embedder of generation information can use the same spread sequence or the same embedding method. Therefore, for example, an extractor can read out the generation information of all embedders (or at least a plurality of embedders) with the same method (or the same spread sequence) in the same manner without increasing the extraction complexity. Therefore, it is advantageous when the embedding method for the generation information is identical for all embedders.</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0240">Based on the knowledge of the generation information (i.e. the number of watermarks) an extractor knows, for example, exactly how many watermarks it has to search for. A (conventionally frequently occurring) useless search for non-existing watermarks is hence unnecessary.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0241">According to a further aspect, so-called derivation functions can be used for embedder information. Details regarding this will be summarized below. In a spread band method, an embedder embeds this sequence (for example a spread sequence) into the carrier signal. Therefore, it is advantageous that the sequence, or the spread sequence, is known to the detector so that the same can detect the sequence, or spread sequence, existing in the carrier signal and so that the detector can hence extract the watermark information contained in the carrier signal. Therefore, every subsequently added embedder (conventionally) causes an update of the extractors. In other watermark methods, it is also sometimes necessitated that the detector knows certain information from the embedder for detection.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0242">This requirement can, for example, be avoided when the stated information (in this example the spread sequences) is calculated from a fixed data amount (e.g. from an initial value) by means of an appropriate derivation function. A new embedder can, for example, apply the derivation function to the initial value as often as there are already allocated embedders and therefore also spread sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0243">In several cases, the value calculated in this manner (i.e. the value calculated from the initial value by applying the derivation function once or several times) cannot be used directly as a spread sequence. Hence, in a spread sequence, several requirements exist, e.g. with regard to the correlation characteristics and the spectrum. In several embodiments, the value calculated by applying the derivation function to the initial value can also serve as &#x201c;seed&#x201d; for generating the actual spread sequence. In other watermark methods (that, for example, do not use a spread sequence), the value obtained by applying the derivation function to the initial value once or several times can also serve as a base for a respective data modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0244">According to a further aspect, a further characteristic results by using so-called one-way functions for the derivation. Thus, for example, only the hierarchically lower value can be calculated from a derived value. Thereby, for example, access rights can be granted to the extractor. If a detector has knowledge, for example, of the &#x201c;uppermost&#x201d; initial value, it will then be able to extract all watermarks. A detector that knows, for example, only the value that was derivated twice as the initial value, cannot generate the two sequences (lying above) and hence it cannot read out the watermarks of two embedders. If, however, instead of a one-way function a normal derivation function (for example convertible with little computing effort) is used as the derivation function, a direct allocation of access rights will not be possible. However, there is the possibility of being able to obtain the sequence of an almost arbitrary amount of embedding parameter values or detection parameter values.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0245">In the following, several improvements and advantages in relation to the prior art will be described, which can be obtained according to several embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0246">According to several embodiments described within the scope of the present invention, it is possible to embed several watermarks into a carrier signal or to read out several watermarks from a carrier signal. Thereby, for example, detection complexity can be reduced or minimized with respect to independent detection. According to several embodiments of the invention, memory requirements and/or energy requirements in a detection of watermarks are reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0247">In several embodiments of the invention it is possible to embed several watermarks into a carrier signal and to read them out in such a manner that only the watermarks are read out that are actually contained or that are free to be accessed. In several embodiments, useless detection efforts can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0248">In several embodiments, a detector does not have to know all embedder information necessitated for detection. Rather, in several embodiments, subsequently added embedders can be detected without having to update the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0249">Further, in several embodiments, a detector (or even every detector) can implicitly obtain access rights for these watermarks.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0250">In the following, a further embodiment of the invention will be described. First, the embedding will be described. According to an embodiment, the embedder searches, for example, for existing watermarks in the carrier signal by searching for a synchronization sequence. Since the embedder (for example in the first embedding of a watermark into a carrier signal) is the first embedder, no such sequence is found. Therefore, the embedder, or the first embedder, inserts the synchronization sequence. Additionally, the embedder, or first embedder, can signalize that it is the first embedder. Thereby, the first embedder can also add the data (for example the signalization data indicating that it is the first embedder) (for example to the carrier signal). For example, the first embedder can add the data in an unoccupied time slot after the synchronization sequence or in a separate band in parallel to the synchronization sequence. In one embodiment, the data are added in parallel to the synchronization sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0251">In the following, a possible procedure in performing further embeddings is described. In this case, the embedder can again, for example, search for the known synchronization sequence. The known synchronization sequence can, moreover, be considered as an indication of the existence of watermarks. If the embedder finds the known synchronization sequence (for example during a further embedding), it can add, for example after signalizing the first embedder, information indicating that it is the second embedder. The respective data can again be added in parallel to the synchronization sequence. Further, the data can also be added to the carrier signal in a different manner, e.g. in a time slot following the synchronization sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0252">In the following, an exemplary procedure for detection will be described. A detector can search, for example, for the embedder information and finds (for example after the above-described embeddings) the synchronization signal and the signalizations from the first and second embedders. Hence, the detector derives, for example, the extraction parameters necessitated for detecting the watermark. Further, the detector extracts, for example, exactly these two watermark data. Since, for example, both watermarks (i.e. for example the watermark embedded by the first embedder and the watermark embedded by the further, or second, embedder) are based on the same synchronization signal, the synchronization is, for example, performed only once for all watermarks. Further, no further watermarks need to be searched for.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0253">In summary, it is to be stated that the present invention according to several aspects provides an apparatus and a method for multiple watermark embedding and watermark extraction. Several embodiments of the invention solve the object to enable multiple watermark embedding into carrier data, or a carrier signal, such that detection with limited complexity or with lower complexity than with conventional arrangements is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0254">The respective concept can be used advantageously, since it is desired or even necessitated for the different cases of application to embed not only one single watermark but several independent watermarks. Moreover, most watermark methods are designed for embedding one watermark, even when the respective method basically allows multiple embedding.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0255">Conventionally, detection complexity and memory requirements increase uniformly with a number of possible watermarks. Further, conventionally, a detector usually has no information on how many and what watermarks actually exist in carrier signals. Hence, it has to attempt, for example, to detect all possible watermarks.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0256">According to one aspect of the embodiments described in the present specification, the carrier signal is examined for possibly existing watermarks prior to every embedding process. If an already existing watermark is detected, the new watermarks will be inserted independent of the original watermark in a manner enabling the detector to use common methods for all watermarks equally.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0257">According to a further aspect of several of the embodiments described herein, embedding of additional information providing both the extractor with information on the original embedders and providing a further embedder with information on every further (or previous) embedding process, can take place. An extraction method for this information can, for example, be independent of the embedder.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0258">According to a further aspect of several of the embodiments described herein, the embedder-dependent information is not selected arbitrarily but derived from each other in a defined manner.</p>
