In an embodiment, a computer system instantiates an anonymous directory that stores data in various client-specific directories for different clients. The anonymous directory is configured to provide data access according to access controls defined and managed by the client. The computer system receives a data request from a user that identifies the user and specifies a portion of data that is to be returned to the user. The computer system determines which of the client's data is to be returned to the user based on the client's specified access controls. The access controls grant access to specified data in some of the client-specific directories, based on the user's identity. The computer system then provides the determined data to the user.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/162,950, filed Jun. 17, 2011, and entitled, &#x201c;CLOUD KEY ESCROW SYSTEM,&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computers have become highly integrated in the workforce, in the home, in mobile devices, and many other places. Computers can process massive amounts of information quickly and efficiently. Software applications designed to run on computer systems allow users to perform a wide variety of functions including business applications, schoolwork, entertainment and more. Software applications are often designed to perform specific tasks, such as word processor applications for drafting documents, or email programs for sending, receiving and organizing email.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some cases, software applications may be designed to interact with other software applications or other computer systems. For example, an application may be designed to store files on a network server. Those files may be stored in one or more directories on the network server. As data storage needs increase, the corresponding directories grow increasingly larger, and may include information that is out-of-date, or is otherwise incorrect. Moreover, customers wishing to share data stored on these directories may only be able to share the data in an all-or-nothing fashion, such that their data is available to all users or to no users.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments described herein are directed to facilitating data transfer using an anonymous directory and to providing attribute-based data access to identified users.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments described herein are directed to facilitating data transfer using an anonymous directory and to providing attribute-based data access to identified users. In one embodiment, a computer system instantiates an anonymous directory that stores data in various client-specific directories for different clients. The anonymous directory is configured to provide data access according to access controls defined and managed by the client. The computer system receives a data request from a user that identifies the user and specifies a portion of data that is to be returned to the user. The computer system determines which of the client's data is to be returned to the user based on the client's specified access controls. The access controls grant access to specified data in some of the client-specific directories, based on the user's identity. The computer system then provides the determined data to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, a computer system receives encrypted data from a client that is to be stored in a client-specific directory. The data is encrypted using multi-authority attribute-based encryption. As such, the client can specify access rights to the encrypted data by allowing identified users to access data with certain specified attributes. The computer system receives a data request from a user, where the data request includes the user's identity and specifies various data attributes. Any data that includes those attributes is to be returned to the user. The computer system determines which portions of data have attributes that match the requested attributes specified by the user. This data is then identified as being allowable to release to the identified user. The computer system then sends to the user those portions of data whose attributes match the requested attributes specified by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following discussion now refers to a number of methods and method acts that may be performed. It should be noted, that although the method acts may be discussed in a certain order or illustrated in a flow chart as occurring in a particular order, no particular ordering is necessarily required unless specifically stated, or required because an act is dependent on another act being completed prior to the act being performed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Embodiments of the present invention may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general-purpose computer including computer hardware, such as, for example, one or more processors and system memory, as discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and/or data structures. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions in the form of data are computer storage media. Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the invention can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: computer storage media and transmission media.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Computer storage media includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM, solid state drives (SSDs) that are based on RAM, Flash memory, phase-change memory (PCM), or other types of memory, or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions, data or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links and/or data switches that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network which can be used to carry data or desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or in the form of data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to computer storage media (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a network interface card or &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and/or to less volatile computer storage media at a computer system. Thus, it should be understood that computer storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Computer-executable (or computer-interpretable) instructions comprise, for example, instructions which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer executable instructions may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the described features or acts described above. Rather, the described features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, message processors, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, mobile telephones, PDAs, pagers, routers, switches, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed system environments where local and remote computer systems that are linked (either by hardwired data links, wireless data links, or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links) through a network, each perform tasks (e.g. cloud computing, cloud services and the like). In a distributed system environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a computer architecture <b>100</b> in which the principles of the present invention may be employed. Computer architecture <b>100</b> includes computer system <b>110</b>. Computer system <b>110</b> may be any type of local or distributed computer system, including a vast system of interconnected computer systems commonly referred to as &#x201c;the cloud&#x201d;. Computer system <b>110</b> may include different modules and systems that are designed to perform specific functions. For instance, the anonymous directory <b>115</b> may be used to store users' information. The anonymous directory may include many different client-specific directories <b>116</b> that correspond to each client. Thus, for example, each of clients <b>105</b> may have their own client-specific directory that stores each client's data <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some cases, the client may want to encrypt their data, so that their data is protected from viewing by other parties. This encrypted data may be stored in the clients' client-specific directories <b>116</b>. The client may, however, in some circumstances, want to make portions of their data (encrypted or otherwise) available to other users. In such cases, the data may be encrypted using multi-authority, attribute-based encryption. This type of encryption allows the encrypted data to be stored with certain attributes <b>107</b> associated therewith. The data may then be accessed using those attributes, along with the requesting user's confirmed identity. This process will be explained in greater detail below with regard to methods <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In view of the systems and architectures described above, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the disclosed subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flow charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. For purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks. However, it should be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>200</b> for facilitating data transfer using an anonymous directory. The method <b>200</b> will now be described with frequent reference to the components and data of environment <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Method <b>200</b> includes an act of instantiating an anonymous directory that stores data in one or more client-specific directories for a plurality of different clients, wherein the anonymous directory is further configured to provide data access according to access controls defined and managed by the client (act <b>210</b>). For example, computer system <b>110</b> may instantiate and manage anonymous directory <b>115</b>. The anonymous directory stores client data <b>106</b> in client-specific directories <b>116</b> for multiple different clients <b>105</b>. The client's data is managed according to access controls defined and managed by the client. Accordingly, using the client-specific access controls <b>117</b>, each client can manage how their data is stored and who is allowed to access their data.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each client's data may be encrypted before being stored in the anonymous directory. The data may be encrypted using multi-authority attribute-based encryption. Such encryption associates attributes <b>107</b> with the encrypted data. In some cases, the clients' data may be accessed by users searching for data with these attributes. The client may specify in their access controls that certain users (e.g. <b>130</b>) may access data with certain attributes. Using multi-authority attribute-based encryption ensures that no single party that can hand out all of the keys to look at the encrypted data. In some cases, each client (e.g. each company) may be an authority. Each client can selectively expose data (e.g. product pricing or details) based on a runtime decision of who the buyer is. Multi-authority attribute-based encryption allows clients to encrypt their data and put their (potentially) sensitive business data in their directory in the computer system (e.g. in the cloud). The data may be encrypted before it is sent up to the cloud, so that the cloud can take ownership of encrypted data. Then off-cloud, the client maintains fine-grained control over the data by providing keys or otherwise allowing third parties to access the data.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For instance, one of clients <b>105</b> may be a merchant selling widgets. User <b>130</b> may be a buyer that wants to buy widgets. The user may not know about the client, but may search for data about widgets. The user may send data request <b>131</b> to the computer system, along with the user's ID (identifying the user as a buyer) and attributes the user is searching for (in this case, widgets). The anonymous directory may then, according to the client's access control policy, allow the user to access those portions of client data that have to do with the widget. Accordingly, the client's data may be safely stored, while still allowing access to interested third parties, according to the client's self-defined access control policies.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The anonymous directory may thus allow data owners to specify which data is presented in a search result. Those search results may be user-specific, such that each user, based on their ID, may receive different search results, even when searching for the same terms or attributes <b>133</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the anonymous directory may allow data owners to specify which data is presented in a search result for different user types. Thus, as above, the search results may be user-type-specific, such that each user type, as indicated in their user ID <b>132</b>, may receive different search results, even when searching for the same terms or attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the anonymous directory allows data owners to dynamically change which data is presented in a given search result. Thus, if a data owner (client <b>105</b>) wanted to allow more or fewer users or user types to access a certain portion of data, the data owner could update their access controls and make the appropriate changes. In some cases, the data owner may convert the data request <b>131</b> received from the user based on the user's identity. The request may be converted into a form that uniquely identifies the user and the requested data and/or attributes. The converted request may be used to provide that user with a specified set of data, as indicated by the client in their access controls.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the data owner uploads their data, the data may be encrypted or unencrypted. As such, any encrypted data may remain invisible to the anonymous directory. The anonymous directory then becomes an intermediary and transmits the client's encrypted data without seeing what it is. In other cases, the data may be unencrypted, and the anonymous directory may be able to see what it is. In either case, the data may be made available to other users, and may appear in other users' searches according to the user's access controls.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Method <b>200</b> includes an act of receiving a data request from a user that identifies the user and specifies a portion of data that is to be returned to the user (act <b>220</b>). For example, computer system <b>110</b> may receive data request <b>131</b> from user <b>130</b>. The data request includes user ID <b>132</b> and one or more attributes <b>133</b> of data that is to be returned to the user. For instance, the user may request a registered salesperson at a jewelry company in Antwerp, Belgium. The request may include these attributes, including &#x201c;registered&#x201d;, &#x201c;salesperson&#x201d;, &#x201c;jewelry company&#x201d; and &#x201c;Antwerp, Belgium&#x201d;. The anonymous directory may search to see whether any clients have uploaded data with attributes that match the above-requested attributes. If such a client has uploaded information and has granted access to such using their access controls, that information is sent to the user (e.g. data <b>126</b>). If the client's data was encrypted using multi-authority attribute-based encryption, the client will have specified access rights to the encrypted data, and will allow identified users to access data that has those specified attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The anonymous directory may also allow discovery of clients' data based on a threshold number of attributes being requested in the user's request. Accordingly, in the above example, if the user had included five attributes in his or her request, and the client had specified in the access controls that the data was to be released if at least three of the attributes were requested, then the threshold would be met and the data would be released. The determining module <b>120</b> may determine which of the client's data is to be returned to the user based on the client's specified access controls (act <b>230</b>). The access controls are customizable and dynamically changeable. The access controls grant access to specified data in one or more client-specific directories, based on the user's identity. The user may be authenticated to verify his or her identity. The anonymous directory may then perform the search using the user's identity and specified data attributes. In some cases, the client may send to the user a set of attributes that the user can search for regarding the client's data. After finding the appropriate data, the data providing module <b>125</b> may provide the requested data <b>126</b> to the user (act <b>240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>300</b> for providing attribute-based data access to identified users. The method <b>300</b> will now be described with frequent reference to the components and data of environments <b>100</b> and <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Method <b>300</b> includes an act of receiving encrypted data from a client that is to be stored in a client-specific directory, the data being encrypted using multi-authority attribute-based encryption, such that the client specifies access rights to the encrypted data by allowing identified users to access data with certain specified attributes (act <b>310</b>). For example, computer system <b>410</b> may receive data <b>406</b> from client <b>405</b> that is to be stored in a client-specific directory <b>116</b> in anonymous directory <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The data may have been encrypted using multi-authority attribute-based encryption which allows the client to specify access rights <b>117</b> for the data. The access rights allow identified users (e.g. <b>430</b>) to access certain types of data that have certain attributes. These attributes may be applied to each portion of data stored in the client-specific directory by the client him- or herself. The attributes applied by the client are user-specific. As such, identified users receive different data based on their identity. If, for example, a user is querying the directory for data of another party, the user can only look at that data selectively based on the attributes that the owner is willing to provide to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Method <b>300</b> includes an act of receiving a data request from a user, wherein the data request includes the user's identity and specifies one or more data attributes, wherein data that includes those attributes is to be returned to the user (act <b>320</b>). For example, computer system <b>410</b> may receive data request <b>431</b> from user <b>430</b>. The data request may include the user's ID <b>132</b> and various specified attributes <b>133</b>. The attributes indicate data or are associated with data which the user would like to retrieve.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the user's query may be sent to multiple different authorities requesting specific attributes. Each of the authorities may receive the query and respond with the appropriate attribute(s). The computer system may then receive these attributes from the authorities and allow the user access to the data corresponding to the attributes returned by the authorities. Thus, by using multi-authority attribute-based encryption, the user can rely on other authorities to provide attributes and/or data to respond to the user's request. The authorities do not have to be online at the time of the request. The authorities may reply asynchronously, upon confirming the user's ID. In cases where the attributes are not returned by the authorities, the user is prevented from accessing the data that corresponds to those attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Method <b>300</b> includes an act of determining which portions of data have attributes that match the requested attributes specified by the user and are identified as being allowable to release to the identified user (act <b>330</b>). For example, determining module <b>120</b> may determine which portions of data have attributes <b>107</b> that match the requested attributes <b>133</b> specified by the user <b>130</b> and have been indicated by the client (in access controls <b>117</b>) as being ok to release to the identified user. In some cases, these attributes may be verified by a trusted third party <b>425</b>. Thus, the attribute verification module <b>420</b> may send request <b>421</b> to one or more of the trusted third parties for verification. The trusted third parties may reply with verification <b>426</b> indicating that the attribute is or is not verified. In one example, for instance, the attribute may be &#x201c;Certified Notary Public&#x201d;. A trusted third party may vouch for the Notary, indicating that they are legitimate. Those portions of data whose attributes match the requested attributes specified by the user may then be sent to the user (act <b>340</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Accordingly, methods, systems and computer program products are provided which facilitate data transfer between data owners and users using an anonymous directory. Moreover, methods, systems and computer program products are provided which provide attribute-based data access to identified users. As such, the data owner has fine-grained control over what is being seen and who is seeing it.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
