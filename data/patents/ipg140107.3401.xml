<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A brush and brush housing arrangement for use with an electric brushed motor containing viscous fluid. The brush and brush housing arrangement comprises a brush housing and at least one brush. The at least one brush comprising a first end that is in contact with a rotating commutator of the motor when in use and an opposed second end. At least one open-faced channel in a surface of the brush extends from the first end to the second end. The open-faced channel provides an exit for entrained fluid from the brush and brush housing, minimizing or eliminating brush lift caused by fluid being forced between the rotating commutator and the brush. Additional pressure relief channels for allowing escape of entrained fluid may be located in the housing.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This present disclosure relates to electric motors, and more particularly to electric motors that require brushes in contact with the motor's armature, particularly when the motor is run while immersed in a fluid.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern drilling techniques employ an increasing number of sensors in downhole tools to determine downhole conditions and parameters such as pressure, spatial orientation, temperature, gamma ray count etc. that are encountered during drilling. These sensors are usually employed in a process called &#x2018;measurement while drilling&#x2019; (MWD). The data from such sensors are either transferred to a telemetry device, and thence up-hole to the surface, or are recorded in a memory device by &#x2018;logging&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The oil and gas industry presently uses a wire (Wireline), pressure pulses (Mud Pulse&#x2014;MP) or electromagnetic (EM) signals to telemeter all or part of this information to the surface in an effort to achieve near real-time data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need to control certain mechanical devices such as valves or actuators in many drilling applications and these usually employ electric motors. In such situations, the motor is required to run in a pressure-compensated housing in order to offset large external pressures (usually up to 20,000 psi). In the drilling environment these motors are generally one of two types&#x2014;brushless or brushed. Both have their advantages and disadvantages&#x2014;for instance brushed motors do not require sophisticated control circuits and are relatively efficient, and brushless motors have finer positional and rotational control. It is important to note that volume constraints are particularly severe in this environment, so electric motors that make optimum use of their armature coils are normally of the 3-phase variety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A major issue to be overcome when utilizing most electric downhole motors is that they usually need to move a shaft or lever that is within the external high-pressure environment. In most cases this implies that a high-pressure seal is necessary in order to protect the motor and its associated control electronics at low pressure from ingress by the drilling fluid (&#x2018;mud&#x2019;). Thus the seal must withstand a pressure differential of up to 20,000 psi, often at temperatures of 150&#xb0; C. to 175&#xb0; C. This is known to be a point of failure and can absorb significant energy in the form of friction to ensure that the seal is robust enough to withstand the differential pressure. A common method of minimizing this problem is to immerse the motor in an oil bath and communicate the external pressure of the mud to the internal oil via a deformable membrane, such as a rubber sheath. This has the effect of reducing the pressure across the seal to a few psi, thereby requiring a less robust seal that will absorb much less energy from the power source running the motor. The pertinent design issues now involve utilizing an electric motor that can run well while being completely immersed in oil. It is for this reason that most downhole designs make use of brushless motors because they avoid the issue that brushed motors must operate with their commutators and associated brushes in continuous contact. The essential problem is that the commutator is usually rotating at between 2,000 to 6,000 revolutions per minute and at this speed the oil is dragged around by both the armature and the commutator, the latter tending to lift the brushes away as the entrained oil is dragged between them&#x2014;the &#x2018;hydroplaning&#x2019; effect. As soon as the brushes lose contact with the armature the current to the motor stops and power&#x2014;and control&#x2014;is lost. A brushless motor has advantages in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In MP telemetry applications there is a class of devices that communicate by a rotary valve mechanism that periodically produces encoded downhole pressure pulses on the order of 200 psi. These pulses are detected at the surface and are decoded in order to present the driller with MWD information in order to steer the well. These rotary valves are preferentially driven by electric gearmotors, and as the forgoing implies, they will usually be electric and brushless. Because the motors are invariably powered by primary cell batteries it is important that they are efficient. Under conventional circumstances, such as surface applications at atmospheric pressure and with no particularly onerous packaging constraints, the requirements of reliable motor control, motor efficiency and output shaft positional accuracy (in order to set the valve appropriately) are not particularly challenging. But when the downhole motor is brushless and immersed in an oil bath subject to high pressure the need for positional accuracy generally leads to a loss of efficiency, as will be explained as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the optimum motor torque-speed curve in small motor downhole applications normally requires the motor speed to be typically at least 2,000 rpm. The final valve output mechanism will usually increase and decrease pressure in the mud at a rate of 0.5 to 2 bits per second. This implies that the motor must be geared down in order to match these rates, and also to generate the necessary torque applied to the valve itself so that adequately large pressure pulses can be developed. The valve mechanism in most cases needs the motor to stop and start at specific output positions so that the pressure increase and decrease is well defined according to the prevailing telemetry protocol. Thus the final mechanical valve positional outputs must be monitored, and this information communicated to the motor controller. In a brushless geared-down electric motor as described the necessary output shaft position is normally achieved by some sort of sensor, typically an encoding optical disc; the motor speed and control is by a microprocessor circuit. Both of these means utilize semiconductor components. Problematically, the semiconductors (transistors, diodes, integrated circuits etc.) must be isolated from high pressure or else they will collapse and fail. In situations where pressure must be tolerated the solution for a brushless motor is that one of the armature coils (typically one of three) is used as a sensor to determine speed and position instead of it being used to power the output shaft. This has the effect of significantly reducing the efficiency of a brushless motor. Further, a relatively complicated electronic control circuit housed in a low-pressure environment must be employed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0040">The embodiments described below introduce a novel aspect relating to a brush and to a brush and brush housing assembly to facilitate operation of a brushed motor at high speed in oil while mitigating conventional brush lift problems.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0041">This has the benefit that a more efficient and simple motor system can be utilized, particularly in oil and gas drilling downhole MP telemetry applications. Although the following embodiments are specifically useful for a certain class of MP systems, they can be useful in other telemetry or downhole control applications. This is demonstrated by showing the causes of brush lift in fluids of significant viscosity and undertaking a simplified analysis of hydrodynamic lift. Conventional means of offsetting the lift in our industry has been confirmed as inadequate based on research and experimentation. The following embodiments describe mitigation means in order to reduce the lift effect to negligible proportions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0042">The following embodiments help to overcome the deleterious and unintended effects of the brushes lifting when the electric motor is run in oil, and conventional means of stopping this effect have failed. The applications specifically apply to a class of downhole MWD tools, but the following embodiments are not limited to this scope&#x2014;they apply to any brushed electric motor that suffers from brush lift due to the entrained fluid around the commutator being viscous enough to cause brush lifting (hydroplaning).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0043">By a simplified analysis of fluid flow around a generic cylinder the underlying forces that cause brushes to lift away are demonstrated, and by extension, it is demonstrated how to reduce these forces by providing pressure relief channels. The embodiments described below are pertinent to small motors running at a few thousand rpm in light oil, but the following embodiments can be generally applied to other applications for motors in non-downhole environments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0044">For ease of reference, like components of the various figures are identified where possible by the same reference numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (prior art), a simple dc electric motor is energized by current flowing along current conductors <b>3</b> via carbon brushes <b>1</b> and on into a commutator <b>4</b>. The brushes <b>1</b> are held firmly against the commutator <b>4</b> via springs <b>2</b>. The rotating parts of the motor (armature) are constrained by a mechanical housing <b>6</b> that also utilizes an oil-filled space <b>5</b> wherein the oil acts as a pressure compensation fluid. The disadvantage of allowing oil to be in close contact with the rotating parts of the motor, particularly the commutator <b>4</b>, is that oil is swept around by the commutator's motion and often forces its way between brush <b>1</b> and commutator <b>4</b>, thus lifting the brush <b>1</b> and causing a current interruption, to the detriment of the motor's operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (prior art), two simple means can be employed to mitigate the effect of the rotationally entrained oil from lifting the brush&#x2014;bypass slots <b>12</b> can be cut into the brush <b>1</b> in the direction of travel, and the springs <b>2</b> that force the brush <b>1</b> against the commutator can be made stiffer. It is obvious to one skilled in the art that a further advantage can sometimes be gained by making the oil of as low a viscosity as is practical. However, it has been found that these simple means are not always effective in addressing the problem of brush lift.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an enlarged view of an area of the motor. It has been noted that the brushes <b>1</b> rarely form a profile that matches the circular shape of the commutator <b>4</b>, particularly if the motor has occasion to run in the reverse direction from normal <b>36</b>. This is partly a consequence of the friability of the carbon and the lack of perfect location of the brush <b>1</b> by the housing <b>6</b>. The pertinent effect is that a &#x2018;pocket&#x2019; or wedge <b>35</b> is formed at the leading edge of the brush <b>1</b>, enabling the entrained oil <b>34</b> to dynamically collect in the available volume between brush <b>1</b> and commutator <b>4</b>. It is now obvious that the wedge would deleteriously grow larger, ultimately lifting the brush <b>1</b> off the commutator <b>4</b> if the rotational speed is increased, the oil was more viscous (perhaps by lowering the temperature or allowing contamination), the spring force weakens, or a combination of all these effects.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0048">It remains to be shown how oil being dragged in a tangential direction can provide a perpendicular force to the axis of the commutator, thereby lifting the brushes against the action of their springs. Once this is understood, means can be assessed to mitigate or reduce this force.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0049">The following analysis breaks the problem into two parts&#x2014;(1) how much entrained oil is effective in being forced against each brush, and (2) once the oil does impinge on the brush, how this translates from a tangential to a radial force. In the embodiments described herein, displacement in or reference to the &#x201c;radial&#x201d; direction includes displacement along a vector that is collinear with a vector extending from the center of the commutator <b>4</b>, but also more generally includes displacement along a vector that has a component perpendicular to the surface of the commutator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0050">Entrained Oil:</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0051">Assume the oil flows (is dragged around) in the space <b>5</b> between the rotating commutator <b>4</b> and the stationary housing <b>6</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The velocity of the oil will be a maximum at the surface of the commutator <b>4</b> and a minimum at the housing <b>6</b>. The velocity profile (velocity v vs. distance r out from the commutator) will be governed by some relationship (see for instance Poiseuille's law, or Couette flow, described at http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pfric.html, one amongst many sources). For illustrative purposes a general exponential relationship can be reasonably determined and followed through in order to understand the major parameters that can be expected to play a role in the transport of oil around the commutator and potentially under the brushes.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0061">Equation [3], while oversimplifying the real situation, does confirm the intuitive importance of the various parameters. For instance, the entrained rotating oil velocity at a given distance from the commutator is directly proportional to the viscosity and the commutator rotational speed, and is inversely proportional to the distance from the rotating surface of the commutator. The oil's maximum velocity matches that of the commutator when r=0, and average velocity of the oil that is forced into the wedge <b>35</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is predicted by v<sub>a </sub>at a given r<sub>a</sub>. This distance is made commensurate with the size of the wedge. One can now use Equation [3] to estimate the lifting force on the brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0062">Radial Force:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows how the oil <b>34</b> is forced into the wedge <b>35</b>, follows some profile <b>37</b> and curls around under the brush <b>1</b>, forming a stagnation point <b>38</b>. Note that if the majority of the oil <b>34</b> forced into the wedge <b>35</b> were able to continue in the direction of the rotating commutator <b>36</b> there would be no stagnation point, simply constrained flow under the brush <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0064">If we assume that oil moves towards the stagnation point at an average velocity of v<sub>a</sub>, the momentum in the direction of travel has to equate to zero because the oil curls back and continues around the oil-filled space contained by the housing. Using the law of Conservation of Momentum, we can expect that the force on the oil in the wedge exactly matches that necessary to reduce the momentum to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0065">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, and assuming that the average height of the wedge <b>41</b> is h, it follows that the volume V<sub>s </sub>of the incoming &#x2018;stalled&#x2019; fluid is:

where d defines a representative distance <b>44</b> under the wedge, w defines the width <b>43</b> of the brush and v<sub>a </sub>from Equation [3] is the average velocity of the oil <b>45</b> entering into the wedge.
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0066">The mass of oil is given approximately by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>M=&#x3c1;V</i><sub>s</sub>,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x3c1; is the oil density.
</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0067">The time for the oil to change velocity from v<sub>a </sub>to zero is given by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>T</i><sub>d</sub><i>=d/v</i><sub>a </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0068">Thus, the force F (rate of change of momentum) on the oil is given by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F=Mv</i><sub>a</sub><i>/T</i><sub>d</sub><i>=M</i>(<i>v</i><sub>a</sub>)<sup>2</sup><i>/d</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;[4]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0069">Because oil is an isotropic fluid and relatively incompressible, any force or equivalently any pressure acting upon it is measured to be the same in all directions. Thus the force that changed the momentum to zero can be translated to a force F that acts radially to the commutator, in effect causing a lifting pressure on the brush. From Equation [4] and various substitutions it can be shown that:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i>=(&#x3c1;<i>hw/</i>2)(<i>v</i><sub>a</sub>)<sup>2</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;[5]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0070">Substituting for v<sub>a </sub>into Equation [5] and simplifying yields:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i>=(<i>K</i>)(<i>w/h</i>)(&#x3c1;)(&#x3b7;<i>v</i><sub>c</sub>)<sup>2</sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;[6]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where we make the simplifying assumption that r<sub>a </sub>is equivalent to h/4 (as is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) and K=8 k<sup>2</sup>.
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0071">Thus Equation [6] predicts that the radial force that can potentially cause brush lift comprises a geometrical term, a term that depends linearly on density and a term that depends on the square of the viscosity and the commutator velocity. When the force due to the momentum change imposed on the oil by being made to change direction within the wedge between commutator and brush equals or exceeds the spring force (assuming the weight of the brush under gravity is negligible) then the phenomena of brush lift occurs. Laboratory experiments have confirmed the sensitivity of brush lift to the dimensions of the wedge (the geometrical term), the density of the oil and most importantly an approximately quadratic sensitivity to viscosity and rotational velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0072">Given the present understanding that prior to brush-lift the pertinent forces on the brush are caused primarily by the fluid dynamically trapped under the leading edge of the brush being forced to radically change direction, the issue is what to do to reduce the radial force. In accordance with the present embodiment, reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrates means to allow the majority of oil being swept round by the commutator <b>4</b> an alternative escape route rather than entering and then leaving the wedge, the alternative escape route in the present embodiment comprising a pressure relief channel or channels <b>48</b> immediately in front of the wedge. In the depicted embodiment the relief channel <b>48</b> comprises a groove in the form of an open-faced channel, which is discussed in more detail below in respect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and which is conveniently placed in the housing <b>6</b>. The relief channel <b>48</b> facilitates the modification of the oil flow profile <b>37</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, whereby the majority of the entrained oil exits the housing <b>6</b> along the relief channel <b>48</b> without providing substantial momentum transfer under the brush <b>1</b>, which would otherwise result in brush lift. The shape of relief channel <b>48</b> enables the majority of the flow just in front of the wedge to depart from tangential to radial streamline flow, thus avoiding a sharp change in direction underneath the brush <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0073">Further benefits can be gained by providing additional pressure relief channels in the housing, as close as is practicable to the brushes <b>1</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where a typical motor bell end housing <b>51</b> comprises a circular ring with an inner surface <b>55</b> and an outer surface <b>56</b>. The inner surface <b>55</b> defines the oil-filled space <b>5</b> which receives the commutator <b>4</b>. Brush-locating slots <b>52</b> extend from the inner surface <b>55</b> to the outer surface <b>56</b> of the housing <b>51</b> for receiving the brushes <b>1</b>. Extending along either face of the brush-locating slot <b>52</b> are the open-faced or grooved pressure relief channels <b>48</b>. By &#x201c;open-faced channel&#x201d; it is meant a channel through which fluid may flow from a first end to a second end and that is located along a surface of a body; the channel is not tunnelled through the body, but is instead open at least along a portion of its side such that the channel can be accessed via the open portion of its side in addition to the first and second ends. It will be noticed that the channels are on both the leading and trailing faces of the brush-locating slot <b>52</b> in this embodiment, to facilitate the reduction of brush lift when the motor is driven in the forward or reverse direction. Instead of becoming entrained in a wedge under the brush <b>1</b>, the oil is instead diverted along the surface of the brush <b>1</b> and to the outer surface <b>56</b> of the housing <b>51</b>, where the oil exits the housing <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0074">A radial force due to the frictional drag of the oil on the brush <b>1</b> may now be present, but this effect can be offset by making the width of the channel <b>48</b> at least 25% to 35% of the width of the brush <b>1</b>, and similarly at least 20% of the depth, thereby reducing the radial velocity of the oil to a relatively negligible value. Furthermore, the force applied to the brush <b>1</b> by the frictional drag of the oil is typically less than the radial force applied to the brush <b>1</b> in the prior art solution depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The slots <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> allow oil to flow beneath and to apply force upwards on the brush <b>1</b> in a direction that is normal to the surface of the brush <b>1</b>. Such forces typically exceed the aforedescribed frictional drag forces, which are applied in a direction parallel to the surface of the brush <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0075">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, extra pressure relief channels <b>54</b> can be tunnelled or formed into the housing <b>51</b> and extend from the inner surface <b>55</b> to the outer surface <b>56</b> of the housing <b>51</b>. As both the extra pressure relief channels <b>54</b> and the open-faced channels <b>48</b> extend along a vector that has a component perpendicular to the surface of the commutator <b>4</b>, they are radially extending or disposed. In the embodiment shown the open-faced or grooved pressure relief channels <b>48</b> have a semi-circular cross section and the extra pressure relief channels <b>54</b> have a circular cross section; such cross sections are particularly expedient to produce by drilling. However a person of skill in the art will recognize that other cross-sectional shapes will also be suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0076">In an alternative embodiment, it is apparent that the pressure relief channels <b>48</b> could similarly be implemented in the brush <b>1</b> itself, resulting in equally beneficial effects.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts an embodiment in which the pressure relief channel is formed in the brush <b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the brush <b>1</b> comprises a first end <b>21</b> that contacts the rotating commutator <b>4</b> and an opposed second end <b>20</b> which is connected to the spring <b>2</b>. Extending between the first and second end <b>21</b>, <b>20</b> are four side faces. The brush <b>1</b> further comprises an open-faced or grooved pressure relief channel <b>58</b> extending along a leading face <b>7</b> of the brush from the first end <b>21</b> to the second end <b>20</b>. The open-faced or grooved pressure relief channel <b>58</b> provides an exit route for the entrained oil gathered at the leading edge of the brush, which oil can be diverted out of the housing <b>51</b> to reduce or eliminate brush lift. An additional open-faced or grooved pressure relief channel <b>58</b> extends along a trailing face <b>8</b> of the brush from the first end <b>21</b> to the second end <b>20</b> to facilitate the reduction of brush lift when the motor is driven in the reverse direction. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the open-faced or grooved pressure relief channels <b>58</b> have a semi-circular cross section, however a person of skill in the art will recognize that other cross-sectional shapes will also be suitable. For example, the relief channel can have square or rectangular cross-section with radiused internal corners. In this embodiment the pressure relief channels <b>58</b> are located on the center-line of the leading and trailing faces of the brush; however, one of skill in the art will also recognize that the open-faced pressure relief channel(s) <b>58</b> may be located at different positions on the brush <b>1</b> to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and still provide an escape route for entrained oil, thereby minimizing brush lift.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0078">It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are intended only to illustrate exemplary embodiments; variation from these embodiments are possible. The present embodiments comprise means whereby the fluid can avoid momentum transfer into the brushes by providing a pressure relief channel that enables viscous fluid a direct means of exiting the housing along the direction of the brush, potentially reducing the brush lift due to the fluid being forced between the rotating commutator and its associated brushes. It is further understood that the dimensions of the pressure relief channel(s) are to be sufficient to effectively by-pass the viscous fluid without causing significant frictional drag of the fluid along the channel(s) for a given commutator's maximum rotational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0079">Another embodiment of a brush for use with an electric motor immersed in a fluid is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The brush <b>1</b> has two bypass slots <b>12</b> cut into the first end <b>21</b> of the brush. The slots <b>12</b> extend toward but do not reach the second end <b>20</b> of the brush, such that the brush has three legs <b>16</b> as is provided in the prior art brush <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment the radially extending edges of the brush (i.e. the edges between the four side faces: leading face, trailing face and interconnecting lateral faces) are cut away to provide a chamfered or bevelled edge <b>13</b> along both edges of the leading face <b>7</b> and both edges of the trailing face <b>8</b>. Although the brush <b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with four chamfered edges, the brush <b>1</b> in an alternative embodiment can feature one, two or three radially extending chamfered edges <b>13</b>, on the leading or trailing faces, or both. Or to put it another way, one or more of the edges between the four side faces can have a chamfered edge.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0080">The chamfered edges <b>13</b> may be at 45 degrees to the faces of the brush, however other angles of chamfering may also be suitable. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the chamfered edges <b>13</b> divert oil more efficiently than straight edges, reducing the build up of entrained oil at the leading edge of the brush, thereby minimizing brush lift. These chamfered edges provide the added benefit of avoiding presenting sharp corners of the brush, which can be prone to breaking when handled or during operation. In essence the chamfers serve as a open-faced channels on the edges of the brush, supplementing or substituting for the open-faced channel either in the housing or at the center of the brush as discussed in the previous embodiments. The chamfered edges also serve to make the brush profile more hydrodynamically efficient; without wishing to be bound by theory, it is theorized that if the brushes can cut through the oil more efficiently, there will be less pressure generated in the oil at the front of the brush, and thus less brush lift.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0081">In an alternative embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the brush <b>1</b> is provided with only one bypass slot <b>12</b>. Provision of a single bypass slot <b>12</b> rather than two bypass slots <b>12</b> as is known in the prior art, allows the two legs <b>16</b> of the brush <b>1</b> either side of the single bypass slot <b>12</b> to be thicker, and therefore stronger and less prone to breaking, than the three legs <b>16</b> of the prior art brush <b>1</b> having two bypass slots <b>12</b>. The edges of the brush, including the edges around the bypass slot <b>12</b> are chamfered or bevelled edges <b>13</b>. As the two legs <b>16</b> of the brush of this embodiment can be thicker than the three legs <b>16</b> of known brushes, the width of the chamfered edges <b>13</b> can be greater whilst still maintaining adequate strength in the legs <b>16</b>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a wider chamfered edge <b>13</b> will divert more oil, reducing the build up of entrained oil at the leading edge of the brush, thereby minimizing brush lift.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0082">While particular embodiments have been described in the foregoing, it is to be understood that other embodiments are possible and are intended to be included herein. It will be clear to any person skilled in the art that modifications of and adjustments to the foregoing embodiments, not shown, are possible.</p>
