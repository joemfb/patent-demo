<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to intravenous catheters. More specifically, this disclosure discusses an intravenous catheter device having an integrated introducer needle and intravenous tubing, wherein following catheterization intravenous access is facilitated between the catheter and the intravenous tubing via the hollow body of the introducer needle.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, vascular access devices are used for communicating fluid with the vascular system of patients. For example, catheters are used for infusing fluid (e.g., saline solution, medicaments, and/or total parenteral nutrition) into a patient, withdrawing fluids (e.g., blood) from a patient, and/or monitoring various parameters of the patient's vascular system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Intravenous (IV) catheter assemblies are among the various types of vascular access devices. Over-the-needle peripheral IV catheters are a common IV catheter configuration. As its name implies, an over-the-needle catheter is mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. The introducer needle is generally a venipuncture needle coupled to a needle assembly that helps guide the needle and facilitates its cooperation with the catheter. At least the inner surface of the distal portion of the catheter tightly engages the outer surface of the needle to prevent peelback of the catheter and, thereby, to facilitate insertion of the catheter into the blood vessel. The catheter and the introducer needle are often assembled so that the sharp distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter. Moreover, the catheter and needle are often assembled so that during insertion, the bevel of the needle faces up, away from the patient's skin. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the patient's skin into a blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Following catheterization, the introducer needle is withdrawn from the catheter and disposed. The clinician then connects a syringe or section of intravenous tubing to the catheter to access the vasculature of the patient. The clinician must act quickly so as to prevent undesirable exposure to the patient's blood following removal of the introducer needle. In some instances, the clinician occludes or blocks blood flow through the catheter by applying physical pressure to the catheterized vein of the patient. In addition to causing discomfort to the patient, physical occlusion of the patient's vein requires the constant use of one of the clinician's hands, thereby requiring that the clinician attach the syringe or intravenous tubing to the inserted catheter using only one hand. Alternatively, the clinician may solicit the assistance of another clinician, however assistance is not always available. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a device which overcomes the difficulties and shortcomings associated with currently available technologies. The present disclosure discusses such a device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides an intravenous catheter device having an integrated introducer needle and intravenous tubing, wherein following catheterization intravenous access is facilitated between the catheter and the intravenous tubing via the hollow body of the introducer needle. In some implementations, an intravenous catheter assembly is provided which includes a catheter adapter having a fluid chamber in which is slidably housed a needle adapter. The needle adapter is configured to support a base of an introducer needle and a terminal end of a section of intravenous tubing such that a fluid pathway of the introducer needle is in fluid communication with a pathway of the section of intravenous tubing. The introducer needle further includes a sharpened tip which is positioned distally beyond a tip of a catheter which is coupled to a distal end of the catheter adapter. As such, the sharpened tip of the introducer needle is exposed externally to the catheter to assist in inserting the catheter into the vasculature of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some instances, the catheter adapter further includes a septum interposed between an inner surface of the catheter adapter and an outer surface of the introducer needle, wherein the septum divides the fluid chamber of the catheter adapter into a distal fluid chamber and a proximal fluid chamber. In these instances, the septum prevents fluid communication between the distal and proximal fluid chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some implementations of the present invention, the needle adapter is slidably positioned within the fluid chamber of the catheter adapter between a distal position and a preferred proximal position. When in the distal position, a sharpened tip of the introducer needle is exposed distally beyond a tip of the catheter. When in the preferred proximal position, the introducer needle is withdrawn into the catheter thereby shielding the sharpened tip of the introducer needle within the catheter. In some instances, the preferred proximal position of the needle adapter results in the sharpened tip of the introducer needle being positioned or located in the distal fluid chamber. When in the preferred proximal position, fluid communication between the catheter and the section of intravenous tubing is facilitated through the hollow body of the introducer needle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some instances, the interior surface of the catheter adapter further comprises distal and proximal stops to retain the needle adapter in the distal and preferred proximal positions. For example, in some implementations the distal and proximal stops include an annular ridge or indentation which is configured to engage a portion of the needle adapter. In other implementations, the distal and proximal stops include a catch or a clip which is configured to engage a portion of the needle adapter. In some instances, the needle adapter defeats or otherwise bypasses the distal stop when the section of intravenous tubing is pulled by the user in a proximal direction. Furthermore, the needle adapter engages the proximal stop when the section of intravenous tubing is further pulled by the user in a proximal direction. In some instances, the catheter adapter further includes a biasing element which is interposed between the needle adapter and an interior surface of the catheter adapter, wherein the biasing element biases the needle adapter in a proximal direction following catheterization.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Distal end <b>24</b> is configured to house a proximal end <b>42</b> of a catheter <b>40</b>. Catheter <b>40</b> further comprises a tip <b>44</b> which is positioned opposite of proximal end <b>42</b>. In some embodiments tip <b>44</b> is tapered so as to provide a smooth transition between a sharpened tip <b>54</b> of an introducer needle <b>50</b> and catheter <b>40</b>. The tapered structure of tip <b>44</b> facilitates insertion of catheter <b>40</b> during catheterization procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Catheter <b>40</b> generally comprises an intravenous catheter which includes a biocompatible material, such as a polymer or metallic material. In some embodiments, catheter <b>40</b> comprises a flexible polymer material, such as silicon rubber, latex, and/or various thermoplastic elastomers. Catheter <b>40</b> may further comprise a rigid polymer or metallic material, as may be desirable for an intended use.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The length and diameter of catheter <b>40</b> is generally determined by the application or use for which the intravenous catheter device <b>10</b> is intended. Accordingly, one having skill in the art will appreciate that catheter <b>40</b> may be modified or adjusted to include any size and dimensions as may be desired or necessary to facilitate a desired use.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Proximal end <b>22</b> further comprises an opening <b>28</b> through which a section of intravenous tubing <b>60</b> is slidably inserted. In some embodiments, the diameter of opening <b>28</b> is selected so as to form a fluid tight seal between opening <b>28</b> and the outer surface of tubing <b>60</b>. Opening <b>28</b> may further include a gasket or O-ring whereby to form a seal with tubing <b>60</b>. In other embodiments, the diameter of opening <b>28</b> is selected so as to provide minimal tolerance between opening <b>28</b> and tubing <b>60</b> without restricting movement of tubing <b>60</b> through opening <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a cross-section side view of an intravenous catheter device <b>10</b> is shown. In some embodiments, intravenous catheter device <b>10</b> further comprises a needle adapter <b>70</b> which is slidably positioned within a fluid chamber <b>26</b> of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. Fluid chamber <b>26</b> is generally defined as the hollow interior of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, fluid chamber <b>26</b> includes various features formed on the inner wall surface <b>30</b> of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. For example, in some embodiments inner wall surface <b>30</b> comprises a channel <b>32</b> in which is housed a portion of a septum <b>80</b>. Inner wall surface <b>30</b> may further comprise an interior flange <b>34</b> provided to prevent or limit movement of needle adapter <b>70</b> and a distal direction <b>12</b>. Inner wall surface <b>30</b> may further include a recessed surface <b>35</b> for receiving and securing catheter <b>40</b> to catheter adapter <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, catheter <b>40</b> may further be secured to catheter adapter <b>20</b> via a swaged connector <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, below), wherein catheter <b>40</b> is wedged between the swaged connector and the inner surface of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. Further still, inner wall surface <b>30</b> may include a distal stop <b>36</b> and a proximal stop <b>38</b> which are provided to temporarily maintain distal and proximal positions of the needle adapter <b>70</b> within fluid chamber <b>26</b>, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, needle adapter <b>70</b> comprises a distal aperture <b>72</b> configured to house a base portion <b>52</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b>. Needle adapter <b>70</b> further comprises a proximal aperture <b>74</b> configured to house a terminal end <b>62</b> of intravenous tubing <b>60</b>. Base portion <b>52</b> and terminal end <b>62</b> are fixedly secured to needle adapter <b>70</b> such that introducer needle <b>50</b>, intravenous tubing <b>60</b>, and needle adapter <b>70</b> form a unitary structure. Base portion <b>52</b> and terminal end <b>62</b> are further secured to needle adapter <b>70</b> such that a fluid pathway or hollow body <b>56</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b> is in fluid communication with a fluid pathway <b>64</b> of intravenous tubing <b>60</b>. Thus, a fluid which enters introducer needle <b>50</b> via a sharpened tip <b>54</b> flows through a fluid pathway <b>56</b> and into a fluid pathway <b>64</b> via needle adapter <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, needle adapter <b>70</b> is secured to a middle portion of introducer needle <b>50</b> such that base portion <b>52</b> extends proximally past needle adapter <b>70</b>, rather than terminating within a portion of needle adapter <b>70</b>. In these instances, base portion <b>52</b> is coupled to terminal end <b>62</b> at a position without needle adapter <b>70</b>. For example, base portion <b>52</b> and terminal end <b>62</b> may be coupled in a fluid tight manner via a crimp or other mechanical connection. In other embodiments, needle adapter <b>70</b> is secured to a middle portion of intravenous tubing <b>60</b> such that base portion <b>52</b> is positioned distally past needle adapter <b>70</b>, rather than terminating within a portion of needle adapter <b>70</b>. In these instances, base portion <b>52</b> is coupled to terminal end <b>62</b> at a position without needle adapter <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some instances, needle adapter <b>70</b> comprises a portion of terminal end <b>62</b>, wherein terminal end <b>62</b> performs a dual function of housing base portion <b>52</b> and interfacing with inner wall surface <b>30</b> of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. In other instances, needle adapter <b>70</b> comprises a portion of base portion <b>52</b>, wherein base portion <b>52</b> performs a dual function of housing terminal end <b>62</b> and interfacing with inner wall surface <b>30</b> of catheter adapter <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Prior to catheterization, needle adapter <b>70</b> is positioned within fluid chamber <b>26</b> at a maximum distal position such that sharpened tip <b>54</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b> is exposed distally beyond tip <b>44</b> of catheter <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the position of interior flange <b>34</b> is selected to provide the optimal exposure of sharpened tip <b>54</b> beyond tip <b>44</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments the length of introducer needle <b>50</b> is selected to provide the optimal exposure of sharpened tip <b>54</b> beyond tip <b>44</b> when needle adapter <b>70</b> is positioned within fluid chamber <b>26</b> at a maximum distal position. Further still, the length of catheter <b>40</b> may be selected to provide the optimal exposure of sharpened tip <b>54</b> beyond tip <b>44</b> when needle adapter <b>70</b> is positioned within fluid chamber <b>26</b> at a maximum distal position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, distal stop <b>36</b> is provided to temporarily maintain the maximum distal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> during the catheterization procedure. Distal stop <b>36</b> may include any feature which prevents movement of needle adapter <b>70</b> in a proximal direction <b>14</b> during catheterization. Thus, distal stop <b>36</b> prevents premature sheathing of sharpened tip <b>54</b> within catheter <b>40</b> during catheterization caused by contact between sharpened tip <b>54</b> and the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, distal stop <b>36</b> comprises an annular ring formed on inner surface <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, distal stop <b>36</b> comprises a plurality of bumps or intermittent raised surfaces formed on inner surface <b>30</b>. Distal stop <b>36</b> may further include a mechanical or friction interface between needle adapter <b>70</b> and inner wall surface <b>30</b>, wherein a shear force between needle adapter <b>70</b> and distal stop <b>36</b> is greater than the compressive force between sharpened tip <b>54</b> and the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, catheter adapter <b>20</b> further comprises a septum <b>80</b> disposed within fluid chamber <b>26</b> and having an aperture or hole <b>82</b> through which introducer needle <b>50</b> is inserted. In some embodiments, septum <b>80</b> comprises an elastomeric polymer material which is impervious to fluids. In other embodiments, septum <b>80</b> comprises a non-elastomeric material having tight tolerances between hole <b>82</b> and introducer needle <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, hole <b>82</b> forms a fluid tight seal around introducer needle <b>50</b> thereby dividing fluid chamber <b>26</b> into a distal fluid chamber <b>84</b> and a proximal fluid chamber <b>86</b>. Thus, a fluid within distal fluid chamber <b>84</b> is prevented from bypassing septum <b>80</b> into proximal fluid chamber <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some instances, introducer needle <b>50</b> is capable of translating or sliding within hole <b>82</b> as needle adapter <b>70</b> is slid in proximal direction <b>14</b>. In other instances, the mechanical interface between hole <b>82</b> and introducer needle <b>50</b> prevents introducer needle <b>50</b> from sliding within hole <b>82</b>, thereby causing septum <b>80</b> to collapse and fold as introducer needle is moved in proximal direction <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, following catheterization needle adapter <b>70</b> is moved in proximal direction <b>14</b> thereby withdrawing introducer needle <b>50</b> from catheter <b>40</b> and shielding sharpened tip <b>54</b> within distal fluid chamber <b>84</b>. In some embodiments, needle adapter <b>70</b> is moved or slid in proximal direction <b>14</b> as intravenous tubing <b>60</b> is pulled in proximal direction <b>14</b> by the user. Needle adapter <b>70</b> bypasses distal stop <b>36</b>, if present, as the pulling force exerted on intravenous tubing <b>60</b> in proximal direction <b>14</b> exceeds a shear force between needle adapter <b>70</b> and distal stop <b>36</b>. Once freed from distal stop <b>36</b>, needle adapter <b>70</b> travels through catheter adapter <b>20</b> towards proximal end <b>22</b>. At a preferred proximal position, needle adapter <b>70</b> is secured by proximal stop <b>38</b>, if present. In some embodiments, the preferred proximal position is determined by a desired position of sharpened tip <b>54</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in some embodiments the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> results in sharpened tip <b>54</b> being positioned within distal fluid chamber <b>84</b>, wherein distal fluid chamber <b>84</b> is separated from proximal fluid chamber <b>86</b> via septum <b>80</b>. Accordingly, fluid flows between catheter <b>40</b> and intravenous tubing <b>60</b> via distal fluid chamber <b>84</b> and introducer needle <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> results in sharpened tip <b>54</b> being positioned within a proximal portion of catheter <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments catheter <b>40</b> comprises a proximal end <b>42</b> having a reduced inner diameter <b>48</b> which forms a fluid tight seal with the outer surface of introducer needle <b>50</b>. As such, fluid communication between catheter <b>40</b> and intravenous tubing <b>60</b> is facilitated by introducer needle <b>50</b>, wherein reduced inner diameter <b>48</b> prevents fluid from passing between catheter <b>40</b> and outer surface of introducer needle <b>50</b> and into fluid chamber <b>26</b> of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. Thus, the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> is determined by the distal position of sharpened tip <b>54</b> with respect to reduced inner diameter <b>48</b> of catheter <b>40</b>. Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention do not require a septum to divert fluid flow between catheter <b>40</b> and intravenous tubing <b>60</b> via introducer needle <b>50</b>. Rather, a fluid tight seal between introducer needle <b>50</b> and the inner surface of catheter <b>40</b> provides the desired diversion of fluid through introducer needle <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a cross-section top view of an intravenous catheter device <b>100</b> is shown. In some embodiments, intravenous catheter device <b>100</b> comprises a needle adapter <b>170</b> having an integrated paddle grip <b>172</b> which is positioned external to catheter adapter <b>20</b>. Paddle grip <b>172</b> is provided as a means for gripping intravenous catheter device <b>100</b> during catheterization. For example, in some embodiments paddle grip <b>172</b> is gripped between the thumb and opposing finger of the user to control device <b>100</b> during catheterization. In some instances, the distal position of needle adapter <b>170</b> is maintained by distal stop <b>36</b>. In other instances, the forward or distal position of needle adapter <b>170</b> is maintained via the user's contact with paddle grip <b>172</b> during insertion of sharpened tip <b>54</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b> into the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In particular, when device <b>100</b> is held by paddle grip <b>172</b> and advanced in distal direction <b>12</b>, the interconnected relationship between introducer needle <b>50</b> and needle adapter <b>170</b> prevents movement of needle adapter <b>170</b> in proximal direction <b>14</b> relative to catheter <b>40</b> and catheter adapter <b>20</b> when sharpened tip <b>54</b> contacts the surface of the patient. Thus, paddle grip <b>172</b> prevents premature shielding of sharpened tip <b>54</b> within catheter <b>40</b> during catheterization. Following catheterization, paddle grip <b>172</b> is moved in proximal direction <b>14</b>, thereby withdrawing sharpened tip <b>54</b> into catheter <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, intravenous catheter device <b>100</b> is configured to permit movement of needle adapter <b>170</b> from a distal position to a preferred proximal position following catheterization. When in the preferred proximal position, sharpened tip <b>54</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b> is withdrawn proximally into catheter <b>40</b> such that sharpened tip <b>54</b> is shielded. In some embodiments, the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>170</b> results in sharpened tip <b>54</b> being positioned within a proximal portion <b>42</b> of catheter <b>40</b>, wherein a fluid tight seal is formed between the outer surface of introducer needle <b>50</b> and an inner surface of catheter <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>170</b> results in sharpened tip <b>54</b> being positioned within distal fluid chamber <b>84</b>, wherein fluid communication between catheter <b>40</b> and intravenous tubing <b>60</b> is facilitated via introducer needle <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, catheter adapter <b>20</b> further comprises a septum <b>80</b> which prevents fluid communication between distal fluid chamber <b>84</b> and proximal fluid chamber <b>86</b>. As such, fluid must travel through introducer needle <b>50</b> following catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in some embodiments an intravenous catheter device <b>200</b> is provided which includes a biasing element <b>210</b> to assist in moving needle adapter <b>70</b> from a distal position to a preferred proximal position following catheterization. Biasing element <b>210</b> generally comprises a resilient member which is interposed between a distal surface of needle adapter <b>70</b> and an inner surface <b>222</b> of catheter adapter <b>220</b>, such that when catheter adapter <b>70</b> is in a distal position, biasing member <b>210</b> applies a force upon needle adapter <b>70</b> in proximal direction <b>14</b>. For example, in some embodiments biasing element <b>210</b> comprises an open coil spring having a first end in contact with inner surface <b>222</b> and a second end in contact with needle adapter <b>70</b>. Biasing element <b>210</b> may further include an elastomeric polymer, a compression spring, a conical compression spring, a magazine spring, or other device or material which is capable of exerting a proximal force on needle adapter <b>70</b>, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. In some embodiments, biasing element <b>210</b> is positioned external to catheter adapter <b>20</b> (not shown), wherein biasing element <b>210</b> is interposed between an external, proximal end of needle adapter <b>70</b> (as in configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) and an outer surface of catheter adapter <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, a distal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> is selected such that sharpened tip <b>54</b> of introducer needle <b>50</b> is exposed distally beyond tip <b>44</b> of catheter <b>40</b>. This distal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> is maintained by distal stop <b>36</b>. Thus the proximal force exerted upon needle adapter <b>70</b> by biasing member <b>210</b> is less than the shear force between needle adapter <b>70</b> and distal stop <b>36</b>. Further, the shear force between needle adapter <b>70</b> and distal stop <b>36</b> is greater than the compressive force between sharpened tip <b>54</b> and the surface of the patient during catheterization. As such, premature shielding of sharpened tip <b>54</b> within catheter <b>40</b> is prevented during catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some instances, distal stop <b>36</b> is deactivated and thereby releases needle adapter <b>70</b> upon the user pushing a button or trigger (not shown) located on the external surface of catheter adapter <b>20</b>. Upon deactivation, biasing member <b>210</b> automatically slides or biases needle adapter <b>70</b> in proximal direction <b>14</b>. Proximal stop <b>38</b> then engages needle adapter <b>70</b> in the preferred proximal position. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention provide for automated relocation of needle adapter <b>70</b> from the distal position to the preferred proximal position following catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, intravenous tubing <b>60</b> is manually pulled in proximal direction <b>14</b> following catheterization thereby overcoming the shear force between needle adapter <b>70</b> and distal stop <b>36</b>. As such, needle adapter <b>70</b> bypasses distal stop <b>36</b>. Once clear of distal stop <b>36</b>, biasing element <b>210</b> assists needle adapter <b>70</b> in traveling proximally through fluid chamber <b>26</b> towards proximal end <b>22</b> of needle adapter <b>220</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some instances the compressive force of biasing element <b>210</b> is sufficient to reposition needle adapter <b>70</b> behind proximal stop <b>38</b> and into a preferred proximal position, as shown. In other instances a user must pull intravenous tubing <b>60</b> in proximal direction <b>14</b> to cause needle adapter <b>72</b> bypass proximal stop <b>38</b> and position needle adapter <b>70</b> in the preferred proximal position. Further, in some embodiments proximal stop <b>38</b> comprises a catch or clip which is configured to interlock with needle adapter <b>70</b> thereby maintaining the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> following catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As discussed previously, in some embodiments the preferred proximal position of needle adapter <b>70</b> results in sharpened tip <b>54</b> being withdrawn from catheter <b>40</b> and positioned within distal fluid chamber <b>84</b>, wherein septum <b>80</b> prevents passage of fluid between distal fluid chamber <b>84</b> and proximal fluid chamber <b>86</b>. As such, fluid communication between a fluid pathway <b>64</b> of intravenous tubing <b>60</b> and catheter <b>40</b> is facilitated via introducer needle <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some embodiments further include a method for assembling or manufacturing an intravenous catheter assembly in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. For example, a method for manufacturing an intravenous catheter assembly may include a first step whereby a catheter adapter is provided having a proximal end, a distal end and a pathway extending therebetween. A catheter may then be coupled to the distal end of the of the catheter adapter, wherein the catheter includes a lumen and a tip. A needle adapter is further provided having a surface for supporting a base end of an introducer needle. The introducer needle generally includes a sharpened end, a base, and a hollow body extending therebetween. For some methods, the base of the introducer needle is coupled to, and supported by the needle adapter. A section of intravenous tubing is further coupled to the needle adapter, wherein the needle adapter facilitates fluid communication between the hollow body of the introducer needle and a fluid pathway of the intravenous tubing. The introducer needle, needle adapter, and section of intravenous tubing are then slidably housed within the lumen of the catheter adapter, in accordance with the teachings above.</p>
