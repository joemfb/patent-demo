<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0035">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">In recent years, the computing/communication industry has enjoyed dramatic technological advancement and spectacular commercial popularity, providing numerous benefits for those who choose to enjoy the fruits of technological developments in the computing/communication sectors. For example, with the dramatic development of personal communication devices such as cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), Smartphones, laptop computers, desktop computers, and so forth, users of such devices are now able to maintain 24/7 connectivity with other users at relatively low costs. Such connectivity may be via, for example, a variety of communication channels including, for example, telephone calls, emails, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, text messaging (e.g., short message service or SMS, or multimedia messaging service or MMS), instant messaging (IM), and so forth. Unfortunately, in addition to providing significant benefits to users, users of such technologies must also deal with a whole new set of issues and problems that have arisen with this new computing/communication technology.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">For example, users of such personal communication devices (e.g., cellular telephones, Smartphones, laptop and desktop computers, and so forth) are facing a number of privacy and security issues. One such issue that has arisen with respect to users of personal communication devices is that these personal communication devices are often easily accessible for use by those other than the primary users (e.g., owners) of such devices. As a result, communiqu&#xe9;s (e.g., electronic communications including, for example, telephone calls, VoIP, emails, text messages, IMs, and so forth) including sensitive communiqu&#xe9;s (e.g., highly personal or confidential business communiqu&#xe9;s) that are directed to the primary users of such devices may be accessed by others potentially causing embarrassing if not devastating consequences to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">For example, it was extensively reported recently that a well-known and well-admired professional athlete was caught by his spouse having an extramarital affair. It was widely reported that the spouse discovered this affair when she discovered a voice message from her husband's mistress on her husband's cellular telephone. Because the husband (i.e., famous professional athlete) in that incident had not erased or was not able to hide or disguise the voice message from his mistress, the husband had to endure significant public humiliation and substantial financial loss due to loss of commercial endorsement income.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">Of course the need for maintaining communication or communiqu&#xe9; secrecy is not just limited to personal situations, but may also be necessary in professional/business context. For example, it may be inappropriate for a person to receive particular communiqu&#xe9;s while at work or while at other locations from certain parties (e.g., communiqu&#xe9;s from girlfriends or communiqu&#xe9;s from a particular websites or business).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">According to various embodiments, methods, systems, and computer program products are provided for obfuscating identity of a source entity affiliated with a communiqu&#xe9; that is directed to a receiving entity, the obfuscating being based on one or more conditional directives provided by the receiving entity. More particularly, the methods, systems, and computer program products may be designed to receive a first communiqu&#xe9; that is affiliated with a source entity (e.g., an entity that is the original or intermediate source for the first communiqu&#xe9;) and that is directed to a receiving entity; and to transmit to the receiving entity, in lieu of the first communiqu&#xe9;, a second communiqu&#xe9; that is provided in accordance with one or more conditional directives to conditionally obfuscate identity of the source entity, the one or more conditional directives provided by the receiving entity.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">For purposes of the following description, a &#x201c;communiqu&#xe9;&#x201d; may be in reference to any one of a variety of means for communicating including, for example, a telephone call, an email message, a text message (e.g., SMS or MMS), an instant message (IM), a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) call, a voice message, a video message, and so forth. As will be further described herein, a source entity may be in reference to any entity that may be the original or an intermediate source for a communiqu&#xe9;. Examples of a source entity include, for example, a source user who may be a human or robotic user and/or a source user device such as a cellular telephone, Smartphone, laptop or desktop computer, and so forth. In some cases, a source entity may be an organization such as a business or a trade or interest group. In some instances, a source entity may be a website.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">A receiving entity may be in reference to an entity that a communiqu&#xe9; is directed to (e.g., being sent to). Examples of a receiving entity include, for example, a receiving user who may be a human or robotic user and/or a receiving user device such a cellular telephone, a Smartphone, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, and so forth. In some cases, a receiving entity may be a voicemail service, a text messaging service, or a web-based application service.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">A &#x201c;conditional directive,&#x201d; as will be discussed herein, relates to an instruction or command to execute one or more actions when one or more conditions arise. For example, a conditional directive may be an instruction to intercept a first communiqu&#xe9; directed to a receiving entity and to transmit a second communiqu&#xe9;, in lieu of the first communiqu&#xe9;, to the receiving entity when a particular environmental condition arises with respect to the receiving entity (e.g., presence of a third party in the vicinity of the receiving entity).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>, and <b>1</b><i>b </i>illustrating an example environment <b>100</b> in which the methods, systems, circuitry, and computer program products in accordance with various embodiments may be implemented by a network device <b>10</b>. Among other things, the methods, systems, circuitry, and computer program products implemented by the network device <b>10</b> may be designed for receiving a first communiqu&#xe9; that is affiliated with a source entity and that is directed to a receiving entity; and for transmitting to the receiving entity, in lieu of the first communiqu&#xe9;, a second communiqu&#xe9; that is provided in accordance with one or more conditional directives to conditionally obfuscate identity of the source entity, the one or more conditional directives provided by the receiving entity. In some embodiments, the network device <b>10</b> may be located at one or more network nodes. For these embodiments, the network device <b>10</b> may include one or more network servers, one or more telephone switches, one or more telephone exchanges, and/or one or more routers. In some embodiments, the network device <b>10</b> may comprise of multiple network components such as in the case of cloud computing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">In some embodiments, the network device <b>10</b> may be designed to facilitate communication between different entities. For example, in some implementations, in which the network device <b>10</b> is a server, a router, a telephone switch, a telephone exchange, or some other network complement, the network device <b>10</b> may be designed to relay communiqu&#xe9;s between a source entity <b>20</b> and a receiving entity <b>30</b>. As briefly described above, a source entity <b>20</b> may comprise of a human or robotic source user <b>22</b> and/or a source user device <b>24</b> (e.g., a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a workstation, a Smartphone, a cellular telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or other computing/communication devices). From another perspective, the source entity <b>20</b> may be a website or an organization such as a business, a social group, a trade/technical group, or an interest group. In some cases, the source entity <b>20</b> may include a global positioning system (GPS) <b>26</b>, which may be part of the source user device <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">Similarly, a receiving entity <b>30</b> may comprise a receiving user <b>32</b> who may be a human or robotic user and/or a receiving user device <b>34</b> (e.g., a laptop computer, a workstation, a Smartphone, a PDA, a desktop computer, a cellular telephone, and so forth). In some cases, the receiving entity <b>30</b> may be a voicemail service, a text messaging service, a web-based application service, and so forth that may be associated with, for example, a receiving user <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">As briefly described above, the network device <b>10</b> may be designed to receive a first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> that is affiliated with a source entity <b>20</b> and that is directed to a receiving entity <b>30</b>. In some cases, the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may be received from the source entity <b>20</b> via one or more communication networks <b>40</b>. The one or more communication networks <b>40</b> may include one or more of a local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), a personal area network (PAN), a Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), public switched telephone network (PTSN), a general packet radio service (GPRS) network, a cellular network, a Client/Server network, a virtual private network (VPN), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">In some embodiments, the reception of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may involve the interception (e.g., seizing capturing, or interrupting) of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>. As will be further described herein, if the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is indeed intercepted, then the intercepting of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may be in accordance with one or more conditional directives <b>54</b> as provided by the receiving entity <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> to be received or intercepted by the network device <b>10</b> may be directed to (e.g., destined for or sent to) the receiving entity <b>30</b> and may be any one of a variety of electronic communications including, for example, a telephone call, a VoIP call, a voice mail or message, an email, a text message (e.g., SMS or MMS), an IM, a video message, and so forth. Depending on whether the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is an email, a telephone call, a VoIP call, a video call or some other type of communiqu&#xe9;, the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may include various types of data including, for example, header data (which may identify the sender, the destination address and/or receiving party, subject heading, routing or path, and so forth), message content data (e.g., audio data if the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is a telephone or VoIP call or text data if the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is an email or text message), and/or metadata.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">In various embodiments, the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may identify the source entity <b>20</b> by indicating the source entity <b>20</b> in the form of one or more representations of the source entity <b>20</b>. A representation of the source entity <b>20</b>, which may be included in the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> in the form of header data, message content data, or metadata, may be any one of a name (e.g., actual legal name or username), address (e.g., email address, uniform resource locator or URL, Internet Protocol or IP address, and so forth), telephone number, image (e.g., digital facial image or iconic figure), voice signature, or any other identifier that may be associated with the source entity <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">The received or intercepted first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may also identify the receiving entity <b>30</b> by indicating the receiving entity <b>30</b> in the form of one or more representations of the receiving entity <b>30</b>. For example, in order to ensure the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> reaches the correct destination, the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may include at least a representation of the receiving entity <b>30</b> in the form of a name, an address (e.g., email address, uniform resource locator or URL, Internet Protocol or IP address, and so forth), or a telephone number (e.g., in the case where the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is a telephone call) associated with the receiving entity <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">After receiving or intercepting the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>, the network device <b>10</b>, as briefly described above, may be designed to transmit to the receiving entity <b>30</b>, in lieu of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>, a second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> that is provided in accordance with one or more conditional directives <b>54</b> to conditionally obfuscate (e.g., hide or disguise) the identity of the source entity <b>20</b>, the one or more conditional directives <b>54</b> being provided by the receiving entity <b>30</b>. In other words, the network device <b>10</b> may provide to the receiving entity <b>30</b> a second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> instead of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> in order to hide or disguise the identity or affiliation of the source entity <b>20</b> with the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> in accordance with the conditional directives <b>54</b> of the receiving entity <b>30</b>. In various alternative embodiments, the one or more conditional directives <b>54</b> that are provided by the receiving entity <b>30</b> may be acquired from the receiving entity <b>30</b> or may be retrieved from a memory <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">In some cases, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be provided by modifying the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> in accordance with the one or more conditional directives <b>54</b> in order to obfuscate the identity of the affiliated source entity <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be a substitute communiqu&#xe9; that is a completely distinct and unrelated communiqu&#xe9; from the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>. Regardless of whether the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> is merely a modified version of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> or a completely distinct communiqu&#xe9; from the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may not be affiliated with the source entity <b>20</b>. In particular, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> in various embodiments may not include any representation of the source entity <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">In embodiments where the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> is provided by modifying the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>, the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> may be modified by replacing one or more representations of the source entity <b>20</b> that may be included in the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> with one or more locum tenentes (e.g., a Latin term for placeholders, substitutes, and so forth). For example, replacing one or more representative addresses or names of the source entity <b>20</b> included in the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> with one or more substitute addresses or names. Note that the one or more locum tenentes (e.g., substitute addresses or substitute names) that are to replace the representations (e.g., representative addresses and names) of the source entity <b>20</b> may be either fictional or non-fictional substitutes as will be further described herein. In cases where the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is an audio communiqu&#xe9; such as a telephone call or a VoIP call, the voice signature of the source entity <b>20</b> (e.g., source user <b>22</b>) may be modified as will be further described herein. A &#x201c;voice signature&#x201d; may be in reference to the distinct patterns of speech (e.g., tone, pitch, rhythm, accent, and so forth) that each person's voice may be associated with.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">In embodiments in which the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> is provided by providing a substitute communiqu&#xe9; that is a distinct communiqu&#xe9; unrelated to the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be a direct or indirect substitute for the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>. That is, in some embodiments, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be a direct substitute that is the same type of communiqu&#xe9; as the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>. For example replacing an email with another email. In other embodiments, however, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be an indirect substitute that is a different type of communiqu&#xe9; from the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>. For example, replacing a text message with a voice message. In some cases, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may have been previously provided by the receiving entity <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be a copy of a communiqu&#xe9; (which may have been sent by a third party) that was previously received by the receiving entity <b>30</b>. For these embodiments, the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> may be a copy of the most recently received communiqu&#xe9; received by the receiving entity <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">In various embodiments, the transmission of the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b>, in lieu of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>, by the network device <b>10</b> may be in response to the network device <b>10</b> at least determining that the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> includes data that associates the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> with the source entity <b>20</b>. For these embodiments, the data that associates the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> with the source entity <b>20</b> may be in the form of header data, message content data, and/or metadata. In some cases, in order to determine whether the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> includes data that associates the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> with the source entity <b>20</b>, the network device <b>10</b> may be designed to look for one or more representations (e.g., names, addresses, telephone numbers, images, voice signatures, and/or other identifiers) of the source entity <b>20</b> in the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>. Additionally, the network device <b>10</b> may be designed to determine that the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> is indeed directed to the receiving entity <b>30</b> prior to receiving (e.g., intercepting) the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b> or transmitting the second communiqu&#xe9; <b>52</b> to the receiving entity <b>30</b> in lieu of the first communiqu&#xe9; <b>50</b>.</p>

Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0203">It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0204">In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0205">In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C, etc.&#x201d; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x201c;a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x201d; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or &#x201c;A and B.&#x201d;</p>
