<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, a PD of a photoelectric conversion unit is constituted of a P-type well region (hereafter referred to as &#x201c;PWL&#x201d;) <b>102</b> and a PN junction in an N region <b>103</b> on an N-type substrate <b>101</b>. Reference numeral <b>107</b> denotes an N+ region serving as a source-drain region of a source follower MOS transistor which is a part of a circuit for amplifying a signal charge generated by a PD.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the case of the APS of a prior art, the N region <b>103</b> of a PD serving as a photoelectric conversion unit is one of large sources for respectively generating a dark current. A dark current component generated nearby a separation layer <b>105</b> on the fringe of the N region <b>103</b> is present in addition of a component generated on the entire surface of the N region <b>103</b>. Therefore, the N region <b>103</b> of the PD is separated from the separation layer <b>105</b> which is a generation region of the dark current component by a certain distance. A P+ region (channel stop region) <b>104</b> having a high P-type impurity concentration is formed between the separation layer <b>105</b> and the N region of the PD in order not to make a depletion layer extending from the N region <b>103</b> of the PD reach the separation layer. An example of the configuration is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H10-308507. Moreover, in US2003160295A, it is reported that a dark current is extremely generated under a poly-wiring on a separation layer. The channel stop region <b>104</b> raises a P-type concentration of a channel stop region under a separation layer in which a poly-wiring (or poly-gate) <b>106</b> is set and realizes an effect for restraining a dark current by forming a concentration barrier on a path to the N region <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, even by forming the channel stop region, when deepening a concentration profile of a PWL and using a PWL structure for improving a quantum efficiency of photoelectric conversion by a PD, a new technical problem is found that a dark current increases.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a dark current increases at a rate of more than 10% by changing a concentration profile of PWL<sub>1 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>1</b> to PWL<sub>2 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>2</b>. Moreover, by setting a profile of PWL<sub>3 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>3</b>, the dark current increases at a rate of tens of percents. This is a phenomenon which cannot be explained by a conventional idea that a dark current is generated because a depletion layer contacts with a separation layer. Moreover, when a well is deepened, a problem further occurs that the number of charges leaked from adjacent pixels increases. Specifically, a problem of deterioration of a blooming phenomenon or color mixture occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to greatly restrain a dark current, blooming and color mixture when the concentration profile of the PWL is deep and a PWL structure for improving a quantum efficiency of photoelectric conversion by a PD is used.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, the principle and means of the present invention are described below in detail. As a result of earnestly studying the above problems, the present inventor et al. found the following solving means.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is useful to set the above P-type semiconductor region for channel stop slightly separately from a separation layer at the MOS transistor side because the impurity concentration of the region is high. When the P-type semiconductor region is formed by contacting with the separation layer at the MOS transistor side, a narrow channel phenomenon occurs, the effective channel width of the MOS transistor decreases and it is difficult to form a fine pixel. Therefore, a region free from P-type semiconductor region is left even under the poly-wiring <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> due to the problem of the layout. Conventionally, it has been considered that most of the current generated in this region is discharged to the N+ region <b>107</b> of the MOS transistor by passing through the path <b>2</b>. However, it is found that some of the current is discharged to the N-type substrate <b>101</b> by the path <b>3</b> and some of the current is discharged to the N region <b>103</b> of the PD by passing through the downside of the P-type semiconductor region. Particularly, in the case of a PWL structure having a deep concentration profile, a relation between a PWL structure and a dark current that the dark current is increased by a path <b>4</b> is found.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">More minute description is made. For example, among electrons generated in the poly-wiring <b>106</b>, <b>100</b> (unit is optional) flow through paths <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> other than the path <b>2</b>. This component is superimposed on the dark current component generated on the entire surface. However, in the case of the concentration profile of PWL<sub>2 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>2</b>, 80 flows through the path <b>3</b> and remaining 20 flows through the path <b>4</b>. As a result, the dark current component increases. In the case of the structure of PWL<sub>3 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>3</b>, however, because a concentration barrier is formed in a deep portion, the path <b>3</b> is greatly decreased and as a result, the path <b>4</b> may increase up to approx. 50.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Therefore, in the case of an image pickup device of the present invention having a plurality of pixels including a photoelectric conversion unit for converting incoming light into a signal charge, an amplifying unit for amplifying the signal charge generated by the photoelectric conversion unit and a transfer unit for transferring the signal charge from the photoelectric conversion unit to the amplifying unit, the photoelectric conversion unit is formed of a first-conductivity-type first semiconductor region, and a second-conductivity-type second semiconductor region, a second-conductivity-type third semiconductor region is formed on at least a part of the portion between the photoelectric conversion unit of a first pixel and the photoelectric conversion unit of a second pixel adjacent to the first pixel, a first-conductivity-type fourth semiconductor region having an impurity concentration higher than that of the first semiconductor region is formed between the photoelectric conversion unit and the third semiconductor region and formed at a position deeper than the fourth semiconductor region between the photoelectric conversion unit and the third semiconductor region, and a first-conductivity-type fifth semiconductor region having an impurity concentration higher than that of the first semiconductor region is included.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this case, &#x201c;deep&#x201d; is a degree of a distance from a principal plane serving as a photoreceiving surface of an image pickup device to another principal plane facing the former principal plane. Moreover, &#x201c;horizontal direction&#x201d; is a direction orthogonal to the depth direction.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereafter, specific embodiments of the present invention are described. However, a portion common to that of a conventional device is provided with a same symbol.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top layout view of pixels of the image pickup device of the Embodiment 1 of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional structural view along the line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference numeral <b>204</b> denotes a P-type semiconductor region (P+ guard layer), peculiar to the Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the present invention greatly decreases the dark current in accordance with a model for generating the dark current by using the following structure. As such configuration, (1) the P-type semiconductor region <b>204</b> is made to extend up to a position nearby the N-type substrate <b>101</b>. Moreover, it is allowed to use a structure including at least a second P-type semiconductor region <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> at a position deeper than a first P-type semiconductor region <b>204</b>-<b>1</b>. Furthermore, it is allowed to include a third P-type semiconductor region <b>204</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, a configuration is used in which (2) the N+ region <b>107</b> is formed between the semiconductor region <b>204</b> and the semiconductor region <b>204</b> of an adjacent pixel. The N+ region <b>107</b> is an N+ region serving as a source-drain region of a source-follower MOS transistor or the like used for amplification of a signal charge. In this case, an amplifying unit is formed between pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this case, a P-type semiconductor region and N+ region are used. However, it is enough that a P-type semiconductor region is an impurity region having a conductivity type reverse to that of the region shown by <b>103</b> for forming a photoelectric conversion unit and storing charges. Moreover, it is enough that an N+ region is an impurity region having a conductivity type reverse to that of the impurity region. In this case, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of pixels (2&#xd7;2=4 pixels in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The structure of (1) restrains a flow to the path <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the structure of (2) accelerates a flow to the path <b>2</b> to resultantly decrease the flow to the path <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Particularly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in the case of the PWL concentration profile PWL<sub>3 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>3</b> (concentration profile is deeper than a conventional one or a concentration peak is present at a deep position (little grade well structure)), the path <b>3</b> is greatly restrained. Therefore, the number of cases in which electrons which must originally flow through the path <b>3</b> flows through the path <b>4</b> is increased. However, it is possible to greatly restrain the path <b>4</b> by a configuration having not only the structure (1) but also the structure of (2).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> are sectional structural views (i) and (ii) of pixels for explaining problems of a prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, unless an N+ region is formed in a device separation portion at the right side of the right pixel, the rate of electrons which finally flow into the N region <b>103</b> of a photodiode increases. Moreover, even if the P-type semiconductor region at the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is set like <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, it is impossible to prevent flowing into the N region <b>103</b> of the photodiode because there is no sealing effect though there is a certain effect.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, a phenomenon in which the number of charges leaking from adjacent pixels is increased is described below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the case of a shallow PWL structure, it is not necessary to consider the path <b>6</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> but the path <b>5</b> is mainly considered. Because the path <b>5</b> is attracted into an N+ region by setting the N+ region, the blooming phenomenon and color mixture are very small.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, by using a deep PWL structure, a rate at which the path <b>6</b> is formed increases. Particularly, by using the structure of the PWL<sub>3 </sub><b>102</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a path of dark current to the N-type substrate <b>101</b> is restrained because there is a concentration barrier. Therefore, charges flowing into adjacent pixels by passing through the path <b>6</b> increases. In the case of the above structure of (1), the P-type semiconductor region serves as a concentration barrier (potential barrier) when charges flow into adjacent pixels to restrain leak of the charges into adjacent pixels. Description is made below by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In the case of the structure shown at the central portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the versatility for setting a concentration is lowered because a MOS transistor also serves as a well through the P-type semiconductor region <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> has the function of restraining charges from flowing into adjacent pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">However, to leak into adjacent pixels by a structure in which a P well for providing a channel unit of a MOS transistor for forming pixels is held by the P-type semiconductor regions <b>204</b>, it is necessary to exceed two concentration barriers. Moreover, before exceeding the concentration barriers (potential barriers) of the P-type semiconductor region <b>204</b> of adjacent pixels, the frequency of exceeding the concentration barriers (potential barriers) of the P-type semiconductor <b>204</b> is greatly restrained because the N+ region <b>107</b> is present and dark current is absorbed into the N+ region <b>107</b>. In this case, source-drain region of a transistor is formed and the impurity concentration of a P well for providing the channel region of the source-drain region is set to a low value compared to that of the P-type semiconductor region.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional structural view of a pixel of an image pickup device of Embodiment 2.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has a P-type semiconductor region <b>304</b>-<b>1</b> set over the lower portion of a MOS transistor in an adjacent photoelectric conversion unit under a P-type semiconductor region <b>304</b>. In the case of the P-type semiconductor region <b>304</b>-<b>1</b>, a concentration is set separately from the well of the MOS transistor and it is possible to form a high concentration barrier (potential barrier). It is possible to accelerate discharge of a few charges exceeding the concentration barrier (potential barrier) to the N+ region <b>107</b> and further restrain the charges from leaking into adjacent pixels by optimizing the concentration profile of the P-type semiconductor region <b>304</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top layout view of pixels of an image pickup device of Embodiment 3.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, by forming a P-type semiconductor region <b>404</b> into an annular shape and setting the region so that a photoelectric conversion unit and charge voltage conversion unit (FD) are included in the region, it is possible to provide an image pickup device in which dark current, blooming and color mixture are further restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustration showing paths generated due to dark current, color mixture and blooming.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when setting a P-type semiconductor region <b>504</b> as described above, paths <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>1</b> are left and a slight dark current, blooming and color mixture are left. However, by using the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the paths <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>1</b> are restrained by the P-type semiconductor region <b>404</b> and it is possible to use the structure as a discharge destination of excessive charges and dark-current charges by setting a charge voltage conversion unit (FD) in a region covered with the P-type semiconductor region <b>404</b>. Moreover, by setting this portion to a fixed voltage during a storage period, it is possible to discharge many charges. When there is no discharge port, paths are restrained by a concentration barrier (potential barrier). However, when charges are excessively generated, they exceed the concentration barrier and flow into adjacent pixels. By setting the discharge port, excessive charges are discharged and it is possible to greatly restrain the paths <b>4</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">That is, it is important for the present invention to set not only a concentration barrier but also a charge discharge port and use a structure in which excessive charges easily flow into the discharge port.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">This example has a configuration in which a photoelectric conversion unit and an amplifying unit are set in the same PWL.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are concentration profiles of PWLs of this example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The middle-concentration profile PWL<sub>1 </sub><b>602</b>-<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> has a conventional PWL structure and the PWL<sub>2 </sub><b>602</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> has a PWL structure of this example. By deepening the structure compared to a conventional well structure, it is possible to capture charges generated in a deeper portion by a PD and thereby improve sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A problem of dark current or color mixture influences a performance like the present invention in the case of a visible-light sensor mounted on a digital camera or video. The visible-light sensor is designed by putting weight on the visual sensitivity of a person and preferably, the peak of a spectral sensitivity in a semiconductor layer is set so that a wavelength becomes equal to approx. 550 nm. That is, it is ideal that the optical signal divide shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> becomes approx. 4 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Therefore, the present invention is particularly effective for a visible-light sensor because of its performance, the depth of a PWL is ideally 4 &#x3bc;m and a range of 1 to 6 &#x3bc;m is a target of its substantial scope.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a concentration profile a P-type semiconductor region formed under a device separation region which is a characteristic requirement of the present invention. Because a PWL structure becomes deep, a first P-type semiconductor region <b>604</b>-<b>1</b> does not reach the &#x201c;boundary depth (optical signal divide) in which optical charges flow to the N region <b>103</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Therefore, in the case of this example, a second P-type semiconductor region <b>604</b>-<b>2</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To extend the first P-type semiconductor region up to &#x201c;C&#x201d;, spread in the horizontal direction becomes a problem and it is difficult to miniaturize pixels. The N region of a PD is substantially decreased by the influence of the horizontal spread. Therefore, in the case of this example, a second P-type semiconductor region is formed by ion implantation energy different from formation of the first P-type semiconductor region at a position deeper than the first P-type semiconductor region.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thus, according to this embodiment, by deepening a PWL and thereby increasing the number of carriers which can be captured by a photodiode, it is possible to lower dark current up to a level almost equal to the case in which the PWL is shallow.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a sectional structural view of a pixel of an image pickup device of Example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A case of forming a first P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b> and a second P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> and a case of forming a first P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b> and a second P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> and a third semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The feature of this example is that horizontal widths of the First P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>, second P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> and third P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>2</b> are kept in a relation of <b>704</b>&#x3c;<b>704</b>-<b>1</b>&#x3c;<b>704</b>-<b>2</b>. Preferably, the second P-type semiconductor region reaches &#x201c;C&#x201d; as described for the Example 1. However, even if the second P-type semiconductor region does not reach &#x201c;C&#x201d;, a characteristic is effectively improved by forming the second P-type semiconductor region in a process (including a different ion implanting condition) separate from the case of the first P-type semiconductor region. The P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b> serving as the first P-type semiconductor region contacts with the N region of a MOS transistor or PD. Therefore, the horizontal width and the concentration of the region <b>704</b> are restricted and thereby, it is impossible to take the width and concentration sufficiently largely.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Compared to the case of extending the first P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b> in the state having the above restriction in a deep direction, the second P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> is formed separately from the first P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b> (formed in a separate process). Thereby, it is possible to set a concentration and a width without deteriorating the performance of the above-described MOS transistor or photodiode. That is, it is possible to set the concentration of the second P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> highly than the concentration of the P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b> and the horizontal width of the region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> widely than the horizontal width of the region <b>704</b>. A width can be widened by using a separate mask and thereby forming a semiconductor region. Moreover, when using the same mask as the case of the first P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>, it is enough to form the second P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>1</b> by using a diagonal ion implantation method.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Moreover, it is preferable that the third P-type semiconductor region <b>704</b>-<b>2</b> is also set under an amplifying unit. Furthermore, the region <b>704</b>-<b>2</b> extends up to a part of the lower portion of the N region of a PD.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">This example has a structure capable of setting optical charges present at a deep position to the N region <b>103</b> of the PD and correctly capturing or discharging charges not used for forming an image of dark current or color mixture charge from or to the N+ region <b>107</b>. Moreover, the structure is preferable from the viewpoint of fabrication. That is, when forming a P-type semiconductor region at a deep position and using it as a barrier, it is necessary to implant ions at a high energy. In this case, however, it is necessary to thicken a resist. As a result, a resolution capacity is inevitably deteriorated and fine resolution is difficult. By using the structure of this example, it is possible to avoid the above problem of fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The effect is confirmed even by the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. That is, it is possible to sufficiently obtain the effect of even the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, as described above, by applying the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is possible to obtain a larger effect. Moreover, it is possible to widen its scope.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> are concentration profile diagrams of a P-type semiconductor region functioning as a barrier to a signal charge, formed between N+ regions present between photoelectric conversion units adjacent to a PWL and a photoelectric conversion unit of Example 3.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a concentration profile of the PWL structure of this example. The PWL is fabricated by repeatedly implanting a plurality of ions having energies different from each other. PWL<sub>3 </sub><b>802</b>-<b>3</b> and PWL<sub>4 </sub><b>802</b>-<b>4</b> are formed of a plurality of wells (semiconductor regions) respectively having an impurity concentration peak.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows a concentration profile of a P-type semiconductor region functioning as a barrier. The profiles are formed in accordance with the implanting energy condition same as the case of the PWL. The fabrication process is formed in accordance with the LOCOS method in order to form a separation layer after implanting ions into the PWL and P-type semiconductor region. Reference numerals <b>804</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>804</b>-<b>4</b> show first to fourth P-type semiconductor regions. A thin line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows the <b>802</b>-<b>4</b> PWL<sub>4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The concentration profiles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> are obtained by forming a separation layer by the LOCOS method and then, implanting ions into a PWL and P-type semiconductor region though an implanting energy condition same as that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is used. In any case, a preferable characteristic is obtained in which dark current, blooming and color mixture are greatly restrained. Particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, in profiles of PWLs, an extreme value is present in concentration and it is possible to raise a concentration barrier of a minimum value portion in which charges easily stay.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Moreover, in the case of this example, the fourth P-type semiconductor region <b>804</b>-<b>4</b> does not reach an optical-signal divide. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>, optical charges generated in a region in which a P-type semiconductor region is insufficient immediately flow into a PWL having a low concentration because of their concentration gradient. Therefore, leak to adjacent pixels at this portion is sufficiently small and it is possible to confirm that even the structure shown for this example has a sufficient restrain effect.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">This example has one more characteristic. By forming a PWL and a P-type semiconductor region in accordance with a plurality of ion implantation steps, it is possible to select a proper concentration at each depth and derive a higher sensor performance. Specifically, a P-type impurity region having a high concentration present at the lower portion of the N region <b>103</b> of the photodiode in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is used. It is preferable that the impurity region has a concentration of 5E16 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or more in order to obtain a large handling charge value. Moreover, it is preferable that a P-type impurity region located at the deepest position has a concentration of 1E17 cm<sup>3 </sup>or more in order to improve the sensitivity. Moreover, it is preferable that a P-type impurity region present between them has a concentration of &#x2155; to 1/10 in order to flow signal charges into a PD compared to the concentration of a P-type impurity region located as the deepest position.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Moreover, to improve the sensor performance, it is preferable to similarly design a P-type semiconductor region correspondingly to a designed PWL structure. Setting second and third P-type semiconductor regions independently of the first P-type semiconductor region like the case of this example is particularly effective for improvement of the performance of a sensor having a plurality of wells respectively having an impurity concentration peak and formed at different depths. In this case, the PWL and the P-type semiconductor region functioning as a barrier are formed at almost the same depth.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">An approximate value of each concentration is described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>, PWLs have surface concentrations of 1E16 to 3E17 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>because it is necessary to be coexistence with a transistor. The concentration of a PWL at the deepest position is up to 1E18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>and an intermediate PWL has a concentration smaller than that of the PWL at the deepest position, preferably &#xbd; or less. A trend of improvement is obtained when the concentration is not &#xbd; or less. The above structure makes it possible to more efficiently collect optical charges in a PD. Moreover, the guard region is preferably more effective when the region has a concentration two times or more higher than that of each PWL. However, by raising a concentration, a trend of improvement is obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLE 5</heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The effect described for the Example 3 is more minutely described below by using the present example.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref> are illustrations for explaining this example. In the case of this example, the concentration profile of a deep guard ring is described. A reference numeral <b>1608</b> denotes p+ region. A reference numeral <b>1603</b> denotes N type region forming a photodiode. A reference numeral <b>1604</b>-<b>4</b> denotes a concentration profile of a guard ring. A reference numeral <b>1601</b> denotes a concentration profile under a photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Optical charges generated at a deep position by incoming light almost isotropically expand by diffusion transport when a concentration is unlimitedly uniform. That is, because the generated optical charges are excessive charges, they isotropically expand in order to uniform the excessive carriers. In fact, however, the photodiode side is depleted due to the PN junction of the photodiode and an electron concentration is low. Therefore, the current quantity by diffusion transport is increased due to the electron concentration difference. Therefore, most optical carriers reach the photodiode but several % of them leaks to adjacent pixels. To restrain the leak of them, it is necessary to make optical carriers easily flow to the photodiode. Therefore, in the case of this example, a potential gradient is formed by providing a gradient to impurity concentrations so as to flow to the photodiode side by the electric field. Diffusion current is D*[dn/dx], D is a diffusion constant, n is a carrier concentration, drift current is &#x3bc;*n*E, and E is an electric field.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Moreover, when considering that a general carrier generation quantity by light is up to 100,000 electrons/pixel/sec, a sufficient effect is obtained by setting an impurity concentration gradient of approx. one digit.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this case, an important idea is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref>, a continuous line <b>1601</b> shows a concentration profile under a photodiode and a broken line <b>1604</b>-<b>4</b> is a concentration profile of a guard ring of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the case of the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, though color mixture is almost restrained, a small quantity flows into adjacent pixels through the region F.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">To further restrain color mixture, it is necessary to deepen the guard ring up to the vicinity of the position C like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>. To realize the above mentioned, it is necessary to perform ion-implantation to the guard ring at a high energy. That is, an advanced technique is necessary which requires resist having a large film thickness and minute patterning.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">This example uses a structure in which concentration differences are concentrated on a deep position, a concentration gradient of an intermediate layer is decreased by a value equivalent to concentration of concentration differences, and color mixture in the region is restrained by a deep guard ring like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">That is, the concentration profile of the photodiode is roughly divided into three regions as shown below.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">&#x3c;1&#x3e; Deep region having a large concentration gradient (Preferably, 1 digit/1.5 &#x3bc;m)</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">&#x3c;2&#x3e; Intermediate region having no concentration gradient or a small concentration gradient</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">&#x3c;3&#x3e; Shallow region in which photodiode is present</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As a result, diffusion in cross direction is restrained by a potential gradient at a deep portion and an intermediate layer can restrain color mixture by a guard ring. Specifically, C is set to 3.5 &#x3bc;m and formed through ion implantation at approx. 2.5 MeV of boron, and a peak concentration is set to approx. 2e17 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. An intermediate region is realized at a position of approx. 2 &#x3bc;m and a deep guard ring is formed through ion implantation of approx. 1.5 MeV of boron.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As a result, a high color-mixture restraining force can be obtained by applying comparatively easy middle-degree ion implantation to the deep guard ring.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Then, in the case of the concentration of a guard ring in an intermediate region, it is possible to restrain up to color mixture of approx. 1% or less by having a concentration at least approx. 5 times, preferably 10 times higher for a width of 1 &#x3bc;m of the guard ring to the concentration under a photodiode. Particularly as one characteristic of a deep guard ring of the present invention, a wide guard ring region is formed. This deep guard ring can be set under a MOS transistor serving as a surface device. This is because a higher restraint effect can be obtained when the deep guard ring has the same concentration as a conventional shallow-position guard ring and it is possible to restrain a concentration in order to restrain a damage to a white defect or transistor for the same restraint effect.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">It is important for the present invention that a higher color-mixture restraint effect can be obtained by forming a deep guard ring under a MOS transistor or electrode. However, the electrode is not indispensable as a sectional structure but it is enough that an N+ electrode is set to a part of the sectional structure. Only setting a wide guard ring provides a color-mixture prevention effect. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, though a region A or region B is a region where an electrode of a MOS transistor is not formed, a color-mixture prevention effect by the present invention is sufficiently obtained by setting a wide deep guard ring under the region. When an N+ electrode is formed even at a part of the deep guard ring region, carriers causing color mixture can finally flow to the electrode. A reference numeral <b>1703</b> denotes N type region forming a photodiode. A reference numeral <b>1704</b>-<b>4</b> denotes a concentration profile of a guard ring. A reference numeral <b>1706</b> denotes a poly silicon wiring. A reference numeral <b>1707</b> denotes n+ region of the MOS transistor.</p>
