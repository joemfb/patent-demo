<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a kind of high strength polyethylene fiber, especially a kind of colored high strength polyethylene fiber, and their preparation method and application.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">High strength polyethylene (HS-PE) fibers are well known synthetic fibers with high strength and modulus, and are produced from ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with a molecular weight higher than 1,000,000. Right now, HS-PE fibers, Aramid fibers and carbon fibers are considered as three high performance fibers in the world. Due to its high strength, high modulus and low density, the UHMWPE fiber plays an important role not only in modern warfare, defense equipment and aerospace field, but also in civil fields.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, HS-PE fibers are mostly produced from UHMWPE by the so-called gel-spinning and ultra-heat drawing processes. However, during these two processes, the UHMWPE, as long, flexible macromolecule chains, has a tendency to be entangled together. In order to avoid this problem, the UHMWPE has to be dissolved in a solvent, which could enlarge the distance of macromolecule chains by diluting the concentration of the UHMWPE. HS-PE fibers with extended chains could be obtained by ultra-heat drawing and molecule tropism of UHMWPE gel precursor fibers with moderate macromolecule entanglement points. The method mainly has five steps: (1) getting a spinning solution by solving UHMWPE in a solvent; (2) getting solvent-embedded wet precursor fibers with moderate molecular chain entanglements by extruding the solution from a spinneret hole and quenching curing in air or water; (3) removing the solvent by certain extraction solvent; (4) drying the precursor fibers in an oven; and (5) getting HS-PE fibers with extended chain crystal by ultra-heat drawing of the precursor fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent No. 7-238416 discloses a method for preparing HS-PE fibers by evaporating a solvent actively during a dry-spinning process, and its specific process includes dissolving UHMWPE (5&#x2dc;50%) in a volatile solvent (95&#x2dc;50%) first and then transferring precursor fibers obtained by thermal extrusion through a spinning cylinder. During this process, more than 40% of the solvent is evaporated by continually purging stable hot air flow into the cylinder. Residual solvent can be removed during a heat-drawing process. In this patent, the spinning adhesion problem could be solved by forming semi-dry precursor fibers through actively removing partial solvent in the spinning process. However, because the solvent evaporation happens in both spinning and heat-drawing processes, fireproofing and explosion-proofing and solvent recovery must be carried out separately during the spinning and drawing processes. Obviously, these operations increase the investment in equipment and make the solvent recovery more difficult, which are unfavorable for large-scale industrial production.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">High-strength is the main goal of the prior art processing technology, resulting in HS-PE fibers which have tensile strength mostly larger than 30 cN/dtex and are in white color. Due to the complexity of the production process and high price, HS-PE fibers are usually used in military field. However, polyethylene fibers with a tensile strength ranging from 15 to 30 cN/dtex could already meet the requirements of applications in civil fields. Therefore, it is a waste of fiber performance and resources to use polyethylene fibers with a tensile strength higher than 30 cN/dtex in civil fields. And the increase of cost limits the application of polyethylene fibers with a tensile strength higher than 30 cN/dtex in civil fields. In addition, in certain application fields, such as rope nets, there is usually requirements for colors. However, it is difficult to color these fibers by general methods because there are no other functional groups in UHMWPE's macromolecular chains except for the C&#x2014;H bond, with which is hard to combine dye molecules. No work has been reported on methods for preparing colored HS-PE fibers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One objective of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing colored HS-PE fibers, which not only make civil products more attractive and easier to distinguish, but also provide better hidden effects in the military field.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, a kind of colored HS-PE fiber is provided, which is characterized in that:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">the surface of the HS-PE fiber is in multicolor, grey or black; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">its tensile strength ranges from 15 to 50 cN/dtex, the tensile elastic modulus is from 400 to 1000 cN/dtex, the filament number ranges from 4 to 5 dtex and the elongation at break is smaller than 3.5%.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">When the tensile strength of the colored HS-PE fiber of the present invention ranges from 15 to 30 cN/dtex, it can be generally applied in, but not limited to, the following civil fields: (1) marine engineering, such as ropes, cables, and sailing and fishing gears; (2) sports equipment, such as safety helmets, skiing boards, sailing boards, fishing rods, rackets, super-light parts of bicycles, gliding boards and aircrafts; (3) biological materials, for example, fiber reinforced composites in denture materials, medical grafts, plastic surgeries and other clinical usages due to the advantages such as good biocompatibility and durability, high stability and allergies-absence, and medical gloves and other medical facilities as well; (4) industrial materials, such as pressure vessels, conveyers, filter materials, and car bumpers with the fiber and its composite materials. In addition, the fiber and its composite materials can be used in walls, partition structures and other building materials. The toughness of concrete can be improved when the fiber is used as the reinforced cement composite materials.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">When the tensile strength of the colored HS-PE fiber of the present invention ranges from 30 to 50 cN/dtex, it can be generally applied in, but not limited to, the following fields: (1) defense equipment, such as protective clothing, helmets, bullet-proof materials, helicopters, protective boards of tanks and armored ships, protective shells of radars, missile shield, bullet-proof vests, anti-thorn clothing, and shields; (2) aerospace applications, such as tip structure of spacecrafts and aircrafts, and hydroplane.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">The usage of the fiber of the present invention is basically similar to that of fibers obtained by the prior art method when it is applied in the above-mentioned fields.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Sometimes it is necessary to make HS-PE fibers in different colors to facilitate collocation, distinction, aesthetics and marketing in civil fields, and to realize hidden function by means of colorization in the military field. However, the HS-PE fiber obtained by the existing technology is white, which greatly restricts its applications in the above-mentioned fields. And this problem can be solved by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">Colored HS-PE fibers are produced by a gel spinning process including swelling and dissolving UHMWPE in a solvent to prepare precursor fibers. The method is characterized in the addition of an inorganic pigment with particle size smaller than 1 &#x3bc;m, the weight ratio of which to the UHMWPE is 1.0 to 3.0% based on the weight of UHMWPE.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The method for preparing the colored HS-PE fiber is described in detail as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">(1) Preparing a Spinning Solution</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">A UHMWPE with a molecular weight higher than 3,000,000 is chosen as the basic fiber component, and white mineral oil is employed as a solvent. These two materials are mixed first, the weight ratio of which may range from 1:7 to 1:9, and then, inorganic pigments are added into the solution of UHMWPE and mineral oil.
