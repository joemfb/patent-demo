<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A shoe includes a first plate and a second plate that are located in a forefoot portion of the shoe between an upper and an outsole of the shoe, and one or more springs for biasing the first plate and the second plate apart from each other. A device for a shoe includes a first plate and a second plate that are installable in a forefoot portion of the shoe, and an energy return member positioned between the first plate and the second plate. A method of using a shoe includes applying, with a foot, a force on at least one of two plates that is positioned in a forefoot portion of a shoe, so as to move the two plates together and increase a loading of a spring, and launching the foot due to the two plates being moved apart by the spring as the foot is being lifted.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate in general to footwear, and particularly to energy absorption and return systems for use in footwear.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,437,110 and 5,596,819, a discussion was provided of the desirability of providing adjustable foot-strike energy shock absorption and return. Those patents disclosed the use of a device disposed in the midsole of a shoe under the heel. The device used an adjustable mechanism to store and return to the wearer's foot shock energy experienced during walking or running.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Those prior patents discussed a variety of related art, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,486,964, 4,506,460, 2,357,281, 2,394,281, 4,709,489, 4,815,221, 4,854,057, and 4,878,300 as disclosing a variety of spring systems for shoes that related to heel-strike energy absorption and return. Since the time of those patents, other patents and applications have addressed a variety of spring mechanisms for shoes. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,282,814, 6,751,891, 6,865,824, 6,886,274, 7,159,338, 7,219,447, 7,287,340, and 7,290,354, as well as published applications 2005/0166422 and 2009/0064536.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A step forward or stride consists of a dynamic process sometimes referred to as gait. The science surrounding gait is extensive, but embodiments of the present invention focus upon that aspect that a layman might identify as toe-off when jumping. Gait can be broken down into three distinct phases as follows: (1) the contact phase which begins with heel strike and continues until the foot is flat on the surface, (2) the mid-stance phase beginning from the foot flat and a shift of body weight and continuing until the heel rises, and, lastly, (3) the propulsion phase where toe-off (or jumping) would occur.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The related art does not focus upon the propulsion phase of the gait cycle. Most of the devices are directed to the contact phase and use heel-related mechanisms to store and return energy. Because energy stored in the contact phase via a heel spring is dissipated by the time the propulsion phase begins, heel springs have not proven effective for energy storage and return. Some of the related art also use springs under the ball of the foot. In addition to not being effective in the propulsion phase, such devices can have adverse physiological effects on the foot if not properly positioned.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a shoe <b>5</b> is provided with a device <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The device <b>10</b> is mounted in an outsole <b>22</b> of the shoe <b>5</b>, as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>, the device <b>10</b> includes a top plate <b>12</b> and a bottom plate <b>14</b> that are hinged together via a pin <b>18</b> (or similar means). In various embodiments, the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are designed such that they have a very limited motion around a hinge axis. Also, in various embodiments, in a neutral position the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are parallel to each other, forming what might be explained as a duck-bill, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. In some embodiments, the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> have a limited motion that allows movement toward one another but not opening beyond (any more than) the two plates being parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, various materials could be used for the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, including polymer, block polymer, monomer, etc., that exhibit properties conducive to use in processes known as injection molding, and in some cases extrusion and the like, or other types of molding such as compression molding, etc. In various embodiments, material is selected for rigidity, because in practice the device <b>10</b> will be subjected to tremendous force as a wearer goes through a gait cycle ending up on the balls of the feet. At the apex of a propulsion phase of the gait cycle, the device <b>10</b> will be subjected to several times the wearer's body weight as the device <b>10</b> is &#x201c;loading&#x201d;. During this loading, it may be desirable that the device <b>10</b> does not deform under stress. Such deformity may result in loss of load factor resulting in diminished return of energy and a corresponding decrease in the actual intended performance. As such, thin steel is potentially usable to reinforce other materials to ensure the requisite rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A variety of hinge mechanisms could be used with the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, such as a barrel hinge, butt hinge, living hinge, plain hinge, or others. In various embodiments, a barrel hinge can include molded features to control a movement of the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> around its axis, to prevent it from springing open, such as a slot and key feature, or notched stop. A barrel hinge would form the two plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> into a single device with a single axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>, in various embodiments a helical torsion spring <b>16</b> may encircle the hinge pin <b>18</b>, and may bias the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> apart consistent with a strength of the particular spring utilized. In various embodiments, the helical torsion spring <b>16</b> is constructed from a metal wire or rod twisted or formed into a helical coil. In such embodiments, each end of the coil may be biased against the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Such torsion springs may be similar to those shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,197. That patent shows a coil spring member with arms that provide an opposing bias. Adjustment of the torsion may be achieved via an inner coil which acts to control the deformation of an outer coil. In various embodiments of the present invention, a torsion spring could be located within a barrel hinge formed as an integral member of the top and bottom plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Once the device <b>10</b> has been properly assembled and installed within the forepart of footwear, and the wearer of the footwear moves into an apex of a gait cycle (i.e. toe-off in jumping), the force applied to the top plate <b>12</b> will push the two plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> together. This will increase the torque loading of the helical torsion spring <b>16</b>, and provide the wearer with a launch factor equal to a release of torque from the helical torsion spring <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In various embodiments, between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> there can be lightweight foam <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. This component's purpose is basically as filler, and may extend partially (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) or completely (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. In various embodiments, the device <b>10</b> may perform optimally in a case where a space between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> is void or empty. However, given the normal spectrum of use for footwear, it might not be desirable to leave the space empty in many instances. Dirt, mud, water, snow, ice, etc. (debris) may find its way within the space and could significantly decrease or even destroy the function of the device. Therefore, various embodiments include a means of blocking debris from entering the space between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Because the device <b>10</b> of various embodiments would perform optimally without any material between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, it may be desirable for performance reasons to include a material that is lightweight, reflects good tear strength values, and that possesses specific compression properties. In addition to the criteria above, the ideal candidate foam <b>20</b> in various embodiments would compress under very low loading and compress to 30% of original thickness gauge&#x2014;or more. Based upon these criteria, the foam <b>20</b> would preferably be of an open cell type. Thus, polyurethane, rubber, rubber latex, PVC or polyethylene can be used in various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">One purpose of the foam <b>20</b> is to avoid debris collecting between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The foam <b>20</b> may slightly inhibit the performance of the device <b>10</b> in various embodiments, since it adds resistance in the loading phase of performance. As such, in an alternative embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the foam <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be replaced with a front shroud <b>30</b> on one of the plates <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is shown attached to the top plate <b>12</b>). In various embodiments, the shroud <b>30</b> acts to keep debris from entering between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, and wraps around a perimeter of the toe area.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, in various embodiments the foam <b>20</b> may be reduced in size or removed completely to allow the use of one or more other springs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The springs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> assist the torsion spring <b>16</b> in providing propulsion to the wearer of the shoe. In various embodiments, such additional springs could be wave springs as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,987, or the like. Wave springs are particularly advantageous because the energy return is almost entirely axial, which would serve to press the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> apart after compression. The springs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> could be attached directly to the top and bottom plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in various embodiments. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in various embodiments an energy return or rebound material <b>48</b> may be disposed between the plates <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the energy return material <b>48</b> comprises rubber, Hytrel&#xae;, or the like, and creates an additional energy return effect.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, in various embodiments the top plate <b>12</b> and the bottom plate <b>14</b> are manufactured as separate units and may have portions in contact with each other at a contact location <b>85</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, in various other embodiments, the top plate <b>12</b> and the bottom plate <b>14</b> are manufactured as a single continuous unit.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As mentioned and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in various embodiments the device <b>10</b> is mounted to the outsole <b>22</b> under a forefoot region by conventional means (gluing, stitching, etc.) and replaces the midsole <b>38</b> in the forefoot portion of the shoe <b>5</b>. Thus, in such embodiments, the midsole <b>38</b> would extend only from the heel portion of the outsole <b>22</b> up to the device <b>10</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shoe <b>5</b> may be described with respect to different portions of the shoe <b>5</b> along a length of the shoe <b>5</b>, including a heel portion <b>52</b>, an arch portion <b>54</b>, a ball portion <b>56</b>, and a forefoot portion <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in various embodiments, an optimal function of the device <b>10</b> within the shoe <b>5</b> requires an absence of any material (foam/rubber/etc.) between the device and the shoe upper <b>24</b>. In other words, it is desirable in various embodiments to have the shoe upper <b>24</b> sit directly on the device <b>10</b> in the forepart, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, in various embodiments the top plate <b>12</b> of the device <b>10</b> would be configured to wrap up around the shoe upper <b>24</b> and in addition to its primary function of propulsion, forms features such as a toe bumper <b>26</b> and a sidewall <b>28</b>. Such a unique construction with the top plate <b>12</b> configured to wrap up around the shoe upper <b>24</b> may create a very rigid toe bumper <b>26</b> and sidewall <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">With this approach, an alternative embodiment for the top plate <b>12</b> would have the top plate <b>12</b> manufactured from more typical, softer/flexible materials (rubber/foam/etc.) and a secondary component then added to it (e.g. steel) added to provide rigidity directly above the bottom plate <b>14</b>. The bottom plate <b>14</b> in such embodiments may still be manufactured from the rigid materials.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>shows a side view of part of a shoe <b>6</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. The shoe <b>6</b> includes an outsole <b>22</b> and a midsole <b>38</b>. In the shoe <b>6</b>, the midsole <b>38</b> extends into a forefoot portion of the shoe <b>6</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a top view of the midsole <b>38</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, where the midsole <b>38</b> includes a cavity <b>39</b> in which an embodiment of the device <b>10</b> is located. Thus, various embodiments allow for placing the device <b>10</b> within a midsole <b>38</b>, such as within the cavity <b>39</b> of the midsole <b>38</b> or otherwise surrounded by the midsole <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In various embodiments, the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> allows for storing and returning energy during a propulsion phase of a gait cycle in a human step using a device in a shoe including two plates and a spring that biases the two plates apart from each other. In various embodiments, the method comprises (step <b>70</b>) applying, with a foot, a force on at least one of the two plates that is positioned in the shoe beneath a forefoot portion of the foot, so as to move the two plates together and increase a loading of the spring, and (step <b>71</b>) launching the foot due to the two plates being moved apart by the spring as the foot is being lifted.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a shoe <b>100</b> according to another example embodiment of the present invention. The shoe <b>100</b> may include an upper <b>110</b> and an outsole <b>120</b>. The shoe <b>100</b> may be divided into various portions, such as a forefoot portion <b>210</b>, a ball portion <b>220</b>, an arch portion <b>230</b>, and a heel portion <b>240</b>. The outsole <b>120</b> is designed to be placed on the ground in normal operation of the shoe <b>100</b>. The upper <b>110</b> includes an opening for a foot and means for tightening the shoe <b>100</b> around the foot, such as laces, a zipper, or the like.

<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Various embodiments provide a method of manufacturing a shoe. The method includes providing a midsole with a cavity in a forefoot portion of the midsole, assembling a device with a filler material and springs located between top and bottom plates, with the springs located in openings in the filler material. The method may include putting a pin through hinges of the top and bottom plates. The method may further include placing the device in the cavity in the midsole, placing an insole over the device and the midsole, and placing a sockliner over the insole. In various embodiments, the method includes attaching a propulsion enhancement material to a bottom side of a forefoot portion of the sockliner, and attaching a heel shock absorber to a bottom side of a heel portion of the sockliner. In some embodiments, the method includes attaching a shank to the midsole. In some embodiments, the method includes providing a window in an outsole and attaching the midsole to the outsole in a location such that the device is at least partially visible through the window in the outsole.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Embodiments of the present invention include shoes that may increase the vertical leap of an individual. Embodiments of the present invention may include a device placed in a cavity in a shoe. The device may be located under the forefoot in front of a ball of the foot and a flex zone of the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">An embodiment of the device may include two plates made of a strong light weight rigid material. In an example embodiment, the rigid material may be high-durometer Pebax&#xae;, or thermoplastic materials such as TPU&#xae; or TPX&#xae;. Pebax&#xae; is a high performance elastomer which offers outstanding compression properties while providing excellent durability which increases fatigue resistance. The two plates of the device may be joined at a hinge. In an example embodiment, the hinge may be seamless to provide strength and support.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">An embodiment of the device may include a nest that includes a filler material such as high-rebound EVA. The filler material may be located between the top and the bottom Pebax&#xae; plates. One embodiment of the filler material may include up to 8 circular die-cut holes. The holes may be configured to house vertical compression springs with a high bias force pushing the plates apart with a high amount of torque and energy return.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">A high density shank may be located behind the device on the outsole of the shoe. The shank provides another level of engagement in a compression-propulsion-liftoff response method. The shank may be made of high durometer Pebax&#xae; and provides a level of stability between the forefoot and the heel portions of the shoe. The shank also absorbs shock and enhances the transfer of energy to the device to increase a vertical leap of an individual.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The combination of the three separate energy return substances: Pebax&#xae;, rebound EVA, and compression springs of the device working in concert increases the vertical leap of an individual. Since in various embodiments the device is inserted in the midsole of a shoe, the individual wearing the shoe according to embodiments of the present invention does not feel the device against their foot.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In an example embodiment, utilizing extremely high rebound EVA in the midsole of the shoe as well as in the insole that lies underneath the sockliner of the shoe provides cushioning, comfort, and the return of energy to the foot during a jumping or liftoff phase. The sockliner may include highly advanced materials designed to provide shock absorption under the heel and additional energy return under the forefoot to further propel the user upward during the liftoff phase of the jump. In one example embodiment, the material under the heel may be made of Poron&#xae;, a shock absorption substance, and under the forefoot portion of the sockliner may lie a sheet of ESS, which is a propulsion enhancement material. In various other embodiments, a shock absorption material, such as Poron&#xae; or other cushioning material, may be attached under both the heel and forefoot portion of the sockliner, or even cover an entire bottom surface of the sockliner, to provide added cushioning.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">According to various embodiments of the present invention, when an athlete applies force to the front of the foot in preparation for liftoff, the shank, sockliner, insole, midsole, device, and the outsole all compress to generate a huge amount of energy exerted downward into the device. As the athlete begins to release the massive force that has been exerted downward, the energy is transferred in reverse order up through the device to provide a dramatic lift that increases the vertical leap of the athlete wearing the shoe. In various embodiments, providing the sockliner with the propulsion enhancement material, such as ESS attached to a forefoot portion of the bottom of the sockliner, would provide for an enhanced return of energy and added lift during a jump. In various embodiments where the sockliner is provided with cushioning material under the forefoot portion of the sockliner rather than the propulsion enhancement material, lift would still be provided by the shank, insole, midsole, device, and outsole working together.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Embodiments of a top and bottom plate for a device may be shaped to be oval, round, elliptical, rectangular, or even irregular shapes. Embodiments may include smaller compression springs assembled around an interior perimeter inside an EVA nest and a larger compression spring in a die-cut hole located at a center of the EVA nest. Embodiments of the top and bottom plates with Pebax may have two levels of hardness of about 40&#xb0; or 63&#xb0;. In yet other embodiments, the hardness of high elasticity EVA inserted around springs may be 35&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Various embodiments of the present invention include springs with a wire having a thickness of about 1.2 mm and an inner diameter of the spring coil of about 15 mm. In various embodiments of the present invention, the height of each spring may be about 5 mm or about 7 mm. One advantage of using high elasticity EVA can be that it keeps springs firmly in place and prevents sideways movement of the springs during compression. Embodiments of the filler material may have hardness of about 35&#xb0;, which may be less than the hardness of the springs. Any desirable hardness of the filler material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In an embodiment of the present invention, a thickness for a midsole at the forefront may be from about 8 to 12 mm. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the plates may be made of rigid materials like Delrin (Acetal or POM) and the plates may be about 3 mm thick. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a device in a shoe may be visible to a user of the shoe through a lateral or a medial side wall of the shoe. In yet another embodiment of a device, top and bottom plates for the device may remain parallel throughout the compression and the expansion of the device. Various embodiments of the present invention may be described as creating a spring sandwich of the two plates holding the filler materials and the springs, and can be used as a cassette to be dropped into a cavity in a midsole of a shoe.</p>
