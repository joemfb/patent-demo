<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Phase filing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT/EP2009/068005 filed on Dec. 29, 2009; and this application claims priority to Application No. MI2009A000012 filed in Italy on Jan. 8, 2009 under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119; the entire contents of all are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a moving element for a low voltage switching device and to a switching device comprising this moving element.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that low voltage switching devices (i.e. for applications with operating voltages up to 1000V AC/1500V DC), such as automatic circuit-breakers, disconnectors and contactors, universally called switching devices and subsequently called switches for the sake of brevity are devices conceived to permit correct operation of specific parts of electrical systems and of the loads installed. For example, automatic circuit-breakers ensure that the rated current required can flow towards the various utilities, allowing correct connection and disconnection of the loads from the circuit and automatic sectioning of the circuit protected with respect to the electrical power source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior art switches also comprise an actuating mechanism which causes the relative movement of pairs of contacts so that they can assume at least a first coupling position (switch closed) and at least a separated position (switch open). In a large number of prior art solutions the action of the actuating mechanism on the moving contacts is conventionally performed through a moving element from which the moving contacts directly protend.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Operating connection between the actuating mechanism and the moving element conventionally takes place by means of a kinematic chain; this kinematic chain is normally composed of a plurality of elements, at least one of which is connected to the moving element so as to drive it in rotation, for example in the case of manual opening of the switch, or so as to be affected by its rotation, for example in the case of the switch tripping.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the most recent solutions, the actuating mechanism is connected to the moving element through an actuating connecting rod. More precisely, this connecting rod comprises a pair of connection portions connected transversely by a further portion. This latter is connected to the actuating mechanism of the switch while the two lateral portions are connected to the moving element through pin connection means which configure a mutual rotation axis between the connecting rod and the moving element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first widely used construction type these connection means are composed of a pin which physically defines the mutual rotation axis between the connecting rod and the moving element. In a second construction type the connection means are instead defined by a pair of pin ends, each of which defined on one side by one of the lateral portions. Each pin end is inserted in a corresponding housing seat defined on the moving element so as to define the mutual rotation axis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although being relatively effective from the functional viewpoint, conventional solutions present some obvious limits. In fact, as it is known, during the working life of the switch each of its components is subject to deterioration or wear, for example due to the considerable thermal and mechanical stresses to which the switching device is normally subjected, during switching operations or tripping due to short circuit. However, the operating efficiency of the switch depends on the perfect state of repair of all its parts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The joining means or the pin ends which are conventionally employed to connect the actuating connecting rod to the moving element prove to be critical components in terms of duration and reliability. In particular, in prior art solutions the pin ends must withstand stresses during any operating phase of the switch.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another limit of conventional solutions is represented by the fact that configuration of the pin connection means requires complex assembly procedures which have a negative effect on the final production costs. Naturally, this limit is also present when maintenance operations are required to restore the connection, or function of the moving element or of the actuating connecting rod.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">On the basis of these considerations, the main aim of the present invention is to provide a moving element for a low voltage switching device which allows the aforesaid drawbacks to be overcome and in particular which can be produced in a simple and reliable manner through a limited number of parts which are relatively simple to assemble and install.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This aim is achieved through a moving element for a low voltage switching device according to the indications in claim <b>1</b>. Further advantageous aspects of the present invention are highlighted in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the description reference will be made to a moving element for a multi-pole low voltage switching device with simple switching. Naturally, it must be understood that the principles and the technical solutions set forth within the scope of the description of the inventive concept are also valid for other applications such as a single-pole moving element or moving elements destined for double break switching devices.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view relative to a first embodiment of a moving element according to the present invention, indicated as a whole by the reference number <b>2</b>. The moving element <b>2</b> comprises a shaped body <b>4</b> having a plurality of housing units <b>25</b> each of which housing an electrical contact <b>1</b> and at least one elastic element <b>50</b> which interacts with the electrical contact <b>1</b> to maintain it in a pre-established position with respect to the relative housing unit <b>25</b>, and to adjust the contact pressure. At the same time, the elastic element <b>50</b> has the function of opposing the electrical repulsive force to which the electrical contact <b>1</b> can be subjected, in substance stabilizing this contact.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The moving element <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is intended for a single-pole or multi-pole switching device, for example with four poles as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In the example shown the shaped body <b>4</b> comprises four housing units, each of which houses an elastic element <b>50</b> and a relative electrical contact <b>1</b>. As shown, these housing units <b>25</b> are in substance adjacent portions of the shaped body <b>4</b> mutually separated by intermediate portions <b>66</b>. These latter can be geometrically coupled with relative support portions configured in the case <b>220</b> of a switching device <b>3</b> intended to receive the moving element <b>2</b>. More precisely, the intermediate portions <b>66</b> are configured so that once coupled with the corresponding support portions they define a rotation axis <b>200</b> for the shaped body <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The moving element <b>2</b> also comprises an actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> susceptible to be operatively connected to an actuating mechanism <b>40</b> of the switching device <b>3</b> intended to receive the moving element <b>2</b>. The actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> comprises a pair of mutually opposite lateral portions <b>41</b>A, <b>41</b>B which are connected by a transverse connection portion <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is connected to the shaped body <b>4</b> through pin connection means. These latter comprise a first pin shaped portion <b>71</b> which emerges from a first lateral portion <b>41</b>A and a second pin shaped portion <b>72</b> which emerges from a second <b>41</b>B of said lateral portions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transverse connection portion is susceptible to be connected to an operating element of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b>. More precisely, in the case shown the transverse connection portion <b>42</b> comprises a central segment <b>42</b>A at the end of which two pin ends <b>42</b>B are defined. As described in greater detail below, the central segment <b>42</b>A is susceptible to be connected with one or more control springs <b>37</b> of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b>, while the two pin ends <b>42</b>B are intended to be placed inside relative housing seats defined on an operating element (indicated below with fork <b>33</b>) of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The shaped body <b>4</b> comprises a first <b>9</b>A and a second seat <b>9</b>B in which the first <b>71</b> and the second <b>72</b> pin shaped portion are respectively inserted so as to define a mutual rotation axis <b>101</b> of the connecting rod <b>15</b> with respect to the shaped body <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). This mutual rotation axis <b>101</b> is defined so as to be substantially parallel to the rotation axis <b>200</b> about which the shaped body <b>4</b> is free to rotate once the moving element <b>2</b> is inserted in a switching device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first lateral portion <b>41</b>A of the connecting rod <b>15</b> comprises a first mating surface <b>51</b> defined in a position opposite the transverse portion <b>42</b> with respect to the first pin shaped portion <b>71</b>. Similarly, the second lateral portion <b>41</b>B of the connecting rod <b>15</b> comprises a second mating surface <b>52</b>, also opposite the transverse portion <b>42</b> with respect to the second pin shaped portion <b>72</b>. The shaped body <b>4</b> also comprises a third mating surface <b>53</b> and a fourth mating surface <b>54</b> susceptible to respectively contact the first <b>51</b> and the second mating surface <b>52</b> when the pin shape portions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are inserted in the corresponding seats <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the shaped body <b>4</b> and the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> mutually separated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first <b>9</b>A and the second seat <b>9</b>B are both defined by shaped portions of a same housing unit <b>25</b>. Through this solution the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is directly connected to only one of the housing units <b>25</b> of the shaped body <b>4</b>. More precisely, the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> determines rotation of the shaped body <b>4</b> when the configuration of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> connected thereto is subjected to a variation. This variation can be the consequence of a controlled action (opening or closing) imparted on the mechanism or can be the consequence of a tripping of the actuating mechanism determined by a short circuit of the switching device <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing unit <b>25</b> to which the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is connected comprises a main cavity <b>18</b> from which the electrical contact <b>1</b> emerges. The housing unit <b>25</b> also comprises a first lateral cavity <b>19</b> and a second lateral cavity <b>19</b>B in which elastic portions <b>50</b>B of an elastic element <b>50</b> are housed. More precisely, the two lateral cavities <b>19</b> and <b>19</b>B are defined in symmetrical position with respect to the main cavity <b>18</b> and each comprises an opposing surface <b>33</b> for a free end <b>88</b> of one of said elastic portions <b>50</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The two seats <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B, in which the pin shaped portions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> of the connecting rod <b>15</b> are housed, are placed in substantially symmetrical position with respect to the central cavity <b>18</b> and each in a position substantially above one of the lateral cavities <b>19</b>, <b>19</b>B. This position above corresponds to a position substantially opposite with respect to the opposing surface <b>33</b> on which the free ends of the elastic element <b>50</b> rest.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a first detailed view showing the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> separate from the moving element <b>2</b>, or in a condition prior to assembly thereof. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the third <b>53</b> and the fourth mating surface <b>54</b> of the moving element <b>2</b> are curved surfaces which are substantially coaxial to the support surfaces <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B respectively of the first <b>9</b>A and of the second rotation seat <b>9</b>B. This means that the third mating surface <b>51</b> and the first seat <b>9</b>A have centers of curvature lying on an axis of reference on which the centers of curvature of the fourth mating surface <b>54</b> and of the second seat <b>9</b>B also lie. Once the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is connected to the shaped body <b>4</b> (condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), this reference axis substantially coincides with the mutual rotation axis <b>101</b> indicated above.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Again according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the first mating surface <b>51</b> and the second mating surface <b>52</b> are curved surfaces whose curvature is geometrically matched respectively with the curvature of the third mating surface <b>53</b> and of the fourth mating surface <b>54</b>. This means that according to this solution contact between the first surface <b>51</b> and the third surface <b>53</b> and contact between the second surface <b>52</b> and the fourth surface <b>54</b> extends along several points, offering an improved distribution of forces between the fixed surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference again to the view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the curvature of the surface <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B of each seat <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B is substantially opposite the curvature of the corresponding mating surface <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> produced on the same side of the housing unit <b>25</b> and considered with respect to the main cavity <b>18</b> of this unit. It can also be observed that the first seat <b>9</b>A and the third mating surface <b>53</b> are defined on opposite semi-planes of a first reference plane R<b>1</b> substantially orthogonal to the mutual rotation axis <b>101</b>. Similarly, the second seat <b>9</b>B and the fourth mating surface <b>54</b> lie on opposite semi-planes of a second reference plane Rs also substantially orthogonal to the mutual rotation axis <b>101</b> and substantially parallel to the first reference plane R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The position of the seats <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B with respect to the third <b>53</b> and fourth mating surface <b>54</b> is defined so as to allow insertion of the pin shaped portions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> in these seats <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B according to a substantially pre-established insertion operation. This characteristic can be observed by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It is observed that the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is inserted according to a direction of insertion (arrow T<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) substantially perpendicular to the direction of use (arrow T<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), or to the direction assumed by the connecting rod <b>15</b> during normal operation of the switching device <b>3</b>. When the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is oriented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pin shaped portions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are maintained stably in their operating position as a result of the constraints created by the pairs of surfaces (<b>51</b>-<b>53</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>54</b>) mutually in contact at the rotation seats <b>9</b>A,<b>9</b>B. Ultimately, this special configuration breaks down the reciprocal action of the connecting rod <b>15</b> towards the shaped body <b>4</b> into two different areas, or two distinct areas of the connecting rod and two distinct areas of the shaped body <b>4</b>. More precisely, the pin portions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> act on the corresponding seats <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B while the first <b>51</b> and the second mating surface <b>52</b> act respectively on the third <b>53</b> and on the fourth mating surface <b>54</b>. This solution in practice allows the tensile and compressive stresses on the connecting rod <b>15</b> to be released on specifically defined and dimensioned areas of the shaped body <b>4</b> producing the technical advantage of a noteworthy increase in the useful life of the connecting rod <b>15</b>, thus of the moving element <b>2</b> and consequently of the relative switching device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention also relates to a switching device <b>3</b> comprising a moving element <b>2</b> according to the present invention. More precisely, in the case shown the switching device <b>3</b> is represented by a single break multi-pole switch for a low voltage system. Naturally, it must be understood that the principles and the technical solutions set forth within the scope of the description of the inventive concept are also valid for other types of devices such as double break switching devices and/or with a different number of poles.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the switching device <b>3</b> (hereinafter also indicated with the expression switch <b>3</b>) comprises an outer case <b>220</b> containing for each pole at least one fixed electrical contact <b>300</b> and at least one moving contact <b>1</b>, which can be coupled with and decoupled from each other. The outer case <b>220</b> is composed of a box <b>220</b>A to which a cover <b>220</b>B is connected. The box <b>220</b>A and the cover <b>220</b>B are structured internally so as to define support portions shaped to support corresponding intermediate portions <b>66</b> of the shaped body <b>4</b>, or so as to define the rotation axis <b>200</b> of this body.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded view of the switching device <b>3</b> in which the moving element <b>2</b> is shown in its operating position. As is apparent, the switch <b>3</b> comprises an actuating mechanism <b>40</b> which is operatively connected to the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> of the moving element <b>2</b>. In the case shown the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> comprises a support frame <b>31</b> which supports a kinematic chain formed by a plurality of operating elements. The support frame <b>31</b> presents a structure provided with a first pair of opposed sides <b>31</b>B and mutually connected by a first transverse portion <b>31</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the switch also comprises a protective device which comprises for each pole a protective unit <b>116</b>; the protective units <b>116</b> interact with a release shaft <b>140</b> which activates the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> in the case in which an operating fault is detected (i.e. a short circuit). In the case shown, the sides <b>31</b>B of the support frame <b>31</b> are pivotally connected to the release shaft <b>140</b>. This latter comprises activation portions <b>144</b> which interact with the protective units <b>116</b> so as to cause rotation of the release shaft <b>140</b>, or tripping of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> according to methods described below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a perspective view relative to the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> of the switch <b>3</b> once assembled, or ready to be connected to the moving element <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> instead shows the components of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> before being assembled. The actuating mechanism <b>40</b> is set on the support frame <b>31</b> so as to be pivotal with respect thereto about a first axis <b>501</b>. The structure of the main coupling <b>32</b> is substantially similar to that of the frame <b>31</b> comprising a second pair of lateral flanks <b>32</b>A connected by a second transverse portion <b>32</b>B. The main coupling <b>32</b> is pivoted at the flanks <b>31</b>B of the support frame <b>31</b> through first pin connection means preferably composed of a pair of pin portions <b>32</b>C integral with the flanks <b>32</b>A of the coupling <b>32</b> and inserted in relative seats <b>31</b>C defined on the flanks <b>31</b>B of the frame <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The actuating mechanism <b>40</b> also comprises a fork <b>33</b> which is pivoted to the main coupling <b>32</b> through second pin connection means which define a second rotation axis <b>502</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The fork <b>33</b> comprises a third pair of flanks <b>33</b>B mutually connected by a third transverse portion <b>33</b>A. In detail, the second connection means preferably comprise a further pair of pin portions <b>32</b>D each defined on an inner side of a flank <b>32</b>B of the main coupling. Each of these pin portions <b>32</b>D is inserted in a relative housing seat <b>33</b>C defined at a first end of a flank <b>33</b>B of the fork <b>33</b>. In other words, the fork <b>33</b> is pivoted to the main coupling <b>32</b> so that its flanks <b>33</b>B move between the flanks <b>32</b>B of the main coupling <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each flank of the fork <b>33</b> also presents a second housing seat <b>33</b>E defined at a second end substantially opposite the first. The pin ends <b>42</b>B of the transverse connection portion <b>42</b> of the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> of the moving element <b>2</b> are inserted in each of these seats <b>33</b>E. In other words, the fork <b>33</b> represents an operating element of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> which is directly connected to the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b>. Coupling between the pin end <b>42</b>B of the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> and the relative housing seats <b>33</b>E of the fork <b>33</b> define a third rotation axis <b>503</b> which allows a relative rotation between the two components (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> also comprises a lever holding element <b>34</b> which presents a C-shaped structure and which is preferably pivoted on the outer side of the support frame <b>31</b>. The lever holding element <b>34</b> can be activated directly by an operator through a control lever <b>25</b>B. The lever holding element <b>34</b> comprises a fourth pair of flanks <b>34</b>B connected by a transverse portion <b>34</b>A configured to support the control lever <b>25</b>B. The flanks <b>34</b>B of the lever holding element <b>34</b> are pivoted externally to the flanks <b>31</b>B of the frame <b>31</b> through fourth pin connection means which configure a fourth rotation axis <b>504</b> indicated clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> also comprises a pair of springs <b>37</b> which are connected at a first end <b>37</b>A to the transverse portion <b>34</b>A of the control lever <b>34</b> and at a second end <b>37</b>B to the central segment <b>42</b>A of the transverse portion <b>42</b>B of the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b>. The actuating mechanism <b>40</b> also comprises a release element <b>36</b> which is activated by the release shaft <b>140</b> to which the flanks <b>31</b>B of the frame <b>31</b> are connected. More precisely, the release element <b>36</b> in normal operating conditions of the switching device <b>3</b> blocks rotation of the main coupling <b>32</b> with respect to the support frame <b>31</b>. In the case of faults detected by the protective unit <b>116</b> of the switch <b>3</b> the release element <b>36</b> releases the main coupling <b>32</b>, in practice allowing rotation according to the methods described in detail below. In the case shown, the release element <b>36</b> is pivoted at opposite ends to corresponding flanks <b>31</b>B of the frame <b>31</b> so as to define a fifth rotation axis <b>505</b>. The release element <b>36</b> is operatively connected to the release shaft <b>140</b> through an elastic connection element <b>39</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> of the switch <b>3</b> which shows it in a closed configuration in which the moving contacts <b>1</b> are coupled with the relative fixed contacts <b>300</b>. In this configuration the control springs <b>37</b> are in a condition of tension and exert an elastic force which extends along a line of action <b>7</b>. This line <b>7</b> is in practice defined by the points in which the control springs <b>37</b> respectively couple with the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> and with the lever holding element <b>34</b>. The release element <b>36</b> is in the coupling position to retain the main coupling <b>32</b>, or to prevent rotation thereof about the first axis <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Passage from the closed configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to the open configuration (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) is implemented following operation of the control lever <b>25</b>B (indicated with the arrow F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). This action F causes rotation of the lever holding element <b>34</b> about the fourth mutual rotation axis <b>504</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). During a first rotation phase of the lever holding element <b>35</b>, the moving contacts <b>1</b> still remain coupled while the control springs <b>37</b>, connected between the lever holding element <b>34</b> and the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b>, are in an increasing state of tension. This condition persists until the line of action <b>7</b> intersects the second rotation axis <b>502</b>, or the mutual rotation axis of the main coupling <b>32</b> with respect to the fork <b>33</b>. In this condition the control springs <b>37</b> reach their maximum extension, or its maximum state of tension. As soon as the line of action <b>7</b> is lowered, passing beyond the second rotation axis <b>502</b>, the control springs <b>37</b> release the elastic energy stored during the first opening phase. This causes the actuating connecting rod <b>34</b> to be driven rapidly downward, or in the direction of the release element <b>36</b>. This driving movement determines a rotation of the moving element <b>2</b> about its rotation axis <b>200</b> which results in rapid separation of the contacts <b>1</b>, <b>300</b>. After opening the actuating mechanism <b>30</b> reaches the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. It must be observed that during opening the release element <b>36</b> maintains its coupled position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">During passage from the closed to the open configuration, the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> is in practice driven by the fork <b>33</b> which acts at the pin end <b>42</b>B of the transverse connecting portion <b>42</b>. This driving of the connecting rod <b>15</b> in fact results in rotation of the shaped body <b>4</b> (clockwise) and this means that the relative stresses are released directly onto the pin portions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> of the connecting rod <b>15</b>. During passage from the open to the closed configuration, the relative stresses are instead released at the mating surfaces <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> of the connecting rod <b>15</b> and of the shaped body <b>4</b>. In fact, in this case the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> determines a counter rotation (counter-clockwise) of the shaped body <b>4</b> pushing it through the first <b>51</b> and the second mating surface <b>52</b>. In other words, the configurations of the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> and of the shaped body <b>4</b> are such as to allow improved distribution of the stresses which are released in different points of the connecting rod <b>15</b> according to the movement thereof. This obviously increases the duration and reliability of the connecting rod and consequently the reliability of the switch <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the actuating mechanism <b>40</b> in &#x201c;tripped&#x201d; configuration. Passage from the closed configuration (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) to the tripped configuration in fact takes place following tripping of a protective device of the switch <b>1</b> which causes a rotation of the release shaft <b>140</b>. Rotation of the release shaft <b>140</b> in fact results in a rotation of the coupling element <b>36</b> about the fifth rotation axis <b>505</b> which takes it to a released position following which the main coupling <b>32</b> is free to rotate with respect to the support frame <b>31</b> about the first rotation axis <b>501</b>. More precisely, when the main coupling <b>32</b> is released, the control springs <b>37</b> exert a tension on the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> in the direction of the control lever <b>35</b>B. This tension affects the main coupling <b>32</b> through the fork <b>33</b> determining rotation of this coupling <b>32</b> about the first rotation axis <b>501</b>. Driving of the actuating connecting rod <b>15</b> in turn causes rotation of the moving element <b>2</b>, or sudden separation of the contacts <b>1</b>, <b>300</b>. The actuating mechanism <b>40</b> thus assumes the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which is obviously different from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> relative to manual opening.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The technical solutions adopted for the switching device according to the invention allow the aim set to be fully achieved. In particular, the presence of mating surfaces defined on the actuating connecting rod and of the shaped body <b>4</b> allows improved distribution of stresses which results in increased reliability and duration of the moving element, or of the switching device in which it is employed. It must be noted that the moving element is produced with component parts which are easy to inspect without complex maintenance procedures and which can be produced easily at limited costs.</p>
