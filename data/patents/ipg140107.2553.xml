<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/219,985, filed Sep. 6, 2005 entitled, &#x201c;URINE GENDER TEST,&#x201d; to John Spurgeon and Constance M. Hendrickson, which in turn, claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application 60/612,411 of the same title, filed on Sep. 23, 2004, and which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed, in general, to determining the gender of an unborn fetus by testing the urine from a pregnant mother, and more particularly, a composition, method and kit to facilitate such testing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is great interest in determining the gender of an unborn fetus. For instances, parents are curious to know the sex of their unborn child. Knowledge of a fetus's gender would allow animal breeders to better manage various aspects of their business, including selling and purchase, insurance, mating decisions. Unfortunately, an accurate gender test that is both inexpensive and simple to perform is not available.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various tests, such as the Draino test, while inexpensive and simple to perform, has been dismissed by the medical establishment as having no value for predicting fetal sex. Other techniques that are accepted as accurate, are either invasive, such as amniocentesis or maternal blood tests, or require expensive equipment, such as ultrasound or x-rays. Moreover, such techniques are not without dangers to the fetus and are not completely reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, what is needed in the art is a gender test that does not suffer from the disadvantages associated with conventional gender tests, as discussed above.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, the present invention provides in one embodiment, a kit for determining the gender of an unborn fetus. The kit comprises a container holding a solid composition therein, the solid composition including a basic salt and a transition metal. An atmosphere in the container is substantially free of water.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment is a method of manufacture the kit. The method comprises forming a solid composition in a container, including placing a transition metal in a container and placing a basic salt in the container. The method also comprises flushing the container with an atmosphere that is substantially free of water.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Still another embodiment is a method of determining the gender of an unborn fetus. The method comprises adding urine from a pregnant female to a container holding the above-described solid composition and atmosphere substantially free of water. The method also comprises mixing the solid composition and the urine to form a solution, and, comparing a color of the solution to a color standard to determine a gender of an unborn fetus carried by the female.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The foregoing has outlined preferred and alternative features of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiment as a basis for designing or modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention. Those skilled in the art should also realize that such equivalent constructions do not depart from the scope of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One embodiment of the present invention is a solid composition for determining the gender of an unborn fetus. The term fetus, as used herein is defined as the unborn offspring of any animal species, such as human, bovine and equine species. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an exemplary solid composition <b>100</b> of the present invention. The present invention benefits from the recognition that the shelf-life of the solid composition <b>100</b> can be advantageously extended by keeping certain components of the solid composition <b>100</b> separated, to prevent the undesired premature reaction of these components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the solid composition <b>100</b> comprises a first layer <b>110</b>, a second layer <b>120</b> and a third layer <b>130</b>. The third layer <b>130</b> separates the first layer <b>110</b> from the second layer <b>120</b>. The first layer <b>110</b> comprises a basic salt. As well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a basic salt is defined as a salt that contains more of the basic constituent than is required to neutralize the acid of the salt. In some preferred embodiments, the basic salt of the first layer <b>100</b> comprises a water-soluble alkali metal hydroxide. In some embodiments, the basic salt comprises lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) or a mixture thereof. In some cases, the basic salt preferably comprises a non-deliquescent basic salt, such as LiOH, because such salts are less prone to absorb water and carbon dioxide from air and thereby do not liquefy during storage as rapidly as deliquescent basic salts such as KOH or NaOH. The liquefaction of the first layer <b>110</b> can cause the undesirable premature mixing and reaction of the components of the first and second layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. In some cases, the basic salt preferably comprises NaOH or KOH, because these salts generate a large amount of heat when it dissolves in water or urine. The generation of heat, in turn, facilitates other components to dissolve when the solid composition <b>100</b> is mixed with urine for gender testing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some advantageous embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first layer <b>110</b>, comprising a basic salt is a top layer of the solid composition <b>100</b> located in a container <b>140</b>. In other preferred embodiments, however, the first layer <b>110</b> can be a bottom layer of the composition <b>100</b>. Preferably, the first layer <b>110</b> comprises solid particles of the basic salt whose size is carefully selected. The selection balances the desire for the particle size to be small enough to rapidly dissolve in an aqueous solution, versus having a large enough size to retain the separation of the first and second layer <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> via the third layer <b>130</b>. In some instances, the first layer <b>110</b> comprises pellets or flakes having an average diameter ranging from about 1 millimeter to 10 millimeters. In some preferred embodiments, the first layer <b>110</b> comprises about 5 to about 25 percent of the total weight of the solid composition <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second layer <b>120</b> comprises a transition metal. For the purposes of the present invention, a transition metal is defined as any element in Periods 4-6 and Groups 3-12 of the Periodic Table of Elements (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemist Convention for designating Groups and Periods). In some preferred embodiments, the transition metal, upon being dissolved in an aqueous solution, forms ions having a valance of +2 or +3. In some embodiments of the solid composition <b>100</b>, the transition metal comprises aluminum, iron or a mixture thereof. In certain preferred embodiments, the transition metal comprises aluminum because aluminum is less prone to oxidation than iron when the solid composition <b>100</b> is stored over a period of 3 to 4 months. In addition, the solid composition <b>100</b> comprising aluminum provides a more readily recognizable color difference between positive and negative results in gender tests, as compared to an iron-containing solid composition <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain preferred embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second layer <b>120</b> is a bottom layer of the solid composition <b>100</b> in the container <b>140</b>. In other preferred embodiments, however, the second layer <b>120</b> can be the top layer of the solid composition <b>100</b>. Preferably, the second layer <b>120</b> comprises solid particles <b>150</b> of the transition metal whose size and amount is carefully selected. The selected size and amount of transition metal balances the desire for the particle size to be small enough to rapidly dissolve and react with the basic salt and urine sample but not to have an excessively violent reaction. An excessively violent reaction might result in the frothing of the solid composition <b>100</b> or the urine sample out of the container <b>140</b> or cause the container <b>140</b> to explode.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some instances, the second layer <b>120</b> advantageously comprises particles <b>150</b>, such as shot or filings, having an average diameter ranging from about 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters. In some preferred embodiments, the second layer <b>110</b> comprises about 4 to about 20 percent, and more preferably about 4 to about 12 percent, of the total weight of the solid composition <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The third layer <b>130</b> comprises a neutral filler. The neutral filler can comprise a neutral salt, a water soluable polymer, or both, and is configured to separate the first and second layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. Keeping the basic salt of the first layer <b>110</b> and transition metal of the second layer <b>120</b> separated advantageously extends the shelf life of the solid composition <b>100</b>. The shelf life is extended by deterring oxidation and other reactions between the basic salt and the transition metal of the first and second layers, <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, respectively. For example, embodiments of the solid composition <b>100</b> of the present invention can be kept for periods of up to about 4 months and then successfully used for gender testing. This is in contrast to formulations comprising a basic salt and a transition metal in intimate contact with each other. In such formulations, the basic salt and transition metal start reacting with each other within minutes of their preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a neutral salt is formed by the complete replacement of the hydrogen in an acid or base, in the former case by a positive or basic element or radical, in the latter case by a negative or acidic element or radical. Preferred embodiments of the neutral salt comprises a water soluable salt such as alkali halides, sulfates or nitrates. Preferred embodiments of the neutral filler comprising the water soluable polymer include polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol or a mixture thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain advantageous embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third layer <b>130</b> is located between the first and second layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. More preferably, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third layer <b>130</b> encapsulates the particles of second layer <b>120</b>. In other preferred embodiments, however, the third layer <b>130</b> can encapsulate the basic salt of the first layer <b>110</b>. In some preferred embodiments, the third layer <b>130</b> comprises about 30 to about 80 percent, and more preferably about 55 to about 80 percent, of the total weight of the solid composition <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In still other preferred embodiments the solid composition <b>100</b> further includes an indicator. The indicator advantageously facilitates a more prominent color change in the solution resulting from mixing the solid composition <b>100</b> with testosterone-containing urine as compared to testosterone-free urine during gender testing. The indicator can comprise any acid-base indicator that preferably turns pink or red with high pH. In some preferred embodiments, the indicator comprises alizarin, alizarin yellow R, o-cresolphthalein, cresol red, phenol red, phenolphalien, or mixtures thereof. In certain advantageous cases, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third layer <b>130</b> includes the indicator. In other cases, not illustrated, the first layer includes the indicator, and in still other instances, both the first and third layer includes the indicator. In some preferred embodiments, the indicator comprises about 0.1 to about 0.3 percent of the total weight of the solid composition <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another aspect of the present invention is a method for preparing a solid composition for determining the gender of an unborn fetus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views of selected steps in an exemplary method of preparing a solid composition <b>200</b> according to the principles of the present invention. Any embodiments of the solid composition, and its the components discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can be made according to the method.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated is the partially completed solid composition <b>200</b>, after a placing a transition metal <b>210</b> in a container <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate placing a neutral filler <b>310</b> in the container <b>220</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the filler <b>310</b> covers the transition metal <b>210</b>. More preferably, the filler <b>310</b> encapsulates the transition metal <b>210</b>. Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to facilitate encapsulation of the transition metal <b>210</b> by the neutral filler <b>310</b>, a liquid <b>320</b> is added to wash the transition metal <b>210</b> and the neutral filler <b>310</b> to the bottom of the container <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some cases, the neutral filler <b>310</b> comprises a neutral salt dissolved in the liquid <b>320</b> to form a solution, and the solution is placed in the container <b>220</b>. In some instances, the liquid <b>320</b> comprises water, a volatile organic solvent such as acetone or ethanol, or a mixture thereof. In still other cases, the neutral salt <b>310</b>, the liquid <b>320</b>, or both, or a solution thereof, are placed in the container <b>220</b>, and then the transition metal <b>210</b> is added to the container <b>220</b>. In other embodiments, the neutral filler <b>310</b> comprises a water soluable organic polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the partially completed solid composition <b>200</b> after drying to leave the transition metal <b>210</b> encapsulated and covered by the neutral filler <b>310</b>. Drying can be accomplished by heating to slightly below the boiling point of the liquid <b>320</b> (e.g., about 94&#xb0; C. when the liquid is water). Alternatively, drying can be achieved in vacuum at room temperature (about 20&#xb0; C.) or at lower than room temperatures, via freeze-drying. In some cases, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, drying removes the liquid <b>320</b> thereby allowing the neutral salt of the neutral filler <b>310</b> to precipitate and crystallize around the transition metal <b>210</b>. In other cases, drying condenses the water soluable organic polymer of the neutral filler <b>310</b>, so that the organic polymer surrounds the transition metal <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, illustrated is the partially completed solid composition <b>200</b>, after adding a basic salt <b>510</b> to the container <b>220</b>. In some preferred embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the basic salt <b>510</b> is placed over the neutral filler <b>310</b>. The neutral filler <b>310</b> thereby separates the transition metal <b>210</b> and the basic salt <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Though not illustrated, in other embodiments of the method, an optional indicator such as described above, is added to one or both of the neutral filler <b>310</b> or the basic salt <b>510</b>. In alternative embodiments of the method, the basic salt <b>510</b> is placed in the container first, followed by adding the neutral filler <b>310</b>, to cover the basic salt, and then adding the transition metal <b>210</b>. In yet other cases, the neutral filler <b>310</b> and basic salt <b>510</b>, and optional indicator, are mixed together, and then moistened with a liquid <b>320</b> to facilitate their placement in the bottom of the container <b>220</b>, followed by drying, and then the transition metal <b>210</b> is placed over the neutral filler <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Yet another aspect of the present invention is a kit for determining the gender of an unborn fetus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an exemplary kit <b>600</b> of the present invention. The kit <b>600</b> comprises a solid composition <b>610</b> located in a reaction vessel <b>620</b>. Any of the embodiments of the solid composition discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> can be included in the kit <b>600</b>. Some preferred embodiments of the reaction vessel <b>620</b> comprise a non-metallic material, and more preferably, the reaction vessel <b>620</b> is substantially non-reactive with the components of the solid composition <b>610</b>. Preferred embodiments of the reaction vessel <b>620</b> comprise glass or plastic tubes or vials.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The solid composition <b>600</b> is separated from the ambient environment surrounding the reaction vessel <b>620</b> by a seal <b>630</b> covering an opening in the reaction vessel <b>620</b>. The seal <b>630</b> advantageously deters the uptake of moisture from the ambient environment into the solid composition <b>610</b>. If it absorbs sufficient quantities of moisture, components of the solid composition <b>610</b> can get mixed together and react as discussed above, thereby spoiling the kit <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some preferred embodiments, the seal <b>630</b> comprises a wax that forms an airtight closure over an opening in the reaction vessel. Preferred waxes comprise a petroleum wax such as paraffin wax, although other animal, plant or synthetic waxes can be used. In other embodiments, however, the seal comprises a plastic screw top cap or similar airtight closure. Alternatively, the top of the reaction vessel <b>620</b> can be sealed by melting the upper portion of the reaction vessel <b>620</b> together.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Forming an airtight seal <b>630</b> over the reaction vessel <b>620</b> advantageously extends the shelf life of the kit <b>600</b>. For example, in some embodiments of the kit <b>600</b> having a seal <b>630</b> made of paraffin wax, the kit <b>600</b> can be stored for least about 2 years before being successfully used. In comparison, similarly formulated solid compositions <b>610</b> placed in unsealed reaction vessels <b>620</b> have a shelf-life up to about 4 months.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still another aspect of the present invention is a method of determining the gender of an unborn fetus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates by flow diagram an exemplary method <b>700</b> of determining the gender of an unborn fetus according to the principles of the present invention. The method <b>700</b> comprises in step <b>710</b>, contacting urine from a mother of the unborn fetus with a solid composition of the present invention to form a solution. Any of the embodiments of the solid composition and its packaging discussed herein can be used in the method <b>700</b>. The method <b>700</b> further includes in step <b>720</b>, comparing a color of the solution to a color standard to determine a gender of the unborn fetus.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, further illustrates aspects of the color comparison. In step <b>730</b>, the solution turns dark brown when the urine is from a mother pregnant with a male fetus. As illustrated in step <b>740</b>, in some preferred embodiments, when the urine from a mother pregnant with a female fetus is added to the solid composition that includes an indicator, the resulting solution turns pink or red.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As exemplified in step <b>745</b>, in some preferred embodiments, the solid composition is stored in a sealed container. Then, as shown in step <b>750</b>, shortly before testing, the seal of the container is opened so that urine from the mother can be added to the container. In some preferred embodiments, the seal is opened within about 1 hour of adding urine to the container. As further exemplified by step <b>760</b>, the urine sample is preferably obtained from the mother within about 1 hour before adding the urine to the container holding the solid composition.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Aspects of present invention are illustrated in the following examples. It will be appreciated that the examples are presented solely for the purpose of illustration and should not be construed as limiting the invention. For instance, although the studies described below may be carried out in a laboratory setting, one skilled in the art could adjust specific numbers, dimensions and quantities up to appropriate values for a full-scale plant setting.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Exemplary data collected as part of the present invention is depicted below to: 1) illustrate the preparation of various solid compositions of the present invention; 2) demonstrate the superior stability of the solid composition of the present invention as compared a prior art formulations; 3) present test results to demonstrate the determination of gender in humans using test kits of the present invention; and 4) present test results to illustrate the feasibility of determining gender in bovine and equine species.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Various solid compositions were prepared and subject to stability testing and to investigate gender testing. One solid composition (designated SC-1) comprised a transition metal of iron powder, a neutral filler of KCl, and a basic salt of KOH, in weight percentages of 10%, 65%, and 25%, respectively. A second solid composition (designated SC-2) comprised a transition metal of aluminum powder, a neutral filler of sodium nitrate (NaNO<sub>3</sub>) and a basic salt of NaOH in weight percentages of 5%, 75%, and 20%, respectively. A third solid composition (designated SC-3) comprised a transition metal of aluminum shot (average diameter of between about 1 and 2 mm), a neutral filler of NaCl and NaNO<sub>3</sub>, and a basic salt of NaOH in weight percentages of 6%, 20%, 60%, and 14%, respectively. A fourth solid composition (designated SC-4) comprised a transition metal of iron filings, a neutral filler of potassium chloride (KCl) and potassium nitrate (KNO<sub>3</sub>) and a basic salt of NaOH in weight percentages of 12%, 25%, 55%, and 6%, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one study, a solid composition (designated SC-5) used for stability testing was composed of the same transition metal, neutral filler and basic salt, and substantially the same proportions thereof, as SC-3. The aluminum shot was added to a glass test tube and then a neutral filler comprising NaCl and NaNO<sub>3 </sub>(about 1:3 weight ratio) was added to the test tube. In addition, an indicator of about 0.1 weight percent phenolphthalein was added to the test tube. Next, several drops of water were added to the tube to wet the neutral filler, indicator and aluminum shot. The test tube was then gently tapped to ensure that all of the aluminum shot was at the bottom of the test tube and covered by the wet neutral filler. The tube was then heated to about 94&#xb0; C. to evaporate the water. As the water evaporated, the neutral filler crystallized, thereby encapsulating the transition metal underneath the neutral filler. After cooling the tube, the NaOH pellets were added to the tube over the neutral filler. In some preparations, the tube was then sealed with paraffin wax until used for testing, while in other preparations the tube was left exposed to the ambient environment (about 50 to 85 percent relative humidity).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For comparative purposes, a test formulation (designated F-1) was prepared by mixing the aluminum shot with NaOH in proportions of 50:50 (wt/wt), with no neutral filler present in the formulation. Preparation F-1 is representative of prior art formulation where aluminum and alkali hydroxide are in intimate contact with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> presents representative microphotographs, at two different magnifications, of the F-1 preparation minutes (e.g., less than 10 minutes) after mixing the aluminum shot and NaOH together. Substantial oxidation reactions between the aluminum shot and NaOH were observed, the reaction continuing until either all the aluminum or the NaOH was consumed. Similar experiments where similar proportions of aluminum powder and NaOH were mixed directly together resulted in a violent reaction, and in some cases, explosion of the reaction vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additional experiments were performed to evaluate the long-term stability of the SC-5 preparation. Several test tubes containing the SC-5 preparation were stored in unsealed test tubes. These preparations worked accurately for gender testing for up to about 3.5 months. Thereafter, the accumulation of moisture in the test tubes became visible. The content of all of the tubes had undergone substantial reactions after about 4.25 months. Dramatically longer stabilities were observed for several test tubes containing SC-5 preparations in sealed test tubes. Preparations of SC-5 stored in sealed tubes have been accurately used for gender test after about 24 months of storage. Similar stabilities have been obtained for preparations stored in containers with damp tight packages.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Representative results for gender test performed using the SC-5 preparation on human subject are shown in Table 1. Similar test results for equine and bovine subjects are shown in TABLE 2.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As noted above, water absorption in basic salts can cause the undesirable mixing and reaction of the transition metals components of the first layer and basic salts of the second layer. As part of the present disclosure, it was recognized that the presence of water facilitates a chemical reaction between the above-described transition metals and basic salts can which, in turn, can significantly decrease the shelf life of a gender test kit containing these components. It was further discovered that transition metals and basic salts in an atmosphere that is substantially free of water can substantially decrease the rate of reaction between the transition metals and basic salts, thereby greatly extending the shelf-life of the kit. In some cases the atmosphere substantially free of water can eliminate the need to separate the transition metals and basic salts from each other with the neutral filler, thereby substantially the kit's manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Another embodiment of the invention is a kit for determining the gender of an unborn fetus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an example gender test kit <b>900</b> of the present invention. The kit <b>900</b> comprises a container <b>910</b> having a solid composition <b>915</b> therein. The solid composition <b>915</b> including a basic salt <b>920</b> and a transition metal <b>925</b>. An atmosphere <b>930</b> in the container <b>910</b> is substantially free of water. For the purposes of the present invention, the substantially term free of water as used herein means that the atmosphere <b>930</b> has about 10 percent or less than the maximum concentration of water vapor that can be attained in the atmosphere <b>930</b> for a given pressure and temperature of the atmosphere <b>930</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments the atmosphere <b>930</b> is composed of dry nitrogen (e.g., about 100 percent N2 gas with than about 1 percent H2O by weight) or dry air. In other embodiments, the atmosphere <b>930</b> is composed of dry air (e.g., about 100 percent air with less than about 1 percent H2O by weight). In still other cases, the atmosphere <b>930</b> is composed of an inert gas (e.g., about 100 percent argon or xenon less than about 1 percent H<sub>2</sub>O by weight). Based on the present disclosure one skilled in the art would appreciate that the atmosphere <b>930</b> could be composed of other dry (e.g., water free) gases.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is preferable for the container to <b>910</b> to be air-tight so that water vapor can not diffuse into the container <b>910</b>. For instance, the container <b>910</b> can be composed of a material that is resistant to the diffusion of air through it, such as glass, polycarbonate or polystyrene. It is also desirable for an opening <b>935</b> of the container <b>910</b> to be covered with an air-tight seal <b>940</b>. For instance, in some embodiments, the container <b>910</b> (e.g., a bottle or tube) is covered with a metal foil seal <b>940</b> that is adhesively coupled to the opening <b>935</b> (e.g., a screw top opening). In some embodiments, the metal foil seal <b>940</b> includes a metal layer <b>942</b> (e.g., aluminum foil) and adhesive backing layer <b>945</b> (e.g., a heat activated adhesive). In some cases the air-tight seal <b>940</b> can include a cap <b>947</b> (e.g., a plastic screw-top cap)</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some cases, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b> of the composition <b>915</b> are intermixed with each other. E.g., the basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b> can be solid particles that are homogenously mixed with each other. Having the basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b> are intermixed with each other can facilitate the rapid generation of heat and dissolving of the particles when a urine sample is added to the contain <b>930</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In other cases, however, it may be desirable for the basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b> of the composition <b>915</b> to be formed as separate layers in the contain <b>910</b> (e.g., first and second layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Providing the basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b> as separate layers decreases the contact between the individual particles of basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b>. This, in turn, can slow down their rate of reaction and thereby increase the shelf-life of the kit <b>900</b> in cases where there is still some water vapor in the atmosphere <b>930</b>, or water vapor slowly diffuses into the container <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In still other cases, it is desirable to for the separate layers of basic salt <b>920</b> and a transition metal <b>925</b> to be separated by a third layer of neutral filler (e.g., layer <b>130</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the containing <b>910</b>. The presence of the neutral filler layer can further can slow down the rate of reaction between the basic salt <b>920</b> and transition metal <b>925</b> and thereby further increase the shelf-life of the kit <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Any of the embodiments of basic salt, transition metal and neutral described herein can be used in the kit <b>900</b>. The kit <b>900</b> can include additional components to facilitate its effectiveness for gender testing. For instance, the solid composition <b>915</b> can further includes an indicator <b>950</b> configured to enhance a color change in a solution resulting from mixing the solid composition <b>915</b> with testosterone-containing urine. For instance, the kit <b>900</b> can further include indicator strips <b>960</b>, <b>965</b> that can each have a colored surface that matches a color of one of either a solution resulting from mixing the solid composition <b>915</b> with urine from a female that is pregnant with either a male fetus, or, a female fetus.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another embodiment of the invention is a method of manufacture a kit for determining the gender of an unborn fetus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> presents a flow diagram of a method <b>1000</b> of manufacturing a gender test kit, such as the gender test kit <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the method <b>1000</b> comprises a step <b>1005</b> of forming a solid composition <b>915</b> in a container <b>910</b>. Forming the composition <b>915</b> includes a step <b>1010</b> of placing a transition metal <b>925</b> in the container <b>910</b>, and, a step <b>1015</b> of placing a basic salt <b>920</b> in the container <b>910</b>. The method <b>1000</b> also comprises a step <b>1020</b> of flushing the container <b>910</b> with an atmosphere <b>930</b> that is substantially free of water.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments the flushing in step <b>1020</b> is performed for at least about 1 minute. For example, a dry nitrogen or dry air atmosphere <b>930</b> can be flushed via a tube inserted into the container <b>910</b>. In other cases, such as when the when components of the solid composition <b>915</b> (e.g., basic salt <b>920</b> or transition metal <b>925</b>) contain water, a longer flushing time (e.g., 5 minutes or greater) can be desirable to drive water out of the solid composition <b>915</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The method <b>1000</b> can further include a step <b>1025</b> covering an opening in said container with an air-tight seal <b>940</b>. The term air-tight seal as used herein means that the atmosphere <b>930</b> in the sealed container does not substantially increase in water content (e.g., less than 10 percent increase) for a storage time at room temperature of at least about 1 month and more preferable at least about 6 months and even more preferably at least about 1 year. In some cases, it is desirable to cover the container <b>910</b> in step <b>1020</b> as soon as possible after flushing in step <b>1020</b> so as to minimum the amount of water vapor re-entering the container <b>910</b>. For example, in some cases, the covering in step <b>1025</b> is done within about 10 seconds of ending the flushing step <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In other cases, the flushing and covering steps <b>1020</b>, <b>1025</b> can both be performed in step <b>1030</b> with the entire container <b>910</b> placed in a chamber that contains the atmosphere <b>930</b>. This can obviate the need to rapidly cover the container in step <b>1025</b> soon after flushing the container in step <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Any of the solid compositions and their methods of preparation described herein can be used as part of forming the solid composition <b>915</b> of the kit <b>900</b>. For instance, forming the solid composition <b>915</b> in step <b>1005</b> can include a step <b>1040</b> forming a layer (e.g., layer <b>110</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the transition metal, and step <b>1045</b> of forming a layer (e.g., layer <b>120</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the basic salt, wherein the transition metal layer <b>110</b> and basic salt layer <b>120</b> are separate layers. For instance, wherein forming the solid composition <b>915</b> in step <b>1005</b> can further include a step <b>1050</b> of placing a neutral filler in the container <b>930</b> (e.g., a layer <b>130</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), wherein the neutral filler separates the transition metal layer <b>110</b> and said basic salt layer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Still another embodiment of the invention is a method of determining the gender of an unborn fetus. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> presents a flow diagram of a method <b>1100</b> of determining the gender of an unborn fetus, such as performed using the gender test kit <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The method <b>1100</b> comprises a step <b>1110</b> of adding urine from a pregnant female to a container <b>910</b> holding the above-described solid composition <b>915</b> and atmosphere <b>930</b> substantially free of water. The method <b>1100</b> also comprises a step <b>1120</b> of mixing the solid composition <b>915</b> and the urine to form a solution. The method <b>1100</b> further comprises a step <b>1130</b> of comparing a color of the solution to a color standard (e.g., the indicator strips <b>960</b>, <b>965</b> of the kit <b>900</b>) to determine a gender of an unborn fetus carried by the female.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Based on the present disclosure, one skilled in the art would appreciate how other steps such as described in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> could be incorporated into the method <b>1100</b>.</p>
