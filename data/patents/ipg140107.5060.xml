<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter described herein relates to subscriber profile adaptation. More particularly, the subject matter described herein relates to methods, systems, and computer readable media for dynamic subscriber profile adaptation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In mobile communications networks, network nodes, such as home location registers (HLRs), home subscriber servers (HSSs), and electronic number mapping (ENUM) servers store subscriber profile information. Such information may include details about a subscriber's service, such as features that are part of the subscriber's service plan. Examples of such features may include data network bandwidth, advanced calling features, such as conference calling, call waiting, call forwarding, etc. Network operators may desire to selectively control access to this information depending on who is requesting the information. For example, a network operator may wish to selectively control access to subscriber profile information depending on the network in which a subscriber is roaming.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, in light of these needs, there exists a need for methods, systems, and computer readable media for dynamic subscriber profile adaptation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer readable media for dynamic subscriber profile adaptation. According to one aspect of the subject matter described herein, a method for subscriber profile adaptation is provided. The method includes receiving, from a database node that stores subscriber profile information, a message generated by the database node in response to a message received by the database node. The message generated by the database node may include subscriber profile information. The method further includes determining whether to modify the subscriber profile information based on predetermined criteria. The method further includes, in response to determining to modify the subscriber profile information, modifying the subscriber profile information and forwarding the modified information to an originator of the message received by the database node.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect of the subject matter described herein, a method for dynamic subscriber profile adaptation at a database node is provided. The method includes receiving a message for which a response including subscriber profile information is indicated. The method further includes identifying a set of subscriber profile information provisioned for the subscriber to which the message pertains. The method further includes determining whether to modify the set subscriber profile information for inclusion in a message generated in response to the received message based on predetermined criteria. The method further includes, in response to determining to modify the set of subscriber profile information for inclusion in the generated message, modifying the set subscriber profile information to be included in the generated message and forwarding the generated message to an originator of the received message.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the subject matter described herein, a subscriber profile adaptation platform is provided. The subscriber profile adaptation platform includes a network interface for receiving, from a database that stores subscriber profile information, a message generated by the database node in response to a message received by the database node. The message generated by the database node includes subscriber profile information. The platform further includes a profile adaptation manager for determining whether to modify subscriber profile information provided to an originator of the received message based on predetermined criteria. In response to determining to modify the subscriber profile information, the profile adaptation manager modifies the subscriber profile information and forwards the modified subscriber profile information to the originator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the subject matter described herein, a subscriber profile adaptation platform that modifies subscriber profile information is provided. The platform includes a network interface for receiving a message.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The subject matter described herein includes methods, systems, and computer readable media for dynamic subscriber profile adaptation. In one exemplary implementation, the subject matter described herein may use a profile adaptation manager co-located with a network node, such as a signal transfer point, a Diameter signaling router (DSR), a Diameter/MAP interworking function, an HLR, an HSS, or an ENUM server and determines whether to modify subscriber information based on the identity of the network requesting the information. Exemplary DSR network elements may include, but are not limited to, a Diameter message router, a Diameter routing agent (DRA), a Diameter relay agent, a Diameter redirect agent, a Diameter translation agent, and a Diameter proxy agent. In mobile communications networks that use the MAP protocol, the profile adaptation manager may intercept insert subscriber data (ISD) messages. In networks that used the Diameter protocol, the profile adaptation manager may intercept user authorization answer (UAA) messages or insert subscriber data request (IDR) messages. In networks that use ENUM, the profile adaptation manager may intercept ENUM responses. If the profile adaptation manager is co-located with the database node, such as the HLR, HSS, or ENUM server, that receives and responds to query messages for subscriber profile information, the profile adaptation manager may determine the set of subscriber profile information to be included in response to a received message based on the identity of the network from which the received message originates.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Call detail records or session detail records may also be generated for the subscriber profile information that is provided. Providing operator control of subscriber profile information may boost the acceptance of ENUM and new technologies to combine database technologies with location information and allow charging access for this information.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a message flow diagram illustrating subscriber profile adaptation for insert subscriber data messages sent from a home location register according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a home location register <b>100</b> is a repository of subscriber profile and location data. HLR <b>100</b> may be queried by other nodes in the network who are seeking such data. A home signal transfer point <b>102</b> routes messages to and from HLR <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an aspect of the subject matter described herein, a profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may intercept messages from HLR <b>100</b> and modify subscriber profile information provided in the messages based on the identity of the requester. An international gateway <b>106</b> acts as a gateway between the subscriber's home network and external networks. A visited VLR <b>108</b> is the point of contact for a roaming subscriber in a visited network.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to the message flow diagram, in line <b>1</b>, a subscriber terminal registers with visited VLR <b>108</b>, and visited VLR <b>108</b> sends an update location message to home HLR <b>100</b>. The update location message contains the subscriber's current location and is used to update the location information stored by HLR <b>100</b>. In line <b>2</b>, home HLR <b>108</b> responds to the update location message with an insert subscriber data message to provide subscriber profile information to visited VLR <b>108</b>. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may intercept the insert subscriber data message and determine whether or not to modify the message based on the network to which the insert subscriber data message is being sent. For example, the owner/operator of the home network may determine whether to modify the subscriber's profile based on the identity of the owner/operator of the network in which visited VLR <b>108</b> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In line <b>3</b>, the visited VLR <b>108</b> responds to the insert subscriber data message with an insert subscriber data acknowledgment message. In line <b>4</b>, the HLR responds to the insert subscriber data acknowledge with an update location acknowledge message.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Lines <b>5</b>-<b>8</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>12</b> of the call flow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> contain the same messages as those described above with regard to lines <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>. However, in these lines, the subscriber is roaming in different networks. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify the subscriber data in the insert subscriber data messages differently based on the identity of the network where the subscriber is roaming. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may add to, delete, or modify service information that is included in the ISD message and forward the modified message to the visited network. The determination of the network in which the subscriber is roaming may be made based on the update location message and correlation with the corresponding ISD message or based on the ISD message alone. In other examples, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify mobility management messages corresponding to the ISD messages that carry subscriber profile information in other protocols, most notably Diameter IDR messages.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the illustrated example, when the subscriber roams in Network A, the subscriber has call forward no reply (CFNR) service, lacks conference calling service, and has a throughput of 64 kbps for data transactions. When the same subscriber is roaming in Network B, the subscriber has CFNR service, conference calling service, and a throughput of 128 kbps. When the subscriber is roaming in Network C, the subscriber lacks CFNR service, lacks conference calling service, and has a throughput of 256 kbps. The complete set of subscriber profile information for the subscriber may include conference calling service, CFNR service, and a standard data rate of 128 kbps. By selectively providing this information to the visited network, the home network operator is able to control services that the subscriber accesses in the visited network and the visibility of services made available to the subscriber by the home network operator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is a stand-alone node or co-located with an STP. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is co-located with an HLR. Other than the fact that profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is co-located with an HLR, the message flow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the same as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Hence, a description thereof will not be repeated herein. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may receive the incoming update location query requesting subscriber profile information, identify the set of subscriber profile information for the subscriber, and determine whether to add to, modify, or delete subscriber profile information from the set to be included in the response sent to the visited network. The subscriber profile information included in the response could be based at least in part on the identity of the visited network, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the network desiring to control access to the subscriber profile information is an SS7 network (GSM or IS-41) where MAP is used to carry and communicate the subscriber profile information. However, the subject matter described herein is not limited to subscriber profile adaptation in SS7 networks and may, for example, be implemented in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network or Internet protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) network or any other communications network that employs Diameter-based mobility management signaling. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the subject matter described herein where profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is a component of a DSR <b>300</b> that is a component of an IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) network. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, HSS <b>302</b> is the repository for subscriber profile and location information. HSS <b>302</b> performs functions in an IMS or other type of network similar to those performed an HLR in IS-41 or GSM networks. Various call session control functions (CSCFs) allow subscribers to access network services. For example, a proxy CSCF (P-CSCF) <b>304</b> is the first point of contact by a user agent <b>306</b> in a visited network. An interrogating CSCF (I-CSCF) <b>308</b> sends messages to HSS <b>302</b> for which responses including subscriber profile data are indicated. A serving (S-CSCF) <b>310</b> control the set of services provided to a subscriber based on information received from the HSS.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In line <b>1</b> of the message flow diagram, UA <b>306</b> sends a register message P-CSCF <b>304</b>. In line <b>2</b> of the message flow diagram, P-CSCF <b>304</b> sends the register message to I-CSCF <b>308</b>. In line <b>3</b> of the message flow diagram, I-CSCF <b>308</b> sends a Diameter user authorization request (UAR) message to HSS <b>302</b> via DSR <b>300</b>. In line <b>4</b> of the message flow diagram, HSS <b>302</b> responds with a user authorization answer (UAA) message. After receiving the UAA message, I-CSCF selects an S-CSCF to serve the subscriber. In line <b>5</b> of the message flow diagram, I-CSCF <b>308</b> sends a register message to S-CSCF <b>310</b>. In line <b>6</b>, S-CSCF <b>310</b> sends a Diameter multimedia authentication request (MAR) message to DSR <b>300</b>. DSR <b>300</b> queries HSS <b>302</b> for an authentication vector. In line <b>7</b>, DSR <b>300</b> sends a multimedia authentication answer (MAA) message to S-CSCF <b>310</b>. In line <b>8</b>, S-CSCF <b>310</b> sends a 401 authorized message to I-CSCF <b>308</b>. In lines <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, the 401 unauthorized message is sent to UA <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In line <b>11</b>, UA <b>306</b> sends a register message to P-CSCF <b>304</b>. In line <b>12</b>, P-CSCF <b>304</b> sends the register message to I-CSCF <b>308</b>. In line <b>13</b>, I-CSCF <b>308</b> sends a diameter UAR message to DSR <b>300</b>. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may determine the visited network ID from the UAR message and store that information for later modification of subscriber profile adaptation information. In line <b>14</b>, DSR <b>300</b> sends a UAA message to I-CSCF <b>308</b>. In line <b>15</b>, I-CSCF <b>308</b> sends a register message to S-CSCF <b>310</b>, which authenticates the user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In line <b>16</b>, S-CSCF <b>310</b> sends a Diameter server assignment request (SAR) message to DSR <b>300</b>. DSR <b>300</b> may query HSS <b>302</b> to obtain subscriber profile information. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify the profile information based on the identity of the visited network as determined from the UAR message in line <b>3</b> or line <b>13</b> and send a modified set of subscriber profile information to S-CSCF <b>310</b> in line <b>17</b> of the message flow diagram. In lines <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b>, OK messages are communicated from S-CSCF <b>310</b> to UA <b>306</b></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, subscriber profile adaptation is performed on a diameter SAA message received from an S-CSCF. In an alternate example, the SAA message from the HSS may be modified. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates such an example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, profile adaptation manger <b>104</b> is a component of DSR <b>300</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The remaining components are the same as the correspondingly numbered components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In message flow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, subscriber terminal <b>306</b> roams in network A and generates a SIP register message that is forwarded to S-CSCF <b>310</b>. In response, S-CSCF <b>310</b> sends a diameter SAR in line <b>1</b> to HSS <b>302</b>. In line <b>2</b>, HSS <b>302</b> responds with a Diameter SAA message. The SAA message includes subscriber profile information which profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may intercept, add to, modify, or delete from based on the identity of the visited network. The remaining messages in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrate subscriber terminal <b>306</b> roaming in different networks. The message flow is the same as the message flow for network A. However, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify the user profile information differently based on the identity of the visited network.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example in a Diameter or IMS network where profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is co-located with HSS <b>302</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may add to, modify, or delete subscriber profile information provided in the SAA message based on the identity of the visited network as determined by the UAR message.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to the message flow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in lines <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the register message is communicated from UA <b>306</b> to I-CSCF <b>308</b>. In line <b>3</b>, I-CSCF <b>308</b> sends a Diameter UAR message to HSS <b>302</b>. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may determine the identity of the visited network from the UAR message and may store this information. In line <b>4</b>, HSS <b>302</b> sends a diameter UAA message to I-CSCF <b>308</b>. In response to UAA message, I-CSCF <b>308</b> selects an S-CSCF and sends a register message in line <b>5</b> to S-CSCF <b>310</b>. In line <b>6</b>, S-CSCF <b>310</b> sends a Diameter MAR message to HSS <b>302</b>. HSS <b>302</b> selects an authentication vector in response to a MAR message, and, in line <b>7</b>, sends a Diameter MAA message including the authentication vectors to S-CSCF <b>310</b>. In lines <b>8</b>-<b>10</b> of the message flow diagram, S-CSCF <b>310</b> sends a 401 unauthorized message to UA <b>306</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the preceding examples, subscriber profile information in HLR or HSS queries is modified. In an alternate implementation of the subject matter described herein, ENUM information provided by an ENUM server may be selectively answered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a network diagram illustrating ENUM server with source dependent answering according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an ENUM server <b>600</b> may perform ENUM translation based on stored ENUM data. For example, ENUM server <b>600</b> may translate received telephone numbers, such as E.164 formatted numbers, into domain name system (DNS) identifiers, such as uniform resource identifiers (URIs). ENUM server <b>600</b> may be provisioned with subscriber profile information for each ENUM translation record. ENUM server <b>600</b> may include profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> that determines how to respond to ENUM queries based on the identity of the requester. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may respond differently (i.e., provide different sets of subscriber profile information for the same subscriber) to ENUM queries based on whether the queries originate from requester <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, or <b>606</b>. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may also store records of ENUM transactions in a CDR or SDR and reporting database <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a message flow diagram illustrating an embodiment where profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> performs ENUM selective answering according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a plurality of ENUM servers <b>600</b>A, <b>600</b>B, and <b>600</b>C provide different tiers of ENUM information. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify ENUM responses from any of these tiers. An ENUM router <b>700</b> may route ENUM queries and responses. In the illustrated call message flow, in line <b>1</b>, requester <b>602</b> sends an ENUM query to tier <b>0</b> one ENUM server <b>600</b>A. Tier <b>0</b> one ENUM server <b>600</b>A forwards the message to tier <b>2</b> ENUM server <b>600</b>C. In line <b>2</b> of the message flow diagram, tier <b>2</b> ENUM server <b>600</b>C responds to the query with service details in an ENUM record. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may intercept the response and add to, omit, or modify the service details.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In lines <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, requester <b>604</b> requests ENUM data from tier <b>0</b> ENUM server <b>600</b>, forwards the information to ENUM server <b>600</b>B. ENUM server <b>600</b>B responds to the ENUM query. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify the ENUM record to contain no subscriber details, as illustrated in line <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In lines <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> of the message flow diagram, requester <b>606</b> queries tier <b>2</b> ENUM server <b>600</b>C and receives a response. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may pass the response unmodified based on identifying the requester as a friendly network operator. For example, if the originator or requester is a mobile operator who is a partner of the operator of the home network of the subscriber, the ENUM response will be populated with all of the service details. If the ENUM query is not from a partner network, the ENUM response may be provided without the corresponding service details.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As with the above-described embodiments, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> can be integrated a network node or may be a stand-alone node. For example, profile adaptation manger <b>106</b> may be integrated with an ENUM server or may be on a separate platform, such as an STP, DSR, or other node that intercepts ENUM responses. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> can modify, add to, or delete subscriber profile information in response to information presented or indicated by fields in the ENUM response.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an ENUM embodiment, the ENUM server that is configured with profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> can share all information with an operator from the same group and/or group of friendly operators. Such an ENUM server can share a reduced set of information with a mobile operator that does not belong to the group or alliance. For example, high-end services can be hidden to avoid subscriber churn. An ENUM server configured with profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> can share a minimal amount of information with an ISP with whom it has a relation. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> can refuse to answer if the requester is unfriendly. Additional functionality that can be implemented by an ENUM based profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> includes keeping account of how much information has been provided to a specific source and/or how recent information has been provided to a specific source. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may also generate CDRs or SDRs for billing or other network management purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the examples illustrated above, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> operates in MAP-based, IMS, and ENUM environments. In an alternate example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may operate in a long term evolution (LTE) network to adapt subscriber profile information based on the identity of the visited public land mobile network for serving gateway support node. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate such an embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is a component of HSS <b>302</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is a component of DSR <b>300</b>. However, rather than residing on an IMS network as described above, DSR <b>300</b> and HSS <b>302</b> reside at an LTE network. In the LTE network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, a user agent <b>306</b> is roaming and is served by mobility management entity <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to the message flow diagram illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in line <b>1</b>, when UA <b>306</b> first contacts the visited network or moves to a new area in the visited network, MME <b>700</b> sends a Diameter update location request (ULR) including the visited PLMN ID and SGSN number to HSS <b>302</b> in the home network. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may modify the response sent to the visited network based on the identity of the visited network, as determined by the visited PLMNID and/or the SGSN number. In line <b>2</b>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> sends a modified Diameter update location answer (ULA) message with the subscription data to MME <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the message flow is the same as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> except that profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> intercepts the Diameter update location answer message sent from HSS <b>302</b> to MME <b>800</b> and modifies the subscriber information in the message based on the identity of the visited network. As with the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the visited network may be identified by the PLMN ID and/or the SGSN number. The visited network can be identified by correlating the Diameter update location request and the corresponding answer or based on the answer alone. Modifying the subscriber profile information can include adding to, deleting from, or modifying the fields of the ULA message.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> intercepts and modifies the Diameter update location answer message. In an alternate example, HSS <b>302</b> may provide a Diameter insert subscriber data request (IDR) message in response to the ULR message before sending the update location answer message. The IDR request message may include subscriber profile information. In such an embodiment, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may intercept the IDR message, determine whether to modify the subscriber profile information in the IDR message based on the identity of the visited network, make the corresponding modifications to the subscriber profile information, and forward the modified message to the visited network.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an exemplary subscriber profile adaptation platform including a subscriber profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an example of profile adaptation manger platform that can be used to intercept HLR, HSS or ENUM responses containing subscriber information, to modify that information, and to forward the modified messages to the querying network. Alternatively, the profile adaptation platform may respond to received messages with the appropriate service subscriber profile information, if the subscriber profile adaptation platform is integrated with the database platform, such as an HLR, an HSS, or an ENUM server, that stores the subscriber profile information. In the illustrated example, profile adaptation platform <b>1200</b> includes a network interface for receiving queries and/or responses relating to or containing subscriber profile information. Profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> performs the operations described above regarding intercepting and modifying responses or responding to queries. Arrows <b>1204</b> and <b>1206</b> illustrate the case where profile adaptation platform <b>1200</b> intercepts or receives a response, modifies the response, and the forwards the modified response to the querying network. Arrows <b>1208</b> and <b>1210</b> illustrate the case where profile adaptation platform <b>1200</b> receives a message and responds to the message with the adapted profile. Profile adaptation platform <b>1200</b> can include a processor and associated memory with profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> being embodied in a non-transitory computer readable medium, such as the memory, and including computer executable instructions executable by the processor for controlling profile adaptation platform <b>1200</b> to perform the steps described herein for subscriber profile adaptation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart illustrating exemplary steps for dynamic subscriber profile adaptation according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. The steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> may be performed by profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> configured to operate as illustrated in any of the embodiments described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in step <b>1300</b>, a message generated by a database node in response to a message received by the database node is received. The received message includes subscriber profile information. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may receive a message from a database node separate from or co-located with profile adaptation manager <b>104</b>, where the response includes details about the subscriber's service profile. In step <b>1302</b>, it is determined whether to modify the subscriber profile information based on predetermined criteria. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may determine whether to add to, delete from, or change the subscriber profile information in the generated message based on the identity of the network to which the response is destined. In step <b>1304</b>, in response to determining to modify the subscriber profile information, the subscriber profile information is modified, and the modified subscriber profile information is forwarded to an originator of the message generated by the database node. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may add to, delete from, or change the subscriber profile information in the modified message based on the identity of the requester.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As set forth above, if profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> is co-located with a database node, such as an HLR, an HSS, or an ENUM server that receives messages and provides subscriber profile information, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may determine the set of subscriber information to include in the responsive messages (rather than intercepting response message generated by the database node and modifying the subscriber information in the generated message). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a message flow diagram illustrating exemplary steps for subscriber profile adaptation where profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> resides at a database node and determines the set of subscriber profile information to include in a responsive message according to an embodiment of the subject matter described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in step <b>1400</b>, a message is received by a subscriber profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> co-located with a database node. For example, profile adaptation manger <b>104</b> co-located with an HLR, an HSS, or an ENUM server may receive a MAP update location message, a Diameter update location request message, a Diameter IDR message, or an ENUM query. In step <b>1402</b>, a set of subscriber profile information provisioned for the subscriber to which the received message pertains is identified. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> and/or the underlying HLR, HSS, or ENUM server may determine the complete set of subscriber profile information provisioned for a subscriber by performing a lookup in a subscriber profile database using a subscriber identifier, such as an international mobile station identifier (IMSI), contained in the received message. In step <b>1404</b>, it is determined whether to modify the set of subscriber profile information for inclusion in a message generated in response to the message received by the database node based on predetermined criteria. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may determine whether to add to, delete from, or change items from the set of subscriber profile information for inclusion in the generated message based on the identity of the network from which the request originated. In step <b>1406</b>, in response to determining to modify the set of subscriber profile information for inclusion in the generated message, the set subscriber profile information to be included in the generated message is modified and the response is forwarded to an originator of the received message. For example, profile adaptation manager <b>104</b> may add to, delete from, or change the set of subscriber information to be included in the ISD message, UAR message, ULA message, IDR message, ENUM response, or other message based on the identity of the network that originated the query.</p>
