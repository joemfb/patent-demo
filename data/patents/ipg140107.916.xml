<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to papermaking, and relates more specifically to a structured fabric employed in a papermaking machine for the production of a fibrous web.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional papermaking process, a water slurry, or suspension, of cellulosic fibers (known as the paper &#x201c;stock&#x201d;) is fed into a gap between two endless woven wires that travels between two or more rolls. At least one of the wires are often referred to as a &#x201c;structured fabric&#x201d; that provides a papermaking surface on the upper surface of its upper run which operates as a filter to separate the cellulosic fibers of the paper stock from the aqueous medium, thereby forming a wet paper web. The aqueous medium drains through mesh openings of the structured fabric, known as drainage holes, by gravity or vacuum located on the lower surface of the upper run (i.e., the &#x201c;machine side&#x201d;) of the fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">After leaving the forming section, the paper web is transferred to a press section of the paper machine, where it is passed through the nips of one or more pairs of pressure rollers covered with another fabric, typically referred to as a &#x201c;press felt.&#x201d; Pressure from the rollers removes additional moisture from the web; the moisture removal is often enhanced by the presence of a &#x201c;batt&#x201d; layer of the press felt. The paper is then transferred to a dryer section for further moisture removal. After drying, the paper is ready for secondary processing and packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, papermakers' fabrics are manufactured as endless belts by one of two basic weaving techniques. In the first of these techniques, fabrics are flat woven by a flat weaving process, with their ends being joined to form an endless belt by any one of a number of well-known joining methods, such as dismantling and reweaving the ends together (commonly known as splicing), or sewing on a pin-seamable flap or a special foldback on each end, then reweaving these into pin-seamable loops. A number of auto-joining machines are available, which for certain fabrics may be used to automate at least part of the joining process. In a flat woven papermakers' fabric, the warp yarns extend in the machine direction and the filling yarns extend in the cross machine direction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the second basic weaving technique, fabrics are woven directly in the form of a continuous belt with an endless weaving process. In the endless weaving process, the warp yarns extend in the cross machine direction and the filling yarns extend in the machine direction. Both weaving methods described hereinabove are well known in the art, and the term &#x201c;endless belt&#x201d; as used herein refers to belts made by either method.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Effective sheet and fiber support are important considerations in papermaking, especially for the forming section of the papermaking machine, where the wet web is initially formed. Additionally, the structured fabrics should exhibit good stability when they are run at high speeds on the papermaking machines, and preferably are highly permeable to reduce the amount of water retained in the web when it is transferred to the press section of the paper machine. In both tissue and fine paper applications (i.e., paper for use in quality printing, carbonizing, cigarettes, electrical condensers, and the like) the papermaking surface comprises a very finely woven or fine wire mesh structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a conventional tissue forming machine, the sheet is formed flat. At the press section, 100% of the sheet is pressed and compacted to reach the necessary dryness and the sheet is further dried on a Yankee and hood section. The sheet is then creped and wound-up, thereby producing a flat sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an ATMOS&#x2122; system, a sheet is formed on a structured or molding fabric and the sheet is further sandwiched between the structured or molding fabric and a dewatering fabric. The sheet is dewatered through the dewatering fabric and opposite the molding fabric. The dewatering takes place with airflow and mechanical pressure. The mechanical pressure is created by a permeable belt and the direction of air flow is from the permeable belt to the dewatering fabric. This can occur when the sandwich passes through an extended pressure nip formed by a vacuum roll and the permeable belt. The sheet is then transferred to a Yankee by a press nip. Only about 25% of the sheet is slightly pressed by the Yankee while approximately 75% of the sheet remains unpressed for quality. The sheet is dried by a Yankee/Hood dryer arrangement and then dry creped. In the ATMOS&#x2122; system, one and the same structured fabric is used to carry the sheet from the headbox to the Yankee dryer. Using the ATMOS&#x2122; system, the sheet reaches between about 35 to 38% dryness after the ATMOS&#x2122; roll, which is almost the same dryness as a conventional press section. However, this advantageously occurs with almost 40 times lower nip pressure and without compacting and destroying sheet quality. Furthermore, a big advantage of the ATMOS&#x2122; system is that it utilizes a permeable belt which is highly tensioned, e.g., about 60 kN/m. This belt enhances the contact points and intimacy for maximum vacuum dewatering. Additionally, the belt nip is more than 20 times longer than a conventional press and utilizes airflow through the nip, which is not the case on a conventional press system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Actual results from trials using an ATMOS&#x2122; system have shown that the caliper and bulk of the sheet is 30% higher than the conventional through-air drying (TAD) formed towel fabrics. Absorbency capacity is also 30% higher than with conventional TAD formed towel fabrics. The results are the same whether one uses 100% virgin pulp up to 100% recycled pulp. Sheets can be produced with basis weight ratios of between 14 to 40 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The ATMOS&#x2122; system also provides excellent sheet transfer to the Yankee working at 33 to 37% dryness. A key aspect of the ATMOS&#x2122; system is that it forms the sheet on the molding fabric and the same molding fabric carries the sheet from the headbox to the Yankee dryer. This produces a sheet with a uniform and defined pore size for maximum absorbency capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/753,435 filed on May 24, 2007, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses a structured fabric for an ATMOS&#x2122; system. The fabric utilizes an at least three float warp and weft structure which, like the prior art fabrics, is symmetrical in form.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,686 to CHIU et al., the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses structured forming fabrics which utilize a load-bearing layer and a sculptured layer. The fabrics utilize impression knuckles to imprint the sheet and increase its surface contour. This document, however, does not create pillows in the sheet for effective dewatering of TAD applications, nor does it teach using the disclosed fabrics on an ATMOS&#x2122; system and/or forming the pillows in the sheet while the sheet is relatively wet and utilizing a hi-tension press nip.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">What is needed in the art is an efficient effective single layer fabric weave pattern to be used in a papermaking machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one aspect, the invention provides a structured fabric for use with a papermaking machine for the production of a fibrous web.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views. The exemplification set out herein illustrates one embodiment of the invention, in one form, and such exemplification is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, and the description is taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The present invention relates to a structured fabric for a papermaking machine, a former for manufacturing a paper web, and also to a former which utilizes the structured fabric, and in some embodiments a belt press, in a papermaking machine.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention also relates to a twin wire former ATMOS&#x2122; system which utilizes the structured fabric which has good resistance to pressure and excessive tensile strain forces, and which can withstand wear/hydrolysis effects that are experienced in an ATMOS&#x2122; system. The system may also include a permeable belt for use in a high tension extended nip around a rotating roll or a stationary shoe and a dewatering fabric for the manufacture of premium tissue or towel grades. The fabric has key parameters which include permeability, weight, caliper, and certain compressibility.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Weave patterns <b>10</b> of the structured fabric <b>28</b> of the present invention are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-30</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a weave pattern <b>10</b> from a top pattern view of the web facing side of the fabric, also known as the papermaking surface. The numbers <b>1</b>-<b>20</b>, shown on the bottom of the pattern identify the warp, machine direction (MD) yarns, while the right side numbers <b>1</b>-<b>20</b> show the weft, cross direction (CD) yarns. The symbol &#x2018;X&#x2019; illustrates a location where a warp yarn passes over a weft yarn and an empty box illustrates a location where a warp yarn passes under a weft yarn. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the areas that are shaded indicate long float warp yarns, which float over at least two weft yarns. The shaded areas form an MD float pattern, which only incorporate the even numbered warp yarns, while the non-shaded areas represent a plain weave pattern for the odd numbered warp yarns. In a like manner, the weave patterns of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>11</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>26</b> illustrate other embodiments of the present invention in the same format, each being conveniently identified with reference number <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The odd numbered warp yarns weave plainly with the weft yarns and have a smaller diameter or cross sectional area than the even numbered warp yarns, resulting in a physical motif that is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Corresponding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>12</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>27</b> for the other embodiments also show motifs for those respective embodiments. Since the odd numbered warp yarns are the smaller cross sectional area, when the weave pattern <b>10</b> is woven, the main width of the weave occurs because of the width of the even numbered warp yarns and the odd numbered warp yarns are substantially inconsequential in the look of the motifs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the weave pattern of the warp yarns relative to the weft yarns with the weft yarns being represented in each line as the numbers and with the line being the pattern of the warp yarns. Each line represents the warp yarn identified along the left side of the FIG. In a like manner, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>13</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>28</b> represent the weave patterns of each respective embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> there is an illustration of what the weave pattern of this set of embodiments produce within structured fabric <b>28</b>. In a like manner, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>14</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>29</b> illustrate structured fabrics <b>28</b> of each separate embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated the impression of fabric <b>28</b> on paper or web <b>38</b>. This impression illustrates where web <b>38</b> is most largely impressed with structured fabric <b>28</b>. In a like manner, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>30</b> also are illustrative of the impression of each structured fabric <b>28</b>, respective to each embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The warp yarns interact with the weft yarns to produce weave patterns <b>10</b>. The plurality of warp yarns can be thought of as two sets of warp yarns, one set containing 10 warp yarns of a smaller diameter and another set of 10 warp yarns of a larger diameter. The smaller diameter set of yarns form the first lower plane and the second set of larger diameter warp yarns form a surface in another plane, which is a higher plane, being positioned farther from the machine facing side of the fabric. This raised second plane surface is to be understood to be an impression layer.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is contemplated that the yarns may be substantially circular in their cross-sectional aspect and the one set of warp yarns being of a smaller diameter than the second set. The smaller set of warp yarns may have a diameter in the range of 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm and the second, larger diameter, set of warp yarns may be in a range of 0.3 mm to 0.8 mm. Although other diameters and cross-sectional areas and, hence, yarn shapes, are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Weave patterns <b>10</b> each illustrate a 20 weft yarn by 20 warp yarn pattern. The plain weave warp yarns, which are the odd numbered warp yarns, are all separated by an even numbered larger diameter warp yarns. Although the illustrations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>21</b>, and <b>26</b> show a significantly square pattern, the smaller diameter odd numbered warp yarns cause the pattern to more specifically approach the motif patterns in their relative size as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>27</b>. This apparent shift in size from weave pattern to the motif is also illustrated as seen in the fabrics represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>29</b> and by the structured web impressions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>30</b>. As a result of the smaller sized odd numbered plain weaving warp yarns, the width in the cross directional direction is substantially less than the length of the machine direction for each weave pattern repeat.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The even numbered warp yarns weave with no more than six weft yarns in any of the weave patterns of the present invention. In studying the warp yarn interaction with the weft yarns, it can be seen that the warp yarns weave exclusively with the following sets of weft yarns: 2 or 3, 2 or 4, 4, 4 or 5, and 4 or 6. For example, the pattern illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> have the even numbered warp yarns interacting with 2 or 3 weft yarns. As a further example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>, the even numbered warp yarns interact, or weave exclusively, with either 4 or 5 weft yarns. As yet another example, in the weave pattern illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-15</figref>, the even numbered warp yarns interact with either 4 or 6 of the weft yarns. In a like manner, the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref> have a weave pattern where the even numbered warp yarns interact with only 4 or 6 weft yarns. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-25</figref>, the even numbered warp yarns exclusively interact with only 4 weft yarns. In the weave pattern embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-30</figref>, the even numbered warp yarns weave with either 2 or 4 weft yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It can be said that of the two warp systems that are used in the present invention the warp yarns having a smaller diameter warp ate used to weave a background ply while the larger diameter warp is used to create the impression layer on a higher plane. The present invention advantageously allows the warp yarns in a structured fabric <b>28</b> to be raised to a higher plane than the wefts in order to display a specific pattern that can be imparted to the sheet of paper <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Topographical features of weave pattern <b>10</b> are repeated in structured fabric <b>28</b> and are reflected upon web <b>38</b> as web <b>38</b> is produced in the papermaking machine. The topographical features cause a three-dimensional effect in web <b>38</b> reflective of weave pattern <b>10</b>, which enhances web <b>38</b> and imparts characteristics to web <b>38</b>, such as pocket depth and texture.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The structured fabric can also be treated and/or coated with an additional polymeric material that is applied by, e.g., deposition. The material can be added cross-linked during processing in order to enhance fabric stability, contamination resistance, drainage, wearability, improve heat and/or hydrolysis resistance and in order to reduce fabric surface tension. This aids in sheet release and/or reduced drive loads. The treatment/coating can be applied to impart/improve one or several of these properties of the fabric. As indicated previously, the topographical pattern in the paper web can be changed and manipulated by use of different single-layer weaves. Further enhancement of the pattern can be attained by adjustments to the specific fabric weave by changes to the yarn diameter, yarn counts, yarn types, yarn shapes, permeability, caliper and the addition of a treatment or coating etc. In addition, a printed design, such as a screen-printed design, of polymeric material can be applied to the fabric to enhance its ability to impart an aesthetic pattern into the web or to enhance the quality of the web. Finally, one or more surfaces of the fabric or molding belt can be subjected to sanding and/or abrading in order to enhance surface characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The characteristics of the individual yarns utilized in the fabric of the present invention can vary depending upon the desired properties of the final papermakers' fabric. For example, the materials comprising yarns employed in the fabric of the present invention may be those commonly used in papermakers' fabric. As such, the yarns may be formed of polypropylene, polyester, nylon, or the like. The skilled artisan should select a yarn material according to the particular application of the final fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">By way of non-limiting example, the structured fabric is a single-layered woven fabric which can withstand high pressures, heat, moisture concentrations, and which can achieve a high level of water removal and also mold or emboss the paper web. These characteristics provide a structured fabric appropriate for the Voith ATMOS&#x2122; papermaking process. The fabric preferably has a width stability and a suitable high permeability and preferably utilizes hydrolysis and/or temperature resistant materials, as discussed above. The fabric is preferably a woven fabric that can be installed on an ATMOS&#x2122; machine as a pre-joined and/or seamed continuous and/or endless belt. Alternatively, the structured fabric can be joined in the ATMOS&#x2122; machine using, e.g., a pin-seam arrangement or can otherwise be seamed on the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The invention also provides for utilizing the structured fabric disclosed herein on a machine for making a fibrous web, e.g., tissue or hygiene paper web, etc., which can be, e.g., a twin wire or a permeable belt ATMOS&#x2122; system. Referring again to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-37</figref>, there is a fibrous web machine including a headbox <b>22</b> that discharges a fibrous slurry between a forming fabric <b>26</b> and a structured fabric <b>28</b> having a weave pattern <b>10</b>. It should be understood that structured fabric <b>28</b> is an embodiment of the structured fabric discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-28</figref>. Rollers <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> direct fabric <b>26</b> in such a manner that tension is applied thereto, against slurry <b>24</b> and structured fabric <b>28</b>. Structured fabric <b>28</b> is supported by forming roll <b>34</b> which rotates with a surface speed that matches the speed of structured fabric <b>28</b> and forming fabric <b>26</b>. Structured fabric <b>28</b> has peaks and valleys as defined by weave pattern <b>10</b>, which give a corresponding structure to web <b>38</b> formed thereon. Structured fabric <b>28</b> travels in a web direction, and as moisture is driven from the fibrous slurry, structured fibrous web <b>38</b> takes form. The moisture that leaves the slurry travels through forming fabric <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The fibrous slurry is formed into a web <b>38</b> with a structure that matches the shape of structured fabric <b>28</b>. Forming fabric <b>26</b> is porous and allows moisture to escape during forming. Further, water is removed through dewatering fabric <b>82</b>. The removal of moisture through fabric <b>82</b> does not cause compression of web <b>38</b> traveling on structured fabric <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Due to the formation of the web <b>38</b> with the structured fabric <b>28</b> the pockets of the fabric <b>28</b> are fully filled with fibers. Therefore, at the Yankee surface <b>52</b> the web <b>38</b> has a much higher contact area, up to approximately 100%, as compared to the prior art because the web <b>38</b> on the side contacting the Yankee surface <b>52</b> is almost flat.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, there is shown an embodiment of the process where a structured fibrous web <b>38</b> is formed. Structured fabric <b>28</b> carries a three dimensional structured fibrous web <b>38</b> to an advanced dewatering system <b>50</b>, past vacuum box <b>67</b> and then to a position where the web is transferred to Yankee dryer <b>52</b> and hood section <b>54</b> for additional drying and creping before winding up on a reel (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A shoe press <b>56</b> is placed adjacent to structured fabric <b>28</b>, holding fabric <b>28</b> in a position proximate Yankee dryer <b>52</b>. Structured fibrous web <b>38</b> comes into contact with Yankee dryer <b>52</b> and transfers to a surface thereof, for further drying and subsequent creping.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">A vacuum box <b>58</b> is placed adjacent to structured fabric <b>28</b> to achieve improved solids levels. Web <b>38</b>, which is carried by structured fabric <b>28</b>, contacts dewatering fabric <b>82</b> and proceeds toward vacuum roll <b>60</b>. Vacuum roll <b>60</b> operates at a vacuum level of &#x2212;0.2 to &#x2212;0.8 bar with a preferred operating level of at least &#x2212;0.4 bar. Hot air hood <b>62</b> is optionally fit over vacuum roll <b>60</b> to improve dewatering.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Optionally a steam box can be installed instead of the hood <b>62</b> supplying steam to the web <b>38</b>. The steam box preferably has a sectionalized design to influence the moisture re-dryness cross profile of the web <b>38</b>. The length of the vacuum zone inside the vacuum roll <b>60</b> can be from 200 mm to 2,500 mm, with a preferable length of 300 mm to 1,200 mm and an even more preferable length of between 400 mm to 800 mm. The solids level of web <b>38</b> leaving suction roll <b>60</b> is 25% to 55% depending on installed options. A vacuum box <b>67</b> and hot air supply <b>65</b> can be used to increase web <b>38</b> solids after vacuum roll <b>60</b> and prior to Yankee dryer <b>52</b>. Wire turning roll <b>69</b> can also be a suction roll with a hot air supply hood. As discussed above, roll <b>56</b> includes a shoe press with a shoe width of 80 mm or higher, preferably 120 mm or higher, with a maximum peak pressure of less than 2.5 MPa. To create an even longer nip to facilitate the transfer of web <b>38</b> to Yankee dryer <b>52</b>, web <b>38</b> carried on structured fabric <b>28</b> can be brought into contact with the surface of Yankee dryer <b>52</b> prior to the press nip associated with shoe press <b>56</b>. Further, the contact can be maintained after structured fabric <b>28</b> travels beyond press <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, there is shown yet another embodiment of the present invention, which is substantially similar to the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, except that instead of hot air hood <b>62</b>, there is a belt press <b>64</b>. Belt press <b>64</b> includes a permeable belt <b>66</b> capable of applying pressure to the machine side of structured fabric <b>28</b> that carries web <b>38</b> around vacuum roll <b>60</b>. Fabric <b>66</b> of belt press <b>64</b> is also known as an extended nip press belt or a link fabric, which can run at 60 KN/m fabric tension with a pressing length that is longer than the suction zone of roll <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Preferred embodiments of the fabric <b>66</b> and the required operation conditions are also described in PCT/EP2004/053688 and PCT/EP2005/050198 which are herewith incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The above mentioned references are also fully applicable for dewatering fabrics <b>82</b> and press fabrics <b>66</b> described in the further embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Belt <b>66</b> is a specially designed extended nip press belt <b>66</b>, made of, for example reinforced polyurethane and/or a spiral link fabric. Belt <b>66</b> also can have a woven construction. Such a woven construction is disclosed, e.g., in EP 1837439. Belt <b>66</b> is permeable thereby allowing air to flow there through to enhance the moisture removing capability of belt press <b>64</b>. Moisture is drawn from web <b>38</b> through dewatering fabric <b>82</b> and into vacuum roll <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of the present invention which is substantially similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> with the addition of hot air hood <b>68</b> placed inside of belt press <b>64</b> to enhance the dewatering capability of belt press <b>64</b> in conjunction with vacuum roll <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, there is shown yet another embodiment of the present invention, which is substantially similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, but including a boost dryer <b>70</b> which encounters structured fabric <b>28</b>. Web <b>38</b> is subjected to a hot surface of boost dryer <b>70</b>, and structured web <b>38</b> rides around boost dryer <b>70</b> with another woven fabric <b>72</b> riding on top of structured fabric <b>28</b>. On top of woven fabric <b>72</b> is a thermally conductive fabric <b>74</b>, which is in contact with both woven fabric <b>72</b> and a cooling jacket <b>76</b> that applies cooling and pressure to all fabrics and web <b>38</b>. The pressing process does not negatively impact web quality. The drying rate of boost dryer <b>70</b> is above 400 kg/hr m<sup>2 </sup>and preferably above 500 kg/hr m<sup>2</sup>. The concept of boost dryer <b>70</b> is to provide sufficient pressure to hold web <b>38</b> against the hot surface of the dryer thus preventing blistering. Steam that is formed at the knuckle points of fabric <b>28</b> passes through fabric <b>28</b> and is condensed on fabric <b>72</b>. Fabric <b>72</b> is cooled by fabric <b>74</b> that is in contact with cooling jacket <b>76</b>, which reduces its temperature to well below that of the steam. Thus the steam is condensed to avoid a pressure build up to thereby avoid blistering of web <b>38</b>. The condensed water is captured in woven fabric <b>72</b>, which is dewatered by dewatering device <b>75</b>. It has been shown that depending on the size of boost dryer <b>70</b>, the need for vacuum roll <b>60</b> can be eliminated. Further, depending on the size of boost dryer <b>70</b>, web <b>38</b> may be creped on the surface of boost dryer <b>70</b>, thereby eliminating the need for Yankee dryer <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, there is shown yet another embodiment of the present invention substantially similar to the invention disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> but with an addition of an air press <b>78</b>, which is a four roll cluster press that is used with high temperature air and is referred to as a High Pressure Through Air Dryer (HPTAD) for additional web drying prior to the transfer of web <b>38</b> to Yankee dryer <b>52</b>. Four-roll cluster press <b>78</b> includes a main roll, a vented roll, and two cap rolls. The purpose of this cluster press is to provide a sealed chamber that is capable of being pressurized. The pressure chamber contains high temperature air, for example, 150&#xb0; C. or higher and is at a significantly higher pressure than conventional TAD technology, for example, greater than 1.5 psi resulting in a much higher drying rate than a conventional TAD. The high-pressure hot air passes through an optional air dispersion fabric, through web <b>38</b> and fabric structured <b>28</b> into a vent roll. The air dispersion fabric may prevent web <b>38</b> from following one of the cap rolls. The air dispersion fabric is very open, having a permeability that equals or exceeds that of fabric structured <b>28</b>. The drying rate of the HPTAD depends on the solids content of web <b>38</b> as it enters the HPTAD. The preferred drying rate is at least 500 kg/hr m<sup>2</sup>, which is a rate of at least twice that of conventional TAD machines.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Advantages of the HPTAD process are in the areas of improved sheet dewatering without a significant loss in sheet quality and compactness in size and energy efficiency. Additionally, it enables higher pre-Yankee solids, which increase the speed potential of the invention. Further, the compact size of the HPTAD allows for easy retrofitting to an existing machine. The compact size of the HPTAD and the fact that it is a closed system means that it can be easily insulated and optimized as a unit to increase energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, there is shown another embodiment of the present invention. This is significantly similar to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 35</figref> except for the addition of a two-pass HPTAD <b>80</b>. In this case, two vented rolls are used to double the dwell time of structured web <b>38</b> relative to the design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. An optional coarse mesh fabric may be used as in the previous embodiment. Hot pressurized air passes through web <b>38</b> carried on structured fabric <b>28</b> and onto the two vent rolls. It has been shown that depending on the configuration and size of the HPTAD, more than one HPTAD can be placed in series, which can eliminate the need for roll <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, a conventional twin wire former <b>90</b> may be used to replace the crescent former shown in previous examples. The forming roll can be either a solid or open roll. If an open roll is used, care must be taken to prevent significant dewatering through the structured fabric to avoid losing basis weight in the pillow areas. The outer forming fabric <b>93</b> can be either a standard forming fabric or one such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,644. The inner fabric <b>91</b> should be a structured fabric that is much coarser than the outer forming fabric <b>90</b>. For example, inner fabric <b>91</b> may be similar to structured fabric <b>28</b>. A vacuum roll <b>92</b> may be needed to ensure that the web stays with structured fabric <b>91</b> and does not go with outer wire <b>90</b>. Web <b>38</b> is transferred to structured fabric <b>28</b> using a vacuum device. The transfer can be a stationary vacuum shoe or a vacuum assisted rotating pick-up roll <b>94</b>. The second structured fabric <b>28</b> is at least the same coarseness and preferably coarser than first structured fabric <b>91</b>. The process from this point is the same as the process previously discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. The registration of the web from the first structured fabric to the second structured fabric is not perfect, and as such some pillows will lose some basis weight during the expansion process, thereby losing some of the benefit of the present invention. However, this process option allows for running a differential speed transfer, which has been shown to improve some sheet properties. Any of the arrangements for removing water discussed above as may be used with the twin wire former arrangement and a conventional TAD.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While this invention has been described with respect to at least one embodiment, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.</p>
