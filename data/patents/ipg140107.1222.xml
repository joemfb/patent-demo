<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a &#xa7;371 national stage patent application of PCT/EP2009/007517, filed Oct. 20, 2009, claiming priority to German Patent Application No. 10 2008 063 248.1 and US Provisional Patent Application No. 61/141,317, both filed Dec. 30, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a transport cart for loading an aircraft galley, for example with service products required for provisioning the passengers on board the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, it is usual for some of the service products required for provisioning the passengers on board a commercial aircraft, such as, for example, foodstuffs or beverages, to be loaded into trolleys. The loading of the trolleys is performed by a catering firm responsible for supplying the service products. The filled trolleys are brought on board the aircraft and accommodated in corresponding trolley receiving regions in the galleys of the aircraft. When the aircraft is in flight, some of the trolleys accommodated in the trolley receiving regions in the galleys are used for service tasks, i.e. the distribution of meals and beverages to the passengers in the passenger cabin. The rest of the trolleys, on the other hand, remain in the trolley receiving regions in the galleys throughout the entire flight. Since they are equipped with a stable, impact-resistant housing, wheels, brakes, etc., trolleys have a relatively large volume and a relatively high weight. In particular, the trolleys not used for service tasks result in an increased space requirement and additional weight in the galleys of the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Service products that are not to be loaded into trolleys are brought on board the aircraft by means of a transport cart by the catering firm responsible for supplying the service products, and they are stored there manually, in cabinets provided in the galleys. After being unloaded, the transport cart is brought back off the aircraft. The manual loading of the galley cabinets is relatively time-consuming. Further, in particular the loading of galley upper cabinets, i.e. cabinets disposed in an upper section of the galleys, requires the application of a relatively large amount of effort.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known from WO 2007/096000 A1 is an aircraft galley of modular design, which comprises a basic body having a plurality of compartments. The compartments receive boxes of differing sizes, in which service products required for provisioning the passengers on board the aircraft, such as, for example, foodstuffs or beverages, can be accommodated. Further, various appliances such as, for example, an oven or a microwave appliance, are disposed in the compartments of the basic body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is based on the object of providing a transport cart that enables an aircraft galley to be loaded in a simple, safe and convenient manner, for example with products required for provisioning the passengers on board the aircraft, and that is suitable, in particular, for loading an aircraft galley of modular design known from WO 2007/096000 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A transport cart, according to the invention, for loading an aircraft galley comprises a base element configured, for example, in the form of a plate. A plurality of wheels are attached to the base element, i.e. to an underside of the base element. Further, two frame elements, disposed at a distance from each other, are connected to the base element. For example, a first frame element can be connected to the base element in the region of a first edge of the base element, and a second frame element can be connected to the base element in the region of a second edge of the base element that is opposite the first edge of the base element. For example, the frame elements can each be constituted by a substantially U-shaped tube.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The transport cart according to the invention further comprises a first guide device, which is set up for engaging a complementary second guide device formed on a box that can be received in the aircraft galley to be loaded and provided for transporting in the transport cart. The first guide device is set up for securing the box against displacement on the transport cart in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the transport cart when engaged with the complementary second guide device formed on the box. A longitudinal axis of the transport cart is understood here as an axis aligned in the normal direction of travel of the transport cart. In acting together with the complementary second guide device configured on the box, the first guide device thus ensures that a box transported on the transport cart does not become displaced on the transport cart in an unwanted manner, for example when the transport cart travels over uneven ground.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first guide device of the transport cart according to the invention is preferably designed such that it corresponds to a guide device provided in the aircraft galley to be loaded, for the purpose of acting together with the second guide device configured on the box, to such an extent that the second guide device formed on the box can be brought into engagement both with the first guide device of the transport cart and with the guide device provided in the aircraft galley to be loaded. Only a second guide device, which can act together with the first guide device of the transport cart during the transporting of the box on the transport cart, need then be configured on the box. When the box is received in the aircraft galley, on the other hand, the second guide device configured on the box can then act together with the guide device of the aircraft galley.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the transport cart according to the invention comprises a locking mechanism configured for securing the box against displacement on the transport cart in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the transport cart. In other words, the locking mechanism serves to prevent the box falling down from the transport cart in an unwanted manner, for example when the transport cart is moved in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the transport cart. Since the transport cart according to the invention is provided with a locking mechanism, the transport cart need not be provided with a closed receiving container or the like. As a result, the transport cart can be designed so as to be relatively light in weight. By means of the transport cart according to the invention, an aircraft galley can be loaded with boxes containing, for example, service products required for provisioning the passengers on board the aircraft, in a simple, convenient and safe manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first guide device of the transport cart according to the invention is preferably swivelable between an operative position, in which it can engage a complementary second guide device configured on a box, and a non-operative position, in which no connection of the first guide device to a complementary second guide device configured on a box is possible. When the first guide device is in its operative position, the transport cart according to the invention can therefore be loaded with a box carrying a complementary second guide device. In its non-operative position, on the other hand, the first guide device is preferably disposed such that the transport cart can be used to transport another item, for example a box not equipped with a second guide device, or a larger box, without the loading or unloading of the transport cart being impeded by the first guide device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, the first guide device, in its operative position, can project into an inner region of the transport cart delimited by the frame elements. The first guide device can then, for example, act together with a complementary second guide device disposed in the region of a side wall of a box provided for transporting on the transport cart. In its non-operative position, on the other hand, the first guide device preferably substantially releases the inner region of the transport cart delimited by the frame elements. When the first guide device is in its non-operative position, the inner region of the transport cart can therefore be loaded in an unimpeded manner with other items such as, for example, a box not equipped with a second guide device, or a larger box.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first guide device can comprise, for example, a rail, which is provided to act together with a component of the second guide device configured on the box that is designed so as to be complementary to the shape of the rail. Alternatively thereto, the second guide device configured on the box can also comprise a rail, which is set up to act together with a component of the first guide device configured so as to be complementary to the shape of the rail. A particularly secure connection of the first guide device to the second guide device can then be ensured if the first guide device and the complementary second guide device configured on the box constitute a tongue and groove connection. For example, the first guide device can comprise a projection shaped such that it is suitable for being received in a groove of the second guide device configured on the box. Alternatively thereto, the second guide device configured on the box can also have a projection shaped such that it is suitable for being received in a groove of the first guide device of the transport cart.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The locking mechanism of the transport cart according to the invention preferably comprises a first and a second lock, which are attached to a frame element, at a distance from each other along the longitudinal axis of the transport cart. For example, the first lock can be attached to a frame element in the region of a first end of the transport cart, and the second lock can be attached to the frame element in the region of a second end of the transport cart that is opposite the first end of the transport cart. The locks of the locking mechanism then reliably prevent a box, transported on the transport cart, from falling down from the transport cart in the region of the first or second end, while the frame elements secure the box against falling down sideways. In principle, it is possible for the locks of the locking mechanism to be attached to differing frame elements. Preferably, however, both locks of the locking mechanism are assigned to the same frame element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The locking mechanism can comprise a coupling device that couples the locks of the locking mechanism to each other in such a way that, upon a movement of the first lock of the locking mechanism into a locking position, the second lock of the locking mechanism is likewise moved into a locking position and, upon a movement of the first lock of the locking mechanism into a non-locking position, the second lock of the locking mechanism is likewise moved into a non-locking position. Similarly, the coupling device preferably has the effect that, upon a movement of the second lock of the locking mechanism into a locking position, the first lock of the locking mechanism is likewise moved into a locking position and, upon a movement of the second lock of the locking mechanism into a non-locking position, the first lock of the locking mechanism is likewise moved into a non-locking position. The coupling device thus makes it possible, through an actuation of an easily accessible first lock, for example disposed in the region of a first end of the transport cart, to effect also an actuation a second lock that is not easily accessible, or not accessible at all, disposed in the region of a second end of the transport cart, and vice versa. The coupling device can comprise, for example, a rod that is rotatable about its longitudinal axis, and which carries the locks of the locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The transport cart according to the invention can further comprise a carrier element that can be attached to at least one frame element and is set up to support a bottom element of a box received on the transport cart or a bottom element of another item received on the transport cart such as, for example, an aircraft galley component. The provision of a carrier element is advantageous, in particular, when an item not provided with a second guide device that is complementary to the first guide device of the transport cart is to be transported on the transport cart. Further, the carrier element can serve to support a bottom element of a particularly heavy box that is not to be held on the transport cart solely by the second guide device configured on the box acting together with the first guide device of the transport cart. The carrier element can comprise a first and a second strip, which are each attached to a frame element and project into an inner region of the transport cart delimited by the frame elements. Further, the carrier element can comprise connecting elements that connect the strips to each other. A carrier element that comprises, instead of a plate-type element, only two strips and connecting elements can be designed so as to be particularly light in weight.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first guide device can be mounted on a frame element or on the carrier element. For example, the first guide device can be configured in two parts, a part of the first guide device being able to be mounted on each frame element of the transport cart or on each of the strips of the carrier element. Depending on the specific application requirements for the transport cart, the transport cart can be provided with a plurality of first guide devices, of which one or more can be mounted on a frame element and one or more can be mounted on a carrier element.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular a first guide device mounted on a carrier element is preferably swivelable between an operative position and a non-operative position. When a first guide device that is hinged to a carrier element in a swivelable manner is in its operative position, a second guide device configured on a box can be brought into engagement with the first guide device, and the box can thereby be secured against displacing on the transport cart in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the transport cart. Further, a bottom element of the box can be supported by the carrier element, such that the box can be held securely on the transport cart even if it is of a particularly heavy weight. When a first guide device mounted on a carrier element is in its non-operative position, on the other hand, the carrier element can be used to receive another item on the transport cart, for example a box not provided with a second guide device, or a component of the aircraft galley such as, for example, an oven or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The base element, the first guide device and/or the carrier element is/are preferably disposed in a position on the transport cart that is adapted to a position of an arrangement for receiving a box provided for transporting on the transport cart, or an aircraft galley component in the aircraft galley, in such a way that a box or aircraft galley component received on the transport cart can be loaded from the transport cart into the aircraft galley substantially through a horizontal displacement. For example, the base element of the transport cart can be disposed at a height that corresponds to the height of a bottom plate of a compartment of the aircraft galley disposed in a lower section of the aircraft galley. A box received on the base element of the transport cart can be conveniently pushed from the transport cart into the compartment of the aircraft galley without the need to raise or lower the box.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Similarly, the first guide device of the transport cart can be disposed at a height that corresponds to the height of a guide device of the aircraft galley that, just like the first guide device of the transport cart, can be brought into engagement with a second guide device configured on a box. A box held on the transport cart by the first guide device of the transport cart acting together with the second guide device configured on the box can then be easily pushed from the transport cart into the aircraft galley, the second guide device configured on the box engaging the guide device of the aircraft galley. Finally, the carrier element of the transport cart can be disposed at a height that corresponds to the height of a carrier plate of the aircraft galley that serves to receive aircraft galley components such as, for example, ovens, beverage preparation devices, etc. An aircraft galley component received on the carrier element of the transport cart can then be conveniently pushed from the transport cart to its destination position in the aircraft galley without the need to raise or lower the aircraft galley component.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A plurality of rolls are preferably disposed in the region of a top side of the base element. As a result, a large, heavy box, or another large, heavy item can be loaded onto the base element of the transport cart, and unloaded again from the base element of the transport cart, in a particularly simple and convenient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A blocking device for blocking the wheels of the transport cart preferably comprises a plurality of actuating arrangements. For example, a first actuating arrangement can be disposed in the region of the first end of the transport cart, while a second actuating arrangement is located in the region of a second end that is opposite the first end of the transport cart. The blocking device can then be actuated from both sides of the transport cart in a particularly convenient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The transport cart according to the invention preferably further comprises a holding device, which is set up to interact with a cover element and/or side walls of a box received on the transport cart. Preferably, the holding device is connected to a frame element of the transport cart in an upper region of the transport cart, and serves to additionally secure a box received at the top of the transport cart. Preferably, the holding device projects into the interior of the transport cart that is delimited by the frame elements. In a manner similar to the first guide device, the holding device can also be configured in two parts, such that a first component of the holding device can be attached to the first frame element of the transport cart, while a second component of the holding device can be mounted on the second frame element of the transport cart, opposite the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The transport cart according to the invention preferably further comprises a positioning device, which is set up to interact with a complementary positioning device provided on the aircraft galley to be loaded, in order to position the transport cart relative to the aircraft galley to be loaded. By means of the positioning device it can be ensured that the transport cart, when in operation, is disposed in a position, relative to the aircraft galley, in which the transport cart can be loaded and unloaded in a particularly simple manner, or elements can be removed from the aircraft galley in a particularly simple manner and the aircraft galley can be loaded in a particularly simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The positioning device can be attached to the base element of the transport cart. Further, the positioning device can be provided with a recess that is set up to receive a projection of the complementary positioning device provided on the aircraft galley to be loaded when the transport cart has attained a desired position relative to the aircraft galley to be loaded. Alternatively thereto, the positioning device of the transport cart can also have a projection provided to be received in a recess of the complementary positioning device provided on the aircraft galley to be loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The spacing of the two frame elements connected to the base element is adapted to the design of the aircraft galley to be loaded, or to the design of the boxes and aircraft galley components to be received in the aircraft galley. In particular, the spacing of the two frame elements connected to the base element can correspond to the width of compartments provided in the aircraft galley and, if the width of these compartments varies in dependence on the height of the aircraft galley, can vary likewise. Preferably, however, the spacing of the two frame elements connected to the base element is less than the width of an aisle of an aircraft in which the aircraft galley to be loaded is disposed. The transport cart can then, if required, be moved through the aisle of the aircraft in a convenient manner.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A transport cart <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref> comprises a plate-type base element <b>12</b>, which has a substantially rectangular base area. Four wheels <b>14</b> are attached to an underside of the base element <b>12</b>. The base element <b>12</b> is disposed at a height that corresponds to the height of a bottom plate of an aircraft galley compartment disposed in a lower section of an aircraft galley. A plurality of rollers <b>16</b> are provided in the region of a top side of the base element <b>12</b> that is opposite the underside. By means of the rollers <b>16</b>, an item such as, for example, a box provided to be received in the compartment of the aircraft galley can be pushed easily from the transport cart into the aircraft galley compartment provided to receive the box. Similarly, the rollers <b>16</b> facilitate the removal of such a box from the aircraft galley compartment, since the box can be conveniently drawn out of the compartment, onto the base element <b>12</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the region of a first edge <b>18</b> of the base element <b>12</b>, a first frame element <b>20</b> is attached to the base element <b>12</b>. Similarly, a second frame element <b>24</b> is attached in the region of a second edge <b>22</b> of the base element <b>12</b> that is opposite the first edge <b>18</b> of the base element <b>12</b>. The frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> are each constituted by a substantially U-shaped tube, and delimit between them an inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A first guide device <b>28</b>, configured in two parts, is mounted on the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. As can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first guide device <b>28</b> comprises a first and a second strip <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, which extend parallelwise in relation to the base element <b>12</b>, the first strip <b>30</b> being attached to the first frame element <b>20</b> and the second strip <b>32</b> being attached to the second frame element <b>24</b>. A projection <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is configured, respectively, on the strips <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The first guide device <b>28</b>, i.e. the strips <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> constituting the first guide device <b>28</b>, is/are mounted on the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> so as to be swivelable between an operative position and a non-operative position. In their operative position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the strips <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the first guide device <b>28</b> project into the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> delimited by the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. In their non-operative position, on the other hand, the strips <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the first guide device <b>28</b> extend substantially perpendicularly in relation to the base area of the base element <b>12</b>, and thereby substantially release the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> delimited by the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the first guide device <b>28</b> is in its operative position, i.e. the strips <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the first guide device <b>28</b> project into the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>, the first guide device <b>28</b> can engage a complementary second guide device configured on a box that can be received in the aircraft galley to be loaded and provided for transporting on the transport cart <b>10</b>. The second guide device configured on the box can comprise, for example, grooves for receiving the projections <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> of the first guide device <b>28</b>, such that the first guide device <b>28</b> and the complementary second guide device configured on the box constitute a tongue and groove connection. When the first guide device <b>28</b> is in engagement with the complementary second guide device configured on the box, the box received on the transport cart <b>10</b> is secured against displacing on the transport cart <b>10</b> in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The portion of the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> that adjoins the base element <b>12</b> can be used to transport a box that is dimensioned such that its height occupies substantially the entire space between the base element <b>12</b> and a carrier element <b>38</b>, which is parallel to the base element <b>12</b> and attached to the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. If the box is provided with a second guide device in the region of its side walls, this second guide device can be brought into engagement with the first guide device <b>28</b>, in order to secure the box against displacing on the transport cart <b>10</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>. If, on the other hand, the box does not have a second guide device, the first guide device <b>28</b> can be swivelled into its non-operative position, such that the first guide device <b>28</b> does not impede the receiving of the box on the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively thereto, the portion of the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> that is adjacent to the base element <b>12</b> can also receive boxes that are disposed over one another and dimensioned such that their height in each case is approximately half the distance between the base element <b>12</b> and the carrier element <b>38</b>. A first box can then be placed on the base element <b>12</b>. On the other hand, a second box, which is provided with a second guide device in a region of its side walls that is adjacent to a bottom element of the box, can be received on the transport cart <b>10</b> in that the second guide device configured on the box is brought into engagement with the first guide device <b>28</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>, which guide device is in its operative position. If the boxes are dimensioned so as to be smaller, in the direction of the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>, than the base element <b>12</b>, i.e. the boxes are, for example, only half as long as the base element <b>12</b>, up to four boxes can thereby be disposed in the portion of the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> that is delimited by the base element <b>12</b> and the carrier element <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first guide device <b>28</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> is disposed at a height that corresponds to the height of a guide device of the aircraft galley, which guide device, just like the first guide device <b>28</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>, can be brought into engagement with a second guide device configured on a box. A box held on the transport cart <b>10</b> by the first guide device <b>28</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> acting together with the second guide device configured on the box can then be easily pushed from the transport cart <b>10</b> into the aircraft galley, the second guide device configured on the box engaging the guide device of the aircraft galley.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transport cart <b>10</b> further comprises a locking mechanism <b>40</b>, which is attached to the second frame element <b>24</b>, adjacently to the second strip <b>32</b> of the first guide device <b>28</b>. The locking mechanism <b>40</b> comprises a first lock <b>42</b> and a second lock <b>44</b>, which are disposed at a distance from each other along the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>. As can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first lock <b>42</b> is disposed in the region of a first end of the transport cart <b>10</b>, while the second lock <b>44</b> is disposed in the region of a second end of the transport cart <b>10</b>. The locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> can each be swivelled between a locking position, shown in the figures, and a non-locking position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the locking position of the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, two extensions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are set up to act together with a front wall or a back wall of a box received on the transport cart <b>10</b>, and thereby to secure the box against displacement on the transport cart in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>. As can be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the extensions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> extend at an angle in relation to each other, the extension <b>46</b> projecting in the direction of the base element <b>12</b>, and the extension <b>48</b> projecting in the direction of the carrier element <b>38</b>. As a result, the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are able to secure, against displacement on the transport cart <b>10</b> in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>, both a box occupying substantially the entire part of the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> between the base element <b>12</b> and the carrier element <b>38</b>, and boxes that are disposed over each other and whose height in each case is only substantially half of the distance between the base element <b>12</b> and the carrier element <b>38</b>. In their non-locking position, on the other hand, the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the locking mechanism <b>40</b> allow unimpeded loading and unloading of the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the locking mechanism <b>40</b> are connected to each other via a coupling device. The coupling device comprises a rod, not illustrated in the figures, which extends in the direction of the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b> and carries the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the locking mechanism <b>40</b>. The coupling device couples the locks <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> of the locking mechanism <b>40</b> to each other in such a way that, upon a movement of the first lock <b>42</b> into its locking position, the second lock <b>44</b> is likewise moved into its locking position. Upon a movement of the first lock <b>42</b> into its non-locking position, the second lock <b>44</b> is likewise moved into its non-locking position. Conversely, a movement of the second lock <b>44</b> into its locking position also results in a movement of the first lock <b>42</b> into its locking position, and a movement of the second lock <b>44</b> into its non-locking position also results in a movement of the first lock <b>42</b> into its non-locking position.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The carrier element <b>38</b> comprises a first strip <b>50</b> and a second strip <b>52</b>. The first strip <b>50</b> is attached to the first frame element <b>20</b>, while the second strip <b>52</b> is attached to the second frame element <b>24</b>. The strips <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> extend parallelwise in relation to the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>, and project into the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> delimited by the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>. Connecting elements <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> extend, respectively, between the strips <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, in the region of the first and the second end of the transport cart <b>10</b>. The carrier element <b>38</b> serves to support a bottom element of a box received on the transport cart <b>10</b> or a bottom element of another item received on the transport cart <b>10</b>, which box or item is not provided, for example, with a second guide device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The carrier element <b>38</b> is attached to the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> at a height that corresponds to the height of a carrier plate of the aircraft galley that serves to receive aircraft galley components such as, for example, ovens, beverage preparation devices, etc. An aircraft galley component received on the carrier element <b>38</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> can then be conveniently pushed from the transport cart <b>10</b> to its destination position in the aircraft galley without the need to raise or lower the aircraft galley component. Further, the spacing of the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> in the region of the carrier element <b>38</b> and above the carrier element <b>38</b> is greater than in the region of the base element <b>12</b>, to enable the transport cart <b>10</b> to be used also for transporting aircraft galley components such as, for example, ovens, beverage preparation devices.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As is most evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a further first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2032; is attached to the carrier element <b>38</b>. In a manner similar to the first guide device <b>28</b>, the further first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2032; can also be swivelled between an operative position and a non-operative position. When the further first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2032; is in its operative position, it can be used to fix a conventional box on the transport cart <b>10</b>, which box is provided with a second guide device. It its non-operative position, on the other hand, the further first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2032; enables a galley component such as, for example, an oven, to be received on the transport cart <b>10</b> in an unimpeded manner.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As is most evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, above the carrier element <b>38</b> a yet further first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2033; is mounted on the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> of the transport cart, but cannot be swivelled, like the first guide devices <b>28</b>, <b>28</b>&#x2032;, between an operative position and a non-operative position. By means of the first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2033;, two boxes can be received over one another on the transport cart <b>10</b>, in the portion of the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> disposed above the carrier element <b>38</b>, and secured against displacing in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart <b>10</b>. For the purpose of securing these boxes against displacement on the transport cart <b>10</b> in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis L of the transport cart, a further locking mechanism <b>40</b>&#x2032; is provided, the structure and functioning of which correspond to the structure and functioning of the locking mechanism <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Finally, the transport cart <b>10</b> is provided with a holding device <b>58</b>. The holding device <b>58</b>, shown in an enlarged representation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, comprises a first strip <b>60</b>, attached to the first frame element <b>20</b>, and comprises a second strip <b>62</b>, attached to the second frame element <b>24</b>. The strips <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> project into the inner region <b>26</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> and are each provided, on their underside, with a receiving portion <b>64</b> configured with a curve. The receiving portion <b>64</b> serves to act together with a box received at the top of the transport cart <b>10</b>, and thereby additionally to hold the box in its position on the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The maximum spacing of the frame elements <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>, which defines the maximum width of the transport cart <b>10</b>, is selected such that it is less than the width of an aisle of an aircraft in which the aircraft galley to be loaded by means of the transport cart <b>10</b> is disposed.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">To facilitate the positioning of the transport cart <b>10</b> relative to the aircraft galley to be loaded, a positioning device <b>66</b>, shown in an enlarged representation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is provided on the transport cart <b>10</b>.

The positioning device <b>66</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b> acts together with a complementary positioning device <b>70</b>, provided on the aircraft galley to be loaded and likewise represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> in order to illustrate the functioning of the positioning device <b>66</b>, when the transport cart <b>10</b> has attained a desired position relative to the aircraft galley to be loaded. In particular, a projection <b>72</b> provided on the positioning device <b>70</b> of the aircraft galley acts together with the recess <b>68</b> of the positioning device <b>66</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the aircraft galley can be divided into a plurality of sections in the vertical direction, a positioning device <b>70</b>, for acting together with the positioning device <b>66</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>, being assignable to each of these sections. The transport cart <b>10</b> can then be positioned in front of each of these sections, such that boxes can be conveniently pushed from the transport cart <b>10</b> into the aircraft galley. Similarly, boxes can be conveniently received on the transport cart <b>10</b>, out of the aircraft galley, by means of the first guide devices <b>28</b>, <b>28</b>&#x2032;, <b>28</b>&#x2033; disposed at a corresponding height, and by means of the carrier element <b>38</b> disposed at a corresponding height and the base element <b>12</b> disposed at a corresponding height.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Particularly convenient operation of the transport cart <b>10</b> is rendered possible in that a blocking device, not illustrated in greater detail in the figures, comprises a plurality of actuating devices for blocking the wheels <b>14</b> of the transport cart <b>10</b>. The actuating devices are disposed in the region of the first end and in the region of the second end of the transport cart <b>10</b>, such that the blocking device can be actuated to block the wheels <b>14</b> of differing sides of the transport cart <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A further embodiment of a transport cart for loading an aircraft galley, which is not shown in the figures, differs from the transport cart <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref> in that it is of a lesser height, i.e. its frame elements project only over the transport element <b>38</b>. In the case of such a transport cart, it is possible to dispense with the first guide device <b>28</b>&#x2033; and the holding device <b>58</b>. In other respects, the structure and functioning of such a cart correspond to the structure and function of the transport cart <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>.</p>
