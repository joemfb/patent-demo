<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems (IHSs), and more particularly to an IHS status alert system.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an IHS. An IHS generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications, IHSs may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in IHSs allow for IHSs to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, IHSs may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An IHS provides an abundance of sounds, graphics, and other information/data to users of the IHS via output devices such as speakers and a display screen. In a group setting, such as a classroom, where the students are facing the teacher and the teacher is facing the students, the teacher cannot see what images or messages are being displayed on each individual student's IHS display because the teacher is generally positioned at the front of the class room and thus, at the back side of the display screen of each student's IHS. As such, it is difficult for the teacher or other non-user of the IHSs to quickly determine a status of each student's IHS or running applications in such a group setting. In other words, teachers have a difficult time monitoring an entire classroom of students using portable IHSs at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, it is difficult for the teacher to move away from their teaching position at the front of the class room and position themselves behind all of the students to monitor progress or status of the student's work on the IHS. As an example, if the students are all taking an exam on their individual IHS and one student is having difficulty with one question and stops progressing with the remaining exam questions, the teacher would not learn of this until the exam is over and turned in to the teacher and the student has earned a poor score on the exam. In this case, the student may fall behind. However, if the teacher could quickly scan the class room to see a status of each student's IHS or application, the teacher could address any problems or issues right from the start.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some IHSs use custom alert systems. However, these alerts are delivered to the IHS display screen and the teacher or other non-user of the IHS would not be alerted because of their location at the front of the classroom. In addition, this type of alert system where the alert notification is provided to the display screen requires that the IHS be turned on and fully booted/operating. In addition, the user has to open run that particular application in order to receive the alert notification. In other examples, IHSs may provide peripheral based alerts, but these alerts generally include using a light or other device in a fixed function manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved IHS status alert system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment, an information handling system status alert system includes an information handling system (IHS). The IHS includes a frame, a processor supported by the frame and a memory module communicatively coupled to the processor. The IHS additionally includes an operational display device coupled with the frame such that the operational display device is viewable from a first side of the frame. Furthermore, the IHS includes a status alert display device coupled with the frame such that the status alert display device is viewable from a second side of the frame, wherein the second side of the frame is substantially opposite the first side of the frame.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a portable embodiment of the IHS <b>100</b>. As shown, this embodiment of the IHS <b>100</b> is configured as a clam shell frame type portable IHS. As such, the IHS <b>100</b> includes a base <b>136</b> portion and a lid <b>138</b> portion. However, other types of IHS may be used with the present disclosure. Additionally, the IHS <b>100</b> includes a display device <b>112</b> located on an inner or user's side of the lid <b>138</b>. In an embodiment, the display device <b>112</b> is a color LCD display screen. However, other types of display device may be used with the IHS <b>100</b> of the present disclosure. The IHS <b>100</b> also includes a network interface <b>118</b> plug receptacle, and USB ports <b>120</b>, user input devices <b>124</b> (e.g., keyboard, mouse pointer, touchpad, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, the IHS <b>100</b> includes a status display device <b>128</b> and a power supply input receptacle <b>130</b>. In an embodiment, the status display device <b>128</b> is integrated into the outer side of the lid <b>138</b> portion of the IHS <b>100</b>. As such, a user of the IHS <b>100</b> can operate the IHS using the user input devices <b>124</b> and viewing the display device <b>112</b>. On the other hand, when a user (e.g., a student in a classroom) is using the IHS <b>100</b>, a non-user (e.g., a teacher in the classroom) can view the status display device <b>128</b>. In this way, a teacher may see the status of a room full of IHSs with a quick glance from the front of the class room.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As should be understood, the status display device <b>128</b> may be used by non-users of the IHS <b>100</b>. When the IHS <b>100</b> clam shell frame is closed, the status display device <b>128</b> may be visible above and on sides of the IHS <b>100</b>. When the IHS <b>100</b> is being used and the lid <b>138</b> is open, the user of the IHS <b>100</b> may not be able to view the status display device <b>128</b>. However, non-users behind the IHS should be able to easily view the status display device <b>128</b>. In use, the status display device <b>128</b> may be configured to indicate an operation status of the IHS <b>100</b> to those who are not directly using the IHS <b>100</b>, but may need to know what actions or activities are taking place on the IHS <b>100</b>. Thus, the non-user (e.g., a classroom teacher, etc.) may learn about the status of the user of that IHS.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the systems of the present disclosure provide an ability to allow software application developers to take control of this status display device <b>128</b> (e.g., a set of colored LEDs) using software application programming interface (API) or other programming tools to provide customizable alerts to be displayed using the status display device <b>128</b> per the requirements of their software application. In other words, it is to be understood that use of the status display device <b>128</b> may be used for and controlled by 3<sup>rd </sup>party non-users of the IHS <b>100</b>. For instance, in a classroom setting, a teacher may use a communicative system software application to put all of the student's IHSs in the classroom into a test taking mode that causes the status display device <b>128</b> to be on showing a solid green color when the IHS is in a test taking mode. Additionally, the status display device <b>128</b> may blink yellow when the student has a question, blink red when a student gets a question wrong, and blink green when the test is completed. In another application the status display device may flash or otherwise cycle through illumination sequences and/or change colors, and/or display a textual message, thereby, showing progress on a class assignment, and etc. This type of software application may be loaded standard on the IHS <b>100</b> or may be implemented by an IHS information technology (IT) administrator at a school, workplace, hospital, military institution, or any other group location. In an embodiment, the status display device <b>128</b> may be controlled using a device control protocol (DCP) or other system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In short, the present disclosure provides a system for creating custom alerts on the IHS <b>100</b>, which may be quickly viewed by teachers, parents, IT administrators, students and/or others, such as non-users of the IHS <b>100</b> in different settings, such as group settings. Thus, embodiments of the present disclosure provide for the creation of different alerts or sets of alerts using the status display device <b>128</b> on portable IHSs <b>100</b> in an educational or other environment. In the educational setting, the alerts may be fully customized based on the needs of the school district, school or individual classroom. In other settings, alerts may be customized to function in a 1 to 1 deployment setting.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be understood that embodiments of the present disclosure provided herein include a colored LED window on the back of the IHS <b>100</b> that can be changed by color or blink rate to indicate various states, behaviors, or alerts for the IHS <b>100</b>. However, other indicator may be used. In a classroom setting types of alerts may include, but are not limited to, student is operating in the prescribed network or application, the student is ahead or behind in a lesson, there is a problem with the IHS <b>100</b> that is preventing the student from continuing, the student has a question for the teacher. Outside of the class room indicators may relate to, but are not limited to notices that the IHS <b>100</b> has been stolen, the parent of the student must attend to something, there is a message for the parent/student from the school/principle/teacher, and/or any variety of alert messages as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another feature of the present disclosure is a system and method to control and customize the alert system to the needs of the particular school environment. This may be performed using a customizing software control panel that allows for the creation, storage, and deployment of alerts to a single IHS status display device <b>128</b> or to multiple IHS's status display devices (e.g., <b>128</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> provide screen shots for an embodiment of such a software control panel.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a screenshot of an embodiment of an administrator setup screen <b>150</b> for setting-up use of status display device <b>128</b>. The design, functionality, and operation of the setup screen <b>150</b> may vary according to different uses and are shown here only for explanation of the concept. As shown, this embodiment of the setup screen <b>150</b> includes tabs along a lower tool bar that allows the user to choose categories in which to work. For example, this setup screen <b>150</b> includes tabs to toggle the user to different working environments such as classroom management tab <b>152</b>, power management tab <b>154</b>, communication network management tab <b>156</b>, security management tab <b>158</b> and/or device management tab <b>160</b>. As should be understood, the options and functionality of each tab may vary for different environments (e.g., different schools) and for different industries (e.g., corporate, medical, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown, the classroom tab <b>152</b> is highlighted and thus, chosen to be the working screen. This screen allows the user to choose between different classroom/teaching services for using the status display device <b>128</b>, as shown, the setup screen <b>150</b>, includes menus for the administrator/teacher to choose. For example, the administrator may choose the parent alert menu <b>166</b>, the testing mode menu <b>168</b>, the classroom mode menu <b>170</b> and/or the unauthorized side menu <b>172</b>. In addition, the administrator may choose to enable or disable the status display device <b>128</b> using the status display enable/disable button <b>180</b>. The definition of the function of the status display device <b>128</b> may be indicated by the status display device definition indicators <b>182</b> on the administrator setup screen <b>150</b>. In the embodiment shown, the parent alert tab <b>166</b> pulls up a parent alert editor screen that allows the administrator to draft a letter to a parent of a student who uses a particular IHS or to the entire group/class (see for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.). Then, once the administrator saves the parent alert, the system allows the administrator to turn the status display device <b>128</b> to a color (e.g., yellow) until the parent reads the alert and acknowledges it. The status display device <b>128</b> may also be configured to flash in one or more sequences, which may indicate different messages or different states. The testing mode menu <b>168</b> may allow the administrator to put all IHSs <b>100</b> in the classroom into a testing mode where certain communication and file operations may be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown, putting the user IHSs <b>100</b> into a testing mode may turn the status display device <b>128</b> green so that the administrator can easily look around the classroom and see that all IHSs <b>100</b> are in the proper testing mode. The classroom mode menu <b>170</b> may allow the administrator to set all the IHSs <b>100</b> in the room to a classroom working mode. This, in turn, may define one or more operating modes, such as communications, file access, Internet access, and any variety of operating modes. When in this mode the status display device <b>128</b> may be turned to blue. Similarly, the unauthorized site menu <b>172</b> may allow the administrator to define authorized and unauthorized Internet sites and may turn the status display device <b>128</b> to flashing red. Viewing this, the administrator may decide to turn off Internet access for the user viewing the unauthorized site. As should be understood any type and number of applications and functions in the administrator software may allow for any type of operation and definition for the status display device <b>128</b>. Other tabs, such as the details tab <b>176</b> may be used to provide different functions or to provide information such as software name and revision or any variety of information. In other words, other tabs, menus, and the like may be used and it is to be understood that the options and functionality of each menu may vary for different environments (e.g., different schools) and for different industries (e.g., corporate, medical, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a screenshot of an embodiment of a teacher IHS status control setup screen <b>188</b>. This setup screen <b>188</b> is shown to provide an example of a setup screen that allows an administrator/teacher to set teaching or operating modes or states of the IHSs <b>100</b> in the classroom. For example, the administrator may modify functionality using the testing mode field <b>190</b>, the classroom sharing mode field <b>192</b>, the world mode field <b>194</b>, or any variety of fields to modify operating modes or functionality of the IHSs <b>100</b>. In addition, the setup screen <b>188</b> may allow the administrator to perform other work tasks. These may be accessed using fields such as the administrator my classroom field <b>196</b>, the administrator assignments field <b>198</b>, the administrator class calendar field <b>200</b>, the administrator progress report field <b>202</b>, and/or other fields.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a screenshot of an embodiment of the parent alert screen <b>210</b>. The parent alert screen <b>210</b> or some other screen may be accessed and viewed on the user/student IHS <b>100</b>. Referring also back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the administrator drafts a parent alert, note the status display device <b>128</b> on the user IHS <b>100</b> will illuminate yellow. This indicates to the parent of the user that there is a message. The parent may then access this screen <b>210</b> on the user IHS <b>100</b> to view the message. The message may be viewed in the message field <b>212</b>. Additionally, the message field may include one or more links (e.g., 1<sup>st </sup>Semester Progress Report link) and may provide for the parent acknowledging having read the alert message. The parent may acknowledge by using a password, electronic signature, or by some other method. In addition, the user and the parent may access the users fields, such as the user my classroom field <b>214</b>, the user assignments field <b>216</b>, the user class calendar field <b>218</b>, the user progress report field, and/or other fields.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As should be understood, this software and systems of the present disclosure may provide any use or functionality that may benefit by having a programmable status display device <b>128</b>. In embodiments, the systems and software of the present disclosure provide for multiple colors &#x26; blink rates of the status display device <b>128</b>. The present disclosure may be configured as an open architecture tool for customization. Software to configure the status display device <b>128</b> may include a software user interface for defining additional functionality of the status display device and operation modes of the IHS <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the status display device may be configured to provide to the administrator an indication of unauthorized programs usage, virus detection/IHS support needed, parental alerts, theft of the IHS, &#x201c;Hands up&#x201d; alert during exams, and any variety of other functions. Additionally, it should be understood that the present disclosure may be utilized not only in the education market, as discussed herein, but also in other markets, such as corporate, military, healthcare, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As should also be understood, the present disclosure solves a number of problems, such as allowing non-users of the IHS to quickly determine a status of the IHSs in a group setting. For example, a teacher may obtain the status of a student's activities on the IHS <b>100</b>. In a classroom setting teachers generally have a difficult time monitoring an entire classroom utilizing IHSs at the same time because the teacher is typically located at the front of the room facing any number of IHS display device backs. It may be difficult to move away from this teaching position to behind the students to monitor the students progress or status. The status display device <b>128</b> of the present disclosure allows for custom alerts that the teacher can quickly and easily see and address. Sometimes students fall behind in the modular electronic programs that are being utilized in today's schools. The present disclosure allows them to discretely indicate such incidences, which the teacher can quickly address and correct. In one to one deployments, the present disclosure offers a much more salient and full proof manner of delivering messages to parents or even students from the school. As such, parents can quickly learn if they need to attend to something school related, such as a permission slip, a report card, a school closing, a schedule changes, or any other item. In yet another setting, the present disclosure provides a quick and easy way for IT workers to identify problems within a set of notebook computers when the status display device <b>128</b> is configured to indicate such problem. For example, in a storage cart system, an IT worker can quickly look at the status display device <b>128</b> to assess IHS health, update status, virus/malware status, and any other status. The IT administrator can create these alerts based on their needs and integrate them into their current software set. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a software tool to create, modify and deploy alerts to multiple IHSs.</p>
