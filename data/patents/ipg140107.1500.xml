<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 9</figref>, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present disclosure in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged device. The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with reference to exemplary non-limiting embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an effort to increase load density and reduce transportation cost, the trucking industry may use a practice called &#x201c;bed-loading&#x201d;. A trailer may be loaded with items of a broad range of sizes, weights, and shapes. Sacks and items having extreme aspect ratios or weights are typically bed-loaded last in a separate area of the trailer or box bed. On a full trailer, such extreme pieces may be located near the trailer door and would be the first items unloaded.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Manually unloading a bed-loaded trailer can be a grueling job that may be performed at extreme temperatures with relatively low pay. A person unloading standard packages with the aid of an extendible conveyor may achieve sustained rates in the range of 1,000 pieces per hour (1K PPH). Sacks and items of irregular size/shape are typically unloaded at rates much less than standard packages. Such reduced rates are often 200-500 PPH, depending on weight, shape, door configuration, and other factors. The time required to load or unload a trailer directly affects dock door utilization/productivity and therefore facility size. Problems have arisen with previous attempts to automated trailer unloading, including solution cost, cube loss, trailer fleet modification, throughput, staffing, package size/type/formats, loading constraints/configuration, package damage, ease of operation/automation, cost to maintain and ease of retrofitting existing loading dock facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various disclosed embodiments include unloading items from a trailer or other container generally without operator intervention. A nose ramp of an automated unloading apparatus is moved under a base belt in the trailer and wider a first item of a plurality of items in the trailer. As the ramp continues advancing, the item is moved onto a conveyor, which is adapted to carry the item out of the trailer. A stack control curtain maintains the remaining items in a stack or pile during and after removal of the first item. A tensioning mechanism maintains a desired tension on the base belt as the ramp moves under the base belt and the first item.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a block diagram of a data processing system <b>100</b> in which an embodiment can be implemented, for example as a control system for a mechanism as described below, and can be configured to perform processes as described herein.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a schematic view of an automatic unloader <b>200</b> according to the present disclosure. A trailer <b>202</b> is positioned adjacent to a loading dock <b>204</b> and a dock door area <b>206</b> for unloading. Within the trailer <b>202</b> are loaded items <b>208</b>, which are to be unloaded by the automatic unloader <b>200</b>. The items <b>208</b> are positioned on top of a base belt <b>210</b>, a first end of which is attached to the trailer at an attachment point <b>212</b>. A second end of the base belt <b>210</b> (opposite to the first end) may be raised to a first transit position <b>214</b> to provide supported to stacked items during transit to help prevent stack collapse. The second end of the base belt <b>210</b> may alternately be placed in a second transit position (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on the floor of the trailer <b>202</b>, where the base belt <b>210</b> may be rolled or gathered during transit. From either the first or second transit position, to initiate unloading of the trailer <b>202</b>, the second end of the base belt <b>210</b> is brought generally along the path indicated by the arrow <b>216</b> to be attached to the automatic unloader <b>200</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The unloader <b>200</b> is positioned at the open door of the trailer <b>202</b> by an operator at an operator console <b>218</b>. The operator may use a video camera (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that is mounted to the unloader <b>200</b> or to the loading dock <b>204</b> and presents the operator with a view of the unloader <b>200</b> and the trailer <b>202</b>. The unloader includes a positioning mechanism <b>220</b>, which is remotely operated by the operator to position the unloader <b>200</b> at the entrance to the trailer <b>202</b>. The positioning mechanism <b>220</b> may be a motorized caster or other mechanism suitable for positioning the unloader <b>200</b> relative to the trailer <b>202</b> into prior to initiating an unloading process or during the unloading process. The positioning mechanism <b>220</b> is operable to position the unloader <b>200</b> at least along a longitudinal axis of the trailer <b>202</b> or horizontally relative to the trailer <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the unloader <b>200</b> is substantially the same width as the interior of the trailer <b>202</b>, such that the unloader <b>200</b> substantially fills the trailer <b>202</b> from one sidewall to the other sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The unloader <b>200</b> also includes a stack control curtain <b>222</b> mounted to a positioning mechanism <b>224</b>. The operation of the stack control curtain <b>222</b> and the positioning mechanism <b>224</b> will be explained in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The unloader <b>200</b> is coupled to an extendible conveyor <b>226</b>, which is operable to carry items unloaded by the unloader <b>200</b> from the trailer <b>202</b>. A sensor <b>250</b> may be mounted in a position that enables the sensor <b>250</b> to sense items on the unloader <b>200</b> or the extendible conveyor <b>226</b>. The sensor <b>250</b> is operable to sense a label, RFID tag, barcode, or other identifying feature of such items.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an automated unloading system <b>300</b> according to the disclosure. Unloaders <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> according to the disclosure are controlled by a controller <b>310</b>. Each of the unloaders <b>302</b>-<b>308</b> may be positioned at each of four truck docks and operated to unload four trailers separately or concurrently. An operator may use an operator console <b>312</b> to control the unloaders <b>302</b>-<b>308</b>. The controller <b>310</b> may be communicatively coupled to a facility management system <b>314</b>. The controller <b>310</b> may receive address or identification information sensed from items unloaded by one or more of the unloaders <b>302</b>-<b>308</b> and send the information to the facility management system <b>314</b> (or other external system) for its use in routing the items to desired destinations.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While the operator console <b>312</b>, the controller <b>310</b>, and the facility management system <b>314</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as separate elements of the automated unloading system <b>300</b>, it will be understood that in other embodiments, this functionality of these elements may be provided in one or two elements. In some embodiments, the automated unloading system <b>300</b> also includes one or more sensors (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) providing a view of one or more of the unloaders <b>302</b>-<b>308</b> and one or more corresponding trailers or other containers. In such embodiments, the controller <b>310</b> is further adapted to control an unloader positioning mechanism to position the unloader in a desired position relative to the trailer, prior to initiating an unloading process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a schematic detail view of the automatic unloader system <b>200</b>. The base belt <b>210</b> has been routed over a nose ramp <b>404</b>, between the nose ramp <b>404</b> and a nose conveyor <b>406</b>, through pinch rollers <b>408</b>, and coupled at coupling <b>410</b> to a tensioning roller <b>412</b>. The pinch rollers <b>408</b> and the tensioning roller <b>412</b> comprise a tensioning mechanism for the base belt <b>210</b>. The nose ramp <b>405</b> may pivot about a horizontal axis, as indicated by arrow <b>405</b>. The tensioning roller <b>412</b> maintains a desired tension T<sub>bb </sub>on the base belt <b>210</b> via the coupling <b>410</b>. The unloader <b>200</b> moves itself forward under the base belt <b>210</b> and loaded items <b>208</b> by using the pinch rollers <b>408</b> to pull on the base belt <b>210</b>. In other embodiments, the unloader <b>200</b> moves itself forward using the positioning mechanism <b>220</b> and the tensioning roller <b>412</b> operates to maintain the base belt <b>210</b> taut over the nose ramp <b>404</b>. The tensioning roller <b>412</b> is mounted in a fixed position relative to the loading dock <b>204</b>, in order to maintain the tension T<sub>bb </sub>on the base belt <b>210</b> regardless of movement of the unloader <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The unloader <b>200</b> moves into the trailer along the trailer floor <b>402</b>, sliding the nose ramp <b>404</b> under a rearmost item of the items <b>208</b>. By sliding the nose ramp <b>404</b> under an item while the item remains on the base belt <b>210</b>, the unloader <b>200</b> reduces the possibility of the nose ramp <b>404</b> pushing the item into the trailer, rather than sliding it up onto the nose conveyor <b>406</b>. When moving forward, the unloader <b>200</b> moves at a speed V<sub>r </sub>that substantially matches a speed V<sub>c </sub>of a transport belt of the nose conveyor <b>406</b>. In this way, the items <b>208</b> are transferred with substantially no relative motion from the base belt <b>210</b> to the nose conveyor <b>406</b>. Once on the nose conveyor <b>406</b>, a lowest, rearmost item of the items <b>208</b> is carried under the stack curtain <b>222</b> out of the trailer <b>202</b> along the nose conveyor <b>406</b>, onto the takeaway conveyor <b>416</b>, toward the extendible conveyor <b>226</b>. An upper portion of the transport belt of the nose conveyor <b>406</b> may be supported by a cushion <b>414</b>, to reduce impact forces on items that fall onto the nose conveyor from the items <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As will be described in greater detail below, the stack curtain <b>222</b> may be moved toward and away from the items <b>208</b> in order to break the lowest, rearmost item free of any item resting upon it, to enable the item to be carried away by the nose conveyor <b>406</b>. The stack curtain <b>222</b> may be moved to a higher position above the nose conveyor <b>406</b>, to permit a larger item to pass under the stack curtain <b>222</b>. The stack curtain <b>222</b> may be positioned rearward along the nose conveyor, farther from the nose ramp <b>404</b>, in order to expose a larger portion of the nose conveyor <b>406</b>, to permit a larger item to rest entirely upon the nose conveyor <b>406</b> and be carried away. The unloader <b>200</b> is operable to remove a diversity of items <b>208</b> (e.g., packages, irregular shapes/weights, sacks, containers, rolling stock, pallets, etc.) from the trailer <b>202</b> or other container, whether the items <b>208</b> are arranged in orderly, segregated stacks or intermingled in disordered piles.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a schematic view of another automatic unloader <b>500</b> according to the present disclosure. The unloader <b>500</b> includes a segmented drive ramp <b>502</b> and a stack control curtain mechanism <b>504</b>. The stack control curtain mechanism <b>504</b> includes a cushioned stack control curtain <b>506</b> and one or more actuators <b>508</b> adapted to change a configuration of the stack control curtain <b>506</b> relative to items <b>518</b>. The actuators are operable to independently move the top and bottom of the stack control curtain <b>506</b> toward and away from the nose of the trailer <b>202</b>, as well as to vary a contour of the stack control curtain <b>506</b> using a roller <b>510</b> or other suitable actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The segmented drive ramp <b>502</b> includes a nose conveyor <b>512</b> and ramping conveyor segments <b>516</b>. The nose conveyor <b>512</b> has a cam roller <b>514</b>, which rotates on a longitudinal axis that is not coincident with a geometric longitudinal axis of the roller <b>514</b>. As the cam roller <b>514</b> rotates, it raises and lowers an upper portion of a transport belt of the nose conveyor <b>512</b>. The cam roller <b>514</b> operates to jostle or otherwise disturb the items <b>518</b> positioned on the nose conveyor <b>512</b>, to facilitate removal of a lowest item by the nose conveyor <b>512</b>. The cushioned stack control curtain <b>506</b>, the nose conveyor <b>512</b>, and the ramping conveyor segments <b>516</b> manage stack decomposition and reduce free fall distance and impact force for the items <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A ramping angle and terracing effect may be created by the ramping conveyor segments <b>516</b>. As the segmented drive ramp <b>502</b> advances deeper into the stack, the ramping conveyor segments <b>516</b> may be raised and controlled relative to raising the stack control curtain mechanism <b>504</b> to allow package flow between the surface of the segmented drive ramp <b>502</b> and the bottom edge of the cushioned stack control curtain <b>506</b>. As the segmented drive ramp <b>502</b> advances into the stack, items are removed at higher and higher levels. The conveyor segments <b>516</b> turn on and off to reduce forces between packages and to cancel relative motion between conveyor and package until drive forces are needed</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The cam roller <b>514</b> is mounted below an upper portion of a transport belt of the nose conveyor <b>512</b>. Cam rollers may also be mounted below upper portions of one or more of the conveyor segments <b>516</b> to aid package flow. Pressure and coverage applied by the stack control curtain <b>506</b> to the stack is kept within an acceptable range by the actuators <b>508</b> to avoid package free fall while not inducing excessive forces or forces that might damage the items <b>518</b>. A variety of devices know in the art can sense and signal pressure levels. Pressures applied over a small area or at a single point are avoided by making the stack control curtain <b>506</b> from a thick cushioned and/or compliant material, such as laminated foam rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a detail schematic view of the stack control curtain mechanism <b>504</b> according to the disclosure. The stack control curtain <b>506</b> is moved into a desired configuration by the actuators <b>508</b>. As individual items are removed from the bottom of the stack or pile of items <b>518</b>, an internal void <b>602</b> may be created within the stack. Where the items are in an otherwise orderly stack or array, such a void may allow an item <b>604</b> to drop into the internal void, possibly damaging the item <b>604</b> or an item on which it lands, or creating a jam that prevents subsequent items <b>518</b> from being removed from the trailer <b>202</b>. Internal voids may create similar unloading problems is unordered piles of items <b>518</b>. Under control of the actuators <b>508</b>, the stack control curtain <b>506</b> is adapted to change configuration to prevent formation of internal voids in the stack or pile of items <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a schematic view of a ramping conveyor <b>700</b> according to the present disclosure. The ramping conveyor <b>700</b> includes a nose conveyor <b>702</b> and a variable incline angle conveyor <b>704</b>. The ramping conveyor <b>700</b> supports items on conveyor belts, rather than on underlying solid support structures. The nose conveyor <b>702</b> includes a cushioned cam roller <b>706</b> that raises and lowers an upper portion of the nose conveyor <b>702</b>, to break items loose from a stack or pile of items. A stack control curtain <b>708</b> restrains upper items of the stack or pile and allows single items to pass from the nose conveyor <b>702</b> to the variable incline angle conveyor <b>704</b>. As may be seen by comparing depicted positions of the stack control curtains <b>222</b>, <b>506</b> and <b>708</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, a stack control curtain according to the disclosure may be moved to multiple desired positions above a nose conveyor and other conveyor segments of unloaders according to the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The variable incline angle conveyor <b>704</b> may include raised cleats <b>710</b> to prevent items on the conveyor <b>704</b> from slipping back toward the trailer as an angle from the horizontal of the conveyor <b>704</b> is increased. The conveyor <b>704</b> may include a cushioned cam roller <b>712</b> to control clumping and spacing of items on the conveyor <b>704</b>. The conveyor <b>704</b> includes a roller <b>714</b> that may be raised and lowered to vary an angle from the horizontal of an upper portion of the variable incline angle conveyor <b>704</b>. The suspended belt of the conveyor <b>704</b> provides a forgiving surface for items that it transports, to reduce damage to the items. Similar results may be obtained through the use of foam cushions or air bladders beneath the upper portion of the conveyor <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The conveyor <b>704</b> is generally inclined to cause layers of tall stacks of items to decompose due to gravity. This thinning of layers provides natural metering of package flow for easier hand off from discharge of the conveyor <b>704</b> to generally narrower downstream takeaway conveyors. At an opposite end of the conveyor <b>704</b> from the nose conveyor <b>702</b>, the angle is selectively changed to produce a wedge-like engagement of the nose conveyor <b>702</b> with items of the stack to facilitate stack decomposition and removal. Similar comments apply to the ramping segmented drive ramp <b>502</b> of the unloader <b>500</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a schematic view of another automatic unloader <b>800</b> according to the present disclosure. The unloader <b>800</b> includes a conveyor mechanism <b>802</b>, an item removal mechanism <b>804</b>, an upper stack control curtain <b>806</b>, and a lower stack control curtain <b>810</b>. The unloader <b>800</b> unloads items <b>808</b> from an upper portion of a stack or pile. The upper portion may be a top, or near the top, of the stack. The lower stack control curtain <b>810</b> passes over a nose ramp <b>812</b>, and is placed under tension to control a lower portion of the stack of items <b>808</b>. The item removal mechanism <b>804</b> pulls individual items from the top of the stack of items <b>808</b> over the nose ramp <b>812</b> and onto a nose conveyor <b>814</b>, which transports the items to a take-away conveyor <b>816</b>. The item removal mechanism <b>804</b> may be a vacuum head, a magnetic head, a hook, or other suitable mechanism for mechanically coupling to an item and pulling the item onto the nose conveyor <b>814</b>. The relative positions of the item removal mechanism <b>804</b> and the nose ramp <b>812</b> manages stack decomposition and minimizes free fall distance and resulting impact force. As the top of the stack of items <b>808</b> is cleared the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> is lowered down the face of the stack. The lower stack control curtain <b>810</b> is kept taut to continue controlling the lower portion of the stack of items <b>808</b>. The item removal mechanism <b>804</b> is mechanically coupled to, and moves with, the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b>, as the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> moves vertically along the stack of items <b>808</b> and horizontally into the trailer (or other container).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> is lowered down the face of the stack, the upper stack control curtain <b>806</b> is extended downward to further control the stack of items <b>808</b> by forming a barrier against items falling from the stack onto the nose ramp <b>812</b>. The upper stack control curtain <b>806</b> may be positioned farther forward than the lower stack control curtain <b>810</b>, to be positioned adjacent to, and control, a remaining upper portion of the stack of items <b>808</b>. When the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> reaches the bottom of the stack of items <b>808</b>, the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> advances to a face of the remaining portion of the stack of items <b>808</b>. The conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> is raised to the top, or near the top, of the stack and unloading by the item removal mechanism <b>804</b> resumes. As the conveyor mechanism <b>802</b> is raised, the lower stack control curtain <b>810</b> is extended to control the lower portion of the stack, and the upper stack control curtain <b>806</b> is retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts a schematic view of another automatic unloader <b>900</b> according to the present disclosure. The unloader <b>900</b> includes a conveyor mechanism <b>902</b>, a vacuum head <b>904</b>, and an upper stack control curtain <b>906</b>. The conveyor mechanism <b>902</b> includes a nose ramp <b>912</b>, a nose conveyor <b>914</b> and a segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b>. The nose conveyor <b>914</b> and/or some or all segments of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> may be cushioned, as described with reference to nose conveyor <b>406</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The unloader <b>900</b> unloads items <b>908</b> from an upper portion of a stack or pile. The upper portion may be a top, or near the top, of the stack. Segments of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> are initially raised to a substantially vertical configuration to control a lower portion of the stack of items <b>908</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The vacuum head <b>904</b> pulls individual items from the top of the stack of items <b>908</b> onto a currently uppermost segment of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b>. The relative positions of the vacuum head <b>904</b> and the currently uppermost segment of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> manages stack decomposition and minimizes free fall distance and resulting impact force. As the top of the stack of items <b>908</b> is cleared segments of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> are repositioned to reduce the height of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> along the face of the stack. The remaining substantially vertical elements of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> control the lower portion of the stack of items <b>908</b>. The vacuum head <b>904</b> is mechanically coupled to, and moves with, the conveyor mechanism <b>902</b>, as the conveyor mechanism <b>902</b> moves horizontally into the trailer (or other container). The vacuum head <b>904</b> is coupled to the conveyor mechanism <b>902</b> by a linkage <b>918</b> that is operable to raise and lower the vacuum head <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the segments of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> are repositioned to reduce the height of the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b> along the face of the stack, the upper stack control curtain <b>906</b> is extended downward to further control the stack of items <b>908</b> by forming a barrier against items falling from the stack onto the segmented take-away conveyor <b>916</b>.
