<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/020,658, filed Jan. 28, 2008 which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/899,185, filed Feb. 1, 2007, the subject matter of both being incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to wet shaving devices, and more specifically to razor handles including hand gripping pads.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many modern safety razors include a disposable razor cartridge adapted to be selectively connected to a reusable handle by cartridge support structure therebetween. The cartridge includes a housing having at least one razor blade with a sharpened cutting edge disposed therein. The handle can be provided with gripping pads having on their exterior surfaces an elastomeric, ie rubber-like material. A normal wet shaving operation is typically performed in an environment that can cause a razor handle to be wet and/or slippery due to the shaving soaps or other preparations employed by the user. The elastomeric material provides the user with at least a sense of a more secure grip of the handle in these circumstances and can help prevent nicks and cuts that might be caused by the user mishandling the razor or can help prevent the user accidentally dropping the razor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Exemplary razors with elastomeric gripping pads are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,822,869 and 5,890,296, both to Metcalf et al. These Patents disclose razor handles having elongated hand-gripping structures that include a frame and at least two gripping pads disposed on opposed sides of the frame. Each gripping pad has a non-elastomeric support layer with an elastomeric gripping layer molded thereon. The support layer of each gripping pad is provided with several extensions that are press fitted into mating elongated slots of the frame to provide the joint between the frame and each respective gripping pad. In consideration of the selection of a press fit joint over other suitable joining methods, one of skill in the art will understand that the retention or security of attachment properties of a typical press fit joint are dependent upon several characteristics of the joint including a property of many molded thermoplastics known as creep modulus and the provision a controlled difference in size, or interference, between the extension and one or both sides of its mating slot or opening. Creep modulus can be likened to a time-dependent relaxation effect which can cause the resistance to disengagement of a press fit joint to diminish over an extended time period. A controlled interference can provide a somewhat uniform assembly or insertion force of the press fitting parts and is preferred at least for manufacturing reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">So-called commodity thermoplastics of the olefin family such as polypropylene (PP) and derivatives of polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE etc) have desirous properties for a non-elastomeric support layer such as their ability to provide a secure chemical bond to some thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) gripping layers and their preferred ability to withstand chemical attack from some soaps and other shaving preparations. However the creep moduli of these materials is generally inferior to that of so-called engineering thermoplastics such as ABS, Polyoxymethylene (POM, commonly known as acetal) and other well known materials.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other typical joining methods that might be considered by one of skill in the art include use of a snap fit joint. In one type of well known snap fit joint between two mating component parts, one component part is provided with an extension with a laterally extending protrusion, usually at or near the distal end portion of the extension. During assembly of the two parts the extension undergoes preferably elastic deformation as the lateral protrusion passes around a suitable shelf of the second part before snapping into a mating recess or void of the second part. As the deformation is preferably predominantly elastic, snap fit joints can be permanent or temporary, ie separable and reattachable. As the assembly of the two parts requires deformation of the extension, clearance is generally provided between the two parts to accommodate this deformation during relative motion of the two parts as these come together at assembly. One of skill in the art will understand that even if a snap fit joint is intended to be permanent it can be released if a force of appropriate magnitude and direction can be applied to the snap fit features. One of skill in the art will also understand that when a razor is accidentally dropped impact forces are generated that are generally unpredictable in magnitude, direction and transference through the razors structure and its component parts.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to the drawings and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a safety razor <b>10</b> is depicted that includes a razor cartridge <b>12</b> connected to a handle <b>14</b>. The handle includes an elongated hand gripping structure <b>20</b> and a cartridge support structure <b>30</b>. The cartridge support structure preferably provides connection to the razor cartridge such that a user may selectively replace the razor cartridge when he or she finds this appropriate. The cartridge is preferably pivotally connected to the support structure so that in use it can pivot about a pivot axis. Particular cartridge support structures including those having pivotal connection are well known to one of skill in the art and the present invention is not limited in this regard. The elongated hand gripping structure includes a frame <b>40</b>, a first gripping pad <b>50</b> and a second gripping pad <b>70</b>. The frame is preferably manufactured from a die-cast zinc alloy having a suitable metallic plating or painted surface as is well known in the art. The frame can also be manufactured from one or more injection molded components, manufactured from a suitable thermoplastic such as ABS or polyamide and the present invention is not limited in regard to the material or manufacture of the frame. Each gripping pad <b>50</b>, <b>70</b> comprises an injection molded nonelastomeric support layer preferably manufactured from a commodity thermoplastic, more preferably polypropylene and most preferably the grade designated KPIC HJ4045 supplied by YUHWA. Each gripping pad preferably has a thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) gripping layer molded over the support layer by any suitable and well known process such as multi-color, also known as multi-shot molding or insert molding. The TPE material is most preferably the grade designated VYRAM 9211-35W-906 supplied by AES. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> the gripping pads are shown disposed on the top and bottom of the hand gripping structure however these may equally be disposed on the left and right side of the hand gripping structure. In the embodiment depicted, two gripping pads are shown, however more than two gripping pads can equally be employed. For example the second gripping pad <b>70</b> could be replaced by two pads, preferably arranged sequentially along the frame and the present invention is not limited in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a sectional view taken at the position of line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is depicted. The first gripping pad <b>50</b> comprises a support layer <b>52</b> and a gripping layer <b>54</b> as previously described. The second gripping pad <b>70</b> comprises a support layer <b>72</b> and a gripping layer <b>74</b> also as previously described. Frame <b>40</b> has an opening <b>42</b>. The first gripping pad <b>50</b> has an extension <b>56</b>, preferably bifurcated as depicted and having opposed protrusions <b>58</b> on the outer surface of the distal end portion of the extension. The bifurcation of the extension <b>56</b> provides an opening <b>60</b>. The bifurcation of the extension preferably provides the distal end portions of the extension with sufficient elasticity to enable protrusions <b>58</b> to cooperate with the opening <b>42</b> of the frame to provide a well known snap fit joint thereby providing attachment between the frame <b>40</b> and the first gripping pad <b>50</b>. The second gripping pad <b>70</b> is subsequently attached to the frame by any suitable and well known means such as by one or more snap fit joints, press fit joints or glue joints. The second gripping pad <b>70</b> has an extension <b>76</b> that at least partially extends into the bifurcation opening <b>60</b> of the extension of the first gripping pad. As extension <b>76</b> does not have to undergo deformation during assembly of the second gripping pad it is preferably provided with greater resistance to lateral deformation of its distal end portion than that of the distal end portion of the extension of the first gripping pad. In this manner, the extension of the second gripping pad <b>76</b> prevents disengagement of the snap fit joint of the first gripping pad from the frame. One of skill in the art will understand that a press fit joint may also be provided between the extension <b>76</b> of the second gripping pad and the opening <b>60</b> of the bifurcation of the first gripping pad to provide further security of attachment of each gripping pad to the frame and to each other. Although this disclosure only depicts a single sectional view of the handle of the safety razor taken at the position of line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one of skill in the art will understand that the group of cooperating features described previously can extend along the elongated hand gripping structure and can be a single group or multiple groups of cooperating features.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B-3D</figref>, alternative arrangements of extensions of the first and second gripping pad and cooperating frame opening(s) are depicted in a similar sectional view to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> extensions <b>82</b> of the first gripping pad <b>80</b> are depicted spaced apart across the width of the hand gripping structure. Extensions <b>82</b> each have a protrusion <b>84</b> on the outer surface of the distal end portion of the extension. Extensions <b>92</b> of the second gripping pad <b>90</b> cooperate with respective extensions of the first gripping pad to prevent disengagement of the snap fit joint between the first gripping pad and the frame <b>100</b>, having openings <b>102</b> in cooperating relation with protrusions <b>84</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> has a similar arrangement to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> but with protrusions <b>124</b> being disposed on opposite sides of the distal end portions of the extensions <b>122</b> compared to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> depicts protrusion <b>144</b> one side only of the centrally disposed extension <b>142</b> at the particular position of this sectional view. The protrusion can alternate between left and right sides of the extension (as depicted), as the extension extends along the frame of the elongated hand gripping structure.</p>
