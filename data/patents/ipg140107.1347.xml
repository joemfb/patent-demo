<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid ejecting head such as an ink jet type recording head, and a liquid ejecting apparatus including the same, and in particular, a liquid ejecting head and a liquid ejecting apparatus ejecting liquid from a nozzle by displacing an island unit of a diaphragm unit partitioning a part of a pressure chamber, using a piezoelectric vibrator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A liquid ejecting apparatus includes a liquid ejecting head which is capable of ejecting liquid as droplets, and is an apparatus which ejects various kinds of liquids from the liquid ejecting head. As a representative apparatus of the liquid ejecting apparatus, for example, an image recording apparatus can be exemplified such as an ink jet type recording apparatus (printer) that includes an ink jet type recording head (hereinafter, referred to as a recording head), and ejects liquid ink as ink droplets from the recording head and performs recording. In recent years, liquid ejecting apparatuses are also applied to various kinds of manufacturing apparatuses such as a display manufacturing apparatus without being limited to the image recording apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the ink jet type printer (hereinafter, simply referred to as the printer) which is a kind of liquid ejecting apparatus, there is a printer having a configuration which fluctuates the volume of a pressure chamber by displacing a diaphragm unit partitioning a part (opening surface) of the pressure chamber, using a piezoelectric vibrator to generate pressure fluctuation in the ink inside the pressure chamber and ejecting the ink from a nozzle (for example, refer to JP-A-07-195689).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The diaphragm unit includes a flexible film which seals the opening surface of the pressure chamber, and an island unit which is provided on this flexible film. This island unit is generally made of a rigid body such as a metal or the like formed in an approximately rectangular parallelepiped shape, and is a part which is joined to the tip of the piezoelectric vibrator. The flexible film around the island unit functions as an elastic film unit. When the piezoelectric vibrator is displaced in an expandable manner, the island unit is displaced towards the side away from the pressure chamber, or the island unit is displaced towards the side close to the inside of the pressure chamber, and accordingly the volume of the pressure chamber is fluctuated. It is configured that the pressure fluctuation of the ink in the pressure chamber is generated by the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber, and the ink is ejected from the nozzle using this pressure fluctuation. Since the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator is extremely small (for example, several tens of nm), it is preferable that the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator be efficiently converted to the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, a plurality of nozzles are arranged with a high density in various printers to respond to the image quality improvement of the recording image. Accordingly, the pressure chambers which communicate with each of the nozzles are also formed with a high density. As a result, the dimensions of the piezoelectric vibrator, particularly the dimension in the nozzle array direction, tend to be small so that the rigidity of the piezoelectric vibrator is degraded. A piezoelectric vibrator with low rigidity tends to be deformed by receiving a reaction force when the island unit is displaced, and thus a failure in ejecting the ink may occur. Specifically, if the piezoelectric vibrator is easily deformed, the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber is not sufficiently performed, and ejection properties (ink amount, flying speed or the like) of the ink ejected from the nozzles may fluctuate. Further, if the piezoelectric vibrator is easily deformed, an increase of the compliance (the degree of tendency to be deformed or softness per unit area) may occur by the same amount. If the compliance is increased, it is concerned that the meniscus vibration may be increased after ejecting the ink, and this vibration may exert a negative influence on the ejection properties.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such problems exist not only in the ink jet type recording apparatus to which the ink jet type recording head ejecting the ink droplet is mounted, but also in liquid ejecting apparatuses to which other liquid ejecting heads ejecting liquid droplets other than ink are mounted.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to provide a liquid ejecting head and a liquid ejecting apparatus capable of reducing a reaction force from an island unit using a piezoelectric vibrator when driving the piezoelectric vibrator and preventing a deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid ejecting head including a pressure chamber which communicates with a nozzle, a diaphragm unit which partitions a part of the pressure chamber, and a piezoelectric vibrator which displaces the diaphragm unit wherein the diaphragm unit includes an elastic film unit which seals an opening portion of the pressure chamber, and an island unit which is provided on the elastic film unit and to which a tip portion of the piezoelectric vibrator is joined, the width of a center portion of the island unit in the longitudinal direction is set to be narrower than the width of both end portions of the island unit in the longitudinal direction, and the dimension of the center portion of the island unit in the longitudinal direction is shorter than the dimension of the piezoelectric vibrator in the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According the configuration, since the width of the center portion of the island in the longitudinal direction is set to be narrower than the width of both end portions of the island unit in the longitudinal direction, a reaction force received from the island unit when the piezoelectric vibrator expands and contracts, particularly a reaction force in the center portion can be reduced. That is, by employing this configuration, the area of the elastic film unit is widened to the degree the width of the center portion of the island unit is narrowed, and the reaction force when the piezoelectric vibrator expands and contracts is easily absorbed by the elastic deformation of the elastic film unit. Accordingly, the reaction force with respect to the piezoelectric vibrator may be reduced. As a result, the deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator due to the reaction force is prevented, and the negative influence on the ejection properties due to the deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator can be suppressed. Meanwhile, since the width of both end portions of the island unit is wider than the width of the center portion, the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator in an expandable manner can be efficiently converted to the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber. Thus, the desired amount of the liquid can be ejected from the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The dimension of the center portion of the island unit in the longitudinal direction is set shorter than the dimension of the piezoelectric vibrator in the same direction, the piezoelectric vibrator is more reliably joined to both end portions of the island unit even in a case where the position of the piezoelectric vibrator with respect to the island unit is slightly shifted in the longitudinal direction of the island unit by the manufacturing error, product size error or the like. Accordingly, the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator in an expandable manner is more reliably delivered with respect to the island unit, and the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber can be performed properly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid ejecting head including a pressure chamber which communicates with a nozzle, a diaphragm unit which partitions a part of the pressure chamber, and a piezoelectric vibrator which displaces the diaphragm unit, wherein the diaphragm unit includes an elastic film unit which seals an opening portion of the pressure chamber, and an island unit which is provided on the elastic film unit and to which a tip portion of the piezoelectric vibrator is joined, and in the center portion of the joint surface of the island unit with the piezoelectric vibrator, a recessed portion is formed on the opposite surface side of the joint surface side.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According the configuration, since the recessed portion is formed in the center portion of the joint surface of the island unit with the piezoelectric vibrator, towards the opposite surface side to the joint surface side, a portion corresponding to the recessed portion of the island unit is not joined to the tip portion of the piezoelectric vibrator. Accordingly, it is possible to reduce the reaction force received from the island unit when the piezoelectric vibrator expands and contracts. As a result, deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator due to the reaction force is prevented, and the adverse influence on the liquid properties due to the deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator can be suppressed. Meanwhile, since the width of both end portions of the island unit is wider than the width of the center portion thereof, the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator in an expandable manner can be efficiently converted to the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber. Thus, the desired amount of the liquid can be ejected from the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to still another aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid ejecting apparatus comprising the liquid ejecting head according to any one of above aspects.</p>

The compliance unit <b>34</b> is manufactured by removing a region of supporting plate <b>31</b> corresponding to the opening surface of the reservoir <b>26</b> by the etching process, so as to leave only the flexible film <b>32</b> on the corresponding portion. The compliance unit <b>34</b> functions as a damper which absorbs the pressure fluctuation of the liquid retained in the reservoir <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The diaphragm <b>33</b> is manufactured by partially removing the supporting plate <b>31</b> through the etching process, similarly to the compliance unit <b>34</b>. That is, the diaphragm unit <b>33</b> includes the island unit <b>35</b> to which the tip surface of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is joined, and an elastic film unit <b>36</b> formed of only the flexible film <b>32</b> surrounding the periphery of the island unit <b>35</b>. The elastic film unit <b>36</b> is a portion where the support plate <b>31</b> is removed with the island unit <b>35</b> remaining, over the formation range of the pressure chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plane view explaining a configuration of an island unit <b>35</b>. The island unit <b>35</b> of the embodiment is formed in a block shape with longer sides, which is smaller than the opening shape of the pressure chamber <b>28</b>. The island unit <b>35</b> includes wide width portions <b>40</b> respectively formed on both end portions in the longitudinal direction and a narrow width portion <b>41</b> formed between both wide width portions <b>40</b>. The width (dimension in the nozzle array direction) of both wide width portions <b>40</b> has gradually been narrowed from the maximum width W<b>1</b> of the end portion which is on the opposite side to the narrow width portion <b>41</b>, to the minimum width W<b>2</b> on the narrow width portion <b>41</b> side. The width of the narrow width portion <b>41</b> is constant as W<b>2</b>. An entire length L<b>1</b> of the island unit <b>35</b> is set to be longer than a dimension L<b>3</b> of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> in a direction perpendicular to the nozzle array, and the length L<b>2</b> of the narrow width portion <b>41</b> in the same direction is set to be shorter than the L<b>3</b>. Further, the maximum width W<b>1</b> of both wide width portions <b>40</b> is set to be smaller than the dimension W<b>3</b> of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> in the nozzle array direction. The maximum width W<b>1</b> of the wide width portions <b>40</b> is similar to or slightly bigger than the width of the island unit of this kind of recording head of the related art, and in this embodiment, is set to 41 &#x3bc;m, for example. Further, the width W<b>2</b> of the narrow width portion <b>41</b> is narrower than the width of the island portion of this kind of recording head in the related art, and in this embodiment, is set to 38 &#x3bc;m, for example. The dimension W<b>3</b> of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> of the embodiment is 50 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a state in which the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is positioned with respect to the island unit <b>35</b>, at least a portion of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> overlaps both end portions of the island unit, respectively. In this state, the tip portion of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is joined to the island unit <b>35</b>. Herein, as described above, since the length L<b>2</b> of the narrow width portion <b>41</b> is set to be sufficiently shorter than the dimension L<b>3</b> of the piezoelectric vibrator, even in a case in which the position of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> with respect to the island unit <b>35</b> is slightly shifted to the direction perpendicular to the nozzle array by the manufacturing error or product size error, the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is more reliably joined to both sides of the wide width portions <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> with respect to the island unit <b>35</b> in an expandable manner can be more reliably delivered, and the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber <b>28</b> can be more reliably performed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a waveform chart showing an example of a configuration of an ejecting driving pulse DP which drives the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> to eject the ink from the nozzles <b>30</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the vertical axis shows the electric potential, and the horizontal axis shows the time. The ejecting driving pulse DP includes a dilation element p<b>1</b> which makes the pressure chamber <b>28</b> dilate by changing the electric potential to positive, from the reference electric potential (intermediate electric potential) Vb to the maximum electric potential (maximum voltage) Vmax, a dilation holding element p<b>2</b> which holds the maximum electric potential Vmax for the constant time period, a contracting element p<b>3</b> which contracts the pressure chamber <b>28</b> rapidly by changing the electric potential to negative, from the maximum electric potential Vmax to the minimum electric potential (minimum voltage) Vmin, a contracting holding (damping held) element p<b>4</b> which holds the minimum electric potential Vmin for the constant time period, and a returning element p<b>5</b> which makes the electric potential return from the minimum electric potential Vmin to the reference electric potential Vb. Herein, when the electric potential applied to the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is the reference electric potential Vb, the position of the island unit <b>35</b> is positioned in the vicinity of the opening portion of the pressure chamber <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ejecting driving pulse DP acts as follows when it is applied to the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b>. First, the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> contracts due to the dilation element p<b>1</b>. Since the island unit <b>35</b> is surrounded by the elastic film unit <b>36</b>, the displacement of the island unit <b>35</b> along with the expanding and the contracting of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> due to the deformation of the elastic film unit <b>36</b> is permitted. That is, if the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is contracted, accordingly, the island unit <b>35</b> is displaced to the side (opposite side to the nozzle plate <b>24</b>) separated from the pressure chamber <b>28</b>. Accordingly, the pressure chamber <b>28</b> dilates from the reference volume corresponding to the reference electric potential Vb to the maximum volume corresponding to the maximum electric potential Vmax. By this dilation of the pressure chamber <b>28</b>, the meniscus exposed to the nozzle <b>30</b> is drawn into the pressure chamber side. The dilated state of the pressure chamber <b>28</b> is held constant over the time period when the dilation holding element p<b>2</b> is applied. During this time, since the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is held in the contracting state, the island unit <b>35</b> also stays in that position. If the contracting element p<b>3</b> is applied to the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> sequentially after the dilation holding element p<b>2</b>, the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> expands to the maximum limit or almost to the maximum limit. Along this, the island unit <b>35</b> is rapidly displaced towards the side (nozzle plate <b>24</b> side) close to the pressure chamber <b>28</b>. Accordingly, the pressure chamber <b>28</b> rapidly contracts from the maximum volume to the minimum volume corresponding to the minimum electric potential Vmin. The ink in the pressure chamber <b>28</b> is pressurized by the rapid contraction of the pressure chamber <b>28</b>, and so that several p<b>1</b> to several tens of p<b>1</b> of ink is ejected from the nozzles <b>30</b>. The contracted state of the pressure chamber <b>28</b> is held for a short time over the time period when the contracting holding element p<b>4</b> is applied. During this time, since the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is held in the expanded state, the island unit <b>35</b> also stays in that position. After that, the returning element p<b>5</b> is applied to the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> and the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> contracts. Along with this, the island unit <b>35</b> is displaced to the normal position corresponding to the reference electric potential Vb. Accordingly the pressure chamber <b>28</b> returns to the reference volume.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> are cross-sectional diagrams of main parts, in the nozzle array direction, of a center portion of a pressure chamber <b>28</b> in the longitudinal direction, in which <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a normal state (a state in which the applied electric potential of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is the reference electric potential Vb), and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a state in which the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is expanded. Herein, when the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is expanded and contracted, particularly when the piezoelectric vibrator is expanded, the reaction force received from the island unit <b>35</b> is easy to concentrate to the center portion of the joint surface of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> and the island unit <b>35</b>. In this kind of recording head in the related art, the piezoelectric vibrator is deformed due to the reaction force received from the island unit, and the normal ejecting of the ink was difficult in some cases. However, in the recording head <b>2</b> according to the embodiments of the invention, since the width of the narrow width portion <b>41</b> in the center portion of the island unit <b>35</b> in the longitudinal direction is set to be narrower than the width of the wide width portions <b>40</b> in both end portions of the island unit in the longitudinal direction, the joint area with the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> in the center portion of the island unit <b>35</b> is smaller than the related art, and the reaction force received from the island unit <b>35</b> when the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> expands and contracts can be reduced. That is, by employing this configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a distance D<b>2</b> from the wall <b>42</b> to the narrow width portion <b>41</b> is longer than a distance D<b>1</b> (or, distance from the pressure chamber wall to the island unit of the recording head in the related art) from the wall <b>42</b> which partitions the pressure chamber <b>28</b> to the wide width portion <b>40</b>. To that extent, the range of the elastic film unit <b>36</b> becomes wider, and the reaction force (black arrows in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) when the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> expands and contracts tends to be absorbed by the elastic deformation of the elastic film unit <b>36</b>. Accordingly, the reaction force with respect to the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> can be reduced. As a result, the deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> due to the reaction force is prevented, and the adverse influence on the ink ejection due to the deformation of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> can be suppressed. Meanwhile, since the width of the wide width portions <b>40</b> of both end portions of the island unit <b>35</b> is wider than the width of the narrow width portion <b>41</b> of the center portion, the displacement of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> in an expandable manner can be efficiently converted to the volume fluctuation of the pressure chamber <b>28</b>. Therefore, it is possible to eject the desired amount of ink from the nozzles <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the printer <b>1</b> on which the recording head <b>2</b> is mounted, since it is possible to arrange the nozzles <b>30</b> with a high density, it is possible to provide the recording images and the like at a high resolution. Further, since it is possible to make the thickness of the substrate of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> thinner than the related art, the cost can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and various modifications can be made based on the descriptions of claims.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the shape of the island unit <b>35</b> is not limited to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plane view explaining a configuration of an island unit <b>35</b>&#x2032; of a second embodiment. The island unit <b>35</b>&#x2032; in this embodiment, includes wide width portions <b>40</b>&#x2032; which are positioned at both end portions in the longitudinal direction, and have constant width as W<b>1</b>, a narrow width portion <b>41</b> which is positioned at the center portion in the longitudinal direction and has a constant width as W<b>2</b> (W<b>2</b>&#x3c;W<b>1</b>), and a connection portions <b>44</b> which are positioned between the wide width portion <b>40</b>&#x2032; and a narrow width portion <b>41</b>, and of which the widths gradually become narrower from W<b>1</b> to W<b>2</b> when it goes from the wide width portion <b>40</b>&#x2032; side to the narrow width portion <b>41</b> side. A piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> is connected to the island portions <b>35</b>&#x2032; in a state in which at least a part of the piezoelectric vibrator overlaps both sides of the wide width portions <b>40</b>&#x2032;. Since the other configurations are the same as the first embodiment, the detailed descriptions are omitted. In the configuration, the same effects are obtained as the first embodiment. To summarize, as long as the configuration is such that the width of the center portion of the island portion in the longitudinal direction is set to be narrower than the width of both end portions of the island unit in the longitudinal direction, an arbitrarily-shaped island unit can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional diagram of the vicinity of a pressure chamber <b>28</b> of a third embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a plane view explaining a configuration of an island unit <b>35</b>&#x2033; of a third embodiment. The island unit <b>35</b>&#x2033; of the embodiment has a rectangular parallelepiped shape wherein the width is approximately constant, as similar to the island unit employed in the recording head in the related art, however, it is different from the island units in the related art and the island units of each embodiments, in a point in which a recessed portion <b>46</b> is formed on the center portion of the joint surface with the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b>, towards to the opposite surface side (pressure chamber <b>28</b> side) of the joint surface side. The opening shape of the recessed portion <b>46</b> has a rectangular shape, and the depth thereof is slightly shallower than the thickness of the island unit <b>35</b>. Alternatively, the recessed portion <b>46</b> may penetrate the thickness direction of the island unit <b>35</b>. Further, an inside dimension L<b>4</b> of the recessed portion <b>46</b> in the longitudinal direction is shorter than the dimension L<b>3</b> of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b>. According to this configuration, since a portion of the island unit <b>35</b> corresponding to the recessed portion <b>46</b> is not joined to the tip portion of the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b>, the reaction force received from the island unit <b>35</b> when the piezoelectric vibrator <b>20</b> expands and contracts can be reduced. The reaction force at this time is absorbed by the elastic deformation of the thin-walled portion of the bottom portion of the recessed portion <b>46</b> and the elastic film unit <b>36</b> corresponding to the thin-walled portion, when the recessed portion <b>46</b> does not penetrate the island unit <b>35</b>. When the recessed portion <b>46</b> penetrates the island unit <b>35</b>, the reaction force is absorbed by the elastic deformation of the elastic film unit <b>36</b> corresponding to the recessed portion <b>46</b>. Thus, the same effects to the embodiments can also be obtained by the above configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Hereinabove, the ink jet type printer <b>1</b> as a kind of liquid ejecting apparatus is described as an example, however, the embodiments of the invention can be also applied to the other liquid ejecting apparatus in which the volume of the pressure chamber is fluctuated so as to eject the liquid from the nozzles by displacing the island unit by the piezoelectric vibrator. For example, it is possible to be applied to a display manufacturing apparatus manufacturing color filters such as liquid crystal displays, an electrode manufacturing apparatus forming the electrode such as electroluminescence display or FED (Field Emission Display), a chip manufacturing apparatus manufacturing biochips, and a micropipette preciously supplying extremely small amounts of a sample solution.</p>
