<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In semiconductor manufacturing, a low K dielectric is a material with a small dielectric constant relative to silicon dioxide. Low K dielectric material implementation is one of several strategies used to allow continued scaling of microelectronic devices. In integrated circuits, insulating dielectrics separate the conducting parts (i.e., wire interconnects) from one another. As components have scaled and transistors have got closer together, the insulating dielectrics have thinned to the point where charge build up and crosstalk may, in some instance, adversely affect the performance of the device. Replacing the traditional silicon dioxide dielectric layers with a low K dielectric of the same thickness reduces parasitic capacitance, thus enabling faster switching speeds and lower heat dissipation.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more implementations of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. The drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Traditional dielectric layers such as silicon dioxide have a relatively high dielectric constant of about 3.9, while some other materials such as fluorine silicon oxide have a dielectric constant of about 3.7. A class of materials typically referred to as low K dielectric materials have a dielectric constant of about 3.0 or lower, while a dielectric constant of 2.0 or less is deemed to an ultra low K dielectric material. Air, on the other hand, as a dielectric constant of 1.0. Strategies to use various low K dielectric materials suffer from poor mechanical properties, poor adhesion, difficult integration, and poor defect control. The present disclosure employs air gaps in more traditional dielectric layers to reduce the effective dielectric constant of the dielectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a fragmentary cross section diagram illustrating a semiconductor device according to one embodiment. The device includes a semiconductor body <b>100</b> such as a substrate or a doped well region in a substrate, such as the n-well formed in a lightly doped p-type substrate <b>102</b>. Any type of semiconductor body, such as a starting material, doped starting material, epitaxial layers formed on or over a substrate, etc. may constitute a semiconductor body, and all such variations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. Generally speaking, a low K dielectric layer <b>106</b> overlies the semiconductor body <b>102</b>, wherein the low K dielectric layer <b>106</b>, in one region <b>108</b> comprises a first portion <b>110</b>, a second portion <b>112</b>, and a third portion <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, the first portion <b>110</b> and the third portion <b>114</b> comprise a dielectric material, while the second portion <b>112</b> comprises an air gap. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates solely one region <b>108</b> having first, second and third regions <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, many such regions such as region <b>1078</b> may be reproduced through the low K dielectric layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The air gap <b>112</b> in the low K dielectric layer <b>106</b> serves to lower the effective dielectric constant of the layer as a whole. By forming many air gaps <b>112</b> with dielectric lateral <b>110</b>, <b>114</b> on opposing sides, the structural stability of the low K dielectric layer <b>106</b> is maintained. IN addition, in one embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, moisture barrier layers <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> that extend vertically on opposing sides of the air gap <b>112</b> may be formed to provide a moisture barrier that protects the dielectric material in first and third portions <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> from contamination and/or degradation due to any moisture that may reside within the air gap <b>112</b>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a conductive material <b>122</b> such as copper may reside near the air gap <b>112</b>, disposed laterally next to the second moisture barrier layer <b>120</b>. The conductive material <b>122</b> may, in one embodiment, be formed concurrently with other conductive metallization, or alternatively in a separate processing step. In one embodiment the conductive layer <b>122</b> is copper and the moisture barrier layer <b>120</b> also serves as a copper diffusion barrier. In one embodiment the moisture barrier layers comprise a silicon nitride, however, any material that provides a moisture barrier and preclude diffusion may be employed and such materials are contemplated as falling within the second of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment where the conductive layer <b>122</b> comprises copper, a diffusion barrier layer <b>124</b> also resides on an opposing side thereof to prevent out-diffusion into the dielectric material. Again, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate solely one air gap <b>112</b> in the dielectric layer, the number of air gaps can be multiplied to include a very large number of air gaps, thereby reducing the effective dielectric constant of the low K dielectric layer <b>106</b> while concurrently maintaining a structural stability of the layer. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, after the air gaps <b>112</b> are formed in the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, a capping layer <b>126</b>, such as an etch stop layer, may be formed thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart diagram illustrating various acts in a method <b>200</b> that may be employed to fabricate a low K dielectric layer, such as layer <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. While the method <b>200</b> is illustrated and described below as a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of such acts or events. For example, some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illustrated and/or described herein, in accordance with the invention. In addition, not all illustrated steps may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present disclosure. Furthermore, the methods according to this disclosure may be implemented in association with the fabrication of ICs including both active and passive devices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method <b>200</b> begins at <b>202</b> and proceeds to <b>204</b>, wherein a well may be formed in a substrate to form a semiconductor body. Alternatively, the semiconductor body may comprise the substrate itself or an epitaxial layer grown over the substrate. Any form of semiconductor body may be employed and is contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one or more air gaps <b>112</b> are formed in the dielectric layer <b>106</b> at <b>206</b>. In one embodiment, the air gaps <b>112</b> are formed by etching, for example, using a patterned photoresist as a mask and then removing the photoresist by, for example, ashing. A moisture barrier layer is then formed in the air gasps at <b>208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in a substantially conformal deposition process, followed by an anisotropic etch to remove the moisture barrier material on lateral surfaces, leaving vertically extending moisture barriers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> on opposing sides of the air gaps <b>112</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The deposition technique, in one embodiment, may comprise atomic layer deposition (ALD) and the anisotropic etch may comprise a reactive ion etch (RIE), however, other conformal depositions and anisotropic etches may be employed and are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method <b>200</b> comprise forming conductive columns in the air gaps <b>112</b> to define sub-air gaps at <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, act <b>210</b> may be performed by first depositing a sacrificial layer on lateral sides of the moisture barriers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and then performing an anisotropic etch to form vertically extending sacrificial regions <b>216</b> next to the moisture barriers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. Subsequently a conductive layer is formed to fill the remaining air gaps <b>112</b> and planarized, for example, via chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to form a planar surface exposing top edges of the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, moisture barriers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, sacrificial regions <b>216</b> and conductive columns <b>122</b>. Act <b>210</b> the concludes with an etch of the exposed sacrificial regions <b>216</b> to remove them, thus defining sub-air gaps <b>218</b> on opposing sides of the conductive columns <b>122</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In one embodiment the sacrificial region <b>216</b> is an oxide, however, other materials having sufficient selectivities with respect of the dielectric layer <b>10</b>-<b>6</b>, moisture barriers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and conductive columns <b>122</b> may be employed, and all such materials are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the etch utilized to remove the sacrificial regions <b>216</b> may be a wet etchant, although a dry etch may having sufficient selectivity may also be employed. Further, in one embodiment the conductive column or pillar <b>122</b> is composed of copper, but other materials, either conductive, semi-conductive, or insulative may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Lastly, method <b>200</b> comprises forming a capping layer <b>220</b> over the underlying structure to cover the sub-air gaps. In one embodiment the capping layer <b>220</b> comprises an etch stop layer, but any layer may be employed and is contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, the capping layer <b>220</b> may be formed by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or other film forming process.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another method <b>300</b> of forming a low K dielectric layer <b>106</b> is illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the fragmentary cross section diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-20</figref>. The method <b>300</b> begins at <b>300</b> with an initiation of dielectric processing at <b>302</b>, wherein a dielectric layer <b>106</b> is formed over a semiconductor body <b>100</b>. In one embodiment the dielectric layer <b>106</b> is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), however, any manner of forming the layer may be employed and all such variations are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. In one embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the dielectric layer <b>106</b> is formed directly over a starting material substrate as the semiconductor body, however, doped regions or epitaxially formed regions may comprise such semiconductor body. In addition, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the dielectric layer <b>106</b> directly over the semiconductor body <b>100</b>, it should be understood that one or more intervening layers may reside therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method <b>300</b> proceeds by forming dielectric pillars by patterning the deposited dielectric layer <b>106</b> at <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, wherein such pillars are identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> with the reference numerals <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, respectively. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates three pillars, it should be understood that the number of formed pillars may vary and all such variations are contemplated by the present disclosure. In one embodiment, the pillars <b>106</b><i>a </i>are a multi-layer composed of an underlying etch stop layer <b>306</b> (ESL), the dielectric material <b>106</b>, and an overlying hardmask layer <b>308</b> (HM). These layers are deposited consecutively at <b>302</b> and may be deposited by chemical vapor deposition, for example. In one example, the etch stop layer <b>306</b> may be silicon nitride (SiN), silicon oxynitride (SiON), silicon carbinde (SiC), oxygen doped silicon carbide (SiOC), and nitride doped silicon carbide (SiCN). In one example, the hard mask layer <b>308</b> may be silicon oxynitride (SiON), or oxygen doped silicon carbide (SiOC). Upon patterning of the multi-layer dielectric to form the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, spaces <b>310</b> are defined between the respective pillars.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">III referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the method <b>300</b> comprises forming a moisture barrier layer <b>312</b> over the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, at <b>314</b>. The moisture barrier layer <b>312</b> is formed via a conformal deposition process such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) in order to conformally adhere along sidewalls <b>316</b> of the pillars. In one embodiment the moisture barrier layer comprises silicon nitride that can also operate as a diffusion barrier, as will be appreciated in further processing. Any moisture barrier material (for example, ALD silicon nitride (SiN) or carbon silicon nitride (SiCN) may be used and all such materials are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The moisture barrier layer <b>312</b> is patterned to remove portions thereof at <b>318</b> that reside on lateral surfaces such as top portions of the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>and regions in the spaces <b>310</b> between the pillars. This patterning leaves vertically extending moisture barriers <b>320</b>, <b>322</b> on opposing sides of the pillars, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In one embodiment the moisture barrier layer is patterned using an anisotropic etch such as a reactive ion etch (RIE) that is substantially selective with respect to the hardmask <b>308</b> and the semiconductor body <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a sacrificial layer <b>324</b> is formed over the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>at <b>326</b> in a conformal deposition process such as ASD, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In one embodiment the sacrificial layer <b>324</b> is an oxide, however, other materials may be employed that serve the same function, as will be more fully appreciated later. For example, such materials include ALD silicon dioxide (SiO2), ALD SiO2 is advantageous due to a large etch selectivity with a SiN or SiCN barrier film. A sacrificial layer etch is then performed at <b>328</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to remove portions of the sacrificial layer <b>324</b> that reside on lateral surfaces such as over the hardmask <b>308</b> portions of the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>an din the spaces <b>310</b> between the pillars. Again, such an etch may be an anisotropic etch that results in vertically extending sacrificial regions <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> on opposing sides of the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, and disposed next to the respective moisture barriers <b>320</b> and <b>322</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a second moisture barrier layer <b>334</b> is formed over the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>at <b>336</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The second moisture barrier layer <b>334</b> is then patterned to remove lateral portions on top of the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>and in the spaces <b>310</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> the patterning of the second moisture barrier layer <b>334</b> at <b>337</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> results in a second pair of vertically extending moisture barriers <b>338</b> and <b>340</b> on opposing sides, wherein the first and second moisture barriers <b>322</b> and <b>340</b>, and <b>320</b> and <b>338</b> effectively sandwich the sacrificial regions <b>332</b> and <b>330</b>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At <b>342</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the method <b>300</b> continues with formation of a conductive layer <b>344</b> over and between the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, thereby filling in the spaces <b>310</b> between the pillars, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In one example, before the conductive layer <b>344</b> is formed, if formed with copper, a copper barrier layer is formed, such as a titanium nitride (TiN) or tantalum nitride (TaN) layer. In one example, the copper barrier layer is formed via physical vapor deposition. In one embodiment the conductive layer <b>344</b> comprises copper and is formed by depositing a copper seed layer followed by an electroplating process. Alternatively the conductive layer is formed by other materials such as aluminum. Any conductive material may be employed and is contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. In one alternative example, Graphene is employed. In one embodiment the formation of the copper layer is deposited concurrently with the formation of the metallization for devices on the integrated circuit chip.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The conductive layer is then planarized at <b>346</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, resulting in removal of conductive material on top portion of the pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>(i.e., exposing the hardmask portions <b>308</b>), and leaving conductive material between the second moisture barriers <b>338</b> and <b>340</b> to form conductive columns <b>348</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In one embodiment the planarization at <b>346</b> is performed via CMP, however, any planarization may be performed and is contemplated as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the planarization of the conductive layer <b>344</b> results into portions <b>350</b> of the moisture barriers <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>338</b> and <b>340</b> and sacrificial portions <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> being exposed. Due to this exposure, the sacrificial layer material <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> are removed at <b>352</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, thereby defining air gaps <b>112</b> that are bounded by the first and second moisture barriers <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>338</b> and <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At <b>354</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> a capping layer <b>220</b> is formed over the dielectric pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, and air gaps <b>112</b>, thereby covering the air gaps, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The method <b>300</b> then discontinues at <b>356</b>, however, additional dielectric processing on other backend processing may continue, as may be appreciated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a portion <b>360</b> of the figure is enlarged to facilitate a more detailed illustration of various feature in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. As can be seen, between the two dielectric pillars <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>resides two pairs of moisture barriers <b>322</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>320</b>, <b>338</b> that surround air gaps <b>112</b> on opposing sides of a conductive column <b>348</b>. The moisture barriers <b>322</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>320</b>, <b>338</b> operate to prevent moisture from moving from the air gaps into the dielectric material <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>that may otherwise adversely affect device performance and/or reliability. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the air gaps <b>112</b> have a width <b>360</b> that corresponds to a thickness of the sacrificial layer <b>324</b> that was formed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. By making the sacrificial layer <b>324</b> more thick, the thickness <b>360</b> of the air gaps <b>112</b> may be increased. Likewise, by decreasing the thickness of the sacrificial layer <b>324</b> the thickness of the air gap may be decreased. In such a manner the effective dielectric constant of the dielectric layer <b>106</b> may be tuned or otherwise varied as desired. As may be appreciated the larger the air gaps become, the more the effective dielectric constant of the layer is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Similarly, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a width <b>362</b> of the conductive pillar or column <b>348</b> may be varied by altering the pitch of the dielectric pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c</i>, wherein the spacings <b>310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are varied. Likewise, the width of the dielectric pillars <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>may be varied, thus also modulating the pitch defined by the widths of the pillars and respective spacings <b>310</b>. In the above fashion the density of the air gaps <b>12</b> within the dielectric layer <b>106</b> may be varied to provide another degree of freedom in varying the effective dielectric constant of the layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While it may be desirable to vary a width <b>360</b> of the air gaps <b>112</b> and a width <b>362</b> of the conductive columns <b>348</b> to any a degree, some practical considerations need to be considered. That is, the air gap width <b>360</b> cannot be so large that the subsequent formation of the capping layer <b>220</b> fills the air gap <b>112</b>. Similarly, the width of the conductive column <b>348</b> cannot be so narrow that the spacings <b>310</b> are too small to have the copper or other conductive material properly form therein.</p>
