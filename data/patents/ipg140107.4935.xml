<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a color electrophotographic image forming apparatus including a plurality of developing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Here, the developing device develops an electrostatic latent image formed on an image bearing member (referred also to as a photosensitive drum) by a developing means to visualize the electrostatic latent image as a toner image, and a developing cartridge includes the developing device and is detachably mountable to the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a printer or a facsimile machine, the electrostatic latent image formed on the image bearing member is visualized as the toner image by being developed by the developing means.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional image forming apparatus using an electrophotographic image forming process, the developing device develops the electrostatic latent image formed on the image bearing member by the developing means to visualize the electrostatic latent image as the toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The developing cartridge is prepared by integrally assembling a developer carrying member for developing the electrostatic latent image formed on the image bearing member, a toner accommodating portion for accommodating a developer, and a developing blade for regulating a developer layer thickness into a cartridge which is detachably mountable to an image forming apparatus main assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With respect to such an image forming apparatus, color image forming apparatuses including a movable member in which a plurality of developing cartridges is mountable (hereinafter referred also to as a rotary) and including developing devices of a rotary type have been proposed and commercialized (Japanese Patent No. 3940919, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 2003-302807, JP-A Hei 10-221919, and JP-A 2000-231239).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In such a rotary constitution, the developing cartridges are supported and a developing roller of one of the developing cartridges is brought into contact with the photosensitive drum uniformly with respect to a rotational axis direction of the photosensitive drum.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>b</i>), the image forming apparatus main assembly applies an urging force to the rotary, so that the developing roller is pressed against the photosensitive drum with holes <b>307</b><i>a </i>and <b>306</b><i>a </i>as centers of swing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For that reason, in order to bring the developing roller into contact with the photosensitive drum uniformly as described above, there is a need to enhance dimensional accuracy and supporting rigidity of the rotary and dimensional accuracy and rigidity of the developing cartridges.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the rotary constitution described in the prior art, the following problem arises. When a variation in dimensional accuracy of each of parts, in the case where, e.g., lengths of R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) are different from each other, a line connecting the center of the hole <b>307</b><i>a </i>(the swing center) to the center of a developing roller end portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>L and a line connecting the center of the hole <b>306</b><i>a </i>(the swing center) to the center of a developing roller end portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>R provide a relative angular difference &#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result, the developing roller end portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>R contacts a photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>but the developing roller end portion <b>2</b><i>a</i>L is separated from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>), so that the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>does not completely contact the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, as a countermeasure thereto, in the case where the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is brought into strong contact with the photosensitive drum <b>3</b> with respect to a direction indicated by an arrow Y, a contact pressure of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>becomes nonuniform with respect to a longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum although a gap d is not created. Thus, a contact with (developing nip width) between the developing roller and the photosensitive drum becomes nonuniform with respect to the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum, so that there is a possibility that image defect occurs. Therefore, there is a need to effect several dimensional controls in manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, in the prior art, the developing roller is required to be uniformly in contact with the photosensitive drum with respect to the photosensitive drum rotational axis direction. For that purpose, there was a need to enhance processing accuracy of each of parts for holding the developing roller and the photosensitive drum and to enhance positioning of the developing roller relative to the photosensitive drum with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As one measure for that purpose, it is necessary to increase the rigidity of the rotary in which the developing cartridges are mounted. That is, there was a need to select a high-rigidity material or to ensure the rigidity by increasing a thickness of a member for the rotary.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As a result of such a measure, there was a problem that a production cost was increased.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As a constitution for solving the problem, e.g., Japanese Patent No. 3940919 discloses a constitution in which the developing roller is brought into contact with the photosensitive drum uniformly (with respect to the photosensitive drum longitudinal direction) as shown in FIGS. 18 to 20 thereof. However, this constitution is effective only for a constitution in which the developing cartridge is mounted and demounted in the photosensitive drum longitudinal direction but is not suitable for a constitution in which the developing cartridge is mounted and demounted in a radial direction of the rotary.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, in the case where a constitution as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of JP-A 2003-302807 was selected, there was a problem that the constitution of the rotary was complicated and thus the production cost was increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A principal object of the present invention is to provide an image forming apparatus capable of bringing a developer carrying member into contact with an image bearing member uniformly with respect to a rotational axis direction of the image bearing member with a simple constitution.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">a first swingable supporting member for rotatably supporting the movable member at the one end portion of the rotation shaft member in the movable member and for swingably supporting the movable member relative to a main assembly of the image forming apparatus;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">a second swingable supporting member for rotatably supporting the movable member at the other end portion of the rotation shaft member in the movable member and for swingably supporting the movable member relative to the main assembly;</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">General Structure of Image Forming Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, an image forming operation of the image forming apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The image forming apparatus is a four color-based full-color laser beam printer, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing a schematic structure thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>11</b> includes a photosensitive drum (image bearing member) <b>3</b><i>a</i>. At a periphery of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, a charging means <b>3</b><i>b </i>for uniformly charging the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>and an exposure means <b>12</b> for forming a latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>by irradiating the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>with laser light are disposed. Further, a yellow developing device <b>5</b><i>a</i>, a magenta developing device <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a cyan developing device <b>5</b><i>c </i>and a black developing device <b>5</b><i>d </i>which are to be used for developing the latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and a cleaning means <b>3</b><i>c </i>for removing residual toner on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>are disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment, the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the charging means <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the cleaning means <b>3</b><i>c </i>are integrally constituted and are assembled into a drum cartridge <b>3</b> which is detachably mountable to the image forming apparatus <b>11</b>. Each of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the charging means <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the cleaning means <b>3</b><i>c </i>may have an independent constitution or may also have an integral constitution. Further, the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>may also be fixed to the image forming apparatus main assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The plurality of developing devices is held by a rotary <b>101</b> which is a movable member rotatably attached to the image forming apparatus <b>11</b>. Each of the developing devices may have a constitution in which the developing device cannot be demounted from the rotary <b>101</b> or may also be a developing cartridge type in which the developing device is mountable to and demountable from the rotary <b>101</b>. Incidentally, in this embodiment, by taking the developing device of the developing cartridge type in which the developing device is detachably mountable to the rotary <b>101</b> as an example, the developing devices will be described as a yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>, a magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and a black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The rotary <b>101</b> has the same developing cartridge holding constitution with respect to each of the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the constitution in which the rotary <b>101</b> holds each of the developing cartridges will be described with respect to the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>), the rotary <b>101</b> includes a first disk <b>104</b> which is a first supporting member (first member) and a second disk <b>103</b> which is a second supporting member (second member). The first disk <b>104</b> supports a guide portion (first portion to be guided) <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> which is a first portion to be locked which is provided on one end portion of the developing cartridge (developing device) <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The second disk <b>103</b> supports a guide portion (second portion to be guided) <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> which is a second portion to be locked which is provided on the other end portion of the developing cartridge (developing device) <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the rotary <b>101</b> is provided with guide grooves (first guide portion) <b>104</b><i>a </i>and (second guide portion) <b>103</b><i>a </i>for guiding the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>to be mounting position when the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is mounted in the rotary <b>101</b>. In a state in which a door <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the image forming apparatus main assembly is opened, developing cartridge locking members <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>a </i>are retracted in a direction indicated by an arrow F<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref><i>b</i>). Then, the rotary <b>101</b> is placed in a state in which the guide portions <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> and <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> can be received by the guide grooves <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>a</i>, respectively (i.e., a state in which the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is not prevented from being mounted in the rotary <b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, a user holds a holding portion H and mounts the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>in a direction indicated by an arrow R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>). The guide portion <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the guide groove <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the guide portion <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the guide groove <b>103</b><i>a</i>, so that the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is guided to the mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Thus, the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>reaches a predetermined position with respect to the arrow R direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>) and then when the door <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1)</figref> of the image forming apparatus main assembly is closed, the developing cartridge locking members <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>103</b><i>a </i>move in a direction indicated by an arrow F<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thus, a locking surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the developing cartridge locking member <b>103</b><i>a </i>and a locking surface <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b><i>a </i>of the portion to be locked <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> contact each other. Further, the developing cartridge locking member <b>104</b><i>a </i>similarly moves in the arrow F<b>1</b> direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>16</b>(<i>a</i>) by an unshown spring. Then, a locking surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the locking member <b>104</b><i>a </i>and a locking surface <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b><i>a </i>of the guide portion <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> contact each other, so that the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is prevented from moving in a direction indicated by an arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">That is, the developing cartridge is held by the rotary <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>5</b>(<i>b</i>)), thus being prevented from being detached in a radial direction of rotation of the rotary <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, in a state in which the door <b>22</b> of the image forming apparatus main assembly is opened, the developing cartridge locking member <b>103</b><i>a </i>is retracted in the arrow F<b>2</b> direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) in interrelation with an opening operation of the door <b>22</b>, so that the engagement of the locking surface <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> with the locking surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is released. Also on an opposite side, similarly, the developing cartridge locking member <b>104</b><i>a </i>is retracted in the arrow F<b>2</b> direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>) in interrelation with the opening operation of the door <b>22</b>, so that the engagement of the locking surface <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b><i>a </i>with the locking surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is released and thus the developing cartridge is detachably mountable to the rotary.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Similarly, the magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d </i>are provided with guide portions <b>9</b><i>b</i><b>11</b>, <b>9</b><i>c</i><b>11</b> and <b>9</b><i>d</i><b>11</b>, respectively. These guide portions <b>9</b><i>b</i><b>11</b>, <b>9</b><i>c</i><b>11</b> and <b>9</b><i>d</i><b>11</b> are engaged with cartridge locking members <b>104</b><i>b</i>, <b>104</b><i>c </i>and <b>104</b><i>d</i>, respectively, provided in the rotary <b>101</b>, so that the developing cartridges <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>c </i>and <b>5</b><i>d </i>are held by the rotary <b>101</b> and thus are prevented from being detached in the radial direction of rotation of the rotary <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, also with respect to the other end portions, by a similar constitution, the magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d </i>are provided with portions to be locked <b>9</b><i>f</i><b>11</b>, <b>9</b><i>g</i><b>11</b> and <b>9</b><i>h</i><b>11</b>, respectively. These guide portions <b>9</b><i>f</i><b>11</b>, <b>9</b><i>g</i><b>11</b> and <b>9</b><i>h</i><b>11</b> are engaged with developing cartridge locking members <b>103</b><i>b</i>, <b>103</b><i>c </i>and <b>103</b><i>d</i>, respectively, provided in the rotary <b>101</b>, so that the developing cartridges <b>5</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>c </i>and <b>5</b><i>d </i>are held by the rotary <b>101</b> and thus are prevented from being detached in the radial direction of rotation of the rotary <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the image forming operation will be described. First, the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In synchronism with the rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, an intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b> is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>is uniformly charged by the charging means <b>3</b><i>b </i>and at the same time is irradiated with light for a yellow image by the exposure means <b>12</b>, so that an electrostatic latent image for yellow is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The rotary <b>101</b> holds the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d</i>. The rotary <b>101</b> is rotated about a rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>in a direction indicated by an arrow B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by a drive transmission mechanism provided in the image forming apparatus <b>11</b>. By the rotation of the rotary <b>101</b>, the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is disposed at a developing position in which the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>opposes the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, i.e., is placed in a state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Then, a potential difference is provided between the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>and the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>which is the developer carrying member so that a yellow developer is deposited on the latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>is developed by depositing the yellow developer thereon. That is, a yellow developer image is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thereafter, by applying a voltage of an opposite polarity to the toner charge polarity to a primary transfer roller <b>14</b> disposed inside the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b>, the yellow toner image is primary-transferred from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>on to the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above-described manner, when the primary transfer of the yellow toner image is completed, the rotary <b>101</b> is rotationally moved in the arrow B direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by receiving a driving force from the drive transmission mechanism (not shown) of the image forming apparatus <b>11</b>. Then, the magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d </i>are successively positioned at the developing position in which the positioned developing cartridge opposes the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Similarly as in the case of yellow, with respect to each of the colors of magenta, cyan and black, the formation of the electrostatic latent image, the development of the electrostatic latent image and the primary transfer are successively performed, so that four color toner images are superposed on the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">During this image forming operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a secondary transfer roller <b>15</b> is in non-contact with the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b>. Further, a cleaning unit <b>16</b> for the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b> is also in non-contact with the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">On the other hand, sheets <b>110</b> which are a recording material (medium) for the toner images are stacked and accommodated in a sheet feeding cassette <b>17</b> provided at a lower portion of the image forming apparatus and are separated and fed one by one from the sheet feeding cassette <b>17</b> by a sheet feeding roller <b>18</b>, thus being fed to conveying rollers <b>19</b>. The conveying rollers <b>19</b> send the fed sheet <b>110</b> between the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>15</b>. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the secondary transfer roller <b>15</b> is in a state in which it press-contacts the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, the voltage of the opposite polarity to the toner charge polarity has been applied to the secondary transfer roller <b>15</b>, so that the above-described four color toner images superposed on the intermediary transfer belt <b>13</b> are secondary-transferred onto the surface of the conveyed sheet <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sheet <b>110</b> on which the toner images are transferred is sent to a fixing device <b>20</b>. In the fixing device <b>20</b>, the sheet <b>110</b> is heated and pressed simultaneously, so that the toner images are fixed on the sheet <b>110</b>. As a result, an image is formed on the sheet <b>110</b>. Thereafter, the sheet <b>110</b> is discharged from the fixing device <b>20</b> to a sheet discharge portion <b>21</b> outside the image forming apparatus <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Developing Cartridge)</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">All the constitutions of the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the magenta developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cyan developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>c </i>and the black developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>d </i>are the same. Therefore, the description of the constitutions of the developing cartridges will be made with respect to the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, and a sectional view thereof is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, constituted by a rubber roller portion <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> and a rigid member shaft <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. The rigid member shaft <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> penetrates the rubber roller portion <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> with respect to the rotational axis direction of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>to create a projected portion (an end portion having an end surface <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> of the rigid member shaft <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) projected from the rubber roller portion <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> at its one end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Incidentally, the rigid member shaft <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>similarly has the projected portion at its other end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is rotationally held by engagement between the end portion of the rigid member shaft <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and a bearing portion <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>10</b> of a developing roller bearing <b>9</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> and by engagement between the other end portion (not shown) of the rigid member shaft <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and a bearing portion (not shown) of a developing roller being <b>9</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">That is, with respect to the developing roller bearing <b>9</b><i>a</i>, a boss <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is engaged with a hole <b>10</b><i>a </i>and an unshown boss provided on the bearing <b>9</b><i>a </i>is engaged with a hole <b>10</b><i>c</i>, so that the bearing <b>9</b><i>a </i>is positioned on the developer container <b>7</b><i>a</i>. Thereafter, a screw <b>21</b> is caused to pass through a hole <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>9</b> and enter a screw hole <b>10</b><i>b</i>, so that the developing roller bearing <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the developing container <b>7</b><i>a </i>are fixed integrally. Further, by a similar constitution, the opposite developing roller bearing <b>9</b><i>e </i>is fixed on the developing container <b>7</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, a developing operation in the developing cartridge will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a principal sectional view of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>during the developing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, toner <b>10</b> in the developing container <b>7</b><i>a </i>is fed to a toner feeding roller <b>8</b><i>a</i>, and the toner feeding roller <b>8</b><i>a </i>feeds the toner <b>10</b> to the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>by rotating in a direction indicated by an arrow E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow F, so that the toner <b>10</b> on the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is regulated by a developing blade <b>1</b><i>a </i>and is subjected to the development of the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The toner <b>10</b> left on the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>after the development is removed by the toner feeding roller <b>8</b><i>a</i>. Thereafter, the toner is fed again to the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>by the toner feeding roller <b>8</b><i>a</i>. The developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>rotates in the arrow F direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, thus developing the electrostatic latent image with the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, to the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a helical gear <b>6</b><i>a </i>is integrally attached. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an input gear <b>4</b><i>a </i>and the helical gear <b>6</b><i>a </i>are engaged with each other, so that the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is rotated by rotation of the input gear <b>4</b><i>a </i>which has received a driving force from an unshown main assembly driving source.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Incidentally, with respect to the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a</i>, in order to provide the potential difference between the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, an electrical contact <b>105</b><i>a </i>of the image forming apparatus <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>) contacts the end surface <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3)</figref> of the core metal portion <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> to supply a voltage to the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The toner feeding roller <b>8</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) is constituted by a sponge portion <b>8</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and a rigid member shaft <b>8</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> and similarly as in the case of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a</i>, an electrical contact (not shown) of the image forming apparatus <b>11</b> contacts the rigid member shaft <b>8</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> to supply a voltage to the toner feeding roller <b>8</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Further, at the developing position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is urged together with the rotary <b>101</b> holding the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>in the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>direction in order to stably bring the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>into contact with the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Incidentally, in order to uniformly develop the latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, it is important that the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>uniformly contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>over the entire longitudinal area (i.e., in a direction parallel to the developing roller rotational axis). As a result, the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the yellow developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is in a state in which the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>with a predetermined pressure.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The rotary constitution in the present invention will be described more specifically below.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first disk <b>104</b> is rotatably supported by engaging an axis <b>104</b><i>f</i>, provided at the center of the first disk <b>104</b>, with a hole <b>106</b><i>b </i>of a first disk supporting member <b>106</b> (first swingable supporting member).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Further, the first disk supporting member <b>106</b> is swingably supported relative to the main assembly by engaging an end portion <b>101</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> of a shaft <b>101</b><i>b </i>with a hole <b>106</b><i>a </i>thereof. As a result, the first disk <b>104</b> is also swingable relative to the main assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Similarly, the second disk <b>103</b> is rotatably supported by engaging an axis <b>103</b><i>f</i>, provided at the center of the second disk <b>103</b>, with a hole <b>107</b><i>b </i>of a second disk supporting member <b>107</b> (second swingable supporting member).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, the second disk supporting member <b>107</b> is swingably supported relative to the main assembly by engaging an end portion <b>101</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> of the shaft <b>101</b><i>b </i>with a hole <b>107</b><i>a </i>thereof. As a result, the second disk <b>103</b> is also swingable relative to the main assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> support the developing cartridges and positionally align the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>with the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>so that a rotation center axis of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>and a rotation center axis of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>are parallel to each other, in order that the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>uniformly contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>with respect to the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, each of a disk gear <b>104</b><i>e </i>provided on the first disk <b>104</b> and a disk gear <b>103</b><i>e </i>provided on the second disk <b>103</b> is engaged with an associated gear <b>109</b> integrally attached to the shaft <b>101</b><i>b</i>. The gear <b>109</b> integrally attached to the shaft <b>101</b><i>b </i>receives a rotational force from an unshown driving source to rotate the shaft <b>101</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The disk gear <b>103</b><i>e </i>and the disk gear <b>104</b><i>e </i>have the same manner of teeth, so that both of the disks are not out of phase depending on an angle of rotation of the gear <b>109</b> and are rotated by an angle corresponding to the same angle of rotation of the gear <b>109</b>. Further, between both of the disks, a rotary rotation shaft (rotation shaft member) <b>101</b><i>a </i>is provided. Further, the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>prevents tilting of the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> toward the inside thereof (in a direction indicated by arrows T in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Further, the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>regulates positions of both of the disks (a width distance) Z in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>)) with respect the longitudinal direction (the axis direction of the shaft <b>101</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>), into a hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>of the first disk <b>104</b>, an end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>L of the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, the hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>and the shaft end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>L are engaged with each other so as to create play with respect to a radial direction, so that the shaft end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>L is freely movable. Here, a state of the engagement will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(</figref><i>b</i>). When the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a </i>has a diameter &#x3c6;A and its engaging hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>has a diameter &#x3c6;B, these diameters satisfy: &#x3c6;A&#x3c;&#x3c6;B. In this embodiment, a value of &#x3c6;B&#x2212;&#x3c6;A is set at <b>0</b>.<b>1</b> mm. Incidentally, this value (of the play) may be appropriately set at a proper value depending on a state of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For that reason, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>), e.g., the disk <b>103</b> is located on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>side and the disk <b>104</b> is located at a position in which the disk <b>104</b> is spaced from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>relative to the disk <b>103</b> (with respect to a direction indicated by an arrow W<b>2</b>). Further, even in the case where the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>is tilted, the end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>L moves within the hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>and an end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>R moves within a hole <b>103</b><i>g</i>, so that movement of the disk <b>104</b> in the W<b>2</b> direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>) is not prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, on an opposite side, similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>R of the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the hole <b>103</b><i>g </i>of the first disk <b>103</b> with the play.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>), e.g., the disk <b>104</b> is located on the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>side and the disk <b>103</b> is located at a position in which the disk <b>103</b> is spaced from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>relative to the disk <b>104</b> (with respect to a direction indicated by an arrow W<b>1</b>). Further, even in the case where the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>is tilted, the end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>L moves within the hole <b>104</b><i>g </i>and an end portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>R moves within a hole <b>103</b><i>g</i>, so that movement of the disk <b>103</b> in the W<b>1</b> direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) is not prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For that reason, the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> are independent of each other and do not interfere with each other, so that the first disk <b>104</b> is swingable in directions indicated by arrows L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>) and the second disk <b>103</b> is swingable in directions indicated by arrows R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A state in which the developing roller <b>5</b><i>a </i>is mounted in the thus constituted rotary is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>b</i>). Incidentally, in these figures, for convenience of easy understanding of states of the respective parts, only one of the developing cartridges is disposed and moved to the developing position. The positioning of the developing cartridge will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, the rotary <b>101</b> is positioned swingably relative to the main assembly by the shaft end portions <b>101</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and <b>101</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>, and the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> are connected by the rotary rotation shaft <b>101</b><i>a </i>with the play described above. By employing such a constitution, the first disk <b>104</b> is movable in the arrow L<b>2</b> direction in which the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>and in the arrow L<b>1</b> direction in which the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is spaced from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Further, the second disk <b>103</b> is configured to be movable in the arrow R<b>1</b> direction in which the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>and in the arrow R<b>2</b> direction in which the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is spaced from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>. At this time, motion of the first disk <b>104</b> and motion of the second disk <b>103</b> do not influence each other and the disks <b>104</b> and <b>103</b> are independently swingable about the shaft <b>101</b><i>b </i>as the rotation center.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Incidentally, as described above, the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> are engaged with the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a </i>with the play. For this reason, the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> are not constrained by the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a </i>with respect to the direction in which each of the disks is spaced from the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a </i>with respect to the rotational axis direction. Therefore, there is a need to devise a means for preventing the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> from being detached from the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this embodiment, a constitution as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(</figref><i>a</i>) is employed. A main assembly left-side frame (first preventing portion) <b>111</b> is provided in proximity to or in contact with the first swingable supporting member <b>106</b> for supporting the first disk <b>104</b>. By this constitution, the first swingable supporting member <b>106</b> and the first disk <b>104</b> are prevented from moving in the direction in which they are spaced from the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a</i>. A main assembly right-side frame (second preventing portion) <b>110</b> is provided in proximity to or in contact with the second swingable supporting member <b>107</b> for supporting the second disk <b>103</b>. By this constitution, the second swingable supporting member <b>107</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> are prevented from moving in the direction in which they are spaced from the rotation shaft member <b>101</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Further, to the disks <b>104</b> and <b>103</b>, in order to bring the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>into contact with the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>with reliability, an urging spring (first urging member) <b>108</b> and an urging spring (second urging member) <b>109</b> are provided, respectively. These springs are referred to as an urging portion.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The spring <b>108</b> is fixed on a receiving surface <b>111</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>a</i>)) fixed on the main assembly frame at its one end and contacts a pressure-receiving surface <b>106</b><i>c </i>provided on the first disk supporting member <b>106</b> at its the other end, thus applying a force toward the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, the spring <b>109</b> is fixed on a receiving surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref><i>b</i>)) fixed on the main assembly frame at its one end and contacts a pressure-receiving surface <b>107</b><i>c </i>provided on the second disk supporting member <b>107</b> at its the other end, thus applying a force toward the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As a result, the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> receive the force toward the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>, so that the force is applied to the developing cartridge positioned between the disks <b>104</b> and <b>103</b> and thus the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>contacts the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, at this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at each of both end portions of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a</i>, a roller (contact portion) <b>30</b><i>a </i>having an outer diameter smaller than that of the rubber roller portion <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is attached. For that reason, the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>urged toward the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>is deformed until the rollers <b>30</b><i>a </i>contact the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>. That is, by the presence of the rollers <b>30</b><i>a</i>, an amount of deformation of the rubber roller portion <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> becomes constant. In this embodiment, the contact portion is the rollers <b>30</b><i>a </i>but is the surface of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>in the case where there are no rollers <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Positioning of Developing Cartridge)</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The positioning of the developing cartridge used in the constitution in this embodiment will be described more specifically.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As described above, the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is provided with the first guide portion (first portion to be guided) <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> engageable with the first guide groove (first guide portion) <b>104</b><i>a </i>and is provided with the second guide portion (second portion to be guided) <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> engageable with the second guide groove (second guide portion) <b>103</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a side view showing a state in which the developing cartridges are mounted in the rotary.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is located at the developing position, in which the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>receives reaction force from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>due to the above-described pressure of the urging spring <b>108</b>. As a result, an outer circumferential portion of the boss <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>10</b> which is the first portion to be supported moves on a first surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> which is parallel to a line a connecting a center <b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>and a center <b>3</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Then, the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>moves in a direction indicated by an arrow U shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, so that an abutting portion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>13</b> which is provided on the developing roller bearing <b>9</b><i>a </i>and is a second portion to be supported, and a force-receiving portion <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>5</b> which is provided on the first disk <b>104</b> and is a second surface contact each other.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, a boss (third portion to be supported) <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>12</b> is provided in the guide groove <b>104</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Then, the boss <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>12</b> contacts a third surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> which forms an acute angle between itself and the first surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> which are disposed opposed to each other, so that an attitude of the developing cartridge at one end is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">On the other hand, also on the other end side of the developing cartridge, the same supporting constitution as that on the above-described one end side, i.e., the support constitutions on both end sides have a bilaterally symmetrical constitution. On the other end sides of the developing cartridge shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an outer circumferential surface of a boss <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>10</b> which is a fourth portion to be supported contacts a fourth surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) which is a surface parallel to the line &#x3b1; connecting the center of the developing cartridge <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the center of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Further, a fifth portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) provided on the developing cartridge contacts a fifth surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) provided on the disk <b>103</b>. Further, a sixth portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) provided on the developing cartridge contacts a sixth surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> (surface present in the guide groove <b>103</b><i>a </i>by which the portion to be guided <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> is guided during the mounting of the developing device) provided on the disk <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Here, a corresponding relation among these constituent elements on one side and on the other side is summarized. The first portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>10</b> corresponds to the fourth portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>10</b>. The first surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> corresponds to the fourth surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>. The second portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>13</b> corresponds to the fifth portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>13</b>. The second surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>5</b> corresponds to the fifth surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>5</b>. The third portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>12</b> corresponds to the sixth portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>12</b>. The third surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> corresponds to the sixth surface <b>103</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. These corresponding constituent elements have the same functions on both end sides.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Incidentally, in this embodiment, a line of intersection of the first surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> and the third surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> is configured to be in parallel to the rotational axis of the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Further, as described above, the disks have the same constitution on both sides of the developing cartridge, so that the attitude of the developing cartridge on the other side relative to the disk <b>103</b> is determined by a similar constitution (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Incidentally, the second portion to be supported <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) and the second surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>5</b> are positioned on the above-described line &#x3b1; and the second surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>5</b> is perpendicular to the line &#x3b1;. This is because the second surface <b>104</b><i>a</i><b>5</b> permits the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>to efficiently receive the reaction force from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>and thus as described above, the developing cartridge is fixed between the disks.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">For that reason, in a state in which the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is positioned at the developing position, the guide groove <b>104</b><i>a </i>provided in the first disk <b>104</b> and the guide portion <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> provided on the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>create gaps (play) C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b> so that they do not contact each other. This is because the positioning of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>relative to the disk <b>104</b> is not prevented. Further, due to dimensional variation of respective parts of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the positions of the guide portion <b>9</b><i>a</i><b>11</b> on one end side and the guide portion <b>9</b><i>e</i><b>11</b> on the other end side are derived from each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in some cases. Even when such a developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>is set at a position which is not the developing position, guide portions <b>9</b><i>b</i><b>11</b> to <b>9</b><i>d</i><b>11</b> of the developing cartridges <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>d </i>are required to be set so as not to interfere with guide grooves <b>104</b><i>b </i>to <b>104</b><i>d</i>. That is, between the guide portions <b>9</b><i>b</i><b>11</b> to <b>9</b><i>d</i><b>11</b> of the developing cartridges, which are not located at the developing position, and the guide grooves <b>104</b><i>b </i>to <b>104</b><i>d</i>, gaps (play) are created at positions corresponding to the gaps C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b> of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a</i>. In this embodiment, a value of C<b>2</b>+C<b>3</b> is set at 0.4 mm. Further, a value of C<b>1</b>+C<b>4</b> is set at 0.6 mm. Incidentally, these values of the play may be appropriately set at proper values depending on the state of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the guide portions <b>9</b><i>b</i><b>11</b> to <b>9</b><i>d</i><b>11</b> can be freely moved in the guide grooves <b>104</b><i>b </i>to <b>104</b><i>d</i>. For that reason, the first disk <b>104</b> is prevented from being forcedly distorted by the developing cartridges <b>5</b><i>b </i>to <b>5</b><i>d </i>which are not located at the developing position. Incidentally, on the other end side, a similar state is created.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">That is, with respect to the developing cartridges which are not located at the developing position, the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> can independently perform an urging operation of each of the developing cartridges toward the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Therefore, it is possible to properly position only the above-described developing cartridge located at the developing position and to bring the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>into contact with the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>uniformly with respect to the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a</i>. As a result, only the developing cartridge located at the developing position is placed in a proper developing attitude. Thus, a force of the spring <b>108</b> is efficiently transmitted as a force for bringing the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the developing cartridge <b>5</b><i>a </i>into contact with the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the case where the gaps C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b> are set at extremely small values, the developing cartridges which are not located at the developing position connect the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> with no latitude. As a result, the disks <b>104</b> and <b>103</b> cannot be moved independently, so that the disks <b>104</b> and <b>103</b> forcedly distort the developing cartridge set at the developing position.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">As a result, the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is caused to contact the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a </i>while the position thereof is deviated, so that the developing roller <b>2</b><i>a </i>is partly spaced from the photosensitive drum <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Incidentally, in this embodiment, an example in which the gaps C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b> are created at both ends of the developing cartridges is shown but the gaps C<b>1</b> to C<b>4</b> may also be created at one of the ends depending on a setting method of the gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">By employing the above-described constitution, the first disk <b>104</b> and the second disk <b>103</b> can be independently supported movably relative to the electrophotographic photosensitive drum. For example, even when parallelism between the center axis of the shaft <b>101</b><i>b </i>and the center axis of the photosensitive drum is set with high accuracy, it is possible to prevent improper contact of the developing roller.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">While the invention has been described with reference to the structures disclosed herein, it is not confined to the details set forth and this application is intended to cover such modifications or changes as may come within the purpose of the improvements or the scope of the following claims.</p>
