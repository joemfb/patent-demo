<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to wireless communication systems and, more particularly, to a system and method for the simultaneous transmission of multiple streams of information or data in a multiple-input, multiple-output wireless communication system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An ever-increasing number of relatively inexpensive, low power wireless data communication services, networks and devices have been made available over the past number of years, promising near wire speed transmission and reliability. Various wireless technologies are described in detail in the 802.11 IEEE Standards, including for example, the IEEE Standard 802.11a (1999) and its updates and amendments, the IEEE Standard 802.11g (2003), and the IEEE Standard 802.11n that is now in the process of being adopted, all of which are collectively incorporated herein fully by reference. These standards have been or are in the process of being commercialized with the promise of 54 Mbps or more effective throughput, making them a strong competitor to traditional wired Ethernet and the more common &#x201c;802.11b&#x201d; or &#x201c;WiFi&#x201d; 11 Mbps mobile wireless transmission standard.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally speaking, transmission systems compliant with the IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g or &#x201c;802.11a/g&#x201d; as well as the 802.11n standards achieve their high data transmission rates using Orthogonal Frequency Division Modulation (OFDM) encoded symbols mapped up to a 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) multi-carrier constellation. In a general sense, the use of OFDM divides the overall system bandwidth into a number of frequency sub-bands or channels, with each frequency sub-band being associated with a respective sub-carrier upon which data may be modulated. Thus, each frequency sub-band of the OFDM system may be viewed as an independent transmission channel within which to send data, thereby increasing the overall throughput or transmission rate of the communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Transmitters used in the wireless communication systems that are compliant with the aforementioned 802.11a/802.11g/802.11n standards as well as other standards such as the 802.16a IEEE Standard, typically perform multi-carrier OFDM symbol encoding (which may include error correction encoding and interleaving), convert the encoded symbols into the time domain using Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) techniques, and perform digital to analog conversion and conventional radio frequency (RF) upconversion on the signals. These transmitters then transmit the modulated and upconverted signals after appropriate power amplification to one or more receivers, resulting in a relatively high-speed time domain signal with a large peak-to-average ratio (PAR).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Likewise, the receivers used in the wireless communication systems that are compliant with the aforementioned 802.11a/802.11g/802.11n and 802.16a IEEE standards typically include an RF receiving unit that performs RF downconversion and filtering of the received signals (which may be performed in one or more stages), and a baseband processor unit that processes the OFDM encoded symbols bearing the data of interest. The digital form of each OFDM symbol presented in the frequency domain is recovered after baseband downconverting, conventional analog to digital conversion and Fast Fourier Transformation of the received time domain signal. Thereafter, the baseband processor performs demodulation and frequency domain equalization (FEQ) to recover the transmitted symbols, and these symbols are then processed with an appropriate FEC decoder, e.g. a Viterbi decoder, to estimate or determine the most likely identity of the transmitted symbol. The recovered and recognized stream of symbols is then decoded, which may include deinterleaving and error correction using any of a number of known error correction techniques, to produce a set of recovered signals corresponding to the original signals transmitted by the transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In wireless communication systems, the RF modulated signals generated by the transmitter may reach a particular receiver via a number of different propagation paths, the characteristics of which typically change over time due to the phenomena of multi-path and fading. Moreover, the characteristics of a propagation channel differ or vary based on the frequency of propagation. To compensate for the time varying, frequency selective nature of the propagation effects, and generally to enhance effective encoding and modulation in a wireless communication system, each receiver of the wireless communication system may periodically develop or collect channel state information (CSI) for each of the frequency channels, such as the channels associated with each of the OFDM sub-bands discussed above. Generally speaking, CSI is information describing one or more characteristics of each of the OFDM channels (for example, the gain, the phase and the SNR of each channel). Upon determining the CSI for one or more channels, the receiver may send this CSI back to the transmitter, which may use the CSI for each channel to precondition the signals transmitted using that channel so as to compensate for the varying propagation effects of each of the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To further increase the number of signals which may be propagated in the communication system and/or to compensate for deleterious effects associated with the various propagation paths, and to thereby improve transmission performance, it is known to use multiple transmission and receive antennas within a wireless transmission system. Such a system is commonly referred to as a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) wireless transmission system and is specifically provided for within the 802.11n IEEE Standard now being adopted. As is known, the use of MIMO technology produces significant increases in spectral efficiency, throughput and link reliability, and these benefits generally increase as the number of transmission and receive antennas within the MIMO system increases.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, in addition to the frequency channels created by the use of OFDM, a MIMO channel formed by the various transmission and receive antennas between a particular transmitter and a particular receiver includes a number of independent spatial channels. As is known, a wireless MIMO communication system can provide improved performance (e.g., increased transmission capacity) by utilizing the additional dimensionalities created by these spatial channels for the transmission of additional data. Of course, the spatial channels of a wideband MIMO system may experience different channel conditions (e.g., different fading and multi-path effects) across the overall system bandwidth and may therefore achieve different SNRs at different frequencies (i.e., at the different OFDM frequency sub-bands) of the overall system bandwidth. Consequently, the number of information bits per modulation symbol (i.e., the data rate) that may be transmitted using the different frequency sub-bands of each spatial channel for a particular level of performance may differ from frequency sub-band to frequency sub-band.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Typically, data is transmitted along one or more receive chains at the receiver and one or more transmitting chains at the transmitter. The data streams in the chain-to-chain transmission are transmitted via a channel matrix, which is described as the full MIMO channel between the transmission and receiving antennas. Where the number of receive chains is less than the number of receiving antennas and/or the number of transmit chains is less than the number of transmission antennas, the actual channel matrix used for transmitting the data streams is a sub-matrix of the full-dimensional channel matrix. Because the channel coefficients corresponding to the different antennas are different, it is important to select the appropriate antennas to transmit and/or receive the transmission. There are many known techniques for antenna selection and training, which are typically conducted based on an estimation of the channel sub-matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When mapping encoded spatial data streams to the transmit chains, a full-dimensional channel spatial spreading matrix is applied, and antenna selection is based on the full-dimensional channel spatial spreading matrix. The value for the full-dimensional channel spatial spreading matrix is typically standardized or otherwise known to both the transmitter and receiver. However, there are instances in which the actual data transmission of encoded spatial data streams includes a number of spatial data streams that is less than the number of transmit chains. Because it is desirable to transmit all signals from all available transmit chains in order to maximize the channel gain, the spatial mapping of the spatial data streams to the transmit chains is performed by applying a spatial spreading matrix before transmitting the data and after antenna selection, rather than applying the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix. That is, the spatial spreading matrix that maps the spatial data streams to the transmit chains is different from, and generally smaller than, the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Consequently, antenna selection during training is based on the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, whereas the actual operation of transmitting the spatial data streams is based on the spatial spreading matrix. The spatial spreading matrix is known only to the transmitter, and not to the receiver which bases its antenna selection on the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix. Neither the transmitter nor the receiver account for the spatial spreading matrix when the encoded spatial data streams includes a number of spatial data streams that is less than the number of transmit chains. As a result, without accounting for the spatial spreading matrix at the transmitter, antenna selection computation is not accurate. It is therefore desirable to account for the spatial spreading matrix when selecting antennas for transmitting and/or receiving the data transmissions.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">While the transmission techniques described herein for processing and effecting a wireless data transmission are described as being used in communication systems that use one of the IEEE Standard 802.11(x) communication standards, these techniques may be used in various other types of wireless communication systems and are not limited to those conforming to one or more of the IEEE Standard 802.11(x) standards.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a MIMO communication system <b>10</b> is illustrated in block diagram form as generally including a single transmitter <b>12</b> having multiple transmission antennas (or antenna elements) <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N and a single receiver <b>16</b> having multiple receiver antennas (or antenna elements) <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M. The number of transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N can be the same as, more than, or less than the number of receiver antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transmitter <b>12</b> may include a controller <b>20</b> coupled to a memory <b>21</b>, to a symbol encoder and modulator unit <b>22</b> and to a spatial spreading block <b>24</b>. The transmitter <b>12</b> may also include a matrix equalizer <b>25</b> and a symbol demodulator and decoder unit <b>26</b> to perform demodulation and decoding of signals received via the antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N in a receive mode. Additionally, in some instances, the transmitter <b>12</b> may include a spreading matrix calculation unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The controller <b>12</b> may be any desired type of controller and the controller <b>12</b> and the spreading matrix calculation unit <b>28</b> may be implemented as one or more standard multi-purpose, programmable processors, such as micro-processors, as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc., or may be implemented using any other desired types of hardware, software and/or firmware. Likewise, the spatial spreading block <b>24</b>, and the matrix equalizer <b>25</b> may be implemented using known or standard hardware and/or software elements. If desired, various of the transmitter components, such as the controller <b>20</b>, the modulator unit <b>22</b>, the demodulator unit <b>26</b>, the spreading matrix calculation unit <b>28</b>, the spatial spreading block <b>24</b> and the matrix equalizer <b>25</b> may be implemented in the same or in different hardware devices, such as in the same or different processors. Additionally, each of these components of the transmitter <b>12</b> may be disposed in a housing <b>31</b> (shown in dotted relief in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the routines or instructions for implementing the functionality of any of these components may be stored in the memory <b>21</b> or within other memory devices associated with the individual hardware used to implement these components.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Likewise, if desired, one or more pre-calculated or predetermined spatial spreading matrices may be stored in the memory <b>21</b> and used in the spatial spreading matrix block <b>24</b> at various times or under various different conditions. Thus, for example, a different pre-calculated or predetermined spatial spreading matrix may be stored for each of a number of possible combinations of encoded spatial streams of data to be transmitted and transmission antennas <b>14</b> to be used to simultaneously transmit these encoded spatial streams of data. Thus, for example, a different spatial spreading matrix may be calculated and stored for two spatial streams of data being sent via three of the transmission antennas <b>14</b>, for two spatial streams of data being sent via four of the transmission antennas <b>14</b>, for three spatial streams of data being sent via five transmission antennas <b>14</b>, etc. In this manner, the communication system <b>10</b> may optimally send different numbers of spatial streams of data at different times, depending on the load of the system. Moreover, the communication system <b>10</b> may also use these various different pre-stored or pre-calculated spatial spreading matrices to account for or to adapt to the loss of one or more of the transmission antennas <b>14</b> to be used in sending data within the communication system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During operation, information signals T<sub>x1</sub>-T<sub>xn </sub>which are to be transmitted from the transmitter <b>12</b> to the receiver <b>16</b> are provided to the symbol encoder and modulator unit <b>22</b> for encoding and modulation. Of course, any desired number of signals T<sub>x1</sub>-T<sub>xn </sub>may be provided to the modulator unit <b>22</b>, with this number generally being limited by the modulation scheme used by and the bandwidth associated with the MIMO communication system <b>10</b>. Additionally, the signals T<sub>x1</sub>-T<sub>xn </sub>may be any type of signals, including analog or digital signals, and may represent any desired type of data or information. Additionally, if desired, a known test or control signal C<sub>x1 </sub>(which may be stored in the memory <b>21</b>) may be provided to the symbol encoder and modulator unit <b>22</b> for use in determining CSI related information describing the characteristics of the channel(s) between the transmitter <b>12</b> and the receiver <b>16</b>. If desired, the same control signal or a different control signal may be used to determine the CSI for each frequency and/or spatial channel used in the MIMO communication system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The symbol encoder and modulator unit <b>22</b> may interleave digital representations of the various signals T<sub>x1</sub>-T<sub>xn </sub>and C<sub>x1 </sub>and may perform any other known type(s) of error-correction encoding on the signals T<sub>x1</sub>-T<sub>xn </sub>and C<sub>x1 </sub>to produce one or more encoded streams of symbols SS<sub>1</sub>, SS<sub>2</sub>, . . .

While the symbol streams SS<sub>1</sub>-SS<sub>p </sub>may be modulated using any desired or suitable QAM technique, such as using 64 QAM, these symbols may be modulated in any other known or desired manner including, for example, using any other desired phase and/or frequency modulation techniques. In any event, the modulated encoded symbol streams SS<sub>1</sub>-SS<sub>p </sub>are provided by the symbol encoder and modulator unit <b>22</b> to the spatial spreading block <b>24</b> for processing before being transmitted via the antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N. While not specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the modulated symbol streams SS<sub>1</sub>-SS<sub>p </sub>may be processed by the spatial spreading block <b>24</b> that implements a spatial spreading matrix in accordance with a transmission technique more specifically described below, before being up-converted to the RF carrier frequencies associated with an OFDM technique (in one or more stages). Upon receiving the modulated signals, the spatial spreading block <b>24</b> processes the modulated signals by injecting delays and/or gains into the modulated signals based on a spatial spreading matrix which may be calculated by the spreading matrix calculation unit <b>28</b>, and provided by, for example, the controller <b>12</b>, to thereby perform mixing and transmission of the spatial streams of data across the transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N and across the transmission chains.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The signals transmitted by the transmitter <b>12</b> are received by the receiver antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M and may be processed by a matrix equalizer <b>35</b> within the receiver <b>16</b> to enhance the reception capabilities of the antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M. As will be understood, the processing applied at the receiver <b>16</b> (as well as at the transmitter <b>12</b>) may be based on, for example, the CSI developed by the receiver <b>16</b> in response to the transmission of the test or control signal C<sub>x1</sub>. In particular, a controller <b>40</b> or other unit within the receiver <b>16</b>, such as a channel determination unit <b>39</b>, may process the received control signal C<sub>x1 </sub>and develop therefrom a measured description of the forward channel between the transmitter <b>12</b> and the receiver <b>16</b> by determining or characterizing the propagation effects of the forward channel on the signal C<sub>x1 </sub>as it traveled through the forward channel. In any event, a symbol demodulator and decoder unit <b>36</b>, under control of the controller <b>40</b>, may decode and demodulate the received symbol strings SS<sub>1</sub>-SS<sub>p </sub>as recovered by the matrix equalizer <b>35</b>. In this process, these signals may be downconverted to baseband. Generally, the demodulator and decoder unit <b>36</b> may operate to remove effects of the forward channel based on the CSI as well as to perform demodulation on the received symbols in each symbol stream SS<sub>1</sub>-SS<sub>p </sub>to produce a digital bit stream for each stream. In some cases, if desired, the symbol demodulator and decoder unit <b>36</b> may perform error correction decoding and deinterleaving on the bit stream to produce the received signals R<sub>x1</sub>-R<sub>xn </sub>corresponding to the originally transmitted signals T<sub>x1</sub>-T<sub>xn</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the receiver <b>16</b> may also include a memory <b>41</b> and a symbol encoder and modulator unit <b>46</b> which may receive one or more signals T<sub>R1</sub>-T<sub>Rm </sub>encoded and modulated using any desired encoding and modulation techniques. The receiver <b>16</b> may also provide one or more known test or control signals C<sub>R1 </sub>to the symbol encoder/modulator unit <b>46</b> to be sent to the transmitter <b>12</b> to enable the transmitter <b>12</b> to determine a measured description of the reverse channel between the receiver <b>16</b> and the transmitter <b>12</b>. The encoded and modulated symbol stream may then be upconverted and processed by a spatial spreading block <b>34</b> which may use a spatial spreading matrix developed according to the principles described herein based on the number of symbol streams to be sent simultaneously, the number of receiver and/or transmitter chains to be used, and the number of transmission antennas <b>18</b> to be used. The output of the spatial spreading block <b>34</b> is then transmitted via the receiver antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>N to, for example, the transmitter <b>12</b>, thereby implementing the reverse link. By implementing the reverse link, the receiver <b>16</b> is able to compute not only receiving antenna selection (Rx ASEL), but also transmission antenna selection (Tx ASEL) or joint transmission/receiving antenna selection (TX/Rx ASEL). For Tx ASEL and/or Tx/Rx ASEL operations, the receiver <b>16</b> may either feed back the channel state information or compute antenna selection and feed back the selected antenna information in a subsequent transmit opportunity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the receiver components may be disposed in a housing <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The matrix equalizer <b>25</b> and the demodulator/decoder unit <b>26</b> within the transmitter <b>12</b> operate similarly to the matrix equalizer <b>35</b> and the demodulator/decoder unit <b>36</b> of the receiver <b>16</b> to demodulate and decode the symbol streams transmitted by the receiver <b>16</b> to produce the recovered signals R<sub>R1</sub>-R<sub>Rm</sub>.

Of course, the CSI or other measured description of the forward channel for the various OFDM channel(s) may be used to process or decode the received signals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As indicated above, it is desirable to account for the spatial spreading matrix when selecting antennas for transmitting and/or receiving the data transmissions. Typically, when transmitting data between one or more of the transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N and one or more of the receiving antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M in a MIMO transmission system <b>10</b>, the data is transmitted along one or more receive chains at the receiver, N<sub>R</sub>, and one or more transmitting chains at the transmitter, N<sub>T</sub>. In a MIMO-OFDM system, this could be a channel on one subcarrier of the system. Whether in a MIMO or MIMO-OFDM system, or any of number of other types of systems utilizing antenna selection and encoded spatial data streams for that matter, the data streams in the chain-to-chain transmission go through a channel matrix, H. The channel matrix, H, is defined as the full MIMO channel between the transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N and the receiving channels <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M (i.e., a full-dimensional channel matrix) which describes the full-dimensions of the channel between the stations <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>. As such, the channel matrix, H, has a row dimension corresponding to the number of receiving antennas, M<sub>R</sub>, and a column dimension corresponding to the number of transmission antennas, M<sub>T</sub>, thereby creating an M<sub>R</sub>&#xd7;M<sub>T </sub>matrix. Although referred to herein as the channel matrix, H, it should be understood that the transmitter <b>12</b> and receiver <b>16</b> may actually use an estimate of the channel matrix, H, based on, for example, sounding information and/or the CSI. Accordingly, as used herein, it should be understood that the channel matrix, H, as used by the transmitter <b>12</b> and receiver <b>16</b> may be an estimate of the channel matrix, H, as sometimes referred to herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Where the number of receive chains, N<sub>R</sub>, is less than the number of receiving antennas, M<sub>R</sub>, and/or the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, is less than the number of transmission antennas, M<sub>T</sub>, the actual matrix channel is a sub-matrix, H<sub>S</sub>, of the full-dimensional channel matrix, H. Because the channel coefficients corresponding to the different antennas are different, it is important to select the appropriate antennas to transmit and/or receive the transmission. As indicated above, when the number of antennas are larger than the number of chains, the antenna selection is artificial when appropriate antenna selection is not used. Selection of appropriate or most optimal antenna subsets of the available antennas allows for the selection of a subset of available antennas matched to the number of chains, thereby achieving high channel gain. Transmission from the transmitter <b>12</b> (Station A) to the receiver <b>16</b> (Station B) can be modeled as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>y=H</i><sub>S</sub><i>x+n</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equ. 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where y and n are the received signal vector and additive noise vector at Station B, respectively; H<sub>S </sub>is the channel matrix from Station A to Station B, which is a sub-matrix of the full-size channel matrix, H, between Station A and Station B; and x is the signal vector to be transmitted from Station A.
</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Antenna selection is conducted based on an estimation of the sub-matrix H<sub>S</sub>. For example, the transmitter <b>12</b> (Station A) determines an estimation of H<sub>S </sub>based on an estimate of the channel from the receiver <b>16</b> (Station B) to Station A, or vice versa. In particular, transmission antenna selection (TX ASEL) is conducted if the number of transmission antennas, M<sub>T</sub>, is greater than the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the number of receiving antennas, M<sub>R</sub>, is equal to the number of receiving chains, N<sub>R</sub>. On the other hand, receiving antenna selection (RX ASEL) is conducted if the number of receiving antennas, M<sub>R</sub>, is greater than the number of receiving chains, N<sub>R</sub>, and the number of transmission antennas, M<sub>T</sub>, is equal to the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>. Of course, if both the number of transmission antennas, M<sub>T</sub>, is greater than the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the number of receiving antennas, M<sub>R</sub>, is greater than the number of receiving chains, N<sub>R</sub>, then joint transmitting and receiving antenna selection is conducted (TX/RX ASEL). As is known, for TX ASEL, the antenna selection computation may be directly conducted at the transmitter <b>12</b> or the receiver <b>16</b>, whereas for RX ASEL, the antenna selection computation is conducted at the receiver <b>16</b>. As is also known, for joint TX/RX ASEL, the antenna selection may be conducted as the receiver <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Regardless of the antenna selection computation (i.e., whether it is TX ASEL, RX ASEL and/or TX/RX ASEL), in order to achieve the desired full channel gain, it is important to know the full-dimensional channel matrix, H. In particular, based on the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, antenna selection may be conducted by selecting the optimal columns and rows from the full-dimensional channel matrix, H. As is known, this may be done based on certain optical criterion, such as channel capacity, substream signal-to-noise ratio, etc. The optimal columns and rows may be selected by conducting antenna selection training, where channel sounding information is send over different antenna subsets using antenna switching. That is, channel sounding information is sent over different subsets of the transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N, where the switch (not shown) switches between the subsets of transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N. Likewise, the sounding information is received over different subsets of the receiving antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M, where the switch (not shown) switches between the subsets of the receiving antennas <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>M. For example, in selecting transmission antennas <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>N where M<sub>T</sub>=2N<sub>T</sub>, the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, is equal to the set [H<b>1</b> H<b>2</b>], where H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> are the sub-channels with a number of transmission antennas equal to the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T </sub>(e.g., H<b>1</b> is the channel from the first N<sub>T </sub>transmission antennas, and H<b>2</b> is the channel from the second N<sub>T </sub>transmission antennas). An example of antenna switching is described in the 802.11n standard and need not be described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When mapping the one or more encoded spatial data streams of symbols SS<sub>1</sub>, SS<sub>2</sub>, . . .

An example of the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, is defined in the IEEE 802.11n standard.
</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order for Station B to know the chain-to-chain channels, Station B removes Q and is able to derive H. For example, if the full-dimensional channel spatial spreading matrix Q is an orthogonal matrix, Station B may derive H by applying the transpose conjugate of the matrix, Q, (i.e., Q<sup>H</sup>), such that in the above example:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>H=[H</i>1<i>&#x2032;Q</i><sup>H</sup><i>,H</i>2<i>&#x2032;Q</i><sup>H</sup>]&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equ. 3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally speaking, the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, is known by the transmitter <b>12</b> (Station A) when conducting antenna selection, because the transmitter applies the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, to the transmission in order to map the encoded spatial data streams to the transmit chains. However, because Q also needs to be known by the receiver <b>16</b> (Station B) in order to estimate the sub-matrix channel, H<sub>S</sub>, Q is predefined, so that the receiver <b>16</b> may remove the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, and derive an estimate of the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, and, in turn, derive the sub-matrix channel, H<sub>S</sub>, based on previous antenna selection training. That is, Station B is able to determine an estimation of H<sub>S </sub>based on an estimate of the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, from Station A to Station B.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">However, as also indicated above, in actual data transmission of encoded spatial data streams, the number of spatial data streams, N<sub>SS</sub>, may be less than the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, because it is desirable to transmit all signals from all available transmit chains in order to maximize the channel gain. In such a case, the spatial mapping of the spatial data streams to the transmit chains is performed by applying a spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, before transmitting the data and after antenna selection, rather than applying the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q. The spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, has a row dimension corresponding to the number of transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and a column dimension corresponding to the number of spatial data streams, N<sub>SS</sub>, thereby creating an N<sub>T</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>SS </sub>matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Consequently, antenna selection during training is based on the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, whereas the actual operation of transmitting the spatial data streams is based on the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>. While Q<sub>d </sub>may be any arbitrary matrix designed by, and therefore known to, the transmitter <b>12</b>, Q<sub>d </sub>is unknown to the receiver <b>16</b>, which bases its antenna selection on the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q. As a result, without knowledge of Q<sub>d</sub>, the previously performed antenna selection computation is not accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Typically, Q<sub>d </sub>is not an identity matrix, because in the above case some of the N<sub>T</sub>-N<sub>SS </sub>transmit chains will be switched off and the transmission power level will be reduced. That is, the N<sub>T </sub>transmit chains are connected by the previously selected transmission antennas. If Q<sub>d </sub>is an identify matrix, then Q<sub>d </sub>does not need to be known and is essentially equal to nothing. Further, Q<sub>d </sub>is applicable when the number of spatial data streams, N<sub>ss </sub>is less than the minimum of the transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the receiving chains, N<sub>R </sub>(i.e., N<sub>SS</sub>&#x3c;min(N<sub>T</sub>, N<sub>R</sub>)). If the number of spatial data streams is equal to the minimum of the transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the receiving chains, N<sub>R </sub>(i.e., N<sub>SS</sub>=min(N<sub>T</sub>, N<sub>R</sub>)), then the number of spatial data streams is equal to the upper limits of the MIMO channel, because the number of spatial data streams reaches the saturation point of the actual matrix channel, H<sub>S</sub>, which is an N<sub>R</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>T </sub>matrix. That is, in such a channel matrix, the maximum number of spatial data streams that can be transmitted is the minimum of N<sub>T</sub>, N<sub>R</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to obtain accurate antenna selection computation when the number of spatial data streams, N<sub>SS</sub>, is less than the minimum of the transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the receiving chains, N<sub>R</sub>, the spatial mapping matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, used to map the spatial data streams to the transmit chains is used for antenna selection training at the transmitter <b>12</b> and/or receiver <b>16</b>. That is, antenna selection computation accounts for Q<sub>d</sub>. Further, in order for the receiver <b>16</b> to accurately select receiving antennas, Q<sub>d </sub>is predefined and known by the receiver <b>16</b>. In one example described further below, Q<sub>d </sub>may be predefined as part of the wireless protocol utilized by the transmitter <b>12</b> and receiver <b>16</b>, such as the 802.11n standard or subsequent 802.11(x) standards.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When computing the antenna selection based on the spatial mapping matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, it is assumed that the station (Station A or B) conducting the antenna selection computation knows that Q<sub>d </sub>will be applied at the transmitter <b>12</b>, in which case the station also knows the number of spatial data streams, N<sub>SS</sub>. As indicated above, if the number of spatial data streams is equal to the minimum of the transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the receiving chains, N<sub>R</sub>, then antenna selection may be conducted using conventional techniques. The antenna selection example described below is based on the situation where the number of spatial data streams is less than the minimum of the transmit chains, N<sub>T</sub>, and the receiving chains, N<sub>R</sub>, in which case the antenna selection accounts for the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Beginning with the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, the station conducting the antenna selection searches over all different combinations of sub-matrices, H<sub>S</sub>, of size N<sub>R</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>T </sub>within the full-dimensional channel matrix, H.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Optionally, each of the sub-matrices may be right-multiplied by the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, to form channel estimation sub-matrices corresponding to each of the sub-matrices H<b>1</b>-Hk. For example, the channel estimation sub-matrices may be denoted as:

<br/>
However, when antenna selection channel training is over all possible sub-matrices of the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, and when the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, is the first set of columns in the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, corresponding to the number of spatial data streams, N<sub>SS</sub>, (i.e., the first N<sub>SS </sub>columns of Q), then right-multiplying with Q<sub>d </sub>is not needed in order to determine the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, and antenna selection computation may be conducted directly.
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Whether or not each sub-matrix is multiplied by Q<sub>d</sub>, the best channel sub-matrix is selected based on certain criteria, such as a set of optimality criterion (e.g., channel capacity, substream signal-to-noise ratio, etc.) which may be the same as that used to determine the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, as indicated above.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one example, selecting one of the channel estimation sub-matrices, H<b>1</b>&#x2032;-Hk&#x2032; may include developing a steering matrix for each channel estimation sub-matrix and applying each steering matrix to the corresponding channel estimation sub-matrix. Once the steering matrix has been applied, the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, is applied to each channel estimation sub-matrix. In particular with transmitter antenna selection computation, the transmitter should apply advanced schemes, such as beamforming and steering matrix application, before applying the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, to each channel estimation sub-matrix. This is because the nature of such schemes tend to change the spatial mapping, and when the transmitter changes the spatial mapping (i.e., changes Q<sub>d</sub>), antenna selection performance gain may suffer due to the previous antenna selection results no longer being accurate or applicable to the new Q<sub>d</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once the spatial spreading matrix has been applied to each channel sub-matrix, the test signals are transmitted from Station A to Station B using the test steering matrices and the spatial spreading matrix. From these transmissions, a quality factor may be determined for each of the test signals and returned back from the receiver <b>16</b> to the transmitter <b>12</b>. Using the quality factors, the optimal channel estimation sub-matrix may be selected, and the antennas corresponding to the selected channel estimation sub-matrix may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As a result of the above antenna selection computation, all possible sub-matrices within the full-dimensional channel matrix, H, are trained.

As will be understood, there may be different ways to account for Q<sub>d </sub>during antenna selection computation, of which the above is only an example. As will also be understood, the above antenna selection computation may be applied to transmission antenna selection at the transmitter <b>12</b>, transmission antenna selection at the receiver <b>16</b>, receiver antenna selection as the receiver <b>16</b> and joint transmission/receiving antenna selection at either the transmitter <b>12</b> or receiver <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As indicated above, antenna selection computation may always be conducted at the transmitter <b>12</b> with the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, known, given that the transmitter <b>12</b> applies the spatial spreading matrix to map the spatial data streams to the transmit chains.

An additional factor in achieving the best performance has the transmitter <b>12</b> applying the first N<sub>SS </sub>column in the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q for spatial mapping (i.e., Q<sub>d</sub>) for data transmission after antenna selection switching.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Some example antenna selection computations and the results thereof using spatial spreading matrices derived from the above-described techniques are provided below for a 4&#xd7;2 chain system used to simultaneously send one spatial stream (four receive chains and two transmit chains in a 4&#xd7;4 antenna system), a 4&#xd7;3 chain system used to simultaneously send two spatial streams (four receive chains and three transmit chains in a 4&#xd7;4 antenna system), a 4&#xd7;3 chain system used to simultaneously send three spatial streams (four receive chains and three transmit chains in a 4&#xd7;4 antenna system), 2&#xd7;2 chain system used to simultaneously send one spatial stream (two receive chains and two transmit chains in a 4&#xd7;2 antenna system), and a 3&#xd7;3 chain system used to simultaneously send two spatial streams (three receive chains and three transmit chains in a 4&#xd7;3 antenna system), all with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20 dB, a Rayleigh fading channel and 10000 simulated samples. In corresponding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref>, the channel strengths or channel capacity (as indicated) of the equivalent channel estimation matrix are plotted with respect to the cumulative density function (CDF) of the post-processing channel gain at the receiver corresponding to different antenna selection strategies. Channel capacity is plotted in some instances, because channel capacity is a better indicator of quality than channel strength. The probability that y is smaller than x is provided as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i><sub>y</sub>(<i>x</i>)=<i>Pr[y&#x2266;x]</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(Equ. 6)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where y is a random variable. The CDF curves on the right of the plots shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> imply a higher possible realization of the random variable (i.e., higher post-processing channel gain). In the examples, the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, is orthogonal for purposes of the examples only. In particular, an orthogonal matrix is easy to remove by multiplying the transpose conjugate of the matrix to obtain the identity matrix, rather than performing matrix inversion, though it should be understood that the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, need not be orthogonal in all instances.

With N<sub>SS</sub>=3, N<sub>SS</sub>=min(N<sub>T</sub>, N<sub>R</sub>), so Q<sub>d</sub>=Q, because the number of spatial data streams is equal to the upper limit of the MIMO channel. That is, the actual MIMO channel after antenna selection is 3&#xd7;4, so the most spatial data streams that can be transmitted is three. As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, no antenna selection results in the least amount of gain, whereas antenna selection based on the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, and full-dimensional channel matrix, H, has the same performance as the most optimal antenna selection based on the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, and the channel sub-matrix, H<sub>S</sub>, because Q=Q<sub>d</sub>.

As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, once again no antenna selection results in the least amount of gain, antenna selection based on the full-dimensional spatial spreading matrix, Q, and full-dimensional channel matrix, H, has a limited gain, and the most optimal antenna selection based on the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, and the channel sub-matrix, H<sub>S</sub>, results in the best gain.
</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As will be understood, the manner in which the spatial spreading matrix, Q<sub>d</sub>, is calculated or determined is not particularly important. Thus, any mathematical, heuristic, iterative, or trial and error method can be used to actually determine or compute any particular size of spatial spreading matrix, and the method used to compute a spatial spreading matrix is not determinative. Moreover, the specific orientation or definition of the &#x201c;row&#x201d; and &#x201c;column&#x201d; dimensions of a matrix as used herein is arbitrary and is simply based on convention, and therefore may be changed. Thus, for example, the row dimension can be a horizontal dimension with the column dimension being a vertical dimension (as assumed herein), or the row dimension can be a vertical dimension with the column dimension being a horizontal dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Moreover, it will be understood that the actual spatial spreading matrix equations, e.g., the computation of a particular spatial spreading matrix that satisfies the constraints defined above, may be performed at any desired location within the wireless communication system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, including within the controller <b>20</b> or other hardware, software, or firmware of the transmitter <b>12</b>, as well as within the controller <b>40</b> or other hardware, software, or firmware of the receiver <b>16</b>. Alternatively, the spatial spreading matrix may be pre-computed and stored in the memory <b>21</b> (or <b>41</b>) or other memory of the system <b>10</b> prior to the transmission system being used. The spatial spreading matrix or matrices may also be computed or determine by a different device and may be sent to the transmitter <b>12</b> or the receiver <b>14</b> of the transmission system <b>10</b> at any desired time.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Of course, the spatial spreading matrix technique described herein is not limited to being used in a transmitter of a MIMO communication system communicating with a single receiver of the MIMO communication system, but can additionally be applied when a transmitter of a MIMO communication system is communicating with multiple receivers, each of which has one or more receiver antennas associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">While the spatial spreading matrix calculations described herein are described in one example as being implemented in software stored in, for example, one of the memories <b>21</b>, <b>41</b> and implemented on a processor associated with one of the controllers <b>20</b>, <b>40</b>, or with the spatial spreading matrix calculation unit <b>28</b> of the MIMO communication system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, these routines may alternatively or additionally be implemented in digital or analog hardware, firmware, application specific integrated circuits, etc., as desired. If implemented in software, the routines may be stored in any computer readable memory such as in RAM, ROM, flash memory, a magnetic disk, a laser disk, or other storage medium. Likewise, this software may be delivered to a MIMO system device (such as a transmitter or a receiver) via any known or desired delivery method including, for example, over a communication channel such as a telephone line, the Internet, a wireless connection, etc., or via a transportable medium, such as a computer-readable disk, flash drive, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The above antenna selection and training techniques may be embodied in any type of wireless communication system including, for example, ones used in wireless computer systems such as those implemented via a local area network or a wide area network, internet, cable and satellite based communication systems (such as internet, data, video and voice communication systems), wireless telephone systems (including cellular phone systems, voice over internet protocol (VoIP) systems, home-based wireless telephone systems, etc.) Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3H</figref>, various exemplary implementations of the antenna selection and training techniques are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the antenna selection and training techniques may be used with a hard disk drive <b>400</b> which includes both signal processing and/or control circuits, which are generally identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> at <b>402</b>.
