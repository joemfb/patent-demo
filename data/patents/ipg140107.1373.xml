<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-285078, filed on Dec. 21, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments discussed herein are related to a frame-attached anti-reflection glass and a method of manufacturing the same. Such a frame-attached anti-reflection glass can be preferably used, for example, as a cap for sealing an optical device such as a light emitting element or the like mounted on a substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As one form of a cap for optical device, there is a structure obtained by joining a silicon to a borosilicate glass by anodic bonding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates an example of the structure, in which a frame-shaped member <b>18</b> made of silicon is joined to a peripheral portion on one surface of a plate-shaped borosilicate glass <b>13</b>. Reference numeral <b>20</b> denotes an optical device (light emitting element in the illustrated example) disposed in a cavity formed by the plate-shaped member (borosilicate glass) <b>13</b> and the frame-shaped member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the art related to sealing of such an optical device, for example, there is known a light emitting device described in Patent document 1 (Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2009-170723). As another related art, there is known a semiconductor device described in Patent document 2 (Japanese National Publication of International Patent Application No. 2008-0238241)</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in the configuration of the cap <b>10</b><i>a </i>for optical device according to the state of the art, the interfaces of the borosilicate glass (plate-shaped member) <b>13</b> and the silicon (frame-shaped member) <b>18</b> are covalent bonded by anodic bonding. Accordingly, the joined portion of the glass <b>13</b> and the silicon <b>18</b> is optically transparent. As a result, problems arise in that unnecessary reflection of light occurs at a portion of the glass on the joined portion and thus the optical characteristics are deteriorated. The particular of the problems will be explained in connection with the embodiments as described later.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a frame-attached anti-reflection glass including a plate-shaped member including an anti-reflection film formed on at least one surface of a plate-shaped glass, and a frame-shaped member made of silicon joined to a peripheral portion on one surface side of the plate-shaped member, wherein the anti-reflection film includes two partial films having different compositions, one of the two partial films being a light-absorbent film, and wherein the two partial films are continuously formed on at least one surface of the plate-shaped glass, and respective surfaces of each partial film are on a level with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a frame-attached anti-reflection glass, including preparing a plate-shaped member including an anti-reflection film formed on one surface of a plate-shaped glass, and a frame-shaped member made of silicon, superposing the frame-shaped member on a surface of the plate-shaped member on a side on which the plate-shaped glass is formed, and joining the plate-shaped glass and the frame-shaped member together by anodic bonding with an application of bias voltage, while forming a light-absorbent film in a portion of the anti-reflection film corresponding to a position of the frame-shaped member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combination particularly pointed out in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates in a cross-sectional view, a configuration of a cap for optical device as the frame-attached anti-reflection glass according to a first embodiment. The cap for optical device according to the embodiment is used to seal an optical device such as a light emitting element or the like mounted on a substrate as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cap <b>10</b> for optical device of the embodiment has a concave structure when viewed in a vertical cross section as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, the cap <b>10</b> has a structure in which a frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is joined to a peripheral portion on one surface side of a plate-shaped member <b>12</b>. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the shape of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b> when viewed in plan from the upper direction thereof is, for example, a square shape. In this case, the frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is formed in a square ring shape so as to match the outer shape of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b>. It is of course that the shape of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b> when viewed in plan from the upper direction thereof is not restricted to a square shape. For example, the shape of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b> may be a circular shape. In this case, the frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is formed in a circular ring shape so as to match the outer shape of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b>. Moreover, the square or circular ring is not necessarily closed in a loop, and may be a partially-opened discontinuous shape. A cavity CV of rectangular parallelepiped shape is formed by the plate-shaped member <b>12</b> and the frame-shaped member <b>18</b>, and an optical device is housed in the cavity CV.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The plate-shaped member <b>12</b> is made of a material which can transmit light therethrough, and has a structure in which a film <b>14</b> having a function of preventing reflection of light (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;anti-reflection film&#x201d;) is formed on one surface of a borosilicate glass <b>13</b> (on the surface opposite to the surface to which the frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is joined). Borosilicate glass is one obtained by mixing boric acid with silicon dioxide which is the main component of a glass, and the embodiment uses the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> which contains at least sodium (Na) or lithium (Li). In the description below, the one surface of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> which is in contact with the frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;first surface S<b>1</b>&#x201d;, and the other surface opposite to the first surface S<b>1</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;second surface S<b>2</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The frame-shaped member <b>18</b> joined to the first surface S<b>1</b> of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> uses silicon (Si) as the material thereof. This frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> is joined to the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> by anodic bonding as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The anti-reflection film <b>14</b> formed on the second surface S<b>2</b> of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> consists of two parts having different compositions. One of the two parts is a partial film <b>15</b> which is positioned above the cavity CV, and is a film containing tantalum pentaoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) as its main component. This film <b>15</b> is hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;tantalum pentaoxide contained film&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another of the two parts is a partial film <b>16</b> which is positioned above the frame-shaped member <b>18</b>, and is a film containing tantalum (Ta), sodium (Na) and oxygen (O), or a film containing tantalum (Ta), lithium (Li) and oxygen (O). This film <b>16</b> may contain sodium tantalate (NaTaO<sub>3</sub>) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>). This film <b>16</b> has a function of absorbing light in addition to the function of anti-reflection. The light to be absorbed is not necessarily restricted to a visible radiation. In the description below, this film <b>16</b> is referred to as &#x201c;light-absorbent film&#x201d; for convenience's sake.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The two partial films <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> constituting the anti-reflection film <b>14</b> are not formed as a separate body, respectively, but are formed integrally with each other as described later. More specifically, the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> and the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> are continuously formed on the second surface S<b>2</b> of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b>, and the respective surfaces of the films <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are on a level with each other. Moreover, the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> and the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> may have the same thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, the anti-reflection film <b>14</b> is basically sufficient to have a structure of a single layer (one-layer structure in which the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> and the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> are formed on the same surface). Note in the present embodiment, the anti-reflection film <b>14</b> has a four-layer structure as illustrated in an enlarged manner on the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, the multilayer film of a portion in the anti-reflection film <b>14</b>, which is positioned above the cavity CV, has a structure in which the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b>, silicon dioxide film <b>17</b>, the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> and silicon dioxide film <b>17</b> are laminated in sequence from the lower layer side. On the other hand, the multilayer film of a portion in the anti-reflection film <b>14</b>, which is positioned above the frame-shaped member <b>18</b>, has a structure in which the light-absorbent film <b>16</b>, the silicon dioxide film <b>17</b>, the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> and the silicon dioxide film <b>17</b> are laminated in sequence from the lower layer side.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Likewise, in the comparative example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the components of light corresponding to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> are indicated by the same reference marks A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b> and C<b>5</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the configuration of the cap <b>10</b><i>a </i>for optical device of the comparative example (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), the joined portion of the glass <b>13</b> and the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> is optically transparent.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, the unnecessary light C<b>1</b> emitted from the light emitting element <b>20</b> is entered into the glass <b>13</b> and travels in the glass <b>13</b> (C<b>2</b>), and is reflected on the upper surface of the glass <b>13</b> (C<b>3</b>).

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Moreover, the unnecessary light (external light) B<b>1</b> entered from the external is entered into the glass <b>13</b> and travels in the glass <b>13</b> (B<b>2</b>), and the light B<b>2</b> transmits the glass <b>13</b> and is entered into the light emitting element <b>20</b> (B<b>3</b>).

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">By this structure, as for the unnecessary light (external light) B<b>1</b> entered from the external, most of the amount of light is absorbed by the light-absorbent film <b>16</b>.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Manufacturing Method of the Cap for Optical Device According to Each of the Above Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Hereinafter, methods of manufacturing the respective caps <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B for optical device according to the above first to third embodiments will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 10C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref> illustrate in a cross-sectional view, one example of manufacturing steps of the cap <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for optical device according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the initial step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), as the members constituting the cap <b>10</b>, a plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a </i>made of a material which can transmit light, and a frame-shaped member <b>18</b> made of silicon (Si), are prepared. The plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a </i>is obtained by forming a film <b>15</b> containing tantalum pentaoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) as its main component (tantalum pentaoxide contained film) on the second surface S<b>2</b> of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> (on the surface opposite to the surface S<b>1</b> to which the frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is joined). The borosilicate glass <b>13</b> contains sodium (Na) which can become a movable ion when a predetermined bias voltage is applied across the both surfaces thereof, and the thickness thereof is selected to be, for example, approximately 0.2 to 0.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a </i>is obtained by forming on the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> shaped to a required thickness, for example, the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> using anodic oxidation method. The frame-shaped member <b>18</b> is obtained by preparing a silicon substrate of a size matching an outer shape of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a</i>, thinning the silicon substrate by a polishing machine or the like to a required thickness, and effecting a dry etching such as a reactive ion etching (RIE) or the like relative to the thinned silicon substrate to thereby form a through hole in a square shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> is superposed on the surface (first surface S<b>1</b>) of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a </i>on the side on which the glass <b>13</b> is formed, and both of the members are joined together by anodic bonding. More specifically, the superposed plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a </i>and frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> are heated at a temperature of 100 to 400&#xb0; C. and then a regular bias voltage (approximately DC 100 to 1000 V) is applied across the both members, while applying an electrode <b>41</b>, which is connected to the positive (+) pole of the direct current (DC) power source <b>40</b>, to the bottom surface of the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>, and applying an electrode <b>42</b>, which is connected to the negative (&#x2212;) pole of the DC power source <b>40</b>, to the surface of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">By the application of the bias voltage, sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> are moved toward the negative (&#x2212;) electrode <b>42</b> side. Then in the interface portion between the glass <b>13</b> and the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>, a layer in which positive (+) charges are collected is formed on the silicon <b>18</b> side, and a space charge layer of SiO<sup>&#x2212;</sup> (a layer in which sodium ions are lacking) is formed on the glass <b>13</b> side. As a result, electrostatic attraction is generated at the interface between the glass <b>13</b> and the silicon <b>18</b>, and thus the both members are covalent bonded.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, the sodium (Na) ions moved in the glass <b>13</b> are taken into a portion of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> which is positioned above the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>. As a result, the portion of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> is changed into a film containing sodium (Na), tantalum (Ta) and oxygen (O) (light-absorbent film <b>16</b>). At this time, since the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> is formed due to the movement of sodium (Na) ions, it is probably formed in a larger (or smaller) range than the portion in which the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> and one surface side (the first surface S<b>1</b> side) of the glass <b>13</b> are in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the multilayer anti-reflection film as well, it is possible to form a plurality of films <b>16</b> containing tantalum (Ta), sodium (Na) and oxygen (O), since sodium (Na) ion is transmitted through and moved in the silicon dioxide film. In this case, in the multilayer anti-reflection film, the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> of at least one layer is sufficient to have a film <b>16</b> containing Ta, Na and O. All of the tantalum pentaoxide contained films <b>15</b> are not necessarily changed to a film <b>16</b> containing Ta, Na and O.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Then, the application of the bias voltage is stopped and the electrodes <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are detached. Thus the cap <b>10</b> for optical device of the first embodiment is manufactured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to the manufacturing method of the cap <b>10</b> for optical device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>, there are obtained further merits below, in addition to the above advantages (improvement in the optical characteristics) based on the structure of the cap <b>10</b> for optical device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Namely, in the state of the art, formation of a light-absorbent film on a glass is carried out, for example, as follows: First, a metal film having the property of absorbing light is formed using a CVD method or the like on the entire surface of a glass; an etching resist is then formed on the metal film; the resist layer is patterned into a required shape; the metal film is etched away using the patterned resist layer as a mask, to thereby form a light-absorbent film; and finally the resist layer is removed. Namely, a photolithography technique needs to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Contrary to this, according to the manufacturing method of the cap <b>10</b> for optical device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>, it is possible to easily form the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> by forming a required metal film (the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b>) on the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> and then, with the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> being interposed between the glass <b>13</b> and the electrode <b>41</b>, applying a predetermined negative (&#x2212;) voltage to the metal film <b>15</b> to thereby effect an anodic bonding. More specifically, the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> can be formed only in a portion corresponding to the position at which the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> and the glass <b>13</b> contacts with each other. Accordingly, masks or the like are unnecessary and the manufacturing process can be simplified. Namely, it is possible to carry out a required patterning without using a photolithography technique such as needed in the state of the art, and accordingly to realize a simplification of the manufacturing process and a reduction in the manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, according to the manufacturing method of the cap <b>10</b> for optical device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>, the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> is interposed between the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> and the negative (&#x2212;) electrode <b>42</b>, and sodium (Na) ions are taken into the film <b>15</b>. Accordingly, unlike the case of an ordinary anodic bonding, it is possible to greatly reduce the amount of sodium (to be exact, sodium hydroxide) deposited on the negative (&#x2212;) electrode. This is advantageous from the viewpoint of the maintenance of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 8B</figref> illustrate in a cross-sectional view, one example of manufacturing steps of the cap <b>10</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) for optical device according to the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the initial step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), as the members constituting the cap <b>10</b>A, a plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>b </i>made of a material which can transmit light, and a frame-shaped member <b>18</b> made of silicon (Si), are prepared. The plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>b </i>is obtained by forming a tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> on both surfaces S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b>, respectively. The material of the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> and the thickness thereof, and the respective forming methods of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>, are the same as those explained in the above step of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b> is superposed on one surface of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>b </i>(on the first surface S<b>1</b> side of the glass <b>13</b> in the illustrated example) on the side on which the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> is formed, and then a reverse bias voltage, which is reverse to the regular bias voltage applied in the above step of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, is applied to the superposed plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>b </i>and frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>. More specifically, the reverse bias voltage (approximately DC 100 to 1000 V) is applied across the both members, while applying the electrode <b>41</b>, which is connected to the negative (&#x2212;) pole of the DC power source <b>40</b>, to the bottom surface of the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>, and applying the electrode <b>42</b>, which is connected to the positive (+) pole of the DC power source <b>40</b>, to the surface of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> of the plate-shaped member <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">By the application of the reverse bias voltage, sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in the borosilicate glass <b>13</b> are moved toward the negative (&#x2212;) electrode <b>41</b> side. The sodium (Na) ions moved in the glass <b>13</b> are taken into a portion of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> which corresponds to the position of the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>. As a result, the portion of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> is changed into a film containing sodium (Na), tantalum (Ta) and oxygen (O) (light-absorbent film <b>16</b>). At this time, no electrostatic attraction is generated at the interface between the glass <b>13</b> and the silicon <b>18</b>, and accordingly, the glass <b>13</b> and the silicon <b>18</b> are not in a joined state.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Then, the application of the reverse bias voltage is stopped and thus an intermediate body <b>12</b><i>c </i>is obtained as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. At this time, the intermediate body <b>12</b><i>c </i>is held between the electrodes <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> because the glass <b>13</b> and the silicon <b>18</b> are not yet in a joined state.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the next step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), the regular bias voltage is applied across the intermediate body <b>12</b><i>c </i>in the same manner as in the above step of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, and thus both of the members <b>13</b>, <b>18</b> are joined together by anodic bonding. At this time, electrostatic attraction is generated at the interface between the light-absorbent film <b>16</b> on the glass <b>13</b> and the silicon <b>18</b>, and thus the both members are covalent bonded.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, the sodium (Na) ions moved in the glass <b>13</b> are taken into a portion of the tantalum pentaoxide contained film <b>15</b> which is positioned above the frame-shaped member (silicon) <b>18</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the application of the regular bias voltage is stopped and the electrodes <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are detached. Thus the cap <b>10</b>A for optical device of the second embodiment is manufactured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to the manufacturing method of the cap <b>10</b>A for optical device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 8B</figref>, it is possible to realize a reduction in the manufacturing cost and also to greatly reduce the amount of sodium hydroxide deposited on the negative (&#x2212;) electrode, in the like manner as in the case of the above manufacturing method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>.</p>
