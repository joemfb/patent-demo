<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to attachment members and insulation panels including the same. The insulation panels may be used on the exterior surface of a roofed and walled structure built for permanent use, including a building, a house, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a building structure, such as a house, a frame is typically built out of wood, steel, block, or similar material. An exterior wall of plywood or material of similar function is then placed upon the frame to provide an exterior surface. A weatherproofing layer may cover the exterior wall. An insulation layer can then be placed, and finally a cladding, paneling, sheathing, veneer, or siding is placed to provide the final exterior view.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vinyl siding is a popular substitute for wood paneling and aluminum siding. It is easily cleaned, and it is resistant to deterioration. It may also be easily installed around windows and doors. Moreover, it may be produced in a variety of shapes and colors by known extrusion and molding processes at a relatively low cost per sheet or panel. To enhance the thermal insulation of building structures, one or more layer of insulating material can be placed between the vinyl siding and the exterior wall of the building. For example, a layer of insulation can be attached to an exterior wall, and the vinyl siding then installed over the insulating layer. In other insulated siding systems, an insulated panel is generally attached to a veneer, such as vinyl siding panel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to produce additional insulated siding panel systems or assemblies, as well as components thereof, that allow for simple production, easy installation, and greater insulating properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present application discloses, in various exemplary embodiments, various installation/attachment members that can be used to form an insulation panel or composite siding panel. The insulation panels are particularly useful on the exterior surfaces or walls of a building. The insulation panels include foam insulation, which provides strength, enables a wide variety of design options, and provides increased R-values.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed in embodiments is an insulation panel comprising a foam insulating layer and an attachment member. The foam insulating layer includes a front face, a rear face, a first end edge, a second end edge, and a female connecting member extending into a body of the foam insulating layer along the first end edge. The attachment member includes a male connecting member extending into the female connecting member of the foam insulating layer, a hem portion substantially aligned with the rear surface of the foam insulating layer, and a connection portion joining the male connecting member and the hem portion. The attachment member and the first end edge cooperate to be complementary in shape with the second end edge such that adjacent panels can engage each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The male connecting member and the hem portion may be substantially parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The attachment member may further include an anchor portion extending from the male connecting member.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The present disclosure relates to various embodiments of attachment members which can be used to attach insulation to the wall of a building. The attachment member can be part of an insulation panel (also referred to as a composite siding panel). The insulation panel includes the attachment member and a foam insulation layer in which the attachment member is embedded. The insulation panel can also include a veneer panel or siding panel which is attached to the front of the foam insulation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Referring to the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an attachment member <b>100</b> generally has three parts. A connection portion or main portion <b>110</b> of the attachment member has a forward edge <b>112</b> and a rear edge <b>114</b>. A hem portion or nailing hem <b>120</b> extends transversely from the rear edge <b>114</b> of the main portion in an upper direction (indicated by arrow <b>102</b>). The hem portion/nailing hem includes openings or receptacles (not visible) through which fasteners (e.g. nails, staples, etc.) are inserted. A male connecting member or lower leg <b>130</b> extends transversely from the main portion <b>110</b> in a lower direction (indicated by arrow <b>104</b>). The upper direction <b>102</b> is opposite the lower direction <b>104</b>. Described in another way, the connection portion <b>110</b> joins the male connecting member <b>130</b> and the hem portion <b>120</b> together. The male connecting member/lower leg <b>130</b> has an upper or first end <b>132</b>, and a lower or second end <b>134</b>. The first end <b>132</b> of the lower leg is connected to the connection portion/main portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In particular embodiments, the nailing hem <b>120</b> and the lower leg <b>130</b> extend substantially perpendicularly from the main portion <b>110</b>. Put another way, the hem portion/nailing hem <b>120</b> and the male connecting member/lower leg <b>130</b> are substantially parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower leg <b>130</b> is connected to the main portion <b>110</b> along the forward edge <b>112</b>. The attachment member also includes a forward wall <b>140</b>, which has a first end <b>142</b> and a second end <b>144</b>. The second end <b>144</b> of the forward wall connects to the main portion <b>110</b> along the forward edge <b>112</b>. The first end <b>142</b> can also be referred to as the upper edge of the first wall. The forward wall <b>140</b> extends in the upper direction <b>102</b> from the main portion <b>110</b>. As shown here, the lower leg <b>130</b>, the forward wall <b>140</b>, and the nailing hem <b>120</b> may be substantially parallel to each other. Put another way, the lower leg <b>130</b>, the forward wall <b>140</b>, and the nailing hem <b>120</b> extend substantially perpendicularly from the main portion <b>110</b>. Also, the height <b>125</b> of the nailing hem is greater than the height <b>145</b> of the forward wall.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a second exemplary embodiment of an attachment member. Here, the lower leg <b>130</b> connects to the main portion <b>110</b> in a central location <b>116</b>, rather than along the forward edge <b>112</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Put another way, the lower leg <b>130</b> connects to the main portion <b>110</b> at a point between the forward edge <b>112</b> and the rear edge <b>114</b>. In specific embodiments, the lower leg connects <b>130</b> to the main portion <b>110</b> at the midpoint <b>118</b> of the main portion. No forward wall is present here.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a third exemplary embodiment of an attachment member. Here, the nailing hem <b>120</b> has a base <b>122</b> that connects to the main portion <b>110</b>, and an apex <b>124</b> at the opposite end. The base <b>122</b> is thicker than the apex <b>124</b>. The top of the base has an angle &#x3b8; which is shown here as being 135&#xb0;, and may generally be from about 120&#xb0; to about 160&#xb0;. This embodiment includes a forward wall <b>140</b>. An optional lip <b>150</b> may extend transversely from the first end or upper edge <b>142</b> of the forward wall. In addition, an anchor portion or flange <b>160</b> extends transversely from the male connecting member/lower leg <b>130</b>. As shown here, the flange <b>160</b> extends from the second end <b>134</b> of the lower leg. Generally the flange <b>160</b> can extend away from the lower leg anywhere between the first end <b>132</b> and the second end <b>134</b> of the lower leg, though usually closer to the second end than the first end. In embodiments, the anchor portion/flange <b>160</b> is substantially parallel to the connection portion/main portion <b>110</b>. Here, the flange <b>160</b> extends for an equal distance forward and backward of the lower leg <b>130</b>. However, it is contemplated that the flange <b>160</b> may extend in only one direction from the lower leg <b>130</b>, or that the flange can extend for different distances in the two directions from the lower leg.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a fourth exemplary embodiment of an attachment member. Here, the attachment member <b>100</b> includes the forward wall <b>140</b>, lip <b>150</b>, and flange <b>160</b> previously discussed in the other exemplary embodiments. Two spurs <b>170</b> extend from the base of the nailing hem. The spurs extend transversely in the lower direction <b>104</b> and in the forward direction <b>106</b>. It should be noted that the apex <b>124</b> of the nailing hem here is rounded off in comparison to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the main portion <b>110</b> of the attachment member may have a thickness <b>115</b> of from about 1.0 inches to about 2.0 inches. The nailing hem <b>120</b> of the attachment member may have a total height <b>125</b> of from about 1.0 inches to about 4.5 inches. The base <b>122</b> of the nailing hem may have a height <b>123</b> of from about 0.5 inches to about 2.0 inches. Generally, the bottom half of the nailing hem should be considered the base. The remainder of the nailing hem may be considered the apex <b>124</b>. The forward wall <b>140</b> of the attachment member may have a height <b>145</b> of from about 0.25 inches to about 3 inches, including from about 0.25 inches to about 1 inch. Again, it should be mentioned that when a forward wall is present, the height <b>145</b> of the forward wall is less than the height <b>125</b> of the nailing hem. The lip <b>150</b> of the attachment member may have a width <b>155</b> of from about 0.01 inches to about 0.1 inches. The lower leg <b>130</b> of the attachment member may have a height <b>135</b> of from about 0.5 inches to about 2.0 inches. The flange <b>160</b> of the attachment member may have a width <b>165</b> of from about 0.25 inches to about 1.5 inches. It should be noted that the flange <b>160</b> is shorter than the main portion <b>110</b> of the attachment member, i.e. width <b>165</b> is less than thickness <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the attachment member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and illustrates additional aspects of the attachment member which apply to all embodiments described herein. Here, the openings/receptacles <b>126</b> in the nailing hem <b>120</b> are visible. In addition, one or more apertures <b>136</b> may be present in the lower leg <b>130</b> of the attachment member as well. As explained further herein, the lower leg can be embedded in a foam insulating layer during formation of the foam layer, and these apertures can further anchor the attachment member into the foam layer when foam passes through the apertures and solidifies. Such apertures in the lower leg are not necessary, and may be absent. The upper surface <b>117</b> of the main portion is flat. The attachment member may have any desired length <b>105</b>, although it is contemplated that the length will be from about 3 feet to about 6 feet, including about 4 feet.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The attachment members of the present disclosure are useful in forming insulation panels or composite siding panels. The attachment members can be inserted into a foam insulating layer, or can be embedded into the foam insulating layer during the manufacture of the foam insulating layer. It is contemplated that this combination of attachment member and foam insulating layer can be sold as an intermediate product to a producer. A veneer panel or siding panel can also be attached to the insulation panel/composite siding panel.</p>

<p id="p-0213" num="0212"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is an exploded side view of a sixth exemplary embodiment of an insulation panel or composite siding panel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a side view of the insulation panel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows two insulation panels stacked upon each other to illustrate how their various parts interact.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The insulation panel <b>2000</b> includes an attachment member <b>2010</b>, a foam insulating layer <b>2030</b>, and a veneer panel <b>2050</b>. The attachment member <b>2010</b> shown here is similar to the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The attachment member is made up of the main portion <b>2018</b>, nailing hem <b>2012</b>, lower leg <b>2014</b>, forward wall <b>2016</b>, the lip <b>2026</b> extending from an upper edge of the forward wall <b>2016</b>, and the flange <b>2020</b> extending transversely from the lower end of lower leg <b>2014</b>. The base <b>2023</b> of the nailing hem <b>2012</b> is depicted with only one spur <b>2028</b>. It should be noted that this spur differs from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in that the spur extends perpendicularly from the base in a forward direction <b>2006</b>, and does not extend in the lower direction, and there is only one spur. However, multiple spurs could be used, and if desired the spur could also extend in the lower direction. A fastening means is illustrated here as a nail <b>2002</b> extending through the nailing hem <b>2012</b>. The flange is useful in improving wind load performance of the overall panel, as well as increasing pull-out resistance (i.e. separation of the attachment member from the foam insulating layer).</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Again, the foam insulating layer <b>2030</b> includes a front face <b>2032</b> which is spaced apart from a rear face <b>2034</b>. A first end edge <b>2036</b> and a second end edge <b>2038</b> join the front face <b>2032</b> and the rear face <b>2034</b> at opposite ends of the foam insulating layer. The front face <b>2032</b>, rear face <b>2034</b>, first end edge <b>2036</b>, and second end edge <b>2038</b> define a body <b>2040</b> of the foam insulating layer. The front face <b>2032</b> is angled with respect to the rear face <b>2034</b>. Put another way, the thickness <b>2037</b> at the first end edge <b>2036</b> is less than the thickness <b>2039</b> at the second end edge <b>2038</b>. The first end edge <b>2036</b> is planar (i.e. flat) from the front face <b>2032</b> to the rear face <b>2034</b>. No joining element extends from the first end edge. The attachment member <b>2010</b> entirely covers the first end edge <b>2036</b> of the foam insulating layer. A groove <b>2042</b> is located in the second end edge <b>2038</b> of the foam insulating layer. The groove divides the body along the second end edge <b>2038</b> into a front ridge <b>2044</b> and a rear ridge <b>2046</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In this embodiment, the lower leg <b>2014</b> and the flange <b>2020</b> of the attachment member are embedded in the body <b>2040</b> of the foam insulating layer along the first end edge <b>2036</b>. The nailing hem <b>2012</b> of the attachment member is substantially aligned with the rear face <b>2034</b> of the foam insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The veneer panel <b>2050</b> has a front face <b>2052</b>, a rear face <b>2054</b>, a first end edge <b>2056</b>, and a second end edge <b>2058</b>. The veneer panel <b>2050</b> is attached to the front face <b>2032</b> of the foam insulating layer by its rear face <b>2054</b>. The first end edge <b>2056</b> of the veneer panel extends transversely upwards beyond the first end edge <b>2036</b> of the foam insulating layer, so that the first end edge <b>2056</b> is adjacent the upper edge <b>2017</b> of the forward wall <b>2016</b>. The lip <b>2026</b> caps the veneer panel <b>2050</b>. In this regard, it should be noted that the forward wall <b>2016</b> of the attachment member depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is slightly different from the forward wall <b>140</b> of the attachment member depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the forward wall <b>140</b> is perpendicular to the main portion <b>110</b>. Here in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the forward wall <b>2016</b> is angled, so that the forward wall <b>2016</b> is parallel to the front face <b>2032</b> of the foam insulating layer. Thus, the front face <b>2052</b> of the veneer panel can be flat.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The veneer panel <b>2050</b> includes a lower wall <b>2082</b> that extends transversely rearward from the second end edge <b>2058</b> of the veneer panel. The lower wall <b>2082</b> runs adjacent the front ridge <b>2044</b> on the second end edge of the foam insulating layer, and ends at the groove <b>2042</b>. If desired, the lower wall could be part of a channel like that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Again, the attachment member <b>2010</b> and the first end edge <b>2036</b> cooperate to be complementary in shape with the second end edge <b>2038</b> of the foam insulating layer, so that adjacent panels can engage each other. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the rear ridge <b>2046</b> fits into the attachment member <b>2010</b>. The groove <b>2042</b> on the second end edge of the foam insulating layer is complementary to the forward wall <b>2016</b> of the attachment member, so that the forward wall <b>2016</b> and a portion of the veneer panel <b>2050</b> enter the groove <b>2042</b>. A recess <b>2048</b> is present in the rear face <b>2034</b> of the foam insulating layer along the second end edge <b>2038</b> and is sized to accommodate the nailing hem <b>2012</b> of the attachment member. As a result, adjacent panels can engage each other.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">More generally, the insulation panel <b>2000</b> could be described as being formed from an attachment member <b>2010</b>, a foam insulating layer <b>2030</b>, and a veneer panel <b>2050</b>. The foam insulating layer has a front face <b>2032</b>, a rear face <b>2034</b>, a first end edge <b>2036</b>, and a second end edge <b>2038</b> that define a body <b>2040</b> of the foam insulating layer. The attachment member <b>2010</b> comprises a main portion <b>2018</b> resting upon the first end edge <b>2036</b> of the foam insulating layer, a forward wall <b>2016</b> extending transversely from a forward edge of the main portion <b>2018</b> away from the foam insulating layer <b>2030</b>, and a lower leg <b>2014</b> extending transversely from the main portion into the body <b>2040</b> of the foam insulating layer. The veneer panel <b>2050</b> is attached to the front face <b>2032</b> of the foam insulating layer, a first end edge <b>2056</b> of the veneer panel being adjacent to an upper edge <b>2017</b> of the forward wall <b>2016</b> of the attachment member.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a side view of a variation on the attachment member which can apply to all embodiments described herein, including at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a perspective view. The attachment member <b>2300</b> has a main portion <b>2310</b>, a hem portion or nailing hem <b>2320</b>, and a lower leg <b>2330</b>. The main portion <b>2310</b> of the attachment member has a forward edge <b>2312</b> and a rear edge <b>2314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The hem portion <b>2320</b> extends transversely from the rear edge <b>2314</b> of the main portion in an upper direction (indicated by arrow <b>2302</b>). The nailing hem <b>2320</b> has a base <b>2322</b> that connects to the main portion <b>2310</b>, and an apex <b>2324</b> at the opposite end. The nailing hem also includes openings or receptacles <b>2326</b> (visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>) for fasteners. One spur <b>2370</b> extends from the base <b>2322</b> of the nailing hem. Again, these spurs extend only in the forward direction <b>2306</b>, or put another way parallel to the main portion <b>2310</b>, and do not extend in the lower direction <b>2304</b>. Again, more than one spur may be present. The apex <b>2324</b> of the nailing hem here is rounded off.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> also includes a forward wall <b>2340</b>, which has a first end <b>2342</b> and a second end <b>2344</b>. It should be noted again that the forward wall is optional (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The second end <b>2344</b> of the forward wall connects to the main portion <b>2310</b> along the forward edge <b>2312</b>. The first end <b>2342</b> can also be referred to as the upper edge of the first wall. The forward wall <b>2340</b> extends in the upper direction <b>2302</b> from the main portion <b>2310</b>. As shown here, the lower leg <b>2330</b>, the forward wall <b>2340</b>, and the nailing hem <b>2320</b> may be substantially parallel to each other. Put another way, the lower leg <b>2330</b>, the forward wall <b>2340</b>, and the nailing hem <b>2320</b> extend substantially perpendicularly from the main portion <b>2310</b>. Also, the height <b>2325</b> of the nailing hem is greater than the height <b>2345</b> of the forward wall. An optional lip <b>2350</b> may extend transversely from the first end or upper edge <b>2342</b> of the forward wall in the forward direction <b>2306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The lower leg <b>2330</b> extends transversely from the main portion <b>2310</b> in a lower direction (indicated by arrow <b>2304</b>). The upper direction <b>2302</b> is opposite the lower direction <b>2304</b>. Described in another way, the connection portion <b>2310</b> joins the lower leg <b>2330</b> and the hem portion <b>2320</b> together. The lower leg <b>2330</b> has an upper or first end <b>2332</b>, and a lower or second end <b>2334</b>. The first end <b>2332</b> of the lower leg is connected to the main portion <b>2310</b>. Here, the lower leg <b>2330</b> connects to the main portion <b>2310</b> in a central location <b>2316</b>. Put another way, the lower leg <b>2330</b> connects to the main portion <b>2310</b> at a point between the forward edge <b>2312</b> and the rear edge <b>2314</b>, such as the midpoint <b>2318</b> of the main portion.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">In particular embodiments, the nailing hem <b>2320</b> and the lower leg <b>2330</b> extend substantially perpendicularly from the main portion <b>2310</b>. Put another way, the hem portion <b>2320</b> and the lower leg <b>2330</b> are substantially parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The main variation illustrated here is in the shape of the lower leg <b>2330</b> and the flange(s) <b>2360</b> extending from the lower leg. As explained further below, one method of joining the attachment member to a foam insulating layer involves &#x201c;stabbing&#x201d; the foam insulating layer with the lower leg of the attachment member to fasten the two components together. The flange increases the pull-out resistance of the attachment member. However, the shape of the lower leg and the flange can both increase the ease of insertion and increase the pull-out resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">In the variation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, one or more flanges <b>2360</b> are present extending transversely from the lower leg <b>2330</b>. Together, the lower leg <b>2330</b> and the flange(s) <b>2360</b> have the shape of an inverted tree. Put another way, the lower leg has an arboriform or dendriform shape. The lower leg <b>2330</b> can be thought of here as the &#x201c;trunk&#x201d;. The flanges <b>2360</b> are the &#x201c;branches&#x201d; and have a pointed shape.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Each flange includes a stop surface <b>2402</b> and an angled surface <b>2404</b>. The stop surface increases the difficulty of pulling the attachment member out of the foam insulating layer after insertion. The stop surface <b>2402</b> extends transversely from the lower leg <b>2330</b>. The angled surface <b>2404</b> is angled with respect to the stop surface <b>2402</b>, shown here as angle &#x3c9;. Angle &#x3c9; is acute and generally has a value of from about 15&#xb0; to about 75&#xb0;. The angled surface <b>2404</b> angles away from the main portion <b>2310</b> toward the lower end <b>2334</b> of the lower leg <b>2330</b>. The angled surface eases the insertion of the attachment member into the foam insulating layer. The stop surface <b>2402</b> of each flange is closer to the main portion <b>2310</b> than the angled surface <b>2404</b>. The stop surface is usually substantially parallel to the lower surface <b>2319</b> of the main portion <b>2310</b>. However, the stop surface can also be angled with respect to the lower surface <b>2319</b> of the main portion as well.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">At least one flange is present, but generally any number of flanges may be present. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, there are three flanges <b>2360</b>, numbered here as tertiary flange <b>2382</b>, secondary flange <b>2384</b>, and primary flange <b>2386</b>. The primary flange is located at the lower end <b>2334</b> of the lower leg <b>2330</b>. The other flanges are spaced along the length of the lower leg. Put another way, the primary flange is further from the main portion than the other flanges. The lower end <b>2334</b> itself is pointed. Dotted lines are present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> to show the difference between the lower leg <b>2330</b> and the flanges <b>2360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">As seen in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the stop surface <b>2402</b> has a length <b>2365</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the stop surfaces of all three flanges <b>2382</b>, <b>2384</b>, <b>2386</b> have the same length.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a perspective view of the attachment member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The receptacles <b>2326</b> in the nailing hem <b>2320</b> are visible. The upper surface <b>2317</b> of the main portion is flat. The stop surfaces <b>2402</b> on each flange <b>2360</b> are also flat. The attachment member may have any desired length <b>2305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> depicts a different embodiment in which the stop surfaces of different flanges have different lengths. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, there are three flanges numbered here as tertiary flange <b>2410</b>, secondary flange <b>2420</b>, and primary flange <b>2430</b>. Tertiary flange <b>2410</b> has a stop surface <b>2412</b> and an angled surface <b>2414</b>. The tertiary stop surface <b>2412</b> has a tertiary length <b>2413</b>. Secondary flange <b>2420</b> has a stop surface <b>2422</b> and an angled surface <b>2424</b>. The secondary stop surface <b>2422</b> has a secondary length <b>2423</b>. Primary flange <b>2430</b> has a stop surface <b>2432</b> and an angled surface <b>2434</b>. The primary stop surface <b>2432</b> has a primary length <b>2433</b>. The lengths <b>2413</b>, <b>2423</b>, <b>2433</b> of the stop surfaces are measured from the lower leg <b>2330</b> parallel to the lower surface <b>2319</b> of the main portion <b>2310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Tertiary length <b>2413</b> is greater than both secondary length <b>2423</b> and primary length <b>2433</b>. Secondary length <b>2423</b> is less than tertiary length <b>2413</b> and greater than primary length <b>2433</b>. Primary length <b>2433</b> is less than both tertiary length <b>2413</b> and secondary length <b>2423</b>. In other words, the tertiary flange is longer than the secondary flange, which is longer than the primary flange. Generally, a flange which is relatively closer to the main portion <b>2310</b> should have a stop surface whose length is greater than that of a flange which is relatively further from the main portion <b>2310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a side view of another variation on the attachment member. The features shown here can be combined with the features illustrated in the other figures of this disclosure. The attachment member <b>2600</b> includes the main portion <b>2610</b>, nailing hem <b>2620</b>, and lower leg <b>2630</b>. The forward wall <b>2640</b>, lip <b>2650</b>, and flange <b>2660</b> are optional features which are also illustrated. The nailing hem <b>2620</b> has a base <b>2622</b> that connects to the main portion <b>2610</b>, and an apex <b>2624</b> at the opposite end. The nailing hem has a height <b>2625</b> and the base has a height <b>2623</b>. The base <b>2622</b> of the nailing hem <b>2620</b> includes an arched portion <b>2670</b>. The arched portion <b>2670</b> extends in the forward direction <b>2606</b>. The arched portion <b>2670</b> could also be described as round, curved, bowed, rotund, semi-circled, or semi-cylindrical in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The apex <b>2624</b> of the nailing hem <b>2620</b> is rounded off. The apex <b>2624</b> may further comprise an end strip <b>2680</b> which extends in the lower direction. The end strip extends to a height <b>2627</b>, wherein the height <b>2627</b> is less than the difference between the height of the nailing hem <b>2625</b> and the base <b>2623</b>. In other words, the end strip <b>2680</b> does not extend to the base <b>2622</b> of the nailing hem <b>2620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The nailing hem <b>2620</b> has a constant thickness <b>2675</b> throughout. In other words, the base <b>2622</b>, the apex <b>2624</b>, the arched portion <b>2670</b>, and the end strip <b>2680</b> are the same thickness <b>2675</b>.</p>

Here, the arched portion <b>2770</b> is formed by increasing the thickness <b>2777</b> of the nailing hem. The apex <b>2724</b>, and the end strip <b>2780</b> are the same thickness <b>2775</b>. However, the thickness <b>2777</b> is greater than the thickness <b>2755</b>. The rear surface of the nailing hem in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> is straight, whereas the rear surface of the nailing hem in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> curves with the arched portion.</p>

The flange is useful in improving wind load performance of the overall panel, as well as increasing pull-out resistance (i.e. separation of the attachment member from the foam insulating layer).</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Again, the foam insulating layer <b>2830</b> includes a front face <b>2832</b> which is spaced apart from a rear face <b>2834</b>. A first end edge <b>2836</b> and a second end edge <b>2838</b> join the front face <b>2832</b> and the rear face <b>2834</b> at opposite ends of the foam insulating layer.

The front face <b>2832</b>, rear face <b>2834</b>, first end edge <b>2836</b>, and second end edge <b>2838</b> define a body <b>2840</b> of the foam insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the front face <b>2832</b> of the foam insulating layer <b>2830</b> has a contour formed by a central lateral ridge <b>2833</b>, a central depressed region <b>2831</b> extending downward from the central lateral <b>2833</b>. The central depressed region <b>2831</b> is contiguously connected to an outwardly extending angled region <b>2835</b>.

<p id="p-0250" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-42</figref> illustrate several different embodiments and variations of the attaching member. These attachment members vary in the number of lower legs, and the arrangement and lengths of the lower legs. The attachment members can also vary on the presence of flanges on the lower legs, their shape, and their arrangement. Some of the attachment members have a side leg attached transversely to nailing hem in the backward direction. Again, the features disclosed in these embodiments can be combined with the features described elsewhere herein, such as the structure of the nailing hem and the presence of apertures in the lower leg(s).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> is an eighth embodiment of an attachment member. The attachment member <b>3400</b> includes the main portion <b>3410</b>, nailing hem <b>3420</b>, and lower legs <b>3430</b> and <b>3432</b>. The main portion has a forward edge <b>3412</b> and a rear edge <b>3414</b>. The forward wall <b>3440</b> and lip <b>3450</b> are optional features, but are illustrated. This embodiment includes two lower legs <b>3430</b> and <b>3432</b> connected to the main portion <b>3410</b>. Here, the lower legs are the same length (<b>3431</b>, <b>3433</b> respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The variation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> differs from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> by including flanges <b>3460</b> and <b>3462</b> on the lower legs <b>3430</b> and <b>3432</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> includes three lower legs <b>3430</b>, <b>3432</b>, and <b>3434</b>. Here, the lower legs are the same length (<b>3431</b>, <b>3433</b>, <b>3435</b> respectively). There are spaces <b>3411</b>, <b>3413</b> between the lower legs. The lower legs can be evenly or unevenly spaced along the main portion <b>3410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the lower legs <b>3430</b>, <b>3432</b>, and <b>3434</b> are of different lengths (<b>3431</b>, <b>3433</b>, <b>3435</b> respectively). The lengths increase from the forward edge to the rear edge of the main portion <b>3410</b>. In other words, length <b>3431</b> is shorter than length <b>3433</b>, which is shorter than length <b>3435</b>. Put another way, for each pair of lower legs, the lower leg closer to the forward edge of the main portion is shorter than the other lower leg (compare pairs <b>3430</b>/<b>3432</b> and <b>3432</b>/<b>3434</b>). The lower legs can be evenly or unevenly spaced along the main portion <b>3410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the nailing hem is illustrated with an arched portion as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the three lower legs <b>3830</b>, <b>3832</b>, and <b>3834</b> are also of different lengths, which increase from the forward edge to the rear edge of the main portion <b>2610</b>. Each leg also includes triangular flanges as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>. Here, lower leg <b>3830</b> has one flange <b>3860</b>, lower leg <b>3832</b> has two flanges <b>3861</b> and <b>3862</b>, and lower leg <b>3834</b> has three flanges <b>3863</b>, <b>3864</b>, and <b>3865</b>. The number of flanges on each leg may vary, and their spacing along the length of the lower leg may vary as well.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> has two differences compared to the prior embodiments. First, four lower legs <b>3430</b>, <b>3432</b>, <b>3434</b>, and <b>3436</b> are present. The legs may differ in length (<b>3431</b>, <b>3433</b>, <b>3435</b>, <b>3437</b> respectively). As seen here, the legs are arranged so that lower legs <b>3430</b> and <b>3436</b> are longer than legs <b>3432</b> and <b>3434</b>. Put another way, the lower legs are arranged so that the lower leg closest to the forward edge <b>3412</b> and the lower leg closest to the rear edge <b>3414</b>. Legs <b>3430</b> and <b>3436</b> may be considered as end legs, while legs <b>3432</b> and <b>3434</b> are considered as central legs. The end legs may be of the same length in such variations. The central legs may also be of the same length.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> has five lower legs <b>3430</b>, <b>3432</b>, <b>3434</b>, <b>3436</b> and <b>3438</b>. The legs may differ in length (<b>3431</b>, <b>3433</b>, <b>3435</b>, <b>3437</b>, <b>3439</b> respectively). Here, the lower legs are arranged so that for each pair of adjacent lower legs, the lower leg closest to the center of the main portion is longer than the other lower leg. The center lower leg <b>3436</b> is the longest of the five legs illustrated. Also illustrated here is that the lower legs may vary in the presence of, and the shape of, any flange. Here, the lower legs, <b>3430</b>, <b>3434</b>, and <b>3438</b>, have flanges (<b>3460</b>, <b>3462</b>, and <b>3464</b> respectively). Lower legs <b>3432</b> and <b>3436</b> do not have flanges. Flange <b>3462</b> is a triangular flange similar to that seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>, while flanges <b>3460</b> and <b>3464</b> are rectangular. Generally, the attachment member may have from 2 to 7 lower legs, which can vary in length and in spacing along the main portion.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> is another embodiment of the attachment member. This embodiment includes four lower legs <b>3430</b>, <b>3432</b>, <b>3434</b>, <b>3436</b>, all of which are the same length. This attachment member also includes a side leg <b>3470</b> extending transversely from the nailing hem <b>3420</b> in the backward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> has three legs of different lengths as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. This embodiment also includes a flange <b>3490</b> attached transversely to the side leg <b>3470</b> extending from the rear surface <b>3422</b> of the nailing hem.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> though applying to all embodiments, the foam insulating layer generally has a thickness of from about 1.0 inches to about 4.0 inches, with the thickness varying if the foam insulating layer is contoured. This thickness may be measured along the first end edge (reference numeral <b>1837</b>) or along the second end edge (reference numeral <b>1839</b>). The foam insulating layer may have a height <b>1805</b> of from about 8 inches to about 48 inches, as desired. In some embodiments, the height <b>1805</b> is from about 12 inches to about 24 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The attachment member is typically made from a polymeric material known in the art. The attachment member is typically made by injection processes where the polymeric material is melted and injected into a die mold. The polymeric material is then cooled and removed from the die mold.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The veneer panel and the attachment member can be attached to the insulating layer in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, adhesive, chemical bonding, interlocking complementary surfaces, and/or fasteners. Typically, however, adhesives are used. The adhesive may be used over the entire surface of the veneer panel or the attachment member, or used in discrete locations. Suitable adhesives may include, but are not limited to, UV curable adhesives and hot melt adhesives, such as polyamines and urethanes, glue, thermosetting or thermoplastic adhesives, pressure sensitive adhesives or solvent-based adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">At least three ways of attaching the attachment member to the foam insulating layer are contemplated. First, the foam insulating layer is made with the first end edge containing a channel, and the lower leg of the attachment member is slid into the channel from the side. Second, the foam insulating layer is made without a channel in the first end edge, and the attachment member may be pressed or stabbed into the foam insulating layer and adhered in place. Third, the attachment member may be embedded in the foam insulating layer during the shape molding process, as described further below. The attachment member may be located to allow the insulation panel to be fastened to the wall without creating penetrations in the veneer panel or the foam insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The foam insulating layer may be shape molded. Such molding operations will generally impart the desired contours and/or design to the foam insulating layer. Typically, beads and/or pellets of a polymeric precursor material, such as pre-expanded polystyrene, are placed in a suitably configured die mold, then reacted in the presence of water and heat (i.e. steam) to expand during the reaction process. The polymeric precursor material expands and presses against the die surface to form compressed, elongated closed calls that form a characteristic tough smooth skin. The shape molded process produces a panel that is essentially straight and/or free of camber. It is contemplated that the attachment member can be placed in the die mold prior to the expansion of the polymeric precursor material. This embeds the attachment member into the foam insulating layer as the polymeric material is expanded, such that no secondary fasteners are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The foam insulating layer provides structural integrity to the insulated siding panel. For example, the foam insulating layer is the platform to which the veneer panel and the attachment member are connected. The foam insulating layer may be shaped to provide the desired profile for the overall insulated siding panel. For example, the shape of the foam insulating layer may be obtained by either suitable shaping of the die mold, or by computer numerical control (CNC) cutting. The grooves and/or female attachment members may also be milled or wire-cut.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The foam insulating layer is generally made from a cellular foam product, i.e. a plastic or polymeric material with numerous cells of trapped air distributed throughout its mass. For example, expanded polystyrene (EPS) is a cellular foam plastic made from beads of polystyrene that are first pre-expanded and allowed to rest for a suitable interval, then molded in closed steam-heated shaped molds to produce closed-cell molded foams. The size and density of the closed cells can be controlled and may vary depending upon the application. Suitable materials for the foam insulating layer can include extruded polystyrene (XPS), expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, polyethylene, polypropylene, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the foam insulating layer is made from a rigid foam material.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The foam insulating layer can be of any density desired, or be tuned to provide different densities depending on the location. For example, it may be desirable to have higher densities near the edges of the panel, and lower densities near the center (where the veneer panel covers the foam insulating layer). In particular embodiments, the foam insulating layer has a higher density along the first end edge or upper edge than in the center of the foam insulation layer (i.e. the middle region of the foam insulation layer between the first end edge and the second end edge). Similarly, the foam insulation layer may also have a higher density along the second end edge or lower edge than in the center of the foam insulation layer. In other words, the foam insulation layer may be thought of as having a top region, a bottom region, and a middle region, and the middle region has a lower foam density than at least one of the top region and the bottom region, and possibly both the top and bottom regions. This increased foam density can strengthen the joining areas of the foam insulation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Expanded or extruded polystyrene are particularly desirable materials for the foam insulation layer because they provide a solid feel; improve the R-value; deaden noise transmitted through the panel; and allow moisture to migrate away from the exterior wall into the external environment, protecting the exterior wall behind the foam insulation layer and reducing the risk of mold growth.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">The veneer panel is optional and is not present in all embodiments, but is generally desired. The veneer panel provides environmental resistance and durability. It is contemplated that the veneer panel is generally contoured to conform to the contours of the foam insulating layer. Generally, siding must be thick to resist sagging and retain the desired shape. However, the foam insulating layer allows the veneer panel to be thinner than otherwise necessary. The veneer panel only has to provide weatherability to the composite siding panel. Whereas traditional vinyl veneer sidings have a minimum material thickness of 0.040 inches, the veneer panels used in this disclosure may have a thickness of from 0.020 to 0.036 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The veneer panel can be formed from any suitable polymeric, metallic, cementitious, or composite material. Exemplary materials include vinyl, polypropylene, fiber-cement material, polyolefins, polyvinyls, polycarbonates, polyacetals, polysulfones, polyesters, polyamides, multilayer films, polyethylene including high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene, CPVC ABS, ethyl-vinyl acetate, various extruded ionomeric films, polyethylene-based films, wood, or combinations thereof. Other siding materials suitable for the veneer panel include wood, aluminum, and steel.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">If desired, the rear face of the foam insulating layer may also have drainage grooves formed or fabricated into it. Such grooves are described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0081468 and 2007/0175154, the disclosures of which are hereby fully incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">The insulation panels are used in suitable combinations to be affixed to or attached to exterior walls of a building. They can be used on several types of structures including, but not limited to, wood-frame, cement block, structural insulated panels (SIPS), insulating concrete forms (ICFs), steel studs, etc. When installed, the resulting insulating layer is uniform and forms a complete seal. In addition, any perforations in the wall are sealed off from outside elements by the insulation. The attachment member also provides fewer perforations overall in the exterior wall. The foam insulating layer and veneer panels themselves are not perforated either. Nails, screws, or staples can be used with equal ease and can be more accurately placed and more secure because they are applied directly to the exterior wall instead of through a flexible insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Other benefits of the insulation panels described herein relate to production. The amount of insulation can be increased by simply adding more foam, without any other cost in materials. A single foam insulation layer can be used with multiple veneer panels to provide desired assemblies. The veneer panel can be reduced in thickness, thereby reducing waste.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The present disclosure has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the present disclosure be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
