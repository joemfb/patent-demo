<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-024309 filed on Feb. 7, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including the specification, drawings and abstract.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to curtain airbag apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A curtain airbag is known which has a secondary deployment portion that is adapted to deploy to an area other than those corresponding to where a passenger is seated and that deploys downward beyond the beltline (for example, refer to Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2007-161167). Further, a curtain airbag is known which is provided with an inflator for feeding gas to an upper deployment portion upon a side collision and an inflator for feeding gas to a lower deployment portion upon a rollover (for example, refer to Japanese Patent No. 4019896).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the former curtain airbag, however, the secondary deployment portion needs to be made large in size, that is, in capacity, in order to ensure a sufficient protection performance upon a rollover. According to the latter curtain airbag, too, the capacity of the entire airbag needs to be made large if the head protection range for rollovers is required to be wide in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention provides curtain airbag apparatuses that are capable of effectively protecting a passenger upon a rollover, as well as effectively protecting the head of the passenger upon a side collision, and that reduce the required entire capacity of the curtain airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first aspect of the invention relates to a curtain airbag apparatus having: a curtain airbag that is embedded, in a folded or rolled state, in an upper edge portion of at least one door opening of a vehicle body and deploys into a form of a curtain, the curtain airbag having a first deployment portion that deploys toward a lower side of a vehicle from the upper edge portion of the vehicle by inflating with gas supplied upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, and a second deployment portion that deploys toward the lower side of the vehicle from the upper edge portion of the door opening by inflating with gas supplied at least upon a rollover of the vehicle, such that the second deployment portion is located in an area that does not overlap, as viewed laterally, an area in which the first deployment portion is located; a gas generator that generates the gas to be fed to the first deployment portion and the second deployment portion; and an internal pressure difference creator that makes an internal pressure of the second deployment portion higher than an internal pressure of the first deployment portion at least upon a rollover of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the curtain airbag apparatus of the first aspect of the invention, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the first deployment portion deploys by inflating with gas supplied, and thereby protects the head of a passenger from the side collision impacts. On the other hand, upon a rollover of the vehicle, the first and second deployment portions deploy to suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle over a longitudinally wide range.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the structure described above, at least when the passenger is to be protected against a rollover, the internal pressure difference creator makes the internal pressure of the second deployment portion higher than that of the first deployment portion. Therefore, the second deployment portion, despite the fact that its capacity is relatively small, can more effectively suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle than a deployment portion of which the internal pressure is low (as low as the internal pressure of the first deployment portion). On the other hand, since the internal pressure of the first deployment portion is relatively low, the first deployment portion can effectively protect the head of the passenger while suppressing the load acting on the same head during a side collision of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As such, the curtain airbag apparatus of the first aspect of the invention is capable of effectively protecting the passenger upon a rollover of the vehicle, as well as effectively protecting the head of the passenger upon a side collision of the vehicle, and further it reduces the required entire capacity of the curtain airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The curtain airbag apparatus of the first aspect of the invention may be such that the internal pressure difference creator is provided with a first gas feed portion via which the gas generator feeds the gas to the first deployment portion and a second gas feed portion via which the gas generator feeds the gas to the second deployment portion and at which a gas flow resistance is lower than a gas flow resistance at the first gas feed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the curtain airbag apparatus structured as described above, since the gas flow resistance at the second gas feed portion is lower than that at the first gas feed portion, the gas supplied from the gas generator is preferentially fed to the second deployment portion, so that the second deployment portion deploys up to an internal pressure higher than that up to which the first deployment portion deploys.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the curtain airbag apparatus of the first aspect of the invention may be such that: the gas generator is provided with a first gas generation portion that generates the gas to be fed to the first deployment portion and a second gas generation portion that generates the gas to be fed to the second deployment portion, and the internal pressure difference creator is provided with a first gas feed portion via which the gas is, upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, fed to the first deployment portion from the first gas generation portion and a second gas feed portion via which the gas, upon a rollover of the vehicle, is fed to the second deployment portion from the second gas generation portion such that the internal pressure of the second deployment portion becomes higher than the internal pressure of the first deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the curtain airbag apparatus structured as described above, upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, the first deployment portion deploys by being supplied with gas from the first gas feed portion. On the other hand, upon a rollover of the vehicle, the second deployment portion deploys by being supplied with gas from the second gas feed portion, such that the second deployment portion deploys up to an internal pressure higher than that up to which the first deployment portion deploys. Because the gas supply source for the first deployment portion and that for the second deployment portion are different, the internal pressure of the second deployment portion can be easily made higher than that of the first deployment portion. It is to be noted that a one-way valve that inhibits a discharge of gas from the second deployment portion may be provided in a gas feed passage to the second deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The second aspect of the invention relates to a curtain airbag apparatus having: a curtain airbag that is embedded, in a folded or rolled state, in an upper edge portion of at least one door opening of a vehicle body and deploys into a form of a curtain, the curtain airbag having a first deployment portion that deploys toward a lower side of a vehicle from the upper edge portion of the vehicle by inflating with gas supplied upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, and a second deployment portion that deploys toward the lower side of the vehicle from the upper edge portion of the door opening by inflating with gas supplied at least upon a rollover of the vehicle, such that the second deployment portion is located in an area that does not overlap, as viewed laterally, an area in which the first deployment portion is located; a gas generator that generates gas upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle; and a first gas feed passage via which the gas generator feeds the gas to the first deployment portion; and a second gas feed passage via which the gas generator feeds the gas to the second deployment portion and which is larger in cross-sectional passage area than the first gas feed passage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the curtain airbag apparatus of the second aspect of the invention, upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, the gas generator generates gas, and it is fed to the first deployment portion via the first gas feed passage and to the second deployment portion via the second gas feed passage. As such, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the first deployment portion protects the head of the passenger, and upon a rollover of the vehicle, the first and second deployment portions deploy to suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle over a longitudinally wide range.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the structure described above, further, since the cross-sectional passage area of the second gas feed passage is larger than that of the first gas feed passage, the gas supplied from the gas generator is preferentially fed to the second deployment portion, so that the second deployment portion deploys up to an internal pressure higher than that up to which the first deployment portion deploys. Thus, the second deployment portion, despite the fact that its capacity is relatively small, can more effectively suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle than a deployment portion of which the internal pressure is low (as low as the internal pressure of the first deployment portion). On the other hand, since the internal pressure of the first deployment portion is relatively low, the first deployment portion can effectively protect the head of the passenger while suppressing the load acting on the same head during a side collision of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As such, the curtain airbag apparatus of the second aspect of the invention is capable of effectively protecting the passenger upon a rollover of the vehicle, as well as effectively protecting the head of the passenger upon a side collision of the vehicle, and further it reduces the required entire capacity of the curtain airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The third aspect of the invention relates to a curtain airbag that is embedded, in a folded or rolled state, in an upper edge portion of at least one door opening of a vehicle body and deploys into a form of a curtain, the curtain airbag having a first deployment portion that deploys toward a lower side of a vehicle from the upper edge portion of the vehicle by inflating with gas supplied upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, and a second deployment portion that deploys toward the lower side of the vehicle from the upper edge portion of the door opening by inflating with gas supplied at least upon a rollover of the vehicle, such that the second deployment portion is located in an area that does not overlap, as viewed laterally, an area in which the first deployment portion is located; a first gas generation portion that generates, upon a side collision of the vehicle and upon a rollover of the vehicle, the gas to be fed to the first deployment portion; and a second gas generation portion that generates, upon a rollover of the vehicle, the gas to be fed to the second deployment portion such that an internal pressure of the second deployment portion becomes higher than an internal pressure of the first deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the curtain airbag apparatus of the third aspect of the invention, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the first gas generation portion generates gas and it is fed to the first deployment portion. Thus, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the first deployment portion protects the head of the passenger. On the other hand, upon a rollover of the vehicle, the first gas generation portion generates gas and it is fed to the first deployment portion while the second gas generation portion generates gas and it is fed to the second deployment portion. At this time, the second deployment portion deploys up to an internal pressure higher than that up to which the first deployment portion deploys. As such, upon a rollover of the vehicle, the first and second deployment portions suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle over a longitudinally wide range.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the structure described above, further, since the second deployment portion deploys up to an internal pressure higher than that up to which the first deployment portion deploys, the second deployment portion, despite the fact that its capacity is relatively small, can more effectively suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle than a deployment portion of which the internal pressure is low (as low as the internal pressure of the first deployment portion). On the other hand, since the internal pressure of the first deployment portion is relatively low, the first deployment portion can effectively protect the head of the passenger while suppressing the load acting on the same head during a side collision of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As such, the curtain airbag apparatus of the third aspect of the invention is capable of effectively protecting the passenger upon a rollover of the vehicle, as well as effectively protecting the head of the passenger upon a side collision of the vehicle, and further it reduces the required entire capacity of the curtain airbag. According to the curtain airbag apparatus of the third aspect of the invention, further, because the gas supply source for the first deployment portion and that for the second deployment portion are different, the internal pressure of the second deployment portion can be easily made higher than that of the first deployment portion. It is to be noted that a one-way valve that inhibits a discharge of gas from the second deployment portion may be provided in the gas feed passage to the second deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The curtain airbag apparatus of the third aspect of the invention may be such that upon a side collision of the vehicle, the second gas generation portion is activated a predetermined time after the first gas generation portion is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the curtain airbag apparatus structured as described above, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the first gas generation portion generations gas, and it is fed to the first deployment portion. As such, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the first deployment portion protects the head of the passenger. Then, the second gas generation portion is activated the predetermined time after the activation (operation start) of the first gas generation portion, so that the second deployment portion deploys. Thus, in a case where the vehicle rolls over after collided sideways, the first and second deployment portions suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle over a longitudinally wide range.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The curtain airbag apparatuses of the first to third aspects of the invention may be such that the first deployment portion deploys to an area on an outer side, in a lateral direction of the vehicle, of a head of a passenger, and the second deployment portion deploys to an area in front of the first deployment portion such that a lower end portion of the second deployment portion overlaps a side door of the vehicle, as viewed laterally.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the curtain airbag apparatuses structured as described above, the second deployment portion deploys to the area in front of the first deployment portion such that the lower end portion of the second deployment portion overlaps the side door of the vehicle, as viewed laterally. Thus, upon a rollover of the vehicle, the second deployment portion of which the internal pressure is relatively high more effectively suppresses the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle, with the lower end portion of the second deployment portion being caught by (being in contact with) the side door.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, the first deployment portion may deploy to an area on the outer side, in the lateral direction of the vehicle, of a head of a passenger on a front seat of the vehicle, and the second deployment portion may deploy to an area in front of the first deployment portion such that an upper end portion of the second deployment portion overlaps a front pillar of the vehicle, as viewed laterally.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the curtain airbag apparatuses structured as described above, the second deployment portion deploys such that the upper end portion of the second deployment portion overlaps the front pillar and the lower end portion of the second deployment portion overlaps the side door, as viewed laterally. As such, at least in the initial stage of the rollover, the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle can be more effectively suppressed, enhancing the passenger head protection performance for the front side of the front seat.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The curtain airbag apparatus of the second aspect of the invention may be such that the gas feed passage to the second deployment portion has a one-way valve that allows gas to be fed to the second deployment portion via the same gas feed passage, and that inhibits a discharge of gas from the second deployment portion via the same gas feed passage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the curtain airbag apparatus structured as described above, since the one-way valve is provided at the gas feed passage to the second deployment portion, the discharge of gas from the second deployment portion is inhibited, and therefore the internal pressure of the second deployment portion is kept high for a long period of time. As such, the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle can be more effectively suppressed during a rollover for which the second deployment portion is required to be kept in its deployed (inflated) state for a relatively long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the second gas feed passage may be folded or rolled together with the first deployment portion and the second deployment portion and include a tubular piece via which the gas generator feeds the gas to the second deployment portion, and the one-way valve may be formed by a downstream end portion of the tubular piece being put into the second deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the curtain airbag apparatus structured as described above, the gas is fed to the second deployment portion via the tubular piece. The portion, put in the second deployment portion, of the tubular piece is placed in its closed state by being pressed against the inner face of the second deployment portion when the internal pressure of the second deployment portion becomes higher than the internal pressure at the upstream side of the gas flow path. This structure is therefore simpler than a structure in which a one-way valve independent of the tubular piece is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The curtain airbag apparatuses of the first to third aspects of the invention may be such that the first deployment portion deploys to an area on an outer side, in a lateral direction of the vehicle, of a head of a passenger, and a rear deployment portion that deploys so as to overlap a middle pillar of the vehicle, as viewed laterally, is provided at or on a rear side of the first deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the curtain airbag apparatuses structured as described above, since the rear deployment portion at the first deployment portion deploys so as to overlap the middle pillar, the first deployment portion can more effectively suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle during a rollover. That is, the passenger protection performance of the first deployment portion for rollovers can be enhanced without increasing the internal pressure of the first deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The curtain airbag apparatuses of the first to third aspects of the invention may be such that the first deployment portion deploys to an area on an outer side, in a lateral direction of the vehicle, of a head of a passenger, and a delayed-deployment portion is provided which deploys, with a time lag from the first deployment portion, to an area below the first deployment portion by being supplied with gas from the first deployment portion via a narrowed passage, such that the delayed-deployment portion overlaps, as viewed laterally, a side door of the vehicle and an upper portion of a side airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the curtain airbag apparatuses structured as described above, upon a side collision of the vehicle, the side airbag deploys to protect the passenger, and thereafter the delayed-deployment portion deploys so as to overlap the upper portion of the side airbag, as viewed laterally. Since the delayed-deployment portion deploys so as to overlap the side door, the first deployment portion connected to the delayed-deployment portion can more effectively suppress the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the vehicle during a rollover of the vehicle. That is, the passenger protection performance of the first deployment portion for rollovers can be enhanced without increasing the internal pressure of the first deployment portion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Accordingly, the curtain airbag apparatuses of the foregoing aspects of the invention are capable of effectively protecting the passenger upon a rollover of the vehicle, as well as effectively protecting the head of the passenger upon a side collision of the vehicle, and they further reduce the required entire capacity of the curtain airbag, and such features are highly desirable.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>. In the following, the outline of the overall structure of the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> will be first described, and then the structure of a curtain airbag <b>12</b>, which is the main structural element of the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment, and the structure for feeding gas to the curtain airbag <b>12</b> will be described in this order. It is to be noted that the arrows FR, UP, IN, and OUT in each drawing indicate, respectively, the forward direction (forward traveling direction), the upper side, the laterally inner inside side, and the laterally outer side of a motor vehicle S incorporating the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>. In the following descriptions, unless otherwise specified, the phrases using &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; (and the terms similar to them) shall be interpreted as indicating the front side, rear side, upper side, and lower side of the vehicle, respectively, and the phrases using &#x201c;laterally outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;laterally inner&#x201d; (and the terms similar to them) shall be interrupted as indicating the laterally outer side and laterally inner side of the vehicle, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view as seen from the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle S incorporating the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is provided with the curtain airbag <b>12</b> and a side airbag <b>22</b>. The curtain airbag <b>12</b> is formed to deploy along the inner sides of side windows <b>14</b> and the inner side of a center pillar (B pillar) <b>15</b>. In the first example embodiment, the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is formed to cover, when deployed, the inner side of the front side window <b>14</b> beside a front seat Sf and the inner side of the rear side window <b>14</b> beside a rear seat Sr.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although not shown in the drawings, the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is vertically rolled or folded like bellows, and is embedded in the space extending from a front pillar (A pillar) <b>16</b> to a position near a rear pillar <b>19</b> via a roof-side portion <b>18</b>. In the state described later, the curtain airbag <b>12</b> deploys along the front side window <b>14</b>, the center pillar <b>15</b>, and the rear side window <b>14</b> to protect the heads of the respective passengers on the front and rear seats, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is to be noted that the roof-side portion <b>18</b> in the first example embodiment serves as the upper edge of a front side door opening <b>11</b>, which is defined by the roof-side portion <b>18</b>, the front pillar <b>16</b>, and the center pillar <b>15</b>, and serves also as the upper edge of a rear door opening <b>13</b>, which is defined by the roof-side portion <b>18</b>, the center pillar <b>15</b>, and the rear pillar <b>19</b>. With regard to the position of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, more specifically, it is arranged between a roof side rail and a roof head lining constituting the roof-side portion <b>18</b>. It is to be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> each show a state where the curtain airbag <b>12</b> (a front secondary-chamber <b>42</b>, which will be described later) is deploying from between the front pillar <b>16</b> and a pillar garnish <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is further provided with an inflator <b>20</b> serving as &#x201c;gas generator&#x201d; in the invention, and it generates the gas to be fed into the curtain airbag <b>12</b>. The inflator <b>20</b> may of a combustion type or a cold-gas type. When activated, the inflator <b>20</b> feeds a large amount of gas into the curtain airbag <b>12</b>. The gas discharge holes of the inflator <b>20</b> are in communication with some portions or sections in the curtain airbag <b>12</b> via an inner tube <b>50</b>, which will be described later. In the first example embodiment, the inflator <b>20</b> is arranged at the roof-side portion <b>18</b>. The deployed form of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> and the gas feed structure for feeding gas to the curtain airbag <b>12</b> from the inflator <b>20</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The side airbag <b>22</b> deploys into the space between a vehicle seat <b>24</b>, which is the front seat Sf on which a passenger is seated, and a front side door <b>26</b> to protect the upper part (the lumbar and chest parts (areas)) of the body of the passenger seated on the vehicle seat <b>24</b>. In the first example embodiment, the upper edge of the side airbag <b>22</b>, when deployed, is located slightly higher than a beltline BL extending along the lower edges of the side windows <b>14</b> of the motor vehicle S. It is to be noted that the side airbag <b>22</b> may be adapted to protect also the shoulder part (area) of the passenger.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although not shown in the drawings, the side airbag <b>22</b> is, for example, rolled or folded like bellows, and is vertically embedded in the laterally outer side portion of a seatback <b>24</b>A of the vehicle seat <b>24</b>, and when supplied with the gas from an inflator <b>28</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the side airbag <b>22</b> inflates and thus deploys. The inflator <b>28</b> may be, for example, a combustion type inflator that generates gas by combusting a gas generation agent (or material), or a cold-gas type inflator. The inflator <b>28</b> is embedded in the seatback <b>24</b>A of the vehicle seat <b>24</b> together with the side airbag <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As such, the side airbag <b>22</b> is formed to deploy to cover the space between the passenger seated on the vehicle seat <b>24</b> and the front side door <b>26</b>, regardless of in which of the front end position, rear end position, and any position therebetween the vehicle seat <b>24</b> is set. It is to be noted that the vehicle seat <b>24</b> is set in the front end position in the example case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The curtain airbag <b>12</b> and the inflator <b>20</b>, each described above, are provided in pairs at the right and left sides, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Further, the side airbag <b>22</b> and the inflator <b>28</b> are provided at each of the right and left front seats <b>24</b> (i.e., the driver's seat and the navigator's seat).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is further provided with a side collision sensor <b>30</b>, a rollover sensor <b>32</b>, and an airbag ECU (Electronic Control Unit) <b>34</b> electrically connected to them and serving as a controller. The side collision sensor <b>30</b> detects or predicts a side collision of the motor vehicle S (i.e., the unavoidableness of the same side collision) and then outputs a side collision detection signal to the airbag ECU <b>34</b>. The rollover sensor <b>32</b> detects or predicts a rollover of the motor vehicle S (i.e., the unavoidableness of the same rollover) and then outputs a rollover detection signal to the airbag ECU <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When receiving the side collision detection signal, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the inflators <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> at the side where the detected side collision occurs (will hereinafter be referred as &#x201c;the near side&#x201d;). Thus, upon a side collision of the motor vehicle S, gases are fed to the curtain airbag <b>12</b> and the side airbag <b>22</b> provided at the near side, so that they are inflated to deploy into given forms. Further, when receiving the rollover detection signal, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the inflators <b>20</b> at the respective lateral sides of the motor vehicle S. In a case where the airbag ECU <b>34</b> receives the rollover detection signal after a side collision, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the inflator <b>20</b> at the lateral side opposite to the near side where the inflator <b>20</b> has already been activated. The side opposite to the near side will hereinafter be referred to as &#x201c;the far side&#x201d;. Further, in the first example embodiment, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> is adapted not to activate the inflators <b>28</b> when receiving the rollover detection signal only.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, the structure of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> will be described in detail. It is to be noted that the following descriptions on the structure and form of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> assume that the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is in its inflated (deployed) state, unless otherwise specified. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the curtain airbag <b>12</b> has primary chambers <b>36</b> (an example of &#x201c;first deployment portion&#x201d;), a delay chamber <b>40</b> (an example of &#x201c;delayed-deployment portion&#x201d;) that communicates with the primary chambers <b>36</b> via a narrowed passage <b>38</b>, a front secondary chamber <b>42</b> (an example of &#x201c;second deployment portion&#x201d;), and a rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> (another example of &#x201c;second deployment portion&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When inflated, the primary chambers <b>36</b> each deploy to cover an area including a side-collision head protection area (refer to the areas A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). More specifically, the primary chambers <b>36</b> include a front primary chamber <b>36</b>F that deploys, when inflated, to cover an area including a side-collision head protection area Af for the front seat Sf, a rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R that deploys, when inflated, to cover an area including a side-collision head protection area Ar for the rear seat Sr, and a communication portion <b>36</b>C that extends along the roof-side portion <b>18</b> and interconnects the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R. A tube body <b>50</b>A of the inner tube <b>50</b>, which will be described later, is provided in the communication portion <b>36</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An extension chamber <b>36</b>E (an example of &#x201c;rear deployment portion&#x201d;) is provided which inflates and thus deploys to an area behind the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and below the communication portion <b>36</b>C. The front end of the extension chamber <b>36</b>E is connected to the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F, and is supplied with gas from the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F. The rear side of the extension chamber <b>36</b>E overlaps, as viewed laterally, the center pillar <b>15</b> (an example of &#x201c;middle pillar&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The narrowed passage <b>38</b> extends generally downward from the front-lower side of the extension chamber <b>36</b>E and leads to the rear side of the delay chamber <b>40</b>. Supplied with gas via the narrowed passage <b>38</b>, the delay chamber <b>40</b> inflates and thus deploys below the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper edge of the delay chamber <b>40</b> is joined (connected) with the lower edge of the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F, and the lower edge of the delay chamber <b>40</b> is located lower than the beltline BL. Thus, the deployment area of the lower portion of the delay chamber <b>40</b> overlaps the deployment area of the side airbag <b>22</b>, as viewed laterally. According to the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, therefore, when deploying upon a side collision, the lower portion of the delay chamber <b>40</b> overlaps, below the beltline BL, the deployment area of the upper portion of the side airbag <b>22</b> that is also deploying.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The delay chamber <b>40</b> is formed and arranged such that the deployment area of the lower portion of the delay chamber <b>40</b> overlaps the deployment area of the upper portion of the side airbag <b>22</b>, regardless of whether the vehicle seat <b>24</b> (the front seat Sf) is set in the front end position or in the rear end position, that is, regardless of the longitudinal position in which the vehicle seat <b>24</b> is presently set. Further, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the delay chamber <b>40</b>, which is used to protect the head of the passenger, is formed and arranged such that the deployment area of the lower portion of the delay chamber <b>40</b> overlaps the deployment area of the upper portion of the side airbag <b>22</b>, as viewed longitudinally as well. It is to be noted that the curtain airbag <b>12</b> indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is in the process of protecting the head of the passenger.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Upon a rollover, the delay chamber <b>40</b> deploys to such an area that the delay chamber <b>40</b> protects, near the vehicle seat <b>24</b>, the head of the passenger in cooperation with the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F. The area B indicated by a thin line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> corresponds to a test point (impact point) against which an impactor I (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), corresponding to a dummy passenger head used in a rollover test according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 226, is hit. In order to protect the passenger's head by reducing the amount of movement of the passenger's head toward the outside of the motor vehicle S during a rollover, the delay chamber <b>40</b> is formed and arranged to deploy down to a level lower than the beltline BL along the front side door <b>26</b> and then comes into contact with the portion, located lower than the beltline BL, of the front side door <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The gas flow resistance of the narrowed passage <b>38</b> (i.e., the pressure loss at the narrowed passage <b>38</b>) is higher than the gas flow resistance of the primary chambers <b>36</b>, which are the main deployment portions of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, and therefore the delay chamber <b>40</b> inflates (deploys) with a time lag from the inflation (deployment) of the primary chamber <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the meantime, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is designed such that the deployment of the side airbag <b>22</b> is completed at the time point t<b>1</b> that is approximately 20 msec after the time point t<b>0</b> at which a side collision detection signal is input from the side collision sensor <b>30</b>, that is, at which the inflators <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> are activated, and the deployments of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> are completed at the time point t<b>2</b> that is approximately 35 msec after the time point t<b>0</b>. It is to be noted that after the time point t<b>3</b>, the internal pressure of the side airbag <b>22</b> becomes sufficiently low as a result of the temperature decrease (i.e., volume decrease) caused by the heat exchange between the gas and the air in the passenger compartment and/or due to the gas being discharged via a vent hole(s) (not shown in the drawings).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Meanwhile, upon a side collision, the protection of the upper body of the passenger by the side airbag <b>22</b> and the protection of the head of the passenger by the corresponding primary chamber <b>36</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> are completed until the time point t<b>3</b> that is approximately 100 msec after the time point t<b>0</b>. The curtain airbag <b>12</b> is designed such that the inflation of the delay chamber <b>40</b> substantially starts at the time point t<b>3</b> (the target setting in design). More specifically, in the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, the inner diameter of the narrowed passage <b>38</b> is set within the range of 40 to 70 mm (note that it is set to 55 mm in the first example embodiment) so that the inflation of the delay chamber <b>40</b> starts after the time point t<b>3</b>. It is to be noted that the time point t<b>4</b> in the chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the time point at which the deployment of the delay chamber <b>40</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, as such, upon a side collision, the delay chamber <b>40</b> starts inflating to deploy after the completion of the passenger protection by the curtain airbag <b>12</b> and the side airbag <b>22</b>. In the meantime, normally, a rollover of the motor vehicle S that is caused by a side collision occurs within the period from approximately 1.5 sec after the time point t<b>0</b> (the time point t<b>5</b>) to approximately 6 sec after the time point t<b>0</b> (the time point t<b>6</b>), while a rollover that is caused by other reason occurs within the period from approximately 1.5 sec after the output of the rollover detection signal from the rollover sensor <b>32</b> (i.e., the time point t<b>0</b> at which to activate the inflators <b>20</b>) to approximately 6 sec after the same output.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are rollover chambers that deploy, upon a rollover, to an area offset forward from the head protection area Af for side collisions and an area offset rearward from the head protection area Ar for side collisions, respectively. That is, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> serves as a front seat rollover chamber for protecting, upon a rollover, the head of the passenger seated on the front seat Sf in front of the front seat Sf, while the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> serves as a rear seat rollover chamber for protecting, upon a rollover, the head of the passenger seated on the rear seat Sr in front of the rear seat Sr.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">More specifically, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is a bag portion that is separate from the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and deploys in front of the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F, thus serving as the front end bag portion of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>. The front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is formed such that, as viewed laterally, the upper edge of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> overlaps the front pillar <b>16</b> while the lower edge of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is located lower than the beltline BL, overlapping the front portion of the front side door <b>26</b>. In the first example embodiment, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys into a generally columnar (elongated) form of which the axis extends substantially vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The front secondary chamber <b>42</b> covers the most forward test point in the rollover test described above. That is, at the most forward test point, the upper edge side of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> contacts and is thus caught by the front pillar <b>16</b> while the lower edge side of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> contacts and is thus caught by the front side door <b>26</b>, thereby suppressing the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S during a rollover. In the first example embodiment, the upper edge of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is fixed on the front pillar <b>16</b> using a fastener <b>45</b>. It is to be noted that the most rearward test point for the front seat Sf in the rollover test described above is covered by the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and the extension chamber <b>36</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> deploys in front of the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R, serving as the bag portion between the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R and the extension chamber <b>36</b>E.

The rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> and the communication portion <b>36</b>C cover the most forward test point for the rear seat Sr in the rollover test described above.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The front end bag portion of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> described above, that is, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is supported by the lower portion of the front pillar <b>16</b> via a tension cloth <b>46</b> that is generally triangular as viewed laterally. Further, the rear end bag portion of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, that is, the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is supported by the rear pillar <b>19</b> via a tension cloth <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, among the respective portions of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, textile sealing (e.g., silicon coating) is applied to at least of the surface of the base cloth from which the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is made.

In the first example embodiment, silicon coating is applied to the surfaces of the base cloths of the delay chamber <b>40</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the inner tube <b>50</b>, which is a tubular piece, is provided in the communication portion <b>36</b>C of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>. The inner tube <b>50</b> is tubular, extending longitudinally along the roof-side portion <b>18</b>, and its front end is at the rear side of the upper portion of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear end is at the front side of the upper portion of the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R. The inner tube <b>50</b> has a gas outlet portion <b>50</b>B which protrudes from the tube body <b>50</b>A and in which gas discharge holes <b>20</b>A of the inflator <b>20</b> are provided. Further, the tube body <b>50</b>A of the inner tube <b>50</b> has a front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b> from which to discharge the gas into the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F, a rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b> from which to discharge the gas into the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R, a front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> from which to discharge the gas into the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and a rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> from which to discharge the gas into the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The gas outlet portion SOB is arranged near the longitudinal center portion of the inner tube <b>50</b> (i.e., arranged above the center pillar <b>15</b>). The front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>, the front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b>, the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>, and the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b> are arranged in this order from the front. The front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F are partitioned off from each other by the inner tube <b>50</b> (the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>) attached on the inner side of the communication portion <b>36</b>C by sewing, for example. Likewise, the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are partitioned off form each other by the inner tube <b>50</b> (the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>) attached on the inner side of the communication portion <b>36</b>C by sewing, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the structure described above, in the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, the gas generated by the inflator <b>20</b> is fed (distributed) to the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F, the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> through the inner tube <b>50</b> only. In the following, how the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is structured to make the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> higher than those of the primary chambers <b>36</b> will be described, more specifically, an example structure serving as &#x201c;internal pressure difference creator&#x201d; in the invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b> is a tubular portion branching downward from the tube body <b>50</b>A, and the inner diameter of the front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b> is smaller than that of the tube body <b>50</b>A. The inner diameter of the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b> gradually decreases toward its end from the rear end of the tube body <b>50</b>A. On the other hand, the inner diameter of the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> is uniform or substantially uniform, that is, it is equal to the inner diameter of the tube body <b>50</b>A. The rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> is a tubular portion branching downward from the boundary between the tube body <b>50</b>A and the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b>. The inner diameter of the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> is larger than that of the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, as such, the cross-sectional passage areas of the gas feed passage (i.e., a portion thereof) via which the gas is fed to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> from the inflator <b>20</b> and the gas feed passage (i.e., a portion thereof) via which the gas is fed to the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> from the inflator <b>20</b> are larger than those of the gas feed passage (i.e., a portion thereof) via which the gas is fed to the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F from the inflator <b>20</b> and the gas feed passage (i.e., a portion thereof) via which the gas is fed to the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R from the inflator <b>20</b>. Thus, the flow resistances at the gas passages via which to feed the gas to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, respectively, from the inflator <b>20</b> are lower than the flow resistances at the gas passages via which to feed the gas to the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R, respectively, from the inflator <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, as such, the flowrates at which to feed the gas to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, respectively, from the inflator <b>20</b> (i.e., the gas amounts fed per unit time) are higher than the flowrates at which to feed the gas to the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R, respectively, from the inflator <b>20</b>, and therefore, upon deployment of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> each inflate (deploy) up to an internal pressure higher than those up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> inflate (deploy). In other words, the inner diameters of the front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b> and the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b> and the inner diameters of the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> and the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> are set, in consideration of the capacities of the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F, the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, such that the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> each inflate (deploy) up to an internal pressure higher those up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> inflate (deploy).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the first example embodiment, accordingly, the inner tube <b>50</b>, the front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b>, and the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b> together serve as &#x201c;first gas feed portion&#x201d; in the invention, and the inner tube <b>50</b>, the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>, the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> together serve as &#x201c;second gas feed portion&#x201d; in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the meantime, the internal pressure of each primary chamber <b>36</b> is set to an internal pressure suitable for protecting the passenger's head upon a side collision (i.e., an internal pressure between a lower limit internal pressure Pl and an upper limit internal pressure Pu shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The lower limit internal pressure Pl is the minimum internal pressure for preventing the passenger's head from hitting the side window <b>14</b> (trim) at the moment of protecting the passenger's head during a side collision. On the other hand, the upper limit internal pressure Pu is the maximum internal pressure allowable to prevent the peak load acting on the passenger's head from exceeding a permissible value at the moment of protecting the passenger's head during a side collision.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the first example embodiment, an internal pressure Pr of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, which serve as rollover chambers, is not limited by the upper limit internal pressure Pu, that is, it is set higher than the upper limit internal pressure Pu. That is, in the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, the primary chambers <b>36</b> serves as side collision chambers that are differentiated from the rollover chambers (i.e., the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>) that deploy up to a high pressure. Further, since the flow resistance against the gas fed to the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> from the inflator <b>20</b> and the flow resistance against the gas fed to the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> from the inflator <b>20</b> are lower than the flow resistance against the gas fed to the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F from the inflator <b>20</b> and the flow resistance against the gas fed to the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R from the inflator <b>20</b> as described above, the deployments of the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> and the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> are completed at the time point t<b>7</b> that is earlier than the time point t<b>2</b> at which the deployments of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> are completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, the curtain airbag <b>12</b> has an internal pressure maintaining structure for minimizing a decrease in the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, which occurs as time passes. More specifically, a one-way valve <b>56</b>A that allows the gas to flow to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> from the inner tube <b>50</b> side but inhibits the gas from flowing back to the inner tube <b>50</b> side from the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> side is provided at the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>. Likewise, a one-way valve <b>58</b>A that allows the gas to flow to the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> from the inner tube <b>50</b> side but inhibits the gas from flowing back to the inner tube <b>50</b> from the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> side is provided at the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The one-way valve <b>56</b>A is formed by putting the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> (i.e., the tubular cloth piece from which the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> is made) into the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>. More specifically, when the internal pressure at the inner tube <b>50</b> side is higher than the internal pressure at the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> side, the one-way valve <b>56</b>A is in a tubular form (i.e., the one-way valve <b>56</b>A is maintained in the form for serving as the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>), thus allowing the gas to flow into the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> from the inner tube <b>50</b> side. On the other hand, when the internal pressure at the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> side is higher than the internal pressure at the inner tube <b>50</b> side, the internal pressure in the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> presses the one-way valve <b>56</b>A against the inner face of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and thereby squashes it on the same inner face, thus inhibiting the gas from flowing back to the inner tube <b>50</b> side from the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>. As well as the one-way valve <b>56</b>A, the one-way valve <b>58</b>A is formed by putting the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> into the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment is structured such that the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> each deploy up to an internal pressure higher those up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> deploy and the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are kept high for a long period of time, more specifically, such that the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are kept higher than the predetermined internal pressure Pru during the time period from the time point t<b>5</b> to the time point t<b>6</b>, over which the protections against a rollover are required.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R also covers the corresponding test points for the rollover test described above, and their internal pressures are kept equal to or higher than a predetermined internal pressure (&#x201c;Prl&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) during the time period from the time point t<b>5</b> to the time point t<b>6</b>, over which the protections against a rollover are required. That is, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is structured such that the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> corresponding to the test points at each of which reducing the amount of movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S is relatively difficult are higher than the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, the effects and advantages of the first example embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that is the timing chart illustrating the deployment (deflation) timings of the side airbag <b>22</b>, the primary chambers <b>36</b>, the delay chamber <b>40</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>. It is to be noted that the timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> only schematically illustrates the deployment timings of the respective chambers and the changes in their internal pressures, that is, it does not illustrate the actual deployment timings and internal pressure changes. Further, it is to be noted that the vertical axis of the timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> does not correspond to that of the internal pressure of the side airbag <b>22</b>, that is, the timing chart, with regard to the side airbag <b>22</b>, only indicates its deployment timing.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> structured as described above, upon a side collision of the motor vehicle S incorporating the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> receives a side collision detection signal from the side collision sensor <b>30</b> and then activates the inflators <b>20</b> and <b>28</b> at the near side, that is, the lateral side at which the side collision is occurring or is to occur (the time point t<b>0</b>). After this moment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the side airbag <b>22</b> is inflated by the gas fed from the inflator <b>28</b>, so that its deployment is completed (the time point t<b>1</b>). Concurrently, the inflator <b>20</b> feeds the gas to the curtain airbag <b>12</b> (mainly the chambers except the delay chamber <b>40</b>) to inflate it, so that the deployments of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> are completed (the time paint t<b>7</b>) and the deployments of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> are completed (the time point t<b>2</b>). After the deployments of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are completed, the one-way valves <b>56</b>A and <b>58</b>A are closed by the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In this way, the head of the passenger at the near side is protected by the primary chamber <b>36</b>, and the upper body of the passenger is protected by the side airbag <b>22</b>. This passenger protection against the side collision is completed until the time point t<b>3</b>. During this protection, since the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> are kept in the range between the lower limit internal pressure Pl and the upper limit internal pressure Pu, the heads of the respective passengers are moderately, and properly, restricted, and thus are effectively protected.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, further, at the moment of protecting the passengers upon a side collision, the delay chamber <b>40</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> does not deploy or its deployment is limited, and therefore the delay chamber <b>40</b> does not hinder the side airbag <b>22</b> from deploying to an appropriate area, allowing the side airbag <b>22</b> to protect the upper body of the passenger effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">After the passenger protection against the side collision (i.e., mainly against the side collision) is completed, the delay chamber <b>40</b> inflates and thus deploys by the gas being fed from the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F via the narrowed passage <b>38</b>. At this time, in the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, the delay chamber <b>40</b> deploys up to an internal pressure almost equal to those of the primary chambers <b>36</b> (note that the internal pressure of the delay chamber <b>40</b> during its deployment is lower than the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b>) while the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> are kept equal to or higher than the predetermined internal pressure Prl. As mentioned earlier, the internal pressure of the side airbag <b>22</b> becomes sufficiently low (the side airbag <b>22</b> deflates) after the end of passenger protection against a side collision (after the time point t<b>3</b>), and therefore the side airbag <b>22</b> does not hinder the deployment of the delay chamber <b>40</b>, that is, the delay chamber <b>40</b> appropriately deploys while squashing the upper side of the side airbag <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">On the other hand, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> deploy up to an internal pressure higher than those up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> deploy, together with (slightly faster than) the primary chambers <b>36</b>, and the one-way valves <b>56</b>A and <b>58</b>A then close. As such, even in a case where the motor vehicle S rolls over after collided sideways (i.e., a rollover occurs as a result of a side collision), the heads of the respective passengers are effectively protected, from the rollover impacts, over a longitudinally wide area by the curtain airbag <b>12</b> with the delay chamber <b>40</b> inflated (deployed) as well as the primary chambers <b>36</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">More specifically, as indicated by the broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lower portion of the delay chamber <b>40</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, which deploys down to a level lower than the beltline BL, comes into contact with the front side door <b>26</b>, Therefore, if the head of the passenger hits the delay chamber <b>40</b>, the delay chamber <b>40</b> suppresses the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S (i.e., reduces the amount of the same movement) while being supported by the reactive force from where the delay chamber <b>40</b> and the front side door <b>26</b> contact each other. According to the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, further, since the extension chamber <b>36</b>E communicating with the delay chamber <b>40</b> comes into contact with the center pillar <b>15</b>, the delay chamber <b>40</b> is also supported by the extension chamber <b>36</b>E (i.e., by receiving a reactive force from the extension chamber <b>36</b>E), and this also contributes to the reduction of the amount of the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S during a rollover.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, further, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys up to an internal pressure higher than the internal pressure up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> deploy, so that the upper edge of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> overlaps the front pillar <b>16</b> while the lower edge overlaps the front side door <b>26</b>, as viewed laterally. Thus, if the head of the passenger hits the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> suppresses the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S (i.e., reduces the amount of the same movement of the passenger's head) while being supported by the reactive force from where the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> contacts the front pillar <b>16</b> and that from where the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> contacts the front side door <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In addition, suppressing the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S during a rollover is harder in the area into which the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys (i.e., an area near the area B corresponding to the most forward test point) than in other protection areas for the passenger on the front seat Sf. That is, suppressing the movement of the passenger's head toward the laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S during a rollover in the area into which the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys requires a relatively large reaction force(s) for supporting the airbag(s). For this reason, if the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> was adapted to deploy up to an internal pressure that is equal to or substantially equal to the internal pressure up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> deploy, it would be unavoidable to make the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> larger in size and capacity (i.e., the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> uses a larger amount of gas for deployment).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, in view of the above, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys up to an internal pressure higher than those up to which the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> deploy, as mentioned earlier, and therefore it is possible to produce large reactive forces when the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> protects the head of the passenger. In particular, since the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys such that the upper edge of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> overlaps the front pillar <b>16</b> and the low edge overlaps the front side door <b>26</b>, as viewed laterally, the upper and lower edges of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> contact and are thus caught by the vehicle body (i.e., the front pillar <b>16</b> and the front side door <b>26</b>), and therefore large reactive forces can be produced. Further, in particular, since the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> deploys into a generally columnar form of which the axis extends substantially vertically, large reactive forces can be produced as compared to a case where a chamber that deploys into a form that is thin in the lateral direction of the motor vehicle S is used as the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>. Structured as described above, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> is capable of effectively protecting the passenger's head even in the area near the severe test point describe above during a rollover, due to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> despite the fact that the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is relatively small in capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Accordingly, the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment is capable of effectively protecting the passengers upon a rollover, as well as effectively protecting the heads of the respective passengers upon a side collision, and further the required entire capacity of each curtain airbag <b>12</b> is relatively small. Meanwhile, with respect to the rear seat Sr, when the passenger's head hits the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> effectively protects the passenger's head from the rollover impacts, as in the case of the head protection by the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> at the front seat Sf.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, the cross-sectional passage areas (inner diameters) of the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> and rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> of the inner tube <b>50</b> are larger than the cross-sectional passage areas (inner diameters) of the front primary gas discharge portion <b>52</b> and the rear primary gas discharge portion <b>54</b> so that the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are higher than those of the primary chambers <b>36</b>. Thus, despite the fact that a single type inflator that generates gas only once is used as the inflator <b>20</b> that is common to the respective chambers, the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> can be made higher than those of the primary chambers <b>36</b>, and therefore the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is simple in structure.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, since the one-way valve <b>56</b>A is provided at the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> while the one-way valve <b>58</b>A is provided at the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>, the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> can be easily kept high. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the internal pressures of the respective secondary chambers <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> decrease more slowly in time than those of the primary chambers <b>36</b> do, and therefore the internal pressure Pr that needs to be set for the initial deployment stage so as to achieve the predetermined internal pressure Pru required for the proper protections against rollovers can be set low, and this also contributes to reduce the required capacities of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, thus, the required capacity of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> (the inflator <b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Further, the one-way valve <b>56</b>A is formed by simply putting the tubular cloth piece from which the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> is made, into the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> from its opening side, and the one-way valve <b>58</b>A is formed by simply putting the tubular cloth piece from which the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> is made, into the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> from its opening side. Accordingly, the curtain airbag <b>12</b> is simpler in structure than when one-way valves independent, respectively, of the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> and the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> are used.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, in the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b>, as mentioned earlier, the extension chamber <b>36</b>E that overlaps, when deployed, the center pillar <b>15</b> as viewed laterally and the delay chamber <b>40</b> that overlaps, when deployed, the front side door <b>26</b> as viewed laterally are in communication with the primary chamber <b>36</b> (the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F). Therefore, during a rollover, the primary chambers <b>36</b> exert a sufficient passenger head protection performance even at the predetermined internal pressure Prl that is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, a vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> of the second example embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref>. It is to be noted that structural elements that are the same as or substantially the same as those of the first example embodiment will be denoted by the same reference numerals, and the descriptions and drawing illustrations of them will be omitted as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a side view schematically showing the outline of the overall structure of the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> in the same way as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> is different from the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment in that the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> has inflators <b>62</b> in place of the inflators <b>20</b> in the first example embodiment, and inner tubes <b>64</b> in place of the inner tubes <b>50</b> in the first example embodiment. It is to be noted that although each curtain airbag <b>12</b> in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is not provided with the delay chamber <b>40</b>, the delay chamber <b>40</b> may be provided at each curtain airbag <b>12</b>. In the following, the structure of the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The inflator <b>62</b> is a two-stage-ignition inflator, having a first ignition portion (initiator) <b>62</b>A and a second ignition portion (initiator) <b>62</b>C as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. When activated, the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A is first ignited so that the gas is discharged from first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, and then the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C is ignited so that the gas is discharged from second gas discharge holes <b>62</b>D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> as well. The first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B of the inflator <b>62</b> are located in the communication portion <b>36</b>C, and the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F and the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R are in communication with the communication portion <b>36</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, the gas discharged from the first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B of the inflator <b>62</b> is fed to the entireties of the primary chambers <b>36</b> via the communication portion <b>36</b>C. As such, in the second example embodiment, the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A and first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B of the inflator <b>62</b> and the communication portion <b>36</b>C (i.e., the structure in which the first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B are present in the communication portion <b>36</b>C) together serve as &#x201c;first gas feed portion&#x201d; in the invention. The amount of gas to be fed to the primary chambers <b>36</b> is set such that the primary chambers <b>36</b> each deploy up to an internal pressure between the lower limit internal pressure Pl and the upper limit internal pressure Pu. It is to be noted that the primary chambers <b>36</b> are partitioned off from the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, as will be described later, and therefore the gas discharged from the first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B is not fed to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the inner tube <b>64</b> is provided in the communication portion <b>36</b>C of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>. The inner tube <b>64</b> longitudinally extends along the roof-side portion <b>18</b>, and its front end is at the rear side of the upper portion of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> while the rear end is at the upper side of the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>. The inner tube <b>64</b> has a gas outlet portion <b>64</b>B protruding from a tube body <b>64</b>A of the inner tube <b>64</b>. The second gas discharge holes <b>62</b>D of the inflator <b>62</b> are located in the gas outlet portion <b>64</b>B. Further, the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> from which to discharge the gas into the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> is provided at the front end of the tube body <b>64</b>A of the inner tube <b>64</b>, while the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> from which to discharge the gas into the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> is provided at the rear end of the tube body <b>64</b>A of the inner tube <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the front primary chamber <b>36</b>F are partitioned off from each other by the inner tube <b>64</b> (the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>) attached on the inner side of the communication portion <b>36</b>C by sewing, for example. Likewise, the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> and the rear primary chamber <b>36</b>R are partitioned off from each other by the inner tube <b>64</b> (the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>) attached on the inner side of the communication portion <b>36</b>C by sewing, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to the structure described above, in the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, the gas generated through activation of the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b>, which serves as &#x201c;gas generator&#x201d; in the invention, is fed (distributed) to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> through the inner tube <b>64</b>. The amount of the gas thus fed to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> is set, in relation to the capacities of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, such that the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> become higher than the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> inflated by the gas fed from the inflator <b>62</b> as a result of the ignition of the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A, which is ignited first (i.e., in the first stage of ignition of the inflator <b>62</b>). According to the second example embodiment, as such, the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C and second gas discharge holes <b>62</b>D of the inflator <b>62</b>, the inner tube <b>64</b>, the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b>, and the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b> together serve as &#x201c;second gas feed portion&#x201d; in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> has the one-way valve <b>56</b>A provided at the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> and the one-way valve <b>58</b>A provided at the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>. Thus, as in the case of the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment, the decreases in the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are minimized. In the second example embodiment, the gas distribution structure including the inflator <b>62</b> and the inner tube <b>64</b> serves as &#x201c;internal pressure difference creator&#x201d; in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the second example embodiment, when receiving a side collision detection signal, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> first activates the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A of the inflator <b>62</b> at the near side. Therefore, upon a side collision of the motor vehicle S, the gas is first fed to the primary chambers <b>36</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> only so that they inflate and thereby deploy, and thereafter the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> at the near side such that the deployments of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are completed at the time point t<b>5</b> that is approximately 1.5 sec after the input of the side collision detection signal, that is, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> immediately before approximately 1.5 sec passes from the input of the side collision detection signal. Accordingly, even in a case where the motor vehicle S rolls over after collided sideways, the passengers can be protected by the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> that start deploying after the primary chambers <b>36</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Meanwhile, when receiving a rollover detection signal after a side collision detection, signal, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A and the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> at the far side. When receiving a rollover detection signal only, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the first ignition portions <b>62</b>A and second ignition portions <b>62</b>C of the inflators <b>62</b> at the respective lateral sides (i.e., the near side and far side) almost simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The timing of activation of the inflator <b>28</b> by the airbag ECU <b>34</b> in the second example embodiment is the same as, or substantially the same as the timing of activation of the inflator <b>28</b> by the airbag ECU <b>34</b> in the first example embodiment. Other structural elements and features of the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b>, including those not shown in the drawings, are the same as, or substantially the same as the corresponding structural elements and features of the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment described above.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, the effects and advantages of the second example embodiment will be described focusing on the differences from those of the first example embodiment. The timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the deployment timings of the primary deployment portions <b>36</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>. It is to be noted that the timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> only schematically illustrates the deployment timings of the respective chambers and the changes in their internal pressures, that is, it does not illustrate the actual deployment timings and internal pressure changes. Further, it is to be noted that the timing chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> does not include any illustration on the operation of the side airbag <b>22</b> (the inflator <b>28</b>) and the following descriptions do not refer to it to avoid repetition.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> structured as described above, upon a side collision of the motor vehicle S incorporating the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b>, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> receives a side collision detection signal from the side collision sensor <b>30</b> and then activates the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A of the inflator <b>62</b> at the near side (the time point t<b>0</b>). At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the primary chambers <b>36</b> first deploy and their deployments are completed at the time point t<b>2</b>, so that the heads of the respective passengers at the near side are protected by the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>. The passenger protection against the side collision is completed until the time point t<b>3</b>. Since the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> are, after their deployments are completed, kept between the lower limit internal pressure Pl and the upper limit internal pressure Pu, the heads of the respective passengers are moderately, and properly, restricted, and thus are effectively protected.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> activates the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> at the near side immediately before approximately 1.5 sec passes from the input of the side collision detection signal. Further, if a rollover detection signal is further input in this state, the airbag ECU <b>34</b> additionally activates the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A and the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> at the far side. As such, the primary chambers <b>36</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> at the near side and those of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> at the far side all complete their deployments at the time point t<b>5</b> from which the protections against the rollover of the motor vehicle S are required. At this time, the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> of each curtain airbag <b>12</b> are higher than the internal pressures of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Accordingly, the amount of movement of the head of each passenger toward the corresponding laterally outer side of the motor vehicle S can be reduced by the left and right curtain airbags <b>12</b> (i.e., the primary chambers <b>36</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> of each curtain airbag <b>12</b>). That is, the passengers are protected from the rollover impacts. According to the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b>, at this time, the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are high, and therefore when the heads of the respective passengers hit the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, the amounts of movements of their heads toward the laterally outer side are significantly reduced by the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> being supported by the reactive forces from where the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> contact the respective side door portions, as in the case of the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment described above.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Accordingly, as is the vehicle airbag system <b>10</b> of the first example embodiment, the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> of the second example embodiment is capable of effectively protecting the passengers upon a rollover, as well as effectively protecting the heads of the respective passengers upon a side collision, and further the required entire capacity of each curtain airbag <b>12</b> is relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, since the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> is provided with the two-stage-ignition inflator <b>62</b>, in other words, since the gas supply source and gas distribution path for the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> and those for the primary chambers <b>36</b> are different, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> can be activated at a desired time point after the start of deployments of the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> (i.e., after the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A is activated). Further, since the gas generated as a result of activation of the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> is fed exclusively to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, their internal pressures can be made sufficiently higher than those of the primary chambers <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in a curtain airbag apparatus <b>100</b> as a comparative example, the primary chambers <b>36</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are in communication with each other and the first gas discharge holes <b>62</b>B and the second gas discharge holes <b>62</b>D are both located in the communication portion <b>36</b>C. According to this comparative example thus structured, in a case where the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A is activated in response to an input of a side collision detection signal and then the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C is activated approximately 1.5 sec after the input of the side collision detection signal, the gas generated as a result of the activation of the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C is fed to all the portions of the curtain airbag <b>12</b>, and therefore the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> cannot be increased up to the predetermined internal pressure Pru, as indicated by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> of the second example embodiment of the invention, in contrast, the gas generated as a result of the activation of the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C of the inflator <b>62</b> is exclusively fed to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> via the inner tube <b>64</b>, and therefore the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> can be increased beyond the predetermined internal pressure Pru, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, using the gas of an amount that is significantly smaller than the gas amount that would be required to increase the internal pressure of the entire curtain airbag <b>12</b> up to the predetermined internal pressure Pru or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to the vehicle airbag apparatus <b>60</b> of the second example embodiment of the invention, further, the activation of the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C is timed with respect to the time point t<b>5</b> at which to start the protections against a rollover, as described above. With regard to this, for example, if the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> was adapted to activate the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C at the same time as the first ignition portion <b>62</b>A, it would result in a possibility that the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> decrease during the period from the completion of the protection against a side collision (the time point t<b>3</b>) to the beginning of the protection against a rollover (the time point t<b>5</b>), to such an extent that the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are lower than the predetermined internal pressure Pru at the time point t<b>5</b> from which the protections against the rollover are required. According to the vehicle airbag system <b>60</b> of the second example embodiment of the invention, the activation of the second ignition portion <b>62</b>C is timed with respect to the time point t<b>5</b>, and therefore the decreases in the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are minimized during the time period from the time point t<b>3</b> to the time point t<b>5</b>. Further, due to the one-way valve <b>56</b>A provided at the front secondary gas discharge portion <b>56</b> and the one-way valve <b>58</b>A provided at the rear secondary gas discharge portion <b>58</b>, the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are maintained high for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the internal pressures of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> decrease more slowly in time than those of the primary chambers <b>36</b> do, and therefore the internal pressure Pr that needs to be set for the initial deployment stage so as to achieve the predetermined internal pressure Pru required for the proper protections against rollovers can be set low, and this also contributes to reduce the required capacities of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, thus, the required capacity of the curtain airbag <b>12</b> (the inflator <b>62</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">While each of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> that are adapted to deploy up to an internal pressure higher than those up to which the primary chambers <b>36</b> deploy serves as &#x201c;second deployment portion&#x201d; in the invention in the foregoing example embodiments, the invention is not limited to this. That is, for example, &#x201c;second deployment portion&#x201d; in the invention may be provided in various other forms, arrangements, or the like. For example, only one of the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> may be adapted to serve as &#x201c;second deployment portion&#x201d; in the invention, depending upon the form of each vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Further, while the invention is applied, by way of example, to the motor vehicle S having the rear seats Sr and the rear side doors <b>27</b> in the foregoing example embodiments, the invention is not limited to such applications. That is, for example, the invention may be applied also to a two-door motor vehicle having no rear side door, a two-seater motor vehicle having no rear seat, and a motor vehicle having seats in three rows or more.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Further, while the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are partitioned off from the primary chambers <b>36</b> in the forgoing example embodiments, the invention is not limited to this. That is, for example, the primary chambers <b>36</b>, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b>, and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> may be formed and arranged such that the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> are supplied with the gas from the respective primary chambers <b>36</b>. In this case, for example, the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> may communicate with the respective primary chambers <b>36</b> via passages that are narrowed so as to retard the deployments of the secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> with respect to those of the primary chambers <b>36</b>, or via passages at which one-way valves are provided, respectively, to inhibit the gas from flowing back to the primary chambers <b>36</b> from the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and the rear secondary chamber <b>44</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, while the two-stage-ignition inflator <b>62</b> is used in the second example embodiment, the invention is not limited to this. For example, two inflators that operate interpedently may be used such that one of them feeds the gas to the primary chambers <b>36</b> and the other feeds the gas to the front secondary chamber <b>42</b> and rear secondary chamber <b>44</b> (the inner tube <b>64</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The invention has been described with reference to the example embodiments for illustrative purposes only. It should be understood that the description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit form of the invention and that the invention may be adapted for use in other systems and applications. The scope of the invention embraces various modifications and equivalent arrangements that may be conceived by one skilled in the art.</p>
