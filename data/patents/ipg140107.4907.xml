<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments herein generally relate to electrostatic printers, copiers, and reproduction machines, and more particularly, concerns display devices positioned within a body of a printing apparatus that provide instructions for clearing paper jams, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern printing devices are sophisticated machines that are able to process a wide variety of print media at very high speeds and produce almost lifelike quality images. However, occasionally a user or service engineer needs to access interior regions of such printing machines in order to perform service or clear paper jams. Often, it is difficult to see service/paper jam clearing instructions provided on a standard external graphic user interface. The embodiments described below assists in such efforts and make it easier for the user/service engineer to see instructions while the user/service engineer is working within the internal confines of the printing machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments herein include a printing apparatus that comprises a body and non-transparent doors and/or drawers on the body. The non-transparent doors and drawers allow access to internal areas of the body of the printing apparatus. Further, a media path that is within the body of the printing apparatus moves sheets of media through the body. Also, a marking engine is within the body of the printing apparatus, and the media path supplies the sheets of media to the marking engine. A processor within the body of the printing apparatus is operatively connected to the marking engine and controls actions of the marking engine. Herein an item is &#x201c;operatively&#x201d; connected to another item when it is directly or indirectly connected (electrically, mechanically, functionally, and the like) to the other item.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, the printing apparatus includes at least one external graphic user interface display positioned on the body of the printing apparatus and at least one internal graphic user interface display within the body of the printing apparatus. The external and internal graphic user interface displays can be, for example, plastic electronic displays, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), light emitting diode (LED) displays, touch screen displays, plasma displays, cathode ray tube displays, and the like (or any combination of such displays).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The internal graphic user interface display is positioned to be observable only when the non-transparent doors and drawers are open. To the contrary, the external graphic user interface display is visible when the doors and drawers are open or closed. The external and internal graphic user interface displays are both operatively connected to the processor. Further, the external graphic user interface display and the internal graphic user interface display can simultaneously provide instructions for clearing a jam within the media path.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some embodiments can include door and drawer sensors on the doors and drawers (the door and drawer sensors are also operatively connected to the processor). In these embodiments, the processor activates the internal graphic user interface display only when the door and drawer sensors detect that at least one of the doors or drawers is open. Other embodiments can include at least one paper jam clearing mechanism connected to the media path. The internal graphic user interface display is positioned adjacent to such paper jam clearing mechanism(s).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, the paper jam clearing mechanisms can comprise a plastic electronic material and can be operatively connected to the processor. This allows the paper jam clearing mechanisms to optionally light up in coordination with the paper jam clearing instructions that are provided on the internal graphic user interface display.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary method embodiment herein automatically detects a paper jam within a printing apparatus. At least one non-transparent door and/or drawer on a body of the printing apparatus is opened to provide access to internal areas of the body of the printing apparatus. The method can provide user instructions through an external graphic user interface display positioned on the body of the printing apparatus (the external graphic user interface display is visible when the doors and drawers are open or closed). Further, the method automatically provides instructions to clear the paper jam using at least one internal graphic user interface display within the body of the printing apparatus. The internal graphic user interface display is positioned to be observable only when the non-transparent doors and drawers are open. The internal and external graphic user interface display can comprise a plastic electronic display, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a light emitting diode (LED) display, a touch screen display, a plasma display, a cathode ray tube display, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the method can activate the internal graphic user interface display only when door and drawer sensors detect at least one of the doors or drawers being open. Additionally, the internal graphic user interface display can be positioned adjacent to at least one paper jam clearing mechanism within the body of the printing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features are described in, or are apparent from, the following detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As mentioned above, it can be difficult to see the service/paper jam clearing instructions provided on the standard external graphic user interface (GUI), because standard external graphic user interfaces are on a different plane to (at a different height from) the marking engine and hence users cannot see the graphic user interface when trying to clear a paper jam. More specifically, once a user opens a print engine door, most print engines are lower than the standard external graphic user interface and it is inconvenient to continually bend up and down to see the jam clearance procedure and then carry out the procedure to clear the jam. This can result in a user having to bend up and down multiple times in order to ensure that they have cleared the jam correctly and to follow the jam clearance instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The embodiments herein address this issue by providing at least one graphic user interface within the internal body of the machine. Thus, with embodiments herein, the jam clearance instructions can be displayed on a main external graphic user interface, as well as on the internal graphic user interface. With this, a user does not continually have to move between the print engine and the external graphic user interface in order to follow the instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, in order to reduce the cost of providing multiple graphic user interface displays on each device, and to reduce the amount of room they occupy, the internal graphic user interface displays can be plastic electronic displays that are available from Plastic Logic (Mountain View, Calif., USA) and Rusnano (Zelenograd, Russia). Such plastic electronic displays can be manufactured purely through plastic printing, making them smaller, lighter, and less expensive than conventional displays. Alternatively, the displays mentioned herein can comprise small and inexpensive liquid crystal displays (LCDs), light emitting diode (LED) displays, touch screen displays, plasma displays, cathode ray tube displays, and the like, (or any combination of such displays).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a computerized printing device printing apparatus <b>100</b>, which can be used with embodiments herein and can comprise, for example, a printer, copier, multi-function machine, and the like. The printing device <b>100</b> includes a controller/processor <b>124</b>, at least one marking device (printing engines) <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> operatively connected to the controller/processor <b>124</b>, media path <b>116</b> positioned to supply sheets of media from a sheet supply <b>102</b> to the marking device(s) <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and a communications port (input/output) <b>126</b> operatively connected to the processor <b>124</b> and to a computerized network external to the printing device <b>100</b>. After receiving various markings from the marking devices(s) <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, the sheets of media can optionally pass to a finisher <b>108</b> which can fold, staple, sort, and the like, the various printed sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, the sheet supply <b>102</b> stores sheets of media and there is the media path <b>116</b> within a body <b>100</b> of the printing device <b>100</b> (which has a beginning, a middle, and an end) and the beginning of the media path <b>116</b> is adjacent the sheet supply <b>102</b>. The media path <b>116</b> moves the sheets of media through the body of the printing device <b>100</b> from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The middle of the media path <b>116</b> is adjacent the marking devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. The media path <b>116</b> supplies the printing media to the marking devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and the marking devices <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> prints marks on the printing media in a printing process to create printed sheets. A media exit <b>118</b> is operatively connected to the body of the printing and to the finisher <b>108</b>. The end of the media path <b>116</b> is adjacent the media exit <b>118</b>, and the media path <b>116</b> moves the printed sheets from the marking engine <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> to the media exit <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also, the printing device <b>100</b> includes at least one accessory functional component (such as a scanner/document handler (scanner) <b>104</b>, sheet supply <b>102</b>, finisher <b>108</b>, and the like), an external graphic user interface (GUI) <b>106</b>, and an internal graphic user interface assembly <b>136</b> that also operate on the power supplied from an external power source (AC power source) <b>128</b> (through a power supply <b>122</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The input/output <b>126</b> is used for communications to and from the printing device <b>100</b>. The controller/processor <b>124</b> controls the various actions of the printing device <b>100</b>. A non-transitory computer storage medium device(computer storage medium) <b>120</b> (which can be optical, magnetic, capacitor based, and the like) is readable by the controller/processor <b>124</b> and stores instructions that the controller/processor <b>124</b> executes to allow the printing device <b>100</b> to perform its various functions, such as those described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, a printer body housing has one or more functional components that operate on power supplied from the external power source <b>128</b> by the power supply <b>122</b>. The power supply <b>122</b> connects to the external power source <b>128</b> and converts the external power into the type of power needed by the various components.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As would be understood by those ordinarily skilled in the art, the printing device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is only one example and the embodiments herein are equally applicable to other types of printing devices that may include fewer components or more components. For example, while a limited number of printing engines and paper paths are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, those ordinarily skilled in the art would understand that many more paper paths and additional printing engines could be included within any printing device used with embodiments herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref> present different schematic diagrams of a portion of the same printing body housing. More specifically, starting with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the printer body can include door and/or drawers <b>240</b> positioned on the body that allow access to the internal areas of the body of the printing device <b>100</b>. Note that the various internal elements such as: roll elements <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> (which can be, for example, transfer rolls, fuser rolls, support rolls, and the like); handles <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>; media support elements <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> (which can be belts, guides, roller nips, and the like); and other processing elements <b>226</b> (which can comprise any element commonly found within a printing device, whether currently known or developed in the future) are only a portion of the actual elements that may be included within a given printing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, the shape, location, and size, of such elements is not necessarily drawn to scale and would vary from machine to machine. Therefore, it would be understood by those ordinarily skilled in the art that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref> only illustrate a partial internal view of a simplified example of the internal arrangement within an exemplary printing device <b>100</b> and that the embodiments herein are equally applicable to many other types of printing devices that may contain many more (or less) components and elements.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, door and drawer sensors <b>242</b> are positioned adjacent the door and drawers <b>240</b>. The door and drawer sensors <b>242</b> are operatively connected to the controller/processor <b>124</b> and inform the controller/processor <b>124</b> when the door and drawers <b>240</b> are open.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, at least one internal graphic user interface <b>136</b> is within the body of the printing device <b>100</b> (and operatively connected to the controller/processor <b>124</b>). The internal and external graphic user interfaces <b>106</b>, <b>136</b> can provide sequential instructions to guide a user through a multi-step process of checking different areas of the media path <b>116</b> to remove a paper jam.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The external and internal graphic user interface displays <b>106</b>, <b>136</b> can be any form of display that is capable of displaying words, directions, instructions, graphic symbols, and the like, (whether now known or developed in the future). Thus, the displays are more than mere lights, but instead comprise an array of pixels (e.g., 32&#xd7;32; 640&#xd7;640; 1080&#xd7;1080, and the like) capable of forming shapes. For example, the external and internal graphic user interface displays <b>106</b>, <b>136</b> can be plastic electronic displays, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), light emitting diode (LED) displays, touch screen displays, plasma displays, cathode ray tube displays, and the like, (or any combination of such displays). The term &#x201c;internal&#x201d; herein means inside or within the body of the printing device <b>100</b>, and &#x201c;external&#x201d; means connected to (or disconnected from) the outside of the printing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b> is positioned to be observable only when the non-transparent doors and drawers <b>240</b> are open. To the contrary, the external graphic user interface display <b>106</b> is visible when the doors and drawers <b>240</b> are open or closed. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the external graphic user interface display <b>106</b> is the only display visible when the doors/drawers <b>240</b> are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The external and internal graphic user interface displays <b>106</b>, <b>136</b> are both operatively connected to the controller/processor <b>124</b>, and the controller/processor <b>124</b> can activate the internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b> only when the door and drawer sensors <b>242</b> detect that at least one of the doors and drawers <b>240</b> is open. For example, both internal graphic user interface displays <b>136</b> are activated and inform the user that the door <b>240</b> is open using the message &#x201c;Door Open!&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Some embodiments can include at least one paper jam clearing mechanism (represented by handles <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>) connected to movable parts of the media path <b>116</b>. The internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b> can be conveniently positioned adjacent to such paper jam clearing mechanism(s) <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the external graphic user interface display <b>106</b> and the internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b> can simultaneously provide the same instructions for clearing a jam within the media path <b>116</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the external and internal graphic user interfaces <b>106</b>, <b>136</b> can simultaneously display an instruction to the user to move handle number <b>202</b> using the message &#x201c;Move Handle <b>202</b>.&#x201d;Moving handle <b>202</b> causes media support element <b>210</b> of the media path <b>116</b> to be lifted off roll element <b>220</b> and help locate the potential paper jam.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, the paper jam clearing mechanisms <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> can comprise a plastic electronic material and can be operatively connected to the controller/processor <b>124</b>. This allows the paper jam clearing mechanisms <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> to optionally light up in coordination with the paper jam clearing instructions that are provided on the internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, if there are multiple internal graphic user interface displays <b>136</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the only display that can be activated is the one closest (relative to all other displays) to the paper jam clearing mechanism <b>202</b> that needs to be operated by the user. In addition, this message can blink or change appearance (change color, brightness, font size, and the like) while being presented on only one of the internal graphic user interface displays <b>106</b> in order to draw the user's attention to the area closest to handle <b>202</b> and allow the user to more easily locate and move handle <b>202</b>. Further, handle <b>202</b> can simultaneously light up, blink, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the message on the internal and external graphic user interfaces <b>106</b>, <b>136</b> changes to instruct the user to sequentially move handles <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> and such handles can light up, blink, and the like, in coordination with the jam clearing instructions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, both internal graphic user interface displays <b>136</b> display the message &#x201c;Move Handle <b>204</b>&#x201d;; while, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, only the internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b> closest to handle <b>206</b> displays the message &#x201c;Move Handle <b>206</b>.&#x201d; Also, the external graphic user interface diplay <b>106</b> may or may not simultaneously display the same message being displayed on the internal graphic user interface displays <b>136</b>, and the internal graphic user interface display <b>136</b> can show an arrow pointing to the handle <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> that needs to be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Method embodiments herein are illustrated in the drawings using a common flowchart, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. More specifically, in item <b>300</b>, an exemplary method embodiment herein automatically detects a paper jam or a maintenance condition that needs servicing within the printing device. At least one non-transparent door and/or drawer on a body of the printing device is opened in item <b>302</b> to provide access to internal areas of the body. In some embodiments, the method can activate the internal graphic user interface display only when door and drawer sensors detect at least one of the doors and drawers being open.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, in item <b>304</b>, the method can provide user instructions to clear the jam or perform the service simultaneously through the external graphic user interface display positioned on the body of the printing device (the external graphic user interface display is visible when the doors and drawers are open or closed) and through at least one internal graphic user interface display within the body of the printing device. Additionally, at the same time, one or more of the handles can light up.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As mentioned above, the internal graphic user interface display is positioned to be observable only when the non-transparent doors and drawers are open to avoid requiring the user to look to the external graphic user interface display when clearing paper jams or performing service within the body of the printing device. Additionally, as also stated above, the internal graphic user interface display can be positioned adjacent to at least one paper jam clearing mechanism within the body of the printing to help draw the user's attention to the paper jam clearing mechanism that needs to be operated.</p>
