<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese patent application serial No. 2009-256700, filed on Nov. 10, 2009, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an integrated gasification combined cycle system provided with a carbon dioxide separation and recovery device and, in particular, to a gasification power generation system provided with a carbon dioxide separation and recovery device in which carbon dioxide contained in exhaust gas discharged from a gas turbine is recovered in the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device, and shift reaction heat generated by a shift reaction to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide is effectively recovered in a shift reactor of the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device in an integrated gasification combined cycle system which generates power by burning gasified fuel gas containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a gas turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There have been techniques to gasify coal and biomass to be used as fuel for gas turbines. In the case of coal gasification, in particular, the representative components of the gas produced are carbon monoxide (55% by volume), hydrogen (20%), nitrogen (20%), carbon dioxide (3%), steam (2%), and others, although they may vary depending on the type of coal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, the shift reaction to obtain carbon dioxide and hydrogen from carbon monoxide and steam, the main components of gas produced in coal gasification, represented by the following equation (1) is generally used in carbon dioxide recovery systems at chemical plants, etc.

</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More specifically, a shift reaction represented by the equation (1) above is caused in a shift reactor, gasified coal is converted into hydrogen and carbon dioxide, then the hydrogen is used as fuel gas for a gas turbine, and the carbon dioxide is absorbed by an absorption liquid at a carbon dioxide absorption tower. This shift reaction is an exothermic reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2008-108621 discloses a technique concerning a fuel cell power generation system provided with a carbon dioxide recovery device having a shift reactor in which a shift reaction converts carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide.

<p id="p-0087" num="0087">In the second embodiment of the gasification power generation system provided with a carbon dioxide separation and recovery system of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the steam generated in the first process gas evaporator <b>6</b> by heat exchange with fuel gas heated by the heat energy of a shift reaction in the shift reactor <b>5</b> and the steam generated in the second process gas evaporator <b>9</b> by heat exchange with fuel gas heated by the heat energy of a shift reaction in the shift reactor <b>7</b> are introduced through the steam line <b>34</b> and the steam line <b>35</b>, respectively, into the shift steam mixer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">The temperature of the fuel gas flown from the first shift reactor <b>5</b> is as high as 400&#xb0; C. However, the fuel gas drops in temperature to 300&#xb0; C. by passing through the first process gas evaporator <b>6</b>. This fuel gas absorbs the reaction heat of a shift catalyst by passing through the second shift reactor <b>7</b> and is heated to 450&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">This fuel gas heated to 450&#xb0; C. drops in temperature to 200&#xb0; C. by passing through the second process gas evaporator <b>9</b>. This fuel gas further drops in temperature to 50&#xb0; C. by passing through a third process gas evaporator <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">The hydrogen-rich fuel gas from which carbon dioxide has been removed in a carbon dioxide flash tank <b>38</b> by separating carbon dioxide from the absorption liquid which has absorbed carbon dioxide contained in a fuel gas in a carbon dioxide absorption tower <b>37</b> of the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device <b>200</b> is heated to 85&#xb0; C. by being pressurized by a compressor <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">Next, the fuel gas pressurized by the compressor <b>41</b> passes through a third fuel gas heater <b>12</b> and is heated to 160&#xb0; C. Then the fuel gas passes through a second fuel gas heater <b>10</b> and is heated to 250&#xb0; C. This fuel gas is further heated to 340&#xb0; C. by passing through a first fuel gas heater <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">After being heated to a temperature equivalent to 340&#xb0; C., which is the temperature of the fuel gas flowing through a shift reactor bypass line <b>2</b> to bypass shift reactors of the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device <b>200</b>, the fuel gas converges with the fuel gas flowing through this shift reactor bypass line <b>2</b> to be supplied to a combustor <b>71</b> of a gas turbine device and burned to drive the gas turbine <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">Meanwhile, the absorption liquid which has absorbed carbon dioxide contained in a fuel gas in the carbon dioxide absorption tower <b>37</b> of the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device <b>200</b> is heated from 80&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. in the carbon dioxide absorption liquid heater <b>39</b> by heat exchange with steam supplied from the third process gas evaporator <b>13</b> through a steam line <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">Then the absorption liquid from the carbon dioxide absorption liquid heater <b>39</b> is supplied to the carbon dioxide flash tank <b>38</b>, where it becomes a lean absorption liquid at 65&#xb0; C. by having the carbon dioxide absorbed in the absorption liquid separated by flashing. The lean liquid from which carbon dioxide has been removed is returned through a lean liquid line <b>49</b> to the carbon dioxide absorption tower <b>37</b>. In other words, the absorption liquid circulates between the carbon dioxide absorption liquid heater <b>39</b> and the carbon dioxide flash tank <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">More specifically, in the second embodiment, a flowing fuel gas is heated by heat energy generated by a shift reaction in the first shift reactor <b>5</b> and the second shift reactor <b>7</b>, and the steam generated by heat exchange with this heated fuel gas is supplied through the steam line <b>34</b> and the steam line <b>35</b> to the steam mixer <b>4</b> to be effectively utilized as shift steam to be used in shift reactors, making it possible to reduce the amount of steam extracted from the exhaust heat recovery boiler <b>20</b> for shifting. As a result, the amount of steam supplied from the exhaust heat recovery boiler <b>20</b> to drive a steam turbine <b>23</b> increases, thus increasing the output of the steam turbine <b>23</b> to improve plant power generation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">Furthermore, the steam generated in the third process gas evaporator <b>13</b> by heat exchange with the fuel gas heated by heat energy of a shift reaction in a shift reactor <b>11</b> is introduced through the steam line <b>36</b> into the carbon dioxide absorption liquid heater <b>39</b> to be utilized in heating the absorption liquid flowing down the carbon dioxide absorption tower <b>37</b>. By effectively utilizing the steam generated by shift reaction heat of shift reactors in the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device <b>200</b>, the power generation efficiency of the gasification power generation system is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">When the present embodiment is applied to a gasification power generation system provided with a carbon dioxide separation and recovery device with a plant output level of 170 MW, the plant power generation efficiency is expected to improve by roughly a few tenths of a percent, although it may vary slightly depending on the type, performance, and circulation amount of the absorption liquid. Since more steam generated by utilizing shift reaction heat is used as steam for a shift reaction in the second embodiment than in the first embodiment, the plant power generation efficiency in the second embodiment is equivalent to or slightly better than that in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">According to the present embodiment, in a gasification power generation system that generates power by burning a gasified fuel gas containing carbon monoxide in a gas turbine, there can be provided a gasification power generation system provided with a carbon dioxide separation and recovery device in which shift reaction heat generated by a shift reaction to convert carbon monoxide contained in a fuel gas into carbon dioxide is effectively recovered in the carbon dioxide separation and recovery device to recover carbon dioxide, and shift steam to supply steam generated by an exhaust heat recovery boiler to a steam mixer is reduced, thereby improving the power generation efficiency of the power generation system.</p>
