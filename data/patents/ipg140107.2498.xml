<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an extract prepared from mutant <i>E. coli </i>cells having a mutation in the ribosomal protein S12 gene, and to a method for producing a protein in a cell-free system using the extract.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A cell-free protein synthesis system using a cell extract is utilized mainly for identification of gene products and for investigation of their activities. For example, the system enables the analysis of functions of synthesized proteins such as the enzymatic activity and DNA binding capability, or the determination of the molecular weight of translated products by labeling them with radioisotopes. Recently, techniques of drastically increasing the production amount in the system have been developed, and the system has become utilized also for protein structure analysis through X-ray crystallography, NMR and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For extracts to perform the translation reaction, those derived from <i>E. coli</i>, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte are commercially available. For an <i>E. coli </i>extract, S-30 cell-free extract reported by Zubay et al. (e.g., see Non-Patent Reference 1) is commonly used. For preparing the <i>E. coli </i>S-30 extract, RNase I-defective strains such as A19 and D10 are used. However, when the target protein is sensitive to proteolytic degradation, <i>E. coli </i>strain B, which is defective in ompT endoprotease and ion protease activities may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For synthesizing mRNA from a cloned cDNA, the cDNA must be introduced into a suitable vector having various promoters. For increasing the protein expression efficiency, intensive promoters for phage-derived polymerases such as T7, T3, and SP6 are used at present, and various systems suitable to various types of template DNAs are commercially available. Using such cell-free systems enables cloned DNA expression in an extremely simplified manner and enables cytotoxic protein synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, it is known that systematic and comprehensive expression of a large number of genes obtained from the recent genome analysis results in the existence of genes of relatively low expression and genes of no expression. It is believed that the low expression of genes may be caused by the reduced efficiency in the translation stage based on the difference in the nucleotide sequence as compared with the genes of higher expression.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, it is known that antibiotics-resistant actinomycetes strains have a property of enhanced producibility of secondary metabolites (antibiotics, etc.), and it is reported that these are derived from the point mutation of ribosomal protein genes. It is suggested that, in these mutants, the conformation of the 16S ribosomal RNA (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;16SrRNA&#x201d;) might change due to the point mutations of the ribosomal protein S12 and S4, which influence the mRNA reading efficiency (e.g., see Non-Patent Reference 2), but the mechanism, by which the mutation of the ribosomal protein enhances the production yield of the secondary metabolites of actinomycetes, is not yet clarified. It is reported that actinomycetes resistant to streptomycin, gentamycin and rifampicin have a property to express an extremely increased amount of a specific transcriptional regulatory protein in the growth stage (e.g., see Non-Patent Reference 3, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). However, nothing has been clarified as yet, relating to the exogenous protein producibility in the extract of such actinomycetes cells. As compared with other bacteria, the growth speed of actinomycetes is slow and the optimum cultivation temperature thereof is low, and thus, it is difficult to provide a large quantity of cell extract of actinomycetes.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to increase the protein producibility by improving the codon reading efficiency of mRNA on ribosome in a cell-free protein synthesis system using an <i>E. coli </i>cell extract.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">We, the present inventors, have studied the culture characteristics of streptomycin-resistant <i>E. coli </i>strains and the protein synthesis activity of the extract thereof, and, as a result, have found that the cell extract prepared from <i>E. coli </i>having a mutation in a specific site of the ribosomal protein S12 has an extremely high protein synthesis activity. On the basis of this finding, we have completed the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cell extract prepared from <i>E. coli </i>having a mutation in the ribosomal protein S12 gene.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the mutation confers a resistance or dependence to streptomycin on <i>E. coli</i>. More preferably, the mutation causes an amino acid substitution in the ribosomal protein S12, and the amino acid substitution is at position 43 of the amino acid sequence represented in SEQ ID NO:2. Even more preferably, the amino acid substitution is a substitution from lysine to threonine. Owing to the ribosomal protein S12 having the amino acid substitution, the mutant strain can grow even in the presence of streptomycin and its cell extract exhibits high protein synthesis activity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a kit for cell-free protein synthesis, which comprises an extract for cell-free protein synthesis prepared from <i>E. coli </i>having a mutation in the ribosomal protein S12 gene, and a mixture comprising an energy regenerating system, at least one amino acid, nucleotide triphosphate, and/or an RNA polymerase. The mixture may be mixed with the <i>E. coli </i>extract just before the protein synthesis reaction, but may be previously mixed with it. Accordingly, in still another aspect thereof, the invention provides a mixture for cell-free protein synthesis, which comprises an extract for cell-free protein synthesis prepared from the above-mentioned <i>E. coli</i>, and at least one selected from the group consisting of an energy regenerating system, at least one amino acid, nucleotide triphosphate, and an RNA polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In still another aspect thereof, the invention further provides a process for producing a protein in a cell-free system. The process comprises preparing a polynucleotide that encodes a protein, and expressing the polynucleotide by the use of the extract for cell-free protein synthesis that is prepared from <i>E. coli </i>having a mutation in the ribosomal protein S12 gene. In some case for expressing a desired polynucleotide, the expression efficiency may be sometimes extremely low depending on the nucleotide sequence of the target polynucleotide, for example, due to any problems of the codon-anticodon pairing on the ribosome. The process of the invention solves the problem by introducing a specific mutation into the ribosomal protein S12, and results in an improvement of the expression efficiency of the polynucleotide that is resistant to express.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferred embodiments of the invention are described hereinunder with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Ribosomal Proteins S12 Mutants, and their Antibiotic Resistance Mechanism)</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The extract of <i>E. coli </i>cells of the invention is prepared by cultivating a mutant <i>E. coli </i>strains having a mutation in the ribosomal protein S12 and extracting the mutant cells. The ribosomal protein S12 is a type of ribosome-constitutive protein. It is known that, in <i>E. coli</i>, the ribosomal protein S12 binds with 16SrRNA to form a small subunit. For example, the amino acid sequence of protein S12 that constitutes the ribosome 308 of <i>E. coli </i>is registered in Acc. No. P02367 in SWISS-PROT, and the amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:2.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A large complex comprising protein and RNA, that is, ribosome catalyzes various processes in the stage of protein translation. The structure and the function of the ribosome are very similar in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and pairs of small subunits gather to form a complex of millions of Daltons. The small subunit controls the binding of mRNA and tRNA, and the large subunit catalyzes the formation of peptide bond.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The elongation of polypeptide chain on ribosome includes binding of an aminoacyl tRNA to the site A on ribosome thereby causing base pairing with three nucleotides of the mRNA having appeared in that site. Next, the carboxyl terminal of the polypeptide chain binding to the tRNA molecule at the site P adjacent to the site A is left away, and a peptide bond is thereby formed by the action of the amino acid binding to the tRNA molecule at the site A and the peptidyl transferase. Finally, the ribosome moves by three nucleotides along the mRNA, and it transfers the peptidyl tRNA newly formed at the site A to the site P.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is known that aminoglycoside-type antibiotics such as streptomycin and hygromycin specifically reduce the translational proof reading activity of ribosome and induce misreading of mRNA codons. In one embodiment of the invention, the mutation of the ribosomal protein S12 can be obtained by screening the mutants that can grow in the presence of an antibiotic such as streptomycin. As a result, by altering its structure and function in protein translation, the mutant ribosome acquires antibiotic resistance in one aspect, and significant influences on the protein translation efficiency and proof reading activity in another aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a mutant strain that has a mutation of improving the protein translation efficiency in the ribosomal protein S12. The mutation may be of any type that gives resistance to or dependence on streptomycin or any other type that does not give such resistance or dependence, so far as it improves the protein synthesis activity of cell extract. Preferably, it has a substitution at any of lysine 43, arginine 86, valine 87, lysine 88, aspartic acid 89, leucine 90, praline 91, glycine 92 or arginine 94 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, as attaining a favorable result. For example, lysine 43 may be substituted with any of other 19 types of natural amino acids, but is preferably substituted with a hydrophilic amino acid, more preferably with threonine for attaining high protein synthesis activity. Lysine 88 may also be substituted with any of other 19 types of natural amino acids, but is preferably with a hydrophilic amino acid, more preferably with arginine for providing an advantageous effect. Leucine 90 or arginine 94 substitution does not bring about resistance to streptomycin but may improve protein synthesis activity. The mutation of the ribosomal protein S12 screened in the presence of an antibiotic is generally for single amino acid substitution, but screening with plural antibiotics enables a mutation with two or more amino acid substitutions. Site-specific mutation and homologous recombination to chromosomal. DNA, as is described hereunder, brings about the formation of a mutant <i>E. coli </i>having a desired amino acid substitution in the ribosomal protein S12.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment of the invention, there is provided a mutant of ribosomal protein S12 that has an excellent protein synthesis activity in the stationary phase of <i>E. coli</i>. For preparing an <i>E. coli S-</i>30 extract, generally employed are cells in a logarithmic growth phase (log phase, exponential phase) having a high protein synthesis activity. The logarithmic growth phase means a phase where the number of bacteria or cells increases logarithmically. When cells are inoculated in a new vessel, they first take a period of time before they could adapt to the new condition (lag phase), and then they grow more and more in the subsequent logarithmic growth phase and the growth of the cells will soon stop depending on the size of the vessel and on the degree of degradation of the culture medium, and thus the cells are in a stationary phase. In general, the cells in the logarithmic growth phase have a higher protein synthesis activity than those in the stationary phase, but they require a larger amount of the culture medium than that in the stationary phase for preparing a predetermined number of cells since the cell concentration is low. Accordingly, if the S-30 extract having a high protein synthesis activity could be prepared from <i>E. coli </i>cells in the stationary stage, then it could be an extremely efficient process. One example of the ribosomal protein S12 mutant having a high protein synthesis activity in the stationary phase is a mutant (K88E) having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 where lysine 88 is substituted with glutamic acid. The reason why the S-30 extract from the cells of the stationary-phase K88E mutant could have a higher protein synthesis activity than the wild strain may be presumed as follows: As a result of investigation of the characteristics of the ribosome in the extracts, the ribosome in the stationary-phase cells of the K88E mutant is more stable than those of the parent strain and the protein synthesis activity per unit ribosome of the mutant is higher than that of the parent strain.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Of the <i>E. coli </i>mutants, those capable of growing in the presence of streptomycin may have the possibility that the translational proof reading activity of the ribosome is improved, or that is, the mRNA codon recognition thereof is more accurate. In general, the codon recognition accuracy means the reduction in the affinity for tRNA of the ribosome, and it is thereby believed that a correct tRNA could be more strictly selected from similar tRNAs competitively bonding to the site A of the ribosome. Accordingly, it is believed that the cell extract of the <i>E. coli </i>mutant of the invention is advantageous in that its protein synthesis amount increases due to the improvement in the translation efficiency thereof and its codon recognition accuracy also increases.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Screening of <i>E. coli </i>Strain Having Mutation at the Ribosomal Protein S12 Gene)</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><i>E. coli </i>strains having a mutation at the gene encoding ribosomal protein S12 (rpsL) may be screened in various methods. One method comprises selecting an <i>E. coli </i>mutant capable of growing in the presence of high-concentration streptomycin. The <i>E. coli </i>mutant of the type may be obtained, for example, by plating a suspension of <i>E. coli </i>cells, either directly as it is or after treatment with UV irradiation, to an agar medium that contains from 5 to 100 times the minimal growth inhibitory concentration of streptomycin (50 to 1000 &#x3bc;g/ml) and harvesting the colonies formed within 2 to 7 days. The <i>E. coli </i>strains applicable to the process include <i>E. coli. </i>A19 (rna,met), BL21, BL21star, BL21codon plus.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another method is as follows: An rpsL gene that has a desired amino acid substitution by introducing a site-specific mutation thereinto is constructed, and this is cloned into a plasmid DNA and is introduced into the chromosomal DNA of <i>E. coli </i>through homologous recombination. The rpsL gene of <i>E. coli </i>is already known, and its nucleotide sequence is registered, for example, in the database of GenBank or DDBJ as Acc No. V00355. The nucleotide sequence that corresponds to the coding region is shown in SEQ ID NO:1. A site-specific mutation is introduced into the rpsL gene cloned from the chromosomal DNA of <i>E. coli </i>through PCR, whereby an amino acid substitution mutation may be introduced into the desired site of the ribosomal protein S12. The method of in-vitro introduction of a site-specific mutation into a cloned DNA includes, for example, a Kunkel method (Kunkel, T. A. et al., Methods Enzymol. 154, 367-382 (1987)); a double primer method (Zoller, M. J. and Smith, M., Methods Enzymol. 154, 329-350 (1987)); a cassette mutation method (Wells, et al., Gene 34, 315-323 (1985)); a mega-primer method (Sarkar, G. and Sommer, S. S., Biotechniques 8, 404-407 (1990)). Next, the mutation-introduced DNA fragment is cloned into a plasmid vector for homologous recombination. The vector has, for example, a chloramphenicol-resistant gene as a selective marker. When the plasmid in which the rpsL gene with the site-specific mutation was inserted, is introduced into <i>E. coli </i>having a DNA recombination capability, for example, <i>E. coli </i>BL21, then it results in homologous recombination. The double recombinant with recombination at two sites of the introduced plasmid and the chromosomal DNA is given streptomycin resistance and is susceptible to chloramphenicol. The two-stage screening provides an <i>E. coli </i>mutant that has the desired rpsL gene inserted into the chromosomal DNA (e.g., see Hosoya et al. (vide supra)).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Preparation of an Extract from the Mutant <i>E. coli </i>Cells)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As an <i>E. coli </i>extract, the S-30 extract prepared by the similar method of Zubay, et al. (supra) can be used. The <i>E. coli</i>. S-30 extract contains all the enzymes and factors from <i>E. coli </i>necessary for transcription and translation. Additionally, supplemental mixture can be added. A concrete S-30 extract is prepared by first culturing the <i>E. coli </i>and harvesting the cells by centrifugation and the like. The recovered cells are washed and resuspended in the buffer, and then lysed or broken with a French press, glass beads, Waring blender, or the like. The insoluble matter of disrupted <i>E. coli </i>cells is removed by centrifugation and the supernatant is then combined with a pre-incubation mixture and incubated. While this operation degrades the endogenous DNA and RNA, it may further include a step of adding a calcium salt or microccocal nuclease to degrade contaminating nucleic acids. The extract is then dialyzed to remove endogenous amino acids, nucleic acids nucleosides etc., stored in liquid nitrogen or &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. after dispensing appropriate aliquots.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For performing a protein synthesis reaction, the S-30 extract is supplemented with all or a portion of the followings: Tris-acetate, dithiothreitol (DTT), the NTPs (ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP), phosphoenol pyruvate, pyruvate kinase, at least one amino acid (20 naturally occurring amino acids including derivatives thereof. In case of labeling the protein with a radioisotope, rests of a radio-labeled amino acid are added.), polyethylene glycol (PEG), folic acid, cAMP, tRNA, ammonium acetate, potassium acetate, potassium glutamate, an optimized concentration of magnesium acetate, and the like. These supplemental solutions are usually stored separately from the S-30 extract, and then combined just before use. Alternatively, the reaction mixture can be made by combining an S-30 extract and supplemental mix, freezing and thawing the combination to remove the RNA degradsomes (see International Publication WO 01/83805).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present invention, an energy regeneration system may preferably be a combination of 0.02 to 5 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l creatine kinase (CK) and 10 to 100 mM creatine phosphate (CP), to which it is not limited, and any known substance may be employed, such as a combination of 1 to 20 mM phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and 0.01 to 1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l pyruvate kinase and the like. Any of PK and CK is an enzyme which regenerates an ATP from an ADP, and requires PEP and CP as respective substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The cell extract or supplemental mix can be distributed as a product easy for use in aliquots. These products can be stored at frozen or dried state, and distributed as a kit in suitable containers for storage and for shipment to users. The kit can be accompanied by an instruction manual, a positive control DNA, a vector DNA and the like.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Protein Synthesis in Cell-Free Protein Synthesis System)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Protein synthesis in a cell-free protein synthesis system includes a system where transcription and translation are separately effected in different test tubes like that for the nucleus and the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, and a transcription/translation coupling system where the two are effected simultaneously. In the method of protein production of the invention, an extract of prokaryotic cells, <i>E. coli </i>is used, and the method is applicable to any of such reaction systems. For the invention, however, the transcription/translation coupling system is preferred in which any unstable mRNA is not directly processed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, a polynucleotide that encodes the protein to be expressed is prepared. In the invention, the &#x201c;protein&#x201d; may be any of a full-length protein having a biological activity or a polypeptide fragment of a part of such a full-length protein. Many proteins, especially many eukaryotic proteins have plural domain structures as a result of evolution through gene duplication, in which each domain has a structure and a function characteristic of itself. Accordingly, it is extremely effective to express such proteins according to the method of the invention. The nucleic acid that encodes the intended protein may be either DNA or RNA, and it may be extracted from the cells or tissues of eukaryotes or prokaryotes in any known method. DNA cloned from a cDNA library and the like according to a known method is also employable herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For in-vitro synthesis of mRNA from a cloned cDNA, for example, employable is a phage-derived transcriptional system such as that from T7, T3 or SP6, or an <i>E. coli</i>-derived transcriptional system. For mRNA synthesis by the use of the system, employable are any commercially-available kits such as MEGAscript (Ambion's trade name) and RiboMAX (Promega's trade name). The distance and the base sequence of the 5&#x2032;-non-translational region between the translation initiation codon (ATG) and the promoter are important, and the region must include the SD sequence of <i>E. coli</i>. After a desired gene has been inserted into a suitable vector, the plasmid DNA is purified according to an alkali-SDS method or by the use of a DNA-coupling resin. Alternatively, using a primer that contains the promoter, the DNA fragment amplified through PCR may be used as a template. This is an extremely simple and rapid method for simultaneously processing different types of samples. In a transcription/translation coupling system, the plasmid DNA prepared herein or the PCR product can be directly used as the template in the cell-free protein synthesis system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A semi-batch process where a small-molecule substrate such as ATP, GTP, amino acid or creatine phosphate is supplied to the reaction mixture via a dialytic membrane or an ultrafilter while the waste is removed; and a continuous process where the product is also removed via the membrane are reported. According to these processes, the reaction time may be prolonged by 5 to tens times, and a large quantity of protein can be synthesized. For example, according to a Kigawa et al's process (Kigawa, T., et al., FEBS Letters 1999, 442:15-19) or to the method described in JP-A 2000-175695, the above-mentioned reaction mixture is introduced inside the space of a dialytic membrane that has a molecular cutoff level of at least 10,000, preferably at least 50,000, and this is dialyzed against a dialytic external liquid (including amino acid, energy source) of from 5 to 10 volume times the reaction mixture. The dialysis is carried out generally at 20 to 40&#xb0; C., preferably at 23 to 30&#xb0; C. with stirring, and at the time when the reaction speed is lowered, the dialytic external liquid is exchanged with a fresh one. The producibility in the optimized cell-free protein synthesis system is far higher than that in an intracellular system as in <i>E. coli </i>cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The invention is described more concretely in the following Examples. In the Examples, an <i>E. coli </i>strain BL21 was used as a parent strain, and the colonies having grown in the presence of streptomycin were screened to give 9 mutants. These mutants were analyzed for their properties such as protein synthesis activity.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Mutants from a parent strain, E, coil BL21 were screened for those capable of growing in the presence of streptomycin. 150 streptomycin-resistant spontaneous mutants of <i>E. coli</i>. BL21 were obtained, and these were sequenced for the full-length rpsL gene. As a result, it was confirmed that about 80% of the resistant mutants have a mutation in the rpsL gene. Nine such rpsL mutants were obtained, and their typical strains are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, SmR in the phenotype column means streptomycin resistance; and SmD means streptomycin dependence.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is understood that the amino acid substitution at position 43 of the ribosomal protein S12 has a significant influence on the protein synthesis activity. In particular, the protein synthesis activity of the K43T mutant was about 1.3 times that of the wild type (WT) BL21. In the Table below <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown are the data of the protein concentration of the extract from each <i>E. coli </i>strain and the 260 nm absorbance thereof (this essentially indicates the nucleic acid concentration of the extract). From the data, it is understood that there is no direct relationship between the variations in the protein amount and the nucleic acid amount in each extract and the protein synthesis activity of the extract.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Characteristic Evaluation of Various <i>E. coli </i>Mutant Strains</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At a fixed Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 20 mM or 5 mM, an S-30 extract was prepared from wild-type <i>E. coli </i>and <i>E. coli </i>mutants (K43T, K43R) in the same manner as in Example 3. The extract was put on a buffer (20 mM HEPES, 20 mM or 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 4.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) containing from 6 to 38% of sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 17000 rpm for 17 hours by the use of a Beckman SW28 rotor. Then, this was divided into fractions of 0.8 ml each. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the vertical axis indicates an estimated value of the ribosome-existing fraction through presumption of the 260 nm absorbance of the sample. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is understood that, in the wild-type <i>E. coli</i>, a part of the 70S ribosome dissociated to give a 30S subunit at the low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 5 mM. This is remarkable in the K43R mutant, in which a large part of the 70S ribosome dissociated into subunits 50S and 30S at the low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 5 mM. As opposed to this, the K43T mutant showed little dissociation of the 70S ribosome even at the low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. These results suggest that the K43T mutation in the ribosomal protein S12 may stabilize the total ribosomal structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Protein Synthesis from Various Mouse cDNAs</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Using various mouse cDNAs as templates, protein synthesis was carried out in an S-30 extract from wild-type and K43T mutant <i>E. coli</i>, in which the protein synthesis activity was evaluated. Three clones obtained from a mouse cDNA library (DDBJ Accession Nos. AK003622, AK010399 and AK019487) were used as templates. According to the two-step polymerase chain reaction (2-step PCR) a DNA fragment was prepared by adding a T7 promoter, an SD sequence and a T7 terminator to the cDNA. First, the first PCR was carried out using the primer pair of the nucleotide sequence shown in Table 3.</p>

After the reaction, this was roughly purified with Ni-NTA agarose beads, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the protein was stained with a fluorescent dye SYPRO Orange protein gel stains (by Molecular Probes). The band corresponding to the molecular weight of the synthesized protein was detected with a luminoimage analyzer LAS-1000 (by Fuji Photo Film), and quantified. Thus determined, the amount of the three proteins produced in the extract of the mutant K43T was compared with that produced in the wile type, and the data are given in Table 4. It is understood that the amount of the protein expressed by any of the clones A, B and C in the extract from the mutant K43T was larger by 1.5 to 2 times or more, than that expressed in the extract from the wild-type <i>E. coli</i>.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Mutant and wild-type (BL21) cells of <i>E. coli </i>in the mid-log phase (L phase), stationary phase 1 (S1 phase) and stationary phase 2 (S2 phase) obtained in Example 1 were used to prepare cell-free extracts, and these were analyzed in point of their protein synthesis activity. Using an ordinary liquid medium, the cells were cultivated to prepare seed cultures. The seed culture was inoculated into 7 liters of 2&#xd7;YT medium in a fermentor, and incubated therein with full aeration with stirring at 400 rpm at 37&#xb0; C. This was periodically sampled out for 24 hours after the start of the incubation, and the turbidity of each sample (as 600 nm absorbance) was measured, from which the amount of the cells was estimated. As a result, it is understood that the growing speed of the K88E mutant was significantly lower than that of the wild-type <i>E. coli</i>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the growth curves of the K88E mutant cultivated with or without streptomycin added thereto are shown. In both cases, the growing speed of the mutant cells was significantly low, and the amount of the mutant cells having grown within 24 hours is about a half of that the wild-type cells. The other mutants gave nearly the same growth curve as that of the wild-type strain.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The mid-log phase (L phase) of the K43R, K43N and K43T mutants and the wild-type strain (WT) was at OD600=3; and that of the K88E mutant is after 6 hours from the start of cultivation. The S1 phase of all the strains is after 9 hours from the start of cultivation; and the S2 phase thereof is after 24 hours from the start of cultivation. The cells in these phases were collected, and an <i>E. coli. </i>5-30 extract was prepared from these in the same manner as in Example 3, and the CAT protein mass was determined. The 260 nm absorbance of the S-30 extract was measured, and the amount of crude ribosome was obtained, and the CAT synthesis amount per unit ribosome is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. From the results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is understood that the CAT synthesis activity of the S-30 extract prepared from the L-phase cells of the K43T mutant was the highest, and the CAT synthesis activity of the S-30 extract prepared from the S2-phase cells of the K88E mutant was the highest. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the vertical axis indicates the value obtained by dividing the CAT synthesis amount (&#x3bc;g) by the 260 nm absorbance (A260) for the crude ribosome amount in the S-30 extract.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The cell extract prepared from the <i>E. coli </i>mutant of the invention has a specific mutation at the ribosomal protein S12, and as compared with that from wild-type <i>E. coli </i>cells, it shows a significantly higher protein synthesis activity. There is a possibility that the ribosomal protein S12 mutant may have an influence on the codon reading efficiency of mRNA in the translation stage, and therefore there is a probability that the mutant may have the ability to noticeably increase the expression efficiency of mRNA of which the production amount was small in a conventional method. In particular, of the <i>E. coli </i>mutants of the invention, those capable of growing in the presence of streptomycin may readily prevent their culture from being contaminated with any other external cells, and an extract for cell-free protein synthesis can be efficiently prepared from them.</p>
