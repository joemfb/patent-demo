<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a drive arrangement for a reel and a chaff spreader of a combine, having a first hydraulic motor for driving the reel and a second hydraulic motor for driving the chaff spreader.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to pick up harvested crops, combines are fitted with cutting units which are equipped with cutter bars for cutting the crop, a reel which is arranged above the latter and rotates during operation, and a transverse conveying device in the form, for example, of a worm or a plurality of conveying belts. During operation, the reel presses the crop rearwards and downwards opposite to the forward direction in order to make it easier to cut the plants with the cutter bar. Besides mechanical drives, hydraulic drives for the reel are also known.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, many combines are equipped with pairs of chaff spreaders, which are arranged downstream of the cleaning device with regard to the flow direction of the harvested crop residues and are used to spread the harvested crop residues remaining at the end of the upper sieve, which are substantially chaff and relatively large pieces of straw. These chaff spreaders, too, are usually hydraulically driven. See for example DE 35 44 157 C1.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, the hydraulic reel drive motor is assigned a dedicated pump for driving it. See for example DE 100 12 056 A1. It was also proposed to connect the reel drive motor in series with a hydraulic motor which drives a rotating stem divider. See for example DE 102 06 541 A1. It was also proposed to connect the reel drive motor in series with hydraulic motors for driving conveying belts of the cutting unit. See for example EP 1 055 359 A1. Similarly, the hydraulic motors are assigned a dedicated hydraulic pump for driving the chaff spreader.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is the object of the invention to create a drive arrangement, which is simplified compared with the prior art, for a reel and a chaff spreader of a combine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is achieved according to the invention by the teaching of Claim <b>1</b>, wherein the further claims contain features which develop the solution in an advantageous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A drive arrangement for a reel and a chaff spreader of a combine comprises a first hydraulic motor for driving the reel and second hydraulic motor, connected in series therewith regard to the flow of hydraulic fluid, for driving the chaff spreader.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this way, a single pump is sufficient to drive both hydraulic motors at the same time. Which of the hydraulic motors lies upstream and which downstream is arbitrary in the context of the concept of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, two chaff spreaders are present, to which is assigned in each case one second hydraulic motor. The second hydraulic motors are expediently connected in series, although a parallel connection would also be possible.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the hydraulic motors have a fixed displacement volume and are driven by a pump having a fixed delivery volume. In order to adjust the rotational speed, in each case one proportional valve is arranged in the supply lines to the hydraulic motors. In another embodiment, however, one or both hydraulic motors and/or the pump may have an adjustable displacement volume. The rotational speeds are then preferably regulated by a controller which is able to adjust all the swash plates.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order, in the case of hydraulic motors which cannot be adjusted and a pump having a fixed delivery volume, to enable the rotational speeds to be adjusted independently by the proportional valves, without in each case changing the rotational speed of the other hydraulic motor, it is proposed to bridge the upstream connections of the proportional valves and the downstream connections of the hydraulic motors in each case by control valves. The control valves maintain a defined pressure and/or flow in the connecting line between the first and second hydraulic motors and can be actuated by the pressure at the downstream connection of the associated proportional valves.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A combine <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is supported on front driven and rear steerable wheels <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, respectively, and has a driver's cabin <b>16</b> from which it can be operated by a driver. The driver's cabin <b>16</b> is adjoined to the rear by a grain tank <b>18</b> which can discharge material which has been discharged into it to the outside through an emptying pipe <b>20</b>. The grain tank <b>18</b> is mounted on a frame <b>22</b>, in which supplied material is broken down into its large and small constituents on the route via a threshing drum <b>24</b>, a threshing cage <b>26</b> and a turning drum <b>28</b>. A further separation of the harvested material is carried out on subsequent straw walkers <b>30</b>, and also on a preparation floor <b>32</b> and sieves <b>34</b>, wherein the threshed portion of material is then conveyed into the grain tank <b>18</b>, the large pieces of harvested material are deposited on the ground via the straw walkers <b>30</b> and light constituents are supplied from the sieves <b>34</b>, via a conveying floor <b>58</b> or by the air flow of the fan <b>36</b>, to two chaff spreaders <b>60</b> which are arranged laterally adjacent to one another and distribute said light constituents likewise on the ground. The chaff spreaders <b>60</b> are driven by hydraulic motors <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; (motor <b>62</b>&#x2032; best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Material lying or standing on the ground is supplied, via a draw-in channel <b>40</b> in the form of an inclined conveyor and a stone trap <b>42</b>, to the threshing drum <b>24</b> once it has been picked up from the ground by a header <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The header <b>38</b> in the embodiment illustrated is a cutting unit, on the front side of which a cutter bar <b>44</b> moving to and fro is located. A frame <b>46</b> of the crop harvesting device <b>38</b> further supports a screw conveyor <b>48</b> having turns <b>50</b> encircling a central pipe. Above and in front of the screw conveyor <b>48</b> is located a reel <b>52</b> which serves to feed standing material to the cutter bar <b>44</b> and the screw conveyor <b>48</b>. The reel <b>52</b> is connected at its two ends to the frame <b>46</b> via reel carrier arms <b>54</b> and is driven about its longitudinal axis by a hydraulic motor <b>56</b>, so that it rotates in the anticlockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a hydraulic diagram of the drive arrangement of the reel <b>52</b> and the chaff spreader <b>60</b>.

The second proportional valve <b>70</b> can be controlled electromagnetically by an operator in the driver's cabin <b>16</b> or by a suitable control means, in order to be able to adapt the speed of the chaff spreader <b>60</b> manually or automatically to the respective harvesting conditions and the cutting unit width of the header <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The hydraulic motors <b>56</b> and <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; are thus connected hydraulically in series. They are driven by a single pump <b>66</b>, thereby reducing the outlay for the drive arrangement compared with separate drive systems for the hydraulic motors <b>56</b> on the one hand and <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; on the other hand. It would also be possible to connect the pump <b>66</b> to the inlet of the hydraulic motor <b>62</b> and to connect the outlet of the latter to the hydraulic motor <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to prevent the speed of the hydraulic motors <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; changing when the proportional valve <b>68</b> is adjusted, and similarly to prevent the speed of the hydraulic motor <b>56</b> changing when the proportional valve <b>70</b> is adjusted, the control valves <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The control valve <b>72</b> is arranged between the lines <b>78</b> and <b>84</b> and is controlled, on the one hand, by the pressure in the line <b>78</b> and, on the other hand, by the pressure in the line <b>80</b>, through which its control connection shown at the top is connected via a throttle <b>94</b>, here shown as a hydraulic fluid flow restrictor. When, with the proportional valve <b>68</b> open, the hydraulic flow through the line <b>80</b> and thus through the hydraulic motor <b>56</b> is large, approximately the same pressure is present at the control connection shown at the top as is present at the control connection shown at the bottom, and so the spring <b>96</b> moves the control valve into the closed position. On the other hand, if the proportional valve <b>68</b> is closed, the pressure on the line <b>78</b> opens the control valve <b>72</b>, and so, in this case, too, sufficient pressure and flow is available in the line <b>84</b> to drive the hydraulic motors <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The control valve <b>74</b> is arranged between the lines <b>84</b> and <b>76</b> (instead of being connected to the line <b>76</b>, it could also be connected by a separate line to the hydraulic fluid reservoir <b>64</b>) and is controlled, on the one hand, by the pressure in the line <b>84</b> and, on the other hand, by the pressure in the line <b>88</b>, through which its control connection shown at the top is connected via a throttle <b>98</b>, shown here+ as a hydraulic fluid flow restrictor. When, with the proportional valve <b>70</b> open, the hydraulic flow through the line <b>88</b> and thus through the hydraulic motors <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; is large, approximately the same pressure is present at the control connection shown at the top as is present at the control connection shown at the bottom, and so the spring <b>100</b> moves the control valve into the closed position. On the other hand, if the proportional valve <b>70</b> is closed, the pressure on the line <b>84</b> opens the control valve <b>74</b>, and so, in this case, too, sufficient flow is possible in the line <b>84</b> to divert the hydraulic fluid of the hydraulic motor <b>56</b> into the hydraulic fluid reservoir <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should also be noted that pressure limiting valves (not shown) can be added between the lines <b>78</b> and <b>76</b>, between the lines <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> and between the lines <b>88</b> and <b>92</b>. Furthermore, the pressure of the pump <b>66</b>, in addition to driving a reversing motor (not shown), can be used for the inclined conveyor <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims.</p>
