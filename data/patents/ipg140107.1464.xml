<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to storm sewers and, more particularly, to a curb-mounted box for funnelling water from streets into a storm sewer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many cities, curb-mounted boxes are installed to define inlets to storm sewers at the sides of streets and highways. The inlet boxes are built into the curbs and have vertical and horizontal walls with surfaces nominally matched respectively to vertical and horizontal surfaces on the curb. The vertical face of the box has a rectangular entry opening that communicates to a chamber bounded by the box and in turn to the sewer conduit. The bottom of the entry opening is flush with or below the street grade so that water can flow freely thereinto. Typically, the street surface will be crowned so that water on the street surface flows laterally oppositely towards the curbs. The lateral street edges and curb vertical surface cooperatively funnel water, with this region being sloped towards the box location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With this well-known construction, the front wall of the box frames the entry opening, with the top, horizontally extending frame portion having vertical and horizontal surfaces that cooperatively produce a corner that is nominally matched to the top corner region of the adjacent curb. Thus, this top frame element, which bridges adjacent curb edges, functions generally in the same manner as the curb.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Street curbs are made from concrete that is designed to withstand forces and impacts as from normal vehicular traffic as well as blades on snow removal equipment. Storm sewer boxes have been cast from concrete to have the same durability. However, by reason of the fact that the entry opening on the box is formed through the front wall thereof, particularly the upper horizontal frame element is susceptible to being damaged upon being impacted, particularly by the edges of blades on snow removal equipment. Even if the concrete forming the front box wall is reinforced so that it is not prone to being broken off, progressive chipping inevitably results that over time produces a jagged edge that may reconfigure the entry opening undesirably and also creates an unsightly external appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is known to place an angle iron component on the top corner of the box to address the above condition. However, this angle iron piece is prone to being torn off by becoming snagged by snow removal blades. Once removed, the underlying concrete edge is exposed and prone to being compromised, as described above. Further, the protective angle iron piece, once removed, becomes deposited upon the street or adjacent area whereupon it may be dangerously situated in the path of vehicular or pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively, upon being snagged, as by a blade on snow removal equipment, part of the protective angle iron piece may be bent outwardly to project dangerously in the path of a vehicle or pedestrian on foot.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another problem may be encountered upon the protective angle iron piece being broken away from the remainder of the box. With the snow removal vehicles traveling at relatively high rates of speed, the angle iron piece could be propelled dangerously towards adjacent vehicles or individuals on foot.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once the concrete boxes are compromised, there are number of repair options. One option is to replace the entire box. The replacement box may be of the same construction or alternatively a molded non-concrete structure may be substituted. The assignee herein currently offers the latter type of boxes, as shown on its website www.accu-rise.com. This design commonly is used to replace cast iron boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, many municipalities wish to use only concrete boxes. In the event that damage is inflicted upon the boxes, the primary options remain to either replace the entire box with a like box or effect repairs of the damaged box, which typically involves reshaping with concrete at least the upper frame component region on the front wall. This reconstruction generally involves replacing the broken away regions of the box with new concrete. This process addresses primarily cosmetic concerns, as the added concrete may not be adhered adequately to the remainder of the concrete to withstand any significant impact.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Regardless of the manner in which compromised boxes are brought up to desired standards, whether by replacement or repair, the exercise is time consuming and expensive. This is particularly a problem since it can be anticipated that repair of concrete boxes will be a large volume, routine activity following each winter season.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one form, the invention is directed to a storm sewer box for directing water into a storm sewer conduit at a curb location. The storm sewer box has a housing with a front, a top and spaced sides. The housing has a chamber and a front entry opening that communicates to the housing chamber. The housing has a first surface that at least nominally matches an adjacent curb surface at the front of the housing with the storm sewer box operatively mounted at a curb location. The housing includes: a) at least one component that defines the first surface; and b) a base to which the at least one component is connected. The at least one component is separable from the base to be replaced by at least one other component upon the base.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one form, the housing has a top opening covered by a separable cover.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one form, the housing defines a frame around the front entry opening and the frame has contoured surfaces that funnel incoming water into the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one form, the at least one component defines a horizontal surface to match an adjacent curb surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one form, the at least one component defines a vertical surface to match an adjacent curb surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one form, the frame fully surrounds the front entry opening.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one form, the storm sewer box is operatively incorporated into a storm sewer conduit on a roadway with a curb and between spaced edges on the curb.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one form, the roadway has an upper surface over a road base and the housing has an upwardly facing locking edge that resides below the upper roadway surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one form, the locking edge is defined by a step that is embedded in the road base.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one form, the at least one component is secured by at least one separable fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one form, the fastener has joinable parts with one of the joinable parts fixed to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one form, the housing is formed through a molding process.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one form, the at least one component is a plurality of components that extend along the top and front of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention is also directed to a method of repairing a storm sewer box that is used to direct water into a storm sewer conduit at a curb location and consists of a housing with a front, top and spaced sides. The housing has a base made from a first material, with the housing defining a chamber and a front entry opening that communicates to the housing chamber. The housing further includes a first surface that at least nominally matches an adjacent curb surface at the front of the housing with the storm sewer box operatively mounted at the curb location. The method includes the steps of: removing a first portion of the housing with a first shape and defining at least a part of the first surface that has been damaged with the storm sewer box operatively mounted at the curb location; and replacing the first portion of the housing with at least one repair component having a second shape that functions in substantially the same manner as the first portion of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one form, the first portion of the housing is defined by at least one component having the first shape that is joined to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one form, the at least one component is made from a second material that is different than the first material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one form, the at least one component is made from an elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one form, the first portion of the housing is integrally formed with the base and removed by being cut from the base.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one form, the first portion of the housing comprises at least one separate component that is releasably attached to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one form, the at least one separate component is releasably attached through at least one threaded fastener.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The storm sewer box <b>10</b> is operatively mounted at a curb location. More specifically, a curb <b>32</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, is provided at the side of a roadway/street <b>33</b> and has a vertical front surface <b>34</b> and a horizontal top surface <b>36</b>. The surface <b>36</b> is flush with the ground surface <b>37</b> adjacent the street <b>33</b> and above the street level. The surface <b>36</b> typically has a width W<b>1</b> of 5-6 inches. The surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> meet at a rounded nose/corner <b>38</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bottom of the curb front blends into a horizontally extending wall <b>39</b>, having a thickness T on the order of 6 inches and an upper surface <b>40</b> that is flush with a street surface <b>41</b> as may be defined by an asphalt layer over which vehicular traffic moves. The surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>40</b> cooperatively define a &#x201c;gutter&#x201d; that guides water flow along the lengthwise extent of the curb <b>32</b> at the side of the street <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Typically, the storm sewer box <b>10</b> will be integrated into and will reside partially above and partially below the street surface <b>41</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>. The curb <b>32</b> will either be cut out or formed so that adjacent, but spaced, edges <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> respectively conform to the sides <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> on the housing <b>12</b>. The curb top surface <b>36</b> will be generally flush with the top <b>16</b> of the housing <b>12</b> with a top and front corner/nose <b>46</b> of the housing <b>12</b> bridging the adjacent curb sections and shaped to nominally match the curb nose/corner <b>38</b> on each. With this arrangement, a plow, or the like, will be guided smoothly along the vertical curb region at the nose/corner <b>38</b> on the curb edge <b>42</b>, to and along the vertical housing region at the corner/nose <b>46</b>, and therefrom smoothly to and along the vertical curb region at the nose/corner <b>38</b> on the curb edge <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The housing <b>12</b> has an upwardly facing locking edge <b>48</b> defined by a step <b>50</b> at the front <b>14</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. With the housing <b>12</b> set at its desired operative location, an anchoring element <b>52</b> with a projecting anchoring component <b>54</b>, is embedded in the adjacent road base <b>56</b> so that a downwardly facing surface <b>58</b> on the anchoring element <b>52</b> abuts to the locking edge <b>48</b> on the housing <b>12</b> to block upward movement of the housing <b>12</b> once the same is operatively mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With the sewer box <b>10</b> operatively mounted, water from the street surface <b>41</b> can flow in the direction of the arrow <b>60</b> to and through the front entry opening <b>30</b> into the chamber <b>28</b> from where the water is directed into a storm sewer conduit <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the front <b>14</b> of the storm sewer box <b>10</b> defines a generally rectangular frame <b>64</b> around the front entry opening <b>30</b>. In the depicted embodiment, this frame <b>64</b> is defined by three components&#x2014;spaced vertical side frame components <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, and a horizontally extending upper frame component <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The side frame components <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> respectively have contoured/curved front surfaces <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> tending to funnel the incoming water into the chamber <b>28</b>. The upper frame component <b>70</b> has a similarly curved surface <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As noted in the Background portion herein, particularly blades on snow removal equipment guided along the curb <b>32</b> and storm sewer box <b>10</b>, may tend to damage the region at the corner/nose <b>46</b> on the frame component <b>70</b>, particularly when the storm sewer box <b>10</b> is constructed from concrete. This damage may be progressive or may occur upon a single impact. In any event the result is generally an unsightly appearance at the front of the storm sewer box <b>10</b>. In a worst case, the depth of the damage may be such that a subsequent pass of a blade may cause the same to shift laterally inwardly to thereby have a greater tendency to further damage the storm sewer box <b>10</b> and/or impact and damage the adjacent curb edge <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once the damage occurs, the primary options for repair are to either replace the entire storm sewer box <b>10</b> or add material to any part broken away to attempt to re-form the original shape at the corner/nose <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the invention, a first portion <b>78</b> of the housing <b>12</b>, as bounded by the dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, is removed. The first portion <b>78</b> has a generally rectangular shape in cross-section spanning between the sides <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> on the housing <b>12</b> and, in this case, the first portion <b>78</b> defines the entire length of the corner/nose <b>46</b> that is prone to being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>, the first portion <b>78</b> of the housing <b>12</b> is replaced with at least one repair component, and in this case three repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>, and <b>80</b><i>c </i>that cooperatively define an inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape. Cooperatively, the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>define a shape that is substantially the same as the first portion <b>78</b> or at least that is similar enough in shape to function in substantially the same manner as the first portion <b>78</b>. The components <b>80</b><i>a</i>, <b>80</b><i>b</i>, <b>80</b><i>c </i>cooperatively define horizontal and vertical surfaces S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, that respectively nominally match curb surfaces <b>36</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is preferred, but not required, that the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>be made from a different material than that making up the base <b>22</b> to which the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>are joined. This allows the properties of different materials to be exploited in each component. For example, the base <b>22</b> may be made from any material, such as metal, a molded material, such as an elastomeric material, or a composite. As one example, the base <b>22</b> might be made from reinforced, or non-reinforced, concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one preferred form, the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>are made from an elastomeric material and are each configured as blocks with substantial fore-and-aft and vertical dimensional thickness. The use of an elastomer is not critical, as the components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>might likewise be made from the same types of non-elastomeric materials contemplated for the base <b>22</b>. The fore-and-aft thickness T<b>1</b> of the material of the first portion <b>78</b> is selected so that the first portion <b>78</b> functions as a resilient bumper by reason of the material thereof and block shapes. It has been found that if the thickness T<b>1</b> is less than three inches, a blade may compress and slice through the material. However, if the thickness T<b>1</b> is greater than three inches, and preferably on the order of six inches, the material will give adequately so that it is not sliced fully through. Commonly, the blade will produce cuts with a shallow enough depth that the flaps/pieces formed by cutting will spring back so that the material restores to its original shape once the blade passes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The damaged portion of the housing <b>12</b> may be cut out, at the installation site, as by a conventional saw, in the aforementioned shape to accommodate the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, the housing <b>12</b> can initially be made with one or more replaceable components, corresponding in shape and function to the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c</i>. These components could be formed in place or could be accommodated by a pre-formed seat <b>82</b> of a shape corresponding to the component(s), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. By pre-forming the seat <b>82</b>, mounting anchors <b>84</b>, as in the form of threaded fasteners, might be embedded into the base <b>22</b>. Each of the repair or original components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>can have stepped bores <b>86</b> into which the threaded ends <b>88</b> of the anchors <b>84</b> project. A nut <b>90</b> can be tightened to the threaded end <b>88</b> of each anchor <b>84</b> to captively secure a part <b>92</b> of each component <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>against the vertical wall surface <b>94</b> bounding the seat <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With this latter arrangement, at time of manufacture, the components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>can be assembled after formation of the base <b>22</b> or otherwise co-formed with the base. In the event that one or more of the components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>is damaged, it can be removed on site by loosening the nuts <b>90</b> associated with the particular component <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c</i>. A similar or identical component <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>can then be used to replace the damaged component(s) <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As noted above, while the components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>are shown as three in number, one, two, or more than three, components might be incorporated consistent with the inventive concepts.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the event that the anchors <b>84</b> are not molded into the base <b>22</b>, the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>in the field might be anchored on site using conventional anchors that may be set by drilling into the concrete, or other material, making up the base <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should also be understood that while an elastomer material is described as preferred for the components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c</i>, other materials could be utilized for repair that may be potentially temporary or more permanent in nature. For example, it is conceivable that the repair components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c </i>might be made from wood, or other non-concrete material, with the expectation of replacement with a more permanent structure at a later date. While not preferred, concrete could be used to make the components <b>80</b><i>a</i>-<b>80</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The foregoing disclosure of specific embodiments is intended to be illustrative of the broad concepts comprehended by the invention.</p>
