<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Security systems to keep track of dispensing and return of containers</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Containers of some materials are important enough to keep track of. The materials can be pepper spray, can be tear gas related, can be known by the chemical name OC (standing for oleoresin capsicum), and can be sold under the MACE trademark. Such materials are controlled substances and are used by police, jailers, and the military. They can be sprayed or squirted at an assailant to stop or limit an injury that might otherwise occur.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A convenient container for such materials is a pressurized spray can that can be deployed quickly. It may also be possible to package such materials in pumpable cans or bottles, and the outflow from containers of such materials can be formed as a squirt or spray.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many situations, containers of OC materials need to be stored securely and checked out and checked back in at shift changes for workers such as police or jailers. Securing the dispensing and return of many containers of OC materials has presented an administrative burden that this invention aims to reduce.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment of the invention provides a security system that dispenses and accepts the return of containers, keeps track of users of the containers, and ensures that containers to be reused hold a sufficient amount of material. Automating the dispensing and return of containers saves considerable labor in otherwise keeping track of a large number of containers and their users. Besides automation, the security system aims at low cost, and high reliability in providing data on authorized users, containers dispensed to authorized users, incidents of container usage, and return of containers to storage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The described embodiment also checks the weight of OC material in containers returned for storage. This can identify a weight loss discovered in a previously dispensed container and can require a report from an authorized user. It also allows a security system to distinguish between containers that are loaded with sufficient OC material to be effective, and containers that are insufficiently loaded to be reused. The readable identification for each container allows records to be automatically available on who checked out which container, how much that container weighed, and who is presenting that container back to storage and how much it weighs when presented.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For security purposes, each container is given a machine readable ID by which each of the containers in a system can be distinguished. The ID can involve RFID, bar code, optical characters, or preferably a touch memory button such as a Dallas iButton. Other forms of ID are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition to a container ID, the security system preferably includes a scale that weighs containers to keep track of the weight of the contents of each container. Container weight can lessen by slow leakage, or by sudden discharge of some of the contents. Either occurrence can reduce weight below a minimum and is worth noting. The effective spray or squirt distance from a container depends mostly on how full the container is.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Keeping track of the weight of material in containers has several advantages. A container presented for return to storage with a weight less than it had when checked out can be an event that requires a report on where, when, and why the container was discharged. The weight of a container can also show that the container was not discharged since it was checked out, and the system can distinguish a reusable weight from a non-reusable weight. For example, a normal weight range can represent a sufficient weight of material remaining in a container for it to be effective in stopping an assailant. Conversely, a weight outside the normal range can show that a container is not effective for its intended purpose and should be withdrawn from circulation. The scale can also detect something substituted for a container if it weighs less than an empty container or more than a full container. By performing these functions, weight becomes part of a container ID system involving both the identity of the container and the weight of its contents by which the system can require retirement of containers that are no longer effective, and can accept as reusable containers presented by a known user with a sufficient weight to be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The drawings show one preferred embodiment that combines elements in an expedient way. Many other combinations of elements are possible in other embodiments that may practice the principles of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The embodiment <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> preferably includes a reusable storage <b>11</b> and a non-reusable storage <b>12</b>. Conveniently near these is a scale <b>15</b> that can weigh a container <b>25</b>. A controller <b>30</b> is also arranged conveniently near storage chambers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. These are normally kept locked and are unlocked by control system <b>30</b> in response to an authorized user.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Container <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, has an ID in the form of a touch memory button <b>40</b> that is preferably mounted in a washer <b>45</b> and permanently secured to container <b>25</b>. The most convenient place for this is on the bottom of container <b>25</b> opposite dispensing end <b>26</b>. Washer <b>45</b> is electrically conductive, and button <b>40</b> is preferably permanently mounted in washer <b>45</b>, such as by being press fit into hole <b>41</b> in washer <b>45</b>. It may also be possible to mount button <b>40</b> in a recess in washer <b>45</b>, and to facilitate bonding or attachment to container <b>25</b>, washer <b>45</b> could have a skirt <b>46</b> such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. The combination of washer <b>45</b> and ID button <b>40</b> is preferably secured to the base of a container <b>25</b> and preferably affords a flat bottom to the container <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The touch memory button <b>40</b> in its preferred mount in washer <b>45</b> is machine readable by means of a pair of electrical contacts <b>42</b> that respectively engage button <b>40</b> and washer <b>45</b>. Other forms of electrical contacts are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The places where the IDs of container <b>25</b> are read, including scale <b>15</b>, and storage units <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, are preferably provided with sockets or cells <b>13</b> that contain reader contacts preferably in the form of conductive coil springs <b>42</b>. [See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>]. This allows one of the springs <b>42</b> to be centered on an axis of a container <b>25</b> lodged in a cell <b>13</b> to engage button <b>40</b>, while a companion coil spring <b>42</b> is offset from the container axis to engage washer <b>45</b>. The contacts engaging washers <b>45</b> are preferably in electrical contact with a neutral buss, which cooperates with the axially concentric contact spring <b>42</b> to make the IDs of buttons <b>40</b> readable.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Container cells or sockets <b>13</b> preferably include frictional elements <b>14</b> that hold a container against slipping or sliding outward while positioned within a cell <b>13</b>. This helps hold containers <b>25</b> in place with washers <b>45</b> and buttons <b>40</b> making contact with coiled springs <b>42</b> arranged on a reader board <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The functioning of the illustrated system is preferably programmed into controller <b>30</b> having a user interface <b>31</b>. This can respond to authorized users who can optionally be identified by PIN, card swipe, proximity, or biometrics. Prompts can appear in display window <b>32</b> so that a user following the prompts can deal effectively with a fully automated system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">To prepare containers <b>25</b> for use, the ID of each container is preferably communicated to controller <b>30</b> by a container enrollment station <b>35</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This registers with controller <b>30</b> the IDs of all containers that may be called upon for use, and it allows controller <b>30</b> to accept as containers <b>25</b> only those who have their IDs enrolled beforehand. This can also produce a supply of containers ready for weighing and use.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferred steps in a security administration process for storing and using containers is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Many additional steps are possible to meet varying needs. These can include prompts appearing in controller display window <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When containers <b>25</b> are initially loaded into reusable storage <b>11</b>, they have their touch memory buttons <b>40</b> in place, and they are weighed on scale <b>15</b>, which can determine whether they are fully loaded. Containers <b>25</b> are then placed in sockets <b>13</b> of reusable storage <b>11</b> for dispensing to authorized users. Readers <b>42</b> arranged on reader boards <b>43</b> engage the touch memory buttons <b>40</b> and washers <b>45</b> of all the containers <b>25</b> that are placed in storage. This gives controller <b>30</b> the identities of whatever number of containers <b>25</b> are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When an authorized user logs into controller <b>30</b>, then controller <b>30</b> unlocks the door of reusable storage <b>11</b> and preferably illuminates a light <b>17</b> indicating the unlocked door so that the authorized user can operate the door handle to open the door and remove a container <b>25</b> for possible use. A withdrawn container <b>25</b> no longer has a memory button <b>40</b> contacting a machine reader <b>42</b>, which enables controller <b>30</b> to detect the withdrawal of a container <b>25</b> and to note the ID of the withdrawn container. The authorized user then shuts the cabinet door and is equipped with a container <b>25</b>. If the user withdraws more than one container the controller can set off an alarm or provide a notification by email, text messaging, or computer display, that something unusual has happened.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To return a container <b>25</b>, the authorized user logs into controller <b>30</b> and presents a container <b>25</b> for return to storage by placing container <b>25</b> on scale <b>15</b>. Controller <b>30</b> then notes the weight of container <b>25</b>, and scale <b>15</b> preferably includes an ID reader so that controller <b>30</b> can also determine the id of the container presented for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the container has lost weight since it was checked out, controller <b>30</b> can provide a notification that a report is necessary on the circumstances of a discharge from a container in the possession of an authorized user. Otherwise, if container <b>25</b> has about the same weight as when it was checked out, controller <b>30</b> can unlock the reusable storage <b>11</b>, which allows the authorized user to replace the container <b>25</b> in one of the sockets <b>13</b> in storage <b>11</b>. Computer <b>30</b> then notes from the ID reader in storage <b>11</b> whether container <b>25</b> has been replaced into storage <b>11</b>. If this has not occurred, controller <b>30</b> can sound an alarm or notify an administrator.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If a container <b>25</b> presented for storage has lost enough weight so that it is no longer effective, then controller <b>30</b> unlocks the door to non-reusable storage <b>12</b>, which also is preferably provided with storage sockets <b>13</b> and ID readers <b>42</b>. This illuminates light <b>16</b> so that the authorized user can then open the door and place container <b>25</b> in storage <b>12</b>, which controller <b>30</b> can note. If the user does not place container <b>25</b> in storage <b>12</b>, the controller can take appropriate action.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Controller <b>30</b> can also be programmed to deal with defective containers presented for non-reusable storage. A user option to controller <b>30</b> can report a defective container that for some reason does not work properly so that the defective container can be removed from circulation by being stored in non-reusable storage <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The specific functions of the security system can be varied considerably. They can be made more elaborate to include generation of reports, notification of events by email, web, text message, and cooperative exchange between several dispensing and return stations within a single facility.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An ID reader and a weigh scale for containers presented for storage can be separated, but for convenience, these are preferably combined near the storage containers. The system can be greatly enlarged without reducing its functions.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If security does not require it, non-reusable storage could become a discard bin where containers are no longer monitored. Problems that this might involve are prevented by deploying ID readers in non-reusable storage, as well as in reusable storage.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Use of other ID codes, such as RFID tags or bar codes, would change the way that the codes are read. Even with use of the preferred button IDs and washers, it is possible to use different electrical contact systems that contact the buttons <b>40</b> and the washers <b>45</b> to achieve ID reading. Buttons can be held in some conductive material other than a washer, for example, and edges of buttons <b>40</b> can provide neutral buss contact points. Changes in ID readers can vary security systems while following the desired principles and functions.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to the OC materials mentioned in the background section, the described embodiment can also be applied to containers of any materials worth protecting by a security system. The way that the controller <b>30</b> handles unlocking and locking of doors and opening of doors can be varied and automated in different ways.</p>
