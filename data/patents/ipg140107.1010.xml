<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/368,137 filed Jul. 27, 2010. The contents of said application are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vending machines typically include devices capable of validating and accepting money like coin changers, bill acceptors, credit card readers, etc. Coin acceptor devices function to authenticate and denominate each of the coins inserted into the vending machine. Known coin detection and validation devices utilize various techniques and methods which include optical size detection and metallic content or characteristic detection. Examples of such coin detection devices are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,625,852, 4,646,904, 5,662,205, 5,673,781, 6,230,870. These patents relate to coin detection, validation and denomination and include some features which, in the general sense, relate to the present invention. All of these patents are assigned to the assignee of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, the coin acceptor has one coin inlet funnel for all coin inputs and which directs coins toward a sloped coin track along which are located optical and magnetic sensors to validate acceptable coinage and reject spurious materials. After being sensed for validity and denomination, the coin is directed in a number of directions. Valid coins are directed to coin inventory tubes, used for coin payback, or a cash box. Invalid denominations or counterfeit coins are directed to a coin return chute.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to properly sense the validity and denomination of the coin, a serpentine path directs the coin toward the beginning of a stainless steel validation rail. The validation rail will both stabilize the coin and guide it past the validation sensors. The rail combined with an inward lean will maximize coin lean against the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Coin validation begins once the coin acceptor recognizes a coin is passing by the optical and magnetic sensors. After proper coin validation, a series of decision gates actuated by solenoids will control the proper routing of the coin.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Coins containing holes or transparent portions or containing portions made from dissimilar materials represent a difficulty for prior art coin detectors. Coins with apertures of any kind allow light pass through the coin as the coin rolls past an optical sensors and coins having portions of dissimilar metals cause the magnetic sensors to fail to generate a consistent or expected waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art devices therefore do not address the problem of validating coins made of more than one different material with holes that are symmetrical or non-symmetrical, apertures or rings of transparent material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, it is desirable and advantageous to provide a coin detection device having optical and electromagnetic sensors and associated circuits capable of accurately authenticating and accepting coins of different denominations by measuring the unique characteristics of holes, apertures and transparent rings located on the coin.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A coin detection device for determining a size of a coin and a size of at least one aperture hole in the coin while the coin is traveling along a coin track, the device comprising a first inductive sensor array positioned along the coin track and/or a first optical sensor array positioned along the coin track, a processing circuit connected to the optical and inductive sensor arrays, each of the sensors providing an output signal to the processing circuit and the processing circuit determining a size of the coin and a size of at least one aperture hole in the coin based upon output signal from each of the optical and inductive sensor arrays.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The coin detection device of the present invention is capable of determining a physical configuration of coins containing apertures or transparent portions and/or an arrangement of dissimilar metals as well as the size of those holes, apertures or transparent portions or the size of the portions containing dissimilar metals. This is accomplished with a special arrangement of optical and inductive sensors positioned along the coin track each of the sensors for providing an output signal to an electrical circuit. By examining the waveforms created by the optical and inductive sensors and comparing the waveform to expected waveforms for an acceptable coin, the coin denomination and validity can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one specific embodiment, a coin detection device for detecting a characteristic of a coin comprises a processing circuit, an arrangement of optical sensors and an arrangement of electromagnetic sensors. Each of these arrangements of sensors is connected to a processing circuit. The optical sensors produce a size related output signal and the magnetic sensors provide an output signal to the processing circuit indicative of the interaction of an electromagnetic field with the coin. The optical and magnetic sensors being in a special location relationship to each other based on the size of the coin and the size and location of the holes or transparent portions of the coin, and the processing circuit for determining whether the coin is acceptable based upon a comparison of the output signals.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another form of the present invention is a metal detector which comprises a first array of optical sensors and a second array of inductive elements, or magnetic sensors, the first and second arrays being connected to processing circuits, the arrays being in a mechanical relationship to each other, the first and second circuits each providing an output signal to the processing circuit, the output signals being produced by the presence of a metallic object and the processing circuit for detecting a characteristic of the metallic object based upon a ratio of the a diameter size and an aperture size to determine a coin's validity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a coin acceptor device <b>10</b> comprising a coin entry portion <b>12</b>, a coin track portion <b>14</b>, and a coin sensor portion <b>16</b>. When the coin is inserted into the coin entry portion <b>12</b> of the coin acceptor device <b>10</b>, it moves through the device <b>10</b> until it rolls down the coin track portion <b>14</b> and past the coin detector portion <b>16</b>. The coin detector portion <b>16</b> comprises a plurality of electromagnetic and optical components, as discussed below, for detecting the denomination and validity of the coin.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows exemplary coins and tokens that include voids and openings which present difficulty for coin acceptors of the prior art to determine denomination and validity due to those voids.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an electrical schematic showing an embodiment for an arrangement of optical sensors in accordance with the present invention. In the exemplary arrangement three light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, and <b>20</b>&#x2033; are arrangement proximate to three phototransistors <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>&#x2032;, and <b>26</b>&#x2033; which detect light from the LEDs <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>&#x2033;. The LEDs <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032;, and <b>20</b>&#x2033; may emit light in the visible or invisible range of the spectrum; however, the LED must be matched to the sensible range of the phototransistors <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>&#x2032; and <b>26</b>&#x2033;. Each corresponding pair of LEDs <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>&#x2032; and <b>20</b>&#x2033; and phototransistor <b>26</b>, <b>26</b>&#x2032;, <b>26</b>&#x2033; are referred to herein as an optical sensor. The state of the phototransistors is transmitted to a logic circuit <b>32</b> via an interface circuit <b>34</b>. Physically a LED and its corresponding phototransistor could be located across a coin track or coin path from one another or on a single side of the coin path with the light emitted by the LED being redirected to the phototransistor by a mirror. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art while the arrangement of optical sensors is shown as comprising three sensors for purposes of illustration any number of a plurality of optical sensors could be utilized to accomplish the arrangement. The logic circuit <b>32</b> and interface circuit <b>34</b> will transform the sensors' output created by the passage of a coin into logical signals, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an electrical schematic showing an embodiment for an arrangement of magnetic sensors comprising sensitive coils <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>&#x2032; and <b>36</b>&#x2033; whose electromagnetic field interacts with coins that pass by the arrangement of sensors. Coils can be arranged on one or either side of the coin track. The coils may be powered by a tank circuit, an oscillator circuit or a pulsing device to generate the electromagnetic field. Like the optical sensors, above, the state of the magnetic sensors <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> is transmitted through the interface <b>34</b> and to the logic circuit <b>32</b>. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art while the arrangement of electromagnetic sensors is shown as comprising three sensors for purposes of illustration any number of a plurality of optical sensors could be utilized to accomplish the arrangement. The logic circuit <b>32</b> and interface circuit <b>34</b> will transform the sensors' output created by the passage of a coin into logical signals, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a coin track <b>42</b> of a coin acceptor routes a coin <b>44</b> past the arrangements of optical and electromagnetic sensors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. The optical sensors comprise pairs of LEDs <b>20</b> and phototransistors <b>26</b>, and the electromagnetic sensors comprise coils <b>36</b>. The arrangements of sensors may be located on a single side of the coin, as in sensors <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and <b>52</b>, or on opposite sides of the coin as in sensors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows schematically the physical parameters that are measured on different coins using the preferred embodiments above. With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, coin <b>56</b> is a solid coin for which the processor <b>35</b> will receive waveform information and will calculate at least diameters A-B and C-D and also many chords parallel with these two diameters. The diameters and the chords will be calculated based on optical sensors outputs and magnetic sensors outputs as described above. The processor <b>35</b> will finally compare the optical and magnetic calculated diameters and chords with pre-stored magnetic and optical diameters and decide if the coin <b>56</b> is valid and of what denomination.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Coin <b>58</b> or coin <b>62</b> defines either an aperture or comprises bi-alloy composition wherein the center material is either opaque or transparent. The center hole may also contain an electronic chip. For the case that the coin has a hole or a hole filled with a transparent substance, the processor <b>35</b> would implement the waveforms, as described above, to determine diameters A-D and E-F, diameter of the hole B-C, ring chords A-B, C-D. The processor will finally compare the optical and magnetic calculated diameters and chords with pre-stored magnetic and optical diameters and decide if the coin <b>58</b> or <b>62</b> is valid and of what denomination.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly for coin <b>60</b>, the processor <b>35</b> uses the optical and magnetic waveforms transmitted from the optical and magnetic sensor arrays <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> to calculate the diameter of the coin <b>60</b>, diameters of the two rings, diameters of the center hole, rings chords, center hole chords.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>, due to the ringed construction of the coins <b>58</b> or <b>62</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> the ring portions will interact differently with the optical coin sensing devices in the horizontal optical and electromagnetic sensors arrays <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> than the vertical optical and electromagnetic sensors arrays <b>70</b>&#x2032; and <b>72</b>&#x2032;.

The processor <b>35</b> will further calculate optical sizes for the ring portions scanned by the optical sensors of the horizontal array <b>70</b>. At the same time the magnetic sensors of the vertical electromagnetic array <b>72</b>&#x2032; will interact differently with the ring portions of the coin based on the material content of those portions. The signal generated by every one of the magnetic sensors is transferred to the processor <b>35</b> via the interface and logic circuits <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

Furthermore the processor <b>35</b> will calculate ratio of the magnetic to optical sizes for all the calculated dimensions of the coin, coin rings and coin holes. Finally, the processor <b>35</b> compares these measurements with pre-stored data and decides if the coin is real and of what denomination.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>13</b> and <b>17</b>, with coin <b>68</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> rolling down the track and positioned in the proximity of the horizontal sensor arrays <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, intermediate optical sensors within vertical optical sensor array <b>70</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> will be located in the transparent ring portion b-c of the coin <b>68</b>. All of the other optical sensors within vertical optical sensor array <b>70</b>&#x2032; interact with the solid portion of the coin <b>68</b>. The processor <b>35</b> will generates an optical timing event signal when individual optical sensors in the array <b>70</b>&#x2032; go from OFF to ON when a solid portion of the coin <b>68</b> follows a transparent portion of the coin <b>68</b> and when a transparent portion of the coin <b>68</b> ends and a solid portion of the coin <b>68</b> follows.
