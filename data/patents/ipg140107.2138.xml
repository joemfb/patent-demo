<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to diagnostic tools to image tissue suspected of or know to being infected, especially with a bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic or other microbial pathogen. The present invention represents a clear advance in the art which presently relies on tissue biopsy for diagnoses of these disease states and conditions. The novel imaging probe is capable of detecting infected cells and tissue, as well as level of infection of the tissue. The present invention results in a significant advance and step forward in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease using the non-invasive molecular imaging techniques. Thus, in the present invention, the existence of a disease state may be diagnosed as well as the extent of disease. Accordingly, the present invention may be used to diagnose infections, including hard-to-diagnose infections and the assist in therapy of infections by monitoring therapy and the response of the disease to therapy. Compounds according to the present invention may be used as diagnostic tools for a number of conditions and diseases states as well as therapeutic agents for treating such conditions and disease states.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A critical need exists to develop imaging agents which can diagnose and/or monitor infections in tissue in a patient. Currently, most imaging is based on the detection of mass infection or general metabolic activity. Imaging agents that elucidate the pathobiology of cells in the masses are lacking. An allosteric inhibitor of LFA-1 has been developed, the small molecule alkyl-amino-NorBirt. Determination of its structure activity relationship has permitted modifications allowing radiometal attachment through an alkylamino linker. We postulate that radiolabeled alkyl-amino-NorBirt will retain its binding affinity towards LFA-1 and thus can be used as a non-invasive imaging agent for a number of disease states and infections caused by microbial agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites and other. Our previous work has demonstrated that the radiometal, <sup>213</sup>Bi, can be effectively incorporated into the alkyl-amino-NorBirt. We propose to link a radiometal with good imaging characteristics to image LFA-1 overexpression in infected tissues. The radiolabeled compound will allow imaging of infected cells, diagnosis and staging, as well as monitoring responses to other therapeutic interventions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatics where the white blood cells start proliferating before they are fully mature and thus cannot function properly. These abnormal cells start collecting in the lymph nodes. The lymphoma cells can be either large or small and are usually grouped together to form small cell masses. Since leukocytes play the most vital role in immunological response by migrating to the site of injury through integrins and adhesion molecules, the chance of metastasis of lymphoma cells is very high.<sup>1,2,3 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrins are &#x3b1;, &#x3b2; heterodimers whose activation leads to a change in structure and conformation which contribute to immune function.<sup>4,5 </sup>One of the major membrane bound integrins receptors is &#x3b2;<sub>2 </sub>integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which is expressed by the leukocytes.<sup>4,6,7 </sup>The &#x3b1;-subunit of LFA-1, has an N-terminally inserted domain (I-domain) that plays a central role in regulating ligand binding. LFA-1 receptors are expressed normally in all of the lymphoma cells and overly expressed on many lymphomas especially T-cell and B-cell neoplasms.<sup>9,10,11,12 </sup>Also known as CD11A/CD18, LFA-1 plays a crucial role in many cellular and immunological processes (migration, antigen presentation, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and haematopoiesis) by displaying both signaling and adhesive properties. This results in binding to the extracellular matrix as well as the receptors involved in cell-cell adhesion. This is regulated by binding to ligands such as intercellular adhesion molecules 1, 2 and 3 (ICAM-1, 2 &#x26; 3).<sup>6,13 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">LFA-1 must be activated to the extended high affinity form in order to mediate a stable adhesion with its ligand ICAM-1.<sup>15 </sup>The resting state affinity of LFA-1 for the ICAM-1 is very low and is estimated at 10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>-10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M for mice.<sup>16 </sup>Binding of the activated LFA-1 with the ICAM-1 through its I-domain (which retains its function as an isolated protein fragment) results in cell adhesion and migration along with intracellular signals which may cause cytotoxic action, cell proliferation or apoptosis.<sup>6 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Development of allosteric LFA-1 inhibitors can cause inhibition of early events like the cell-cell as well as cell-extra cellular matrix adhesion and will prevent metastasis of lymphoma cells.<sup>5,7,17 </sup></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently small molecules have been developed that bind to the I-domain of the &#x3b1;-subunit of LFA-1 receptors and stabilize it to the low affinity state. Structure activity studies of one of such molecule, BIRT-377, suggest that it binds to LFA-1 solely through nonionic interaction. (<i>J Am Chem Soc </i>123, 5643-5650). Two hydrophobic pockets of the I-domain and the aromatic rings of Birt-377 interact with each other in an edge-to-face aromatic/aromatic orientation. This binding presumably prevents displacement of the overall conformational changes of the whole protein stabilizing it in the bent, low affinity state. Many derivatives of BIRT-377 have been developed. One of them is alkylamino-NorBirt. Studies have demonstrated that this derivative retains its affinity as the original DOTA-alkylamino-NorBirt. Even in the presence of divalent cations like Mn<sup>++</sup> (which results in activation and small conformational changes in the I-domain), BIRT-377 and its derivative (the alkylamino-NorBirt) inhibit the ligand binding by stabilizing LFA-1 in the bent, low affinity state.<sup>5 </sup>Thus, it prevents the ICAM-1 adhesion on LFA-1 and thereby prevents the leukocytes from migration (metastasis).<sup>20 </sup>It also inhibits the intercellular signals (outside-in signaling) and hence affects the functional activity of cell.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Structure activity work with BIRT-377 had suggested that the hydantoin methyl group when bound to LFA-1 was oriented away from the binding site, suggesting that changes at this site would not interfere with BIRT-377 binding. The modification of Birt-377 allows a linker 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) to be attached to the alkylamino chain resulting in DOTA-alkylamino-NorBirt. A radiometal then can be incorporated in the DOTA linker for non-invasive imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There are several characteristics of Lymphoma cells and the LFA-1 receptors, which make them amenable for non-invasive imaging. They are:

<p id="p-0012" num="0016">Thus the radiolabeled DOTA-alkylamino-NorBirt can potentially be used, as a non-invasive imaging tool for lymphomas.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The need for non-invasive imaging in lymphoma is very important. The current methods of staging and detecting the residual disease are very crude. Since the research is still in its early stages, we do not expect to achieve immediate diagnostic capabilities. However, detecting the residual disease after therapy and increasing the sensitivity of staging the disease can be accomplished. The advantage of this non-invasive imaging is the sensitivity with which the radiopharmaceutical can detect the disease and its spread in the body.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0047">In the diagnostic method according to the present invention, a compound according to the present invention is administered to a patient. Evidence of a disease state or condition of the tissue to be diagnosed and its relevance to disease (for example, from elevated expression of LFA-1/CAM receptors) in tissue of said patient is made through standard well-known nuclear imaging techniques, especially radiation (radionuclide) imaging, including scintigraphic imaging, in which an image(s) taken from a patient is/are compared to a standard, which may be an image from normal, uninfected tissue or an image or images from infected tissue at various stages of infection, is indicative of a disease state or condition in the tissue of the patient. In general, elevated levels of radiation emanating from a diagnosed tissue is evidence of elevated LFA-1/CAM receptor activity and indicative of a disease state or condition wherein these receptors are found at elevated levels and a disease state or condition occurs. It has recently been discovered that the present method is applicable to a large number of infectious diseases states which are caused by microbial agents, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa, as well as multicellular parasites (helminthic and other endoparasites). Thus, the present invention may be used to diagnose the existence and/or severity of a disease state, as well as response of a disease state or condition to therapy. This is done by imaging tissue which is infected or suspected of being infected to develop one or more images and then comparing the image(s) with a standard image or images from normal tissue and/or infected tissue.</p>

Treatment of or monitoring of treatment of diseases/infections in tissues (which may also be diagnosed by the present methods) by methods according to the present invention represent further aspects. This method optionally comprises the step of modifying treatment of said disease state or condition in the event that the monitoring evidences that therapy should be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0050">Thus, the present invention relates to a method for diagnosing an infection (infectious disease) in a patient comprising administering to said patient an effective amount of a compound as generally described hereinabove to a patient suspected of or at risk for being infected and then diagnosing the existence of a disease or condition in said patient by imaging said patient and determining the existence of an imaging (radioimage) signal from tissue in said patient consistent with the existence of a disease state or condition. The method comprises comparing the image(s) obtained from the patient to one or more standard images (e.g. a standard for normal tissue and/or of diseased tissue). A determination that tissue or an organ in a patient is infected and the extent and/or severity of infection is made by comparing the image from the tissue or organ suspected of being infected with the standard image. If the image from the tissue is significantly higher than a standard image from non-infected tissue, then a diagnosis that the tissue is infected may be made. Alternatively, if the image from the tissue is approximately the same as a standard image from infected tissue, then a diagnosis that the tissue is infected and the severity of infection may be made.</p>

Antibiotics belong to the group of antimicrobial compounds used to treat infections caused by micro-organisms, including fungi and protozoa. The term &#x201c;antibiotic&#x201d; was coined in the 1940's to describe any substance produced by a micro-organism that is antagonistic to the growth of other micro-organisms in high dilution. This original definition excluded naturally occurring substances, such as gastric juice and hydrogen peroxide (they kill bacteria but are not produced by micro-organisms), and also excluded synthetic compounds such as the sulfonamides (which are antimicrobial agents). Many antibiotics are relatively small molecules with a molecular weight less than 2000 Da. With advances in medicinal chemistry, most antibiotics are now modified chemically from original compounds found in nature, as is the case with beta-lactams (which include the penicillins, produced by fungi in the genus <i>Penicillium</i>, the cephalosporins, and the carbapenems). Some antibiotics are still produced and isolated from living organisms, such as the aminoglycosides; in addition, many more have been created through purely synthetic means, such as the quinolones.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0153">Unlike many previous treatments for infections, which often consisted of administering chemical compounds such as strychnine and arsenic, with high toxicity also against mammals, most antibiotics from microbes have fewer side-effects, and high effective target activity. Most anti-bacterial antibiotics do not have activity against viruses, fungi, or other microbes. Anti-bacterial antibiotics can be categorized based on their target specificity: &#x201c;narrow-spectrum&#x201d; antibiotics target particular types of bacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, while broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Antibiotics which target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins, cephalosporins, cephems), or cell membrane (polymixins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (quinolones, sulfonamides) usually are bactericidal in nature. Those which target protein synthesis such as the aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracyclines are usually bacteriostatic. In the last few years three new classes of antibiotics have been brought into clinical use. These new antibiotics are of the following three classes: cyclic lipopeptides (daptomycin), glycylcyclines (tigecycline), and oxazolidinones (linezolid). Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, while the two others are used for Gram-positive infections.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0154">The term &#x201c;antiviral agent&#x201d; is used to describe a chemical agent which is used to treat a virus infection. Numerous antiviral agents may be used in the present invention. Antiviral drugs are a class of medication used specifically for treating viral infections. Like antibiotics for bacteria, specific antivirals are used for specific viruses. Unlike antibiotics, however, antiviral drugs do not destroy their target pathogen, they only inhibit their development. Antiviral drugs are one class of antimicrobials, a larger group which also includes antibiotic, antifungal and antiparasitic drugs. They are relatively harmless to the host, and therefore can be used to treat infections. They should be distinguished from viricides, which actively destroy virus particles outside the body.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0155">Most of the antivirals now available are designed to help deal with HIV, herpes viruses (causing cold sores and genital herpes, amongst a wide range of diseases), the hepatitis B and C viruses, which can cause hepatitis and liver cancer, and influenza A and B viruses. Researchers are now working to extend the range of antivirals to other families of pathogens.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0156">The term &#x201c;antifungal agent&#x201d; is used to describe a therapeutic compound or bioactive agent which may be used to treat a fungal infection in a patient. An antifungal drug is a medication used to treat fungal infections such as athlete's foot, ringworm, candidiasis (thrush), serious systemic infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, and related fungal infections. Antifungal agents for use in the present invention include, for example, polyene antifungals, imidazole, triazole and thiazole antifungals, allylamines, echinocandins, griseofulvin, flycystosine, undecylenic acid, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0157">The term &#x201c;antiparasitic agent&#x201d; is used to describe a therapeutic compound or bioactive agent that is used to treat parasitic diseases including nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, infectious protozoa, and amoebas. Antiparasitic agents for use in the present invention include antinematodes (mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, thiabendazole, diethycarbazine), anticestodes (niclosamide, praziquantel), antitrematodes (praziquantel), antiamoebics (rifampin and amphotericin B), antiprotozoals (melarsoprol, eflornithine, metronidazole and tinidazole), among others. These are used to treat infections and/or disease states including roundworm infections, tapeworm infections, lymphatic filariasis, and fungal sleeping sickness (<i>Trypanosoma</i>, including for <i>Trypanasoma brucei</i>), among others.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0158">The term &#x201c;antihelminthic agent&#x201d; is used to describe a therapeutic compound or bioactive agent which may be used to treat a multicellular parasitic infection. It is a subset of anti-parasitic agents, otherwise described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0159">The term &#x201c;coadministration&#x201d; or &#x201c;combination therapy&#x201d; is used to describe a therapy in which at least two active compounds (one of which is a compound according to the present invention) in effective amounts are used to treat cancer or another disease state or condition as otherwise described herein at the same time. Although the term coadministration preferably includes the administration of two active compounds to the patient at the same time, it is not necessary that the compounds be administered to the patient at the same time, although effective amounts of the individual compounds will be present in the patient at the same time. Compounds according to the present invention may be administered with one or more antibiotic, antifungal agent, antiviral agent or antiprotozoal or antiparasitic agent (which may also be used to treat multicellular parasites) as described hereinabove, or an anti-cancer agent, including antimetabolites, alkylating agents, topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II inhibitors as well as microtubule inhibitors, among others. Anticancer compounds for use in the present invention include those described above, and mixtures thereof, among others. Coadministration of one of the present compounds with another anticancer agent as otherwise described herein will often result in a synergistic enhancement of the anticancer activity of the other anticancer agent, an unexpected result.</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0212">In accordance with the method provided by the invention, the novel compounds of formula I in effective amounts may be administered to a patient for a diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic purpose, including monitoring of therapy, either alone or with other agents, including other immunosuppressive or antiinflammatory agents or other anti-cancer agents and especially antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics, antiviral agents, antifungal agents and antiprotozoal agents, as well as antihelminthic and other antiparasatic agents. When provided prophylactically, the immunosuppressive compound(s) are provided in advance of any inflammatory response or symptom (for example, prior to, at, or shortly after the time of an organ or tissue transplant but in advance of any symptoms of organ rejection). The prophylactic administration of a compound of the formula I serves to prevent or attenuate any subsequent inflammatory response (such as, for example, rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue, etc.). The therapeutic administration of a compound of the formula I serves to attenuate any actual inflammation (such as, for example, the rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue). Thus, in accordance with the invention, a compound of the formula I can be administered either prior to the onset of inflammation (so as to suppress an anticipated inflammation) or after the initiation of inflammation.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0213">The novel compounds of formula I may, in accordance with the invention, be administered in single or divided doses by the oral, parenteral or topical routes. Administration of the active compound may range from continuous (intravenous drip) to several oral administrations per day (for example, Q.I.D.) and may include oral, topical, parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous, sub-cutaneous, transdermal (which may include a penetration enhancement agent), buccal and suppository administration, among other routes of administration. Enteric coated oral tablets may also be used to enhance bioavailability of the compounds from an oral route of administration. The most effective dosage form will depend upon the pharmacokinetics of the particular agent chosen as well as the severity of disease in the patient. Administration of compounds according to the present invention as sprays, mists, or aerosols for intra-nasal, intra-tracheal or pulmonary administration may also be used. The present invention therefore also is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound according to the present invention, optionally in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, additive or excipient.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0214">The amount used is that amount effective within the context of the administration. A suitable oral dosage for a compound of formula I would be in the range of about 0.01 mg to 10 g or more per day, preferably about 0.1 mg to about 1 g per day. In parenteral formulations, a suitable dosage unit may contain from 0.1 to 250 mg of said compounds, which may be administered from one to four times per day, whereas for topical administration, formulations containing 0.01 to 1% active ingredient are preferred. It should be understood, however, that the dosage administration from patient to patient will vary and the dosage for any particular patient will depend upon the clinician's judgment, who will use as criteria for fixing a proper dosage the size and condition of the patient as well as the patient's response to the drug.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0215">When the compounds of the present invention are to be administered by the oral route, they may be administered as medicaments in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which contain them in association with a compatible pharmaceutical carrier, additive or excipient material. Such carrier material can be an inert organic or inorganic carrier material suitable for oral administration. Examples of such carrier materials are water, gelatin, talc, starch, magnesium stearate, gum arabic, vegetable oils, polyalkylene-glycols, petroleum jelly and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0216">The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a conventional manner and finished dosage forms can be solid dosage forms, for example, tablets, dragees, capsules, and the like, or liquid dosage forms, for example solutions, suspensions, emulsions and the like.</p>

Further, the pharmaceutical preparations may contain conventional adjuvants such as preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifiers, flavor-improvers, wetting agents, buffers, salts for varying the osmotic pressure and the like. Solid carrier material which can be used include, for example, starch, lactose, mannitol, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, silica, dibasic calcium phosphate, and high molecular weight polymers (such as polyethylene glycol).</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0218">For parenteral use, a compound according to the present invention can be administered in an aqueous or non-aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion in a pharmaceutically acceptable oil or a mixture of liquids, which may contain bacteriostatic agents, antioxidants, preservatives, buffers or other solutes to render the solution isotonic with the blood, thickening agents, suspending agents or other pharmaceutically acceptable additives. Additives of this type include, for example, tartrate, citrate and acetate buffers, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, complex formers (such as EDTA), antioxidants (such as sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and ascorbic acid), high molecular weight polymers (such as liquid polyethylene oxides) for viscosity regulation and polyethylene derivatives of sorbitol anhydrides. Preservatives may also be added if necessary, such as benzoic acid, methyl or propyl paraben, benzalkonium chloride and other quaternary ammonium compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0219">The compounds of this invention may also be administered as solutions for nasal application and may contain in addition to the compounds of this invention suitable buffers, tonicity adjusters, microbial preservatives, antioxidants and viscosity-increasing agents in an aqueous vehicle. Examples of agents used to increase viscosity are polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polysorbates or glycerin.

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Research Methods</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0224">Radiolabelling the DOTA-alkylamino-NorBirt with radionuclide and determining its specific activity, specific binding and integrity towards LFA-1 receptors utilizing in vitro receptor studies may be performed according to the methods which are described in detail in US patent application No. 20070048216, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Objective:</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0225">To evaluate the in vivo molecular imaging potential of this compound in a pre-clinical model of infection/inflammation.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Methods:</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Radiolabeling</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0226">The radiometal <sup>111</sup>In was incorporated into alkylamino-NorBIRT through 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N&#x2032;N&#x2033;N&#x2032;&#x2033;-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) as a chelator. <sup>111</sup>In chloride (high purity) was purchased through Mallinckrodt (United States). Synthesis of the alkylamino-NorBIRT is described in detail in Cancer Biotherapy and Radiopharmaceuticals Volume 21, Number 5, 2006, pages 418-426.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0227">DOTA-butylamino-NorBIRT was dissolved in ultrapure water. <sup>111</sup>In-chloride was placed in a metal free tube and the NorBirt solution was added. The solution was mixed and then buffered to a pH of 5-6 using a 3M ammonium acetate buffer. The solution was heated in a hot block for 30 minutes at 100&#xb0; C. The reaction mixture (50 uL) was added to 200 uL of 4 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, Mallinckrodt Baker Inc., Paris, Ky.).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0228">Incorporation yield was determined using ITLC silica gel strips (Gelman Sciences, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.) with 0.9% NaCl USP solution (Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, Ill.). Stripes were analyzed on an AR2000 (Bioscan Inc., Washington, D.C.).</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Cell Culture</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0229"><i>E. coli</i>. cells were obtained from a commercial source, reconstituted and incubated 24-72 hours in standard media according to the manufacturer's instructions [more specifics to follow].</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Infection Model</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0230">Normal C57Blk6 male mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 1E7-9 <i>E. coli </i>cells in approximately 0.8 mL in the muscle overlying the left femur, the proximal hind leg.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Biodistribution</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0231">An initial biodistribution study was carried out in three (3) animals 24 hours post-inoculation of &#x2dc;5E8 <i>E. coli </i>at 5 hours post-injection of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-alkylamino-NorBIRT. Results were evaluated as the percent injected dose per gram of tissue. The organs assessed were the heart, blood, stomach, liver, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, bone, muscle, bladder, testes, as well as the abcess or site of infection.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Imaging</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0232">Mice were imaged with the Bioscan NanoSPECT/CT imaging system. Dynamimc images were obtained immediately following injection of &#x2dc;750 uCi of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-alkylamino-NorBIRT intravenously. Static images were also obtained at 2, 4, and 24 hours post injection. Images are individually shown below.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0233">ITLC analyses of <sup>111</sup>In-DOTA-alkylamino-NorBIRT demonstrated &#x3e;98% incorporation yield. The specific activity achieved was 473 Ci/mmol. SPECT/CT images with <sup>111</sup>In-alkylaminoNorBIRT show focal uptake in the site of infection, and prompt and significant urinary excretion as soon as 5 minutes post-injection and at all subsequent time points.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Discussion:</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0234">The radiometal <sup>111</sup>In is a polyvalent cationic metal that is an ideal candidate for SPECT imaging with 173 and 245 keV energy peaks. Gallium-68 is a similar polyvalent, cationic radiometal with chemical behavior akin to indium that undergoes radioactive decay by positron emission. Thus, it is proposed that 68Ga-alkylaminoNorBIRT would show similar desirable imaging properties useful in positron-emission tomography or PET. Our previous research has shown these and other radiometals to be effectively incorporated in many DOTA compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0235">Early images obtained 5 minutes post-injection show high concentrations of <sup>111</sup>In-alkylaminoNorBIRT uptake/retention at the site of infection. This focal uptake persists and all observed time points, including images obtained 24 hours post-injection. There is prompt and significant radioactivity in the bladder and no focal retention in any other tissues. Biodistribution data obtained following gross dissection of mice at 18 and 24 hrs post-inoculation and tissue harvest correlate well with image-based pharmacokinetic data.</p>
<heading id="h-0021" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0165" num="0236">These data show that <sup>68</sup>Ga- or <sup>111</sup>In-alkylaminoNorBIRT are highly selective imaging probes for LFA-1 receptor expression, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity for in vivo SPECT/PET imaging sites of infection and inflammation.</p>
