<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) of Provisional Application No. 61/445,774 filed Feb. 23, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a sterilizing system for sterilizing a continuous loop conveyor belt of a conveyor system that may be classified in U.S. Class 198, Subclass 494.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conveyor-belt checkout stand may be used to transport groceries or other items toward the cashier and away from the cashier to the bagging area. In a conveyor-belt type checkout stand, a synthetic conveyor belt, typically of rubber or plastic, is supported on each end by a roller. These rollers provide a tension between themselves to retain the conveyor belt in position. The belt is also equipped with a drive motor that advances the belt around the rollers. In use, a customer approaches a checkout stand and places his groceries or other items on the conveyor belt. Either by manual control or by an automated device, the rollers begin to rotate, thereby advancing the surface of the conveyor belt containing the groceries or other items toward the cashier. Sterilizing systems for sterilizing the conveyor belt may be provided to maintain a sanitary environment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sterilizing systems for sterilizing the conveyor belt of a conveyor system may benefit from improvements.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of exemplary embodiments to provide an improved sterilizing system for sterilizing the conveyor belt of a conveyor system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of exemplary embodiments to provide a sterilizing system for sterilizing the conveyor belt of a conveyor system having improved operating and servicing capabilities.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> show a conveyor system <b>20</b> with a sterilizing system <b>22</b> constructed in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The conveyor system <b>20</b> may be configured to transport items in a retail point of purchase, checkout stand or other place where goods are sold. For example, the conveyor system may be configured to transport groceries or other items in a grocery or other checkout stand. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the conveyor system <b>20</b> includes a continuous loop conveyor belt <b>24</b> that is supported on a frame <b>26</b>. The frame <b>26</b> is fixedly supported by a stand <b>28</b>. The conveyor belt <b>24</b> operates to move in the direction displayed by arrows <b>31</b> (for the upper flight path <b>30</b>) and <b>33</b> (for the lower flight path <b>32</b>) relative to the frame <b>26</b> between upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the conveyor system <b>20</b>. The belt includes an exposed surface <b>34</b> facing upwardly at the upper flight path <b>30</b> that receives items. The conveyor belt may be support on each end by a roller <b>35</b> and pulley system <b>37</b> or other device for facilitating movement of the belt <b>24</b>. At the lower flight path <b>32</b>, this belt surface faces downwardly toward the ground. The rollers are rotatably driven by a drive such as a motor <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) to move the conveyor belt <b>24</b> between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, power source <b>38</b>, such as an external source of AC power from a power outlet, supplies power to the conveyor system <b>20</b>. The conveyor system <b>20</b> includes a main power switch <b>40</b> operatively connected to the power source that is operative to turn on the conveyor system <b>20</b> so that power may be to provide to the conveyor system <b>20</b>. The conveyor system <b>20</b> may include a product sensor <b>42</b> that detects an item on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>. The product sensor <b>42</b> is operatively connected to the motor control switch <b>43</b>. When products are placed on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the upper flight path <b>30</b> of the belt <b>24</b> the products will be transported towards the product sensor <b>42</b>. When the product sensor detects a product on the belt, a signal is sent to the motor control switch <b>43</b> turning the motor <b>36</b> off stopping the advancement of the belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In operation, the conveyor system <b>20</b> is turned on by operation of the power switch <b>40</b> activating the advancement or movement in the directions <b>31</b>, <b>33</b> of the belt <b>24</b> between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The customer approaches a checkout stand and places his groceries or other item(s) on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the upper flight path <b>30</b> of the belt <b>24</b> that advances the groceries or other item(s) towards the product sensor <b>42</b>. When the product sensor <b>42</b> detects the item(s), it sends a signal to the motor control switch <b>43</b> operatively connected to the motor <b>36</b> to cause the motor <b>36</b> to stop advancing the conveyor belt <b>24</b> between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The conveyor belt <b>24</b> may start automatically after the item(s) is removed from the exposed surface <b>34</b>. Alternatively or in addition, the conveyor system <b>20</b> may be operated manually to control movement of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sterilizing system <b>22</b> includes a housing <b>44</b> that covers or at least partially covers the belt <b>24</b> at the lower flight or return path <b>32</b>. The housing <b>44</b> may be made of a metal or any other material that has ferromagnetic properties. The housing <b>44</b> also includes an inner housing piece <b>46</b> and an outer housing piece <b>48</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the inner housing piece <b>46</b> includes a bottom wall <b>50</b> and upstanding front, rear and left side walls <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> extending from the bottom wall <b>50</b>. The outer housing piece <b>48</b> includes a bottom wall <b>58</b> and upstanding front, rear, and right side walls <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> extending from the bottom wall <b>58</b>. The outer housing piece <b>48</b> overlaps a portion of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> near the right end of the inner housing piece as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In other words, the open end of the outer housing piece <b>48</b> at its left end slidably receives the portion of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> at its right end. This overlapping portion defines an expansion joint in which the inner housing piece and outer housing piece may move laterally relative to each other. The range of this movement is indicated by arrow A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The expansion joint thus allows the width of the housing <b>44</b> to increase or decrease as indicated by the arrow A in order to match the width of the conveyor system <b>20</b>. Left and right angle brackets <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> mount the housing to the stand <b>28</b> and determine the range of the width of the housing <b>44</b>. This will be explained below in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The exemplary embodiment of the width adjustable housing may include a dual set of opposing siding rails <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The sliding rails <b>210</b>, <b>214</b> are permanently attached to inner surface <b>234</b> of the front wall <b>60</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The lower rail <b>210</b> includes a base <b>218</b> that is attached proximal to the bottom wall <b>58</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b>. The base <b>218</b> extends inward towards outer surface <b>236</b> of the front wall <b>52</b>. Flange <b>222</b> is connected to the base <b>218</b> and extends upward. The base <b>220</b> of the upper rail <b>214</b> is permanently attached on the inner surface <b>234</b> proximal to the upper end of front wall <b>60</b> and extends inward towards the outer surface <b>236</b> of the front wall <b>52</b>. Flange <b>224</b> is connected to the base <b>220</b> and extends downward. The base <b>226</b> of the lower rail <b>212</b> on the outer surface <b>236</b> is attached proximal to the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> and extends outward towards the inner surface <b>234</b> of the front wall <b>60</b>. Flange <b>230</b> is connected to the base <b>226</b> and extends downward. The upper rail <b>216</b> includes a base <b>228</b> that is permanently attached on the outer surface <b>236</b> proximal to the upper end of the front wall <b>52</b> and extends outward towards the inner surface <b>234</b> of the front wall <b>60</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b>. Flange <b>232</b> is connected to the base <b>228</b> and extends upward. Rail <b>210</b> slidably receives rail <b>212</b> and rail <b>214</b> slidably receives rail <b>216</b>. When each of the rails <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> slidably receive its corresponding rail, as outlined above, the dual set of sliding rails will hold the inner housing piece <b>46</b> in position relative to the outer housing piece <b>48</b> such that there will not be any vertical movement between the inner and outer housings <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and the sterilizing system <b>22</b> will not sag in the middle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An alternative configuration of this exemplary embodiment may include one or more circulating fans <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b>) designed and positioned to dissipate heat generated from the operation of the first and second light sources <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First and second ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are positioned in the interior of the housing <b>44</b>. Each light source is operative to emit or generate ultraviolet light with a single wavelength or multiple wavelengths within the wavelength range of 180 to 290 nm. Each ultraviolet light source may comprise mercury tubes, light emitting diodes (LEDs) or any other suitable ultraviolet light source. In this exemplary embodiment, each of the ultraviolet light sources is configured as an elongated u-shaped tube <b>75</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This exemplary embodiment depicts a configuration including two ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, however, other exemplary embodiments may accommodate less than or more than the two light sources depicted in this design. Each tube includes parallel leg portions <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> and a curved bight portion <b>80</b>. Alternatively, the portion <b>80</b> may be straight rather than curved in some exemplary arrangements. Each tube <b>75</b> is oriented such that the leg portions lie in a plane that is generally parallel to the belt surface facing the tube. Each tube is also oriented such that the longitudinal axis <b>83</b> of a leg of the tube is perpendicular to the belt movement in the direction <b>33</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Electrical prongs <b>82</b> extend from the free end of each leg portion. The prongs <b>82</b> of the first ultraviolet light source <b>70</b> are inserted into bulb connectors or electrical sockets <b>84</b>. The sockets <b>84</b> are mounted to the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> at the left side wall <b>56</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b>. The prongs <b>82</b> of the second ultraviolet light source <b>72</b> are inserted into bulb connectors or electrical sockets <b>86</b>. The sockets <b>86</b> are mounted to the bottom wall <b>58</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b> at the right side wall <b>64</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first and second ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are spaced from one another along the lower flight path <b>32</b>. The ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are positioned to collectively emit ultraviolet light that irradiates across the surface of the belt <b>24</b> with the emitted light starting from one end <b>88</b> of the belt and ending at the other end <b>90</b> of the belt <b>24</b>. In essence, the light shines only on the surface of the belt <b>24</b> but extends across the belt surface to ensure that the entire belt surface passes over the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and receives ultraviolet radiation to sterilize the belt surface. Alternatively, the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may be configured to emit light that extends across the belt <b>24</b> and beyond the ends <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> of the belt <b>24</b>. The ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may be so positioned so as not to interfere from each other. An ultraviolet reflective lining or coating <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is applied on the interior surface of the housing to maximize ultraviolet exposure on the conveyor belt <b>24</b>. The housing <b>44</b> is configured to completely contain the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and prevent ultraviolet light from escaping. Additionally, reflectors <b>87</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be installed on the inner and outer housing <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to ensure that sufficient ultraviolet light is incident across the entire width of the conveyor belt <b>24</b> including the ends <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Since the first light source <b>70</b> is fixed to the inner housing piece <b>46</b> and the second light source <b>72</b> is fixed to the outer housing piece <b>48</b>, the first and second light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may be movable in their longitudinal direction relative to each other at selected positions. Each of these positions corresponds to an emission of light of a particular width. This allows the width of the emitted light to be adjusted in order to accommodate belts that have different widths. The range of the adjusted widths is determined by the configuration of the conveyor system <b>20</b> and the conveyor stand <b>28</b>. Upon adjusting the sterilization system to the appropriate width, the angle brackets <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are fastened to the conveyor stand <b>28</b> and locked in place with the locking nuts <b>102</b>. In particular, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>, each of the angled brackets <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> is L-shaped and includes a top plate <b>94</b> and a side plate <b>96</b>. The top plate <b>94</b> includes a slot <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that extends longitudinally with respect to the top plate <b>94</b>. The side plates <b>96</b> of the left brackets <b>66</b> are mounted to the left side of the conveyor stand <b>28</b> by attachment screws <b>100</b>. The top plates <b>94</b> of the left brackets <b>66</b> are mounted to the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> by locking nuts <b>102</b> and threaded bolts <b>104</b>. Specifically, for each of the left brackets <b>66</b>, the bolt <b>104</b> extends through the bottom wall <b>50</b> and the slot <b>98</b> of the top plate <b>94</b>. The locking nut <b>102</b> is then threadibly turned on the bolt <b>104</b> to fix the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> to the bracket <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Likewise, the side plates <b>96</b> of the right brackets <b>68</b> are mounted to the right side of the conveyor stand <b>28</b> by attachment screws <b>100</b>. The top plates <b>94</b> of the right brackets <b>68</b> are mounted to the bottom wall <b>58</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b> by locking nuts <b>102</b> and threaded bolts <b>104</b>. Specifically, for each of the right brackets <b>68</b>, the bolt <b>104</b> extends through the bottom wall <b>58</b> and the slot <b>98</b> of the top plate <b>94</b>. The locking nut is then threadibly turned on the bolt <b>104</b> to fix the bottom wall <b>58</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b> to the bracket <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To adjust the width of the light emitted by the lights sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, the locking nuts <b>102</b> are loosened from their respective bolts <b>104</b>. Then, the left and right angle brackets <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> are securely fastened to the conveyor stand <b>28</b> with the attachment screws <b>100</b>. Upon fastening the angle brackets <b>66</b> and <b>68</b> to the conveyor stand <b>20</b>, the width of the light emitted by the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, may be expanded to radiate the entire width of the exposed surface <b>34</b> to its width permitted by the bolts <b>104</b> and slots <b>98</b>. Since the first light source <b>70</b> is fixed to the inner housing piece <b>46</b> and the second light source <b>72</b> fixed to the outer housing piece <b>48</b>, the light sources may be moved relative to each other along the slots <b>98</b>. After the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are moved to the desired position, the locking nuts are then threadily fastened on their respect bolts and turned and tightened until the housing <b>44</b> is fixed or lock to the brackets.

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An alternative exemplary arrangement of first and second ultraviolet light sources <b>270</b>, <b>272</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. In this arrangement, each of the tubes <b>175</b> of the light sources <b>270</b>, <b>272</b> may be straight or I-shaped. The first light source <b>270</b> is mounted to fixture <b>105</b>, which in turn is mounted to the the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b>. Each of the ends of the first light source <b>270</b> is electrically coupled to an electrical socket <b>266</b>. One electrical socket <b>266</b> is mounted on the left side wall of the inner housing piece <b>56</b>, and the other electrical socket <b>266</b> mounted near the right end of the inner housing piece <b>46</b>. The second light source <b>272</b> is mounted to a fixture <b>116</b>. Each of the ends of the second light source <b>272</b> is mounted to an electrical socket <b>268</b>. One electrical socket <b>268</b> of the second light source <b>272</b> is mounted to the bottom wall <b>58</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b> on the right side wall of the outer housing piece <b>64</b> and the other electrical socket <b>268</b> is slidably mounted to a sliding support bracket <b>106</b>, which is mounted to the bottom wall <b>50</b> of the inner housing piece <b>46</b>. Specifically, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the support bracket <b>106</b> includes a track <b>108</b> with two rails <b>110</b>. Each rail <b>110</b> includes a base <b>112</b> that is connected at its upper end to a flange <b>114</b> that extends outwardly. The fixture <b>116</b> includes two L-shaped legs <b>118</b>. Each leg <b>118</b> extends downwardly and inwardly to define a channel. Each channel slidably receives the flange <b>114</b> of its corresponding rail <b>110</b>. The sliding support bracket <b>106</b> extends from the left side wall <b>56</b> to near the right end of the inner housing piece <b>46</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The second light source <b>272</b> slides along the track <b>108</b> of the support bracket <b>106</b> when the inner and outer housing pieces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> move relative to each other to adjust the width of the light emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the sterilizing system <b>22</b> includes an electrical control box <b>120</b>. The electrical control box <b>120</b> is electrically coupled via an electrical cord <b>123</b> to the power source <b>38</b> and mounted to the bottom wall <b>58</b> of the outer housing piece <b>48</b>. The electrical control box <b>120</b> is configured to direct and control power from the power source <b>38</b> to various devices of the sterilizing system <b>22</b>. The electrical control box <b>120</b> may include control circuitry <b>122</b> or a controller for controlling devices based on certain conditions. A transformer <b>124</b> may be provided in the electrical control box <b>120</b> to step down the supply voltage to a level suitable for low voltage circuits (e.g. sensors) coupled to it. Other transformers may be included in the system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electrical control box <b>120</b> directs power from the power source <b>38</b> to the electrical sockets <b>84</b>, <b>86</b> (for U shaped bulbs <b>75</b>) or <b>266</b>, <b>268</b> (for I shaped bulbs <b>175</b>) to supply power via lines <b>138</b> to the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. A ballast <b>126</b> may be coupled to the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. The ballast <b>126</b> is operative to drive the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A conveyor motion sensor <b>128</b> may be electrically coupled via a power signal wire <b>131</b> to the electrical control box <b>120</b>. The motion sensor <b>128</b> is operatively associated with the belt and is operative to detect movement of the belt <b>24</b> between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The motion sensor <b>128</b> may be an optical sensor or a sensor that operates via mechanical connection of the belt or roller. Other suitable motion sensors may also be used instead. The motion sensor <b>128</b> is operatively connected to the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> through the control circuitry <b>122</b>. The control circuitry <b>122</b> causes the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> to turn on and emit ultraviolet light on the belt at the lower flight path <b>32</b> in response to the motion sensor <b>128</b> detecting movement of the belt <b>24</b> between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, the motion sensor <b>128</b> outputs a signal indicative of the belt <b>24</b> moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> to the control circuitry <b>122</b> which in turn causes the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> to turn on and emit ultraviolet light on the belt at the lower flight path <b>32</b>. When the movement of the belt <b>24</b> stops, the motion sensor <b>128</b> outputs a signal to the control circuitry <b>122</b>, which in turn causes the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> to turn off and not emit ultraviolet light on the belt <b>24</b>. The motion sensor <b>128</b> is independent of the power controls of the conveyor system <b>20</b>. Thus, existing conveyor belt systems would not need to be modified in order to connect, for example, an on/off switch for the ultraviolet light in the existing control circuitry of the conveyor belt system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively, the sterilizing system <b>22</b> could be activated in other ways. For example, the sterilizing system <b>22</b> could be activated by incorporating a sterilizing system, control switch <b>41</b> that receives a power signal in response to the power switch <b>40</b> turning on. This would allow the sterilizing system to completely power down including the motion sensor <b>128</b> when the conveyor system <b>20</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively the ultraviolet light sources could be activated by a switch wired into the product sensor <b>42</b> rather than the motion sensor <b>128</b>. In this example, the product sensor <b>42</b> outputs a signal indicative of the belt <b>24</b> moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> to the control circuitry <b>122</b> which in turn causes the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> to turn on and emit ultraviolet light on the belt at the lower flight path <b>32</b>. The light sources could also be wired to the power source of the motor <b>36</b> rather than the motion sensor <b>128</b> or the product sensor <b>42</b>. In this example, the motor <b>36</b> outputs a signal indicative of the belt <b>24</b> moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> to the control circuitry <b>122</b> which in turn causes the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> to turn on and emit ultraviolet light on the belt at the lower flight path <b>32</b></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Often the motor <b>36</b> (or motors) that moves the belt turns on and off frequently and typically is not running for more than one or two seconds. This action causes the ultraviolet light sources to switch on and off frequently thereby causing premature degradation to the ultraviolet light source. In addition, the conveyor system <b>20</b> may not be on long enough which results in the light sources not being charged to full power which in turn results in providing insufficient intensity of ultraviolet radiation to sterilize the conveyor belt surface. To solve this problem, a delay switch <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) is provided in the sterilizing system <b>22</b> to keep the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> activated for an adequate time even after the belt <b>24</b> stops moving. In one exemplary embodiment, the delay switch <b>130</b> is incorporated into the electrical control box <b>120</b> and operatively connected to the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and motion sensor <b>128</b> via the control circuitry <b>122</b> in the electrical control box <b>120</b>. When the motion sensor <b>128</b> detects that the belt <b>24</b> has stopped moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, the motion sensor <b>128</b> outputs a signal indicative of this condition to the delay switch <b>130</b> via control circuitry <b>122</b> in the control box <b>120</b>. The delay switch <b>130</b> delays for a predetermined time the sending of this signal to the ultraviolet light sources that turns them off. The predetermined time may be set at time that the belt <b>24</b> will be adequately irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A power reduction switch <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) may also be provided. The power reduction switch <b>132</b> is operative to reduce the power output and hence, light intensity of the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> by a predetermined amount after the belt <b>24</b> has remained motionless for a first predetermine time. In one exemplary embodiment, the power reduction switch <b>132</b> is operatively connected to the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and motion sensor <b>128</b> via control circuitry <b>122</b>. When the motion sensor <b>128</b> detects that the belt <b>24</b> has stopped moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, the motion sensor <b>128</b> outputs a signal indicative of this condition to the power reduction switch <b>132</b> via control circuitry <b>122</b> in the control box <b>120</b>. After the first predetermined time has lapsed upon receipt of this signal, the power reduction switch <b>132</b> reduces the power output of the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. The ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may turn off or deactivate completely after the belt has remained motionless for a second predetermined time, which is greater than the first predetermined time. Alternatively, the ultraviolet light sources may also be automatically powered down or their power reduced when the conveyor system is turned off via the main power switch <b>40</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Alternatively or in addition, an ultraviolet light shield <b>274</b> may be provided. The ultraviolet light shield <b>274</b> is controlled by a light shield switch <b>276</b> that sends a signal to the ultraviolet light shield motor <b>278</b>, which in turn rotates the ultraviolet light shield <b>274</b> such that the light shield would block all or most of the ultraviolet radiation from intersecting or shining on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show an exemplary arrangement in which the ultraviolet light shields may comprise first and second pivoting parabolic light shields <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> around single I shaped light tube <b>175</b>. In this arrangement, the pivoting parabolic light shields are controlled by a light shield switch <b>276</b> that sends a signal to the ultraviolet light shield motor <b>278</b>, which in turn rotates the first and second parabolic light shields <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> such that the light shield would block all or most of the ultraviolet radiation from intersecting or shining on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref> show another exemplary arrangement in which the first and second pivoting parabolic light shields <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> may be constructed in three (or more) pieces. In particular, each shield includes a bottom fixed shield portion <b>284</b> and two rotating shield portions <b>286</b> on opposite sides of the fixed shield portion <b>284</b>. The rotating shield portions <b>286</b> are also located on opposite sides of the light tube <b>175</b>. Each of the rotating shield portions <b>286</b> pivots on a respective light shield hinge <b>288</b> provided on the fixed shield portion and is controlled by a respective light shield actuator arm <b>290</b>. Each light shield actuator arm <b>290</b> is operatively connected to a light shield actuator <b>292</b> capable of positioning the rotating light shield portion between a fully open position <b>294</b> and a closed position <b>296</b>. The actuator <b>292</b> may be a mechanical motor, solenoid, spring, magnetic or other device capable of repositioning the rotating light shield portions <b>286</b>. The actuators <b>292</b> are controlled by a light shield switch <b>276</b> that sends a signal to the actuator <b>292</b>, which in turn pushes or pulls the light shield actuator arms <b>290</b> inwardly or outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, each light shield actuator arm is permanently attached (screws, bolt or welded) to its respective rotating light shield portion at shield portion area <b>302</b>, which is located upwardly adjacent the light shield hinge <b>288</b>. The light shield actuator arm <b>290</b> is also movably connected to the actuator <b>292</b> via a pivot pin <b>304</b>. The pivot pin <b>304</b> slides along a slot <b>306</b> cut into the actuator arm <b>290</b> during inwardly and outward movement of the actuator arm <b>290</b>. When the actuator <b>292</b> extends (moves outwardly), the outward force is transferred from the actuator <b>292</b> to the pivot pin <b>304</b> to the actuator arm <b>290</b> below the light shield hinge <b>288</b>. Since the actuator arm <b>290</b> is permanently attached to the rotating light shield portion <b>286</b>, the actuator arm <b>290</b> and the rotating light shield portion <b>286</b> act as a single unit that pivots on the light shield hinge <b>288</b> in the middle. When the lower end of the actuator arm <b>290</b> is pushed outwardly, the rotating light shield portion <b>286</b> must pivot inwardly in the opposite direction on the light shield hinge <b>288</b>. Since the actuator <b>292</b> in this embodiment is fixed and the actuator <b>292</b> retracts (moves in) or extends (moves out) along a horizontal axis, the distance between the pivot pin <b>304</b> on the actuator and the shield portion area <b>302</b> increases as the actuator extends (moves outwardly) and decreases as the actuator <b>292</b> retracts (moves inwardly). Hence, the pivot pin <b>304</b> can slide back and forth along the slot <b>306</b> to accommodate the change in distance between the pivot pin <b>304</b> on the actuator and the point <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus, when the lower end of the light shield actuator arms <b>290</b> are pushed outwardly, the rotating light shield portions <b>286</b> pivot inwardly about the light shield hinge <b>288</b> such that the outer edge <b>298</b> of each of the rotating light shield portions <b>286</b> come together above the first and/or second light sources <b>270</b> and <b>272</b>. In this position (as illustrated by the right light shield <b>282</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 19</figref>), the light shield would block all or most of the ultraviolet radiation from intersecting or shining on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>. When the lower end of the light shield actuator arms <b>290</b> are pulled inwardly, the rotating light shield portions <b>286</b> pivot outwardly about the light shield hinge <b>288</b> such that the outer edge <b>298</b> of each of the rotating light shield portions <b>286</b> separate to their fully open position (as illustrated by the left light shield <b>280</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>). This allows the ultraviolet radiation to intersect or shine onto the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one exemplary embodiment, the light shield switch <b>276</b> is operatively connected to the light shield motor <b>278</b> and motion sensor <b>128</b> via control circuitry <b>122</b>. When the motion sensor <b>128</b> detects that the belt <b>24</b> has stopped moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, the motion sensor <b>128</b> outputs a signal indicative of this condition to the power reduction switch <b>132</b> via control circuitry <b>122</b> in the control box <b>120</b>. After the first predetermined time has lapsed upon receipt of this signal, the power reduction switch <b>132</b> reduces the power output of the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. After a second predetermined time, which is greater than the first predetermined time, has lapsed upon receipt of this signal, the light shield switch <b>276</b> activates the light shield motor <b>278</b> to rotate the ultraviolet light shield <b>274</b> reducing the ultraviolet light intensity incident on the exposed surface <b>34</b> of the conveyor belt <b>24</b>. The ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> may turn off or deactivate completely after the belt has remained motionless for a third predetermined time, which is greater than the second predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At any time during the first, second or third predetermined times, when the motion sensor <b>128</b> detects that the belt <b>24</b> begins moving between the upper and lower flight paths <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, the motion sensor <b>128</b> outputs a signal indicative of this condition to the control circuitry <b>122</b> that sends a signal to the power reduction switch <b>132</b> and the light shield switch <b>276</b> ensuring that the light shield is deactivated and the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> are returned to full power.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an ultraviolet light sensor <b>134</b> is electrically coupled to the electrical control box <b>120</b>. The ultraviolet light sensor <b>134</b> is operative to sense the intensity of the ultraviolet light emitted by the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. A contamination sensor <b>136</b> may also be electrically connected to the control box <b>120</b>. The contamination sensor <b>136</b> is operative to detect dirt, liquid, or biological contaminant. This sensor <b>136</b> may operate via an optical, magnetic, electrical or any other form of remote sensing. The contamination sensor <b>136</b> may send data to a display screen <b>144</b> to notify the operator that a sterilization cycle is needed. Alternatively or additionally, the contamination sensor <b>136</b> may incorporate a warning device to notify the operator that sterilization is needed. The notification device could include lights or an audible alarm. The contamination sensor may also include control circuitry that causes the conveyor belt to stop until the contaminated area is radiated by the ultraviolet lights sources for a sufficient length of time to sterilize that section of the conveyor belt. The sterilizing system <b>22</b> may include a timer that activates the ultraviolet lights and the conveyor belt motor automatically to complete one or more decontamination cycles. An on/off override switch may be included to activate a complete timed treatment cycle. Capacitors schematically indicated at <b>139</b> may be coupled to the light sources or other devices in the systems to, for example, limit the amount of current to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Monitor circuitry <b>140</b> may be provided in the electrical control box <b>120</b> to monitor the conditions of the devices or system in general. For example, the monitor circuitry <b>140</b> may measure the power drawn on various devices to monitor energy efficiency. This information may be used to determine the need for servicing or replacing devices, since devices such as ballasts draw more power as they begin to fail. The monitor circuitry <b>140</b> may include a computer chip or other electronic circuitry that can collect, transmit, and store data related to devices or the overall system functionality. The monitored data may be communicated via wireless or a line <b>137</b> from the control box <b>120</b> to an input/output (IO) port <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), wireless transmitter <b>143</b>, or to an output device such as a display screen <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Other output devices such as indicator lights or an audio device may instead be use. The display screen <b>144</b> may, for example, be part of personal computer (e.g. laptop, desktop, etc.), cell phone, personal digital assistant, an iPod&#xae;, iPhone&#xae;. The display screen <b>144</b> may have access to a website that receives the monitored data.

The magnetic attachment also holds the panels in place such that any vibration conveyed from the conveyor system does not result in vibration between the access panels and the housing. Additional magnetic seals may be positioned between the access panels to dampen vibration and shield the ultraviolet light. Alternatively, the magnetic seals <b>182</b>, <b>184</b> may be replaced with other materials such as plastic or polyurethane foam or any other material capable of providing the ability to dampen vibration and block ultraviolet radiation from escaping from between the inner and outer housing pieces <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">To gain access to the light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and other internal components of the sterilizing system <b>22</b>, the outer access panel <b>152</b> is first removed by grasping or prying the outer access panel <b>152</b> and applying sufficient force outwardly to overcome the magnetic force exerted between the magnetic fastener <b>176</b> and the magnetic seals <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>. Then, the inner access panel <b>150</b> is removed by grasping or prying the inner access panel <b>150</b> and applying sufficient force outwardly to overcome the magnetic force exerted between the magnetic fastener <b>162</b>. The removable access panels permit a technician to replace the light sources (or internal parts) without needing to detach the sterilizing system from the conveyor system. Further, no tools are needed to remove panels or otherwise gain access to light sources or other parts in the housing. Alternatively, the magnetic fasteners <b>162</b>, <b>176</b> may be replaced with bolts, clamps, screws, hook and loop fasteners such as Velcro&#xae;, or other fastening devices provided they maintain a flush surface between the bottom wall of the inner housing piece <b>50</b> and the inner access panel <b>150</b> and between the bottom wall of the outer housing piece <b>58</b> and the outer access panel <b>152</b></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The exemplary embodiment may utilize various systems to prevent human exposure to the ultraviolet when servicing or otherwise gaining access to the light sources or other internal components. One embodiment may comprise a power disconnect switch <b>186</b> that is provided such that the power being supplied to the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> is disconnected prior to removal of the outer access panel. In particular, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the power disconnect switch <b>186</b> includes a plug <b>188</b> and an electrical socket <b>190</b>. The plug <b>188</b> is electrically connected to the electrical cord <b>123</b> coming from the power source <b>38</b>. The socket <b>190</b> is electrically connected to the electrical control box <b>120</b>. The electrical cord <b>123</b> may be attached to the outer access panel <b>152</b>. When the outer panel <b>152</b> is attached to the housing <b>44</b>, the plug <b>188</b> is plugged into the socket <b>190</b> to allow the power to be supplied to the ultraviolet light sources <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and other devices of the sterilizing system <b>22</b>. When the outer access panel <b>152</b> needs to be removed to gain access to the light sources or other internal components, the user has to unplug the plug <b>188</b> from the electrical socket <b>190</b>, thus disconnecting the power source <b>38</b> from the sterilizing system <b>22</b> before the outer access panel <b>152</b> can be pulled or pried outwardly to overcome the magnetic force exerted between the magnetic fastener <b>176</b> and the magnetic seals <b>182</b>, <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Alternatively, or in addition to the power disconnect switch <b>186</b>, an optical light sensor <b>127</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be incorporated on the outer surface of the exemplary embodiment. The optical light sensor <b>127</b> may be electrically connected to the ballast <b>126</b> and control circuitry <b>122</b> in the control box <b>120</b>. The optical light sensor <b>127</b> would be capable of detecting fluctuations in the visible light spectrum indicative of removal of an access panel on the conveyor stand <b>28</b>. Upon detection of an increase of a predetermined amount of light indicative of removing an access panel of the conveyor stand <b>28</b>, electrical circuitry connected to the optical light sensor <b>127</b> would cut power to one or more of the UV light ballasts.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Other types of power disconnect switches can be used. For example, the switch could include a spring loaded pushbutton. For this switch, when the outer access panel is attached, the outer access panel causes the pushbutton to depress and close the switch to electrically connect the power source to the sterilizing system. When the outer access panel is removed, the pushbutton extends to open the switch and electrically disconnect the power source from the sterilizing system.</p>
