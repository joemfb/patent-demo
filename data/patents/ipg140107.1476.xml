<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to retaining wall blocks and walls made from such blocks. In particular, this invention relates to retaining wall blocks having a pinning system and channel bar that can be used with soil reinforcement material, such as a geogrid and walls made therefrom.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Numerous methods and materials exist for the construction of retaining walls. Such methods include the use of natural stone, poured in-place concrete, pre-cast concrete, masonry, and landscape timbers or railroad ties. In recent years, segmental concrete retaining wall units which are dry stacked (i.e., built without the use of mortar) have become a widely accepted product for the construction of retaining walls. Examples of such products are described in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 34,314 (Forsberg '314) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,216 (Sievert). Such products have gained popularity because they are mass produced, and thus relatively inexpensive. They are structurally sound, easy and relatively inexpensive to install, and couple the durability of concrete with the attractiveness of various architectural finishes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The retaining wall system described in Forsberg '314 has been particularly successful because of its use of block design that includes, among other design elements, a unique pinning system that interlocks and aligns the retaining wall units, allowing structural strength and efficient rates of installation. This system has also shown considerable advantages in the construction of larger walls when combined with the use of geogrid tie-backs hooked over the pins, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,914,876 (Forsberg).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The construction of modular concrete retaining walls as described in Forsberg involves several relatively simple steps. First, a leveling pad of dense base material or unreinforced concrete is placed, compacted and leveled. Second, the initial course of blocks is placed and leveled. Two pins are placed in each block into the pin holes. Third, core fill material, such as crushed rock, is placed in the cores of the blocks and spaces between the blocks to encourage drainage and add mass to the wall structure. Fourth, succeeding courses of the blocks are placed in a &#x201c;running bond&#x201d; pattern such that each block is placed between the two blocks below it. This is done by placing the blocks so that the receiving cavities of the bottom of the block fit over the pins that have been placed in the units in the course below. As each course is placed, pins are placed in the blocks, the blocks are corefilled with drainage rock, and the area behind the course is backfilled and compacted until the wall reaches the desired height.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many retaining wall systems described in the art include the use of reinforcing materials, also referred to as geogrids, geosynthetic reinforcement, or geogrid soil reinforcement. These terms sometimes are used interchangeably, and &#x201c;geogrid&#x201d; as used herein is intended as a generic term. Reinforcement materials may be inextensible, such as steel mesh, or extensible geosynthetic materials, such as mats and oriented polymeric materials. For example, flat polymeric sheets are used to form geogrids by forming holes in the sheets and then drawing them to orient the polymer and increase the modulus. Such polymeric materials include high density polyethylene (HDPE) and these materials form relatively stiff geogrids commercially available under the trade designation &#x201c;TENSAR&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While the HDPE materials are relatively stiff, a second type of geosynthetic material is composed of a mat typically formed from polyester fibers that are woven or knitted. These may comprise rectilinear polymer constructions characterized by large (e.g., 1 inch (2.5 cm) or greater) openings. In these open structure geogrids, polymeric strands are woven, knitted or &#x201c;welded&#x201d; (by means of adhesives and/or heat) together in a grid. Polymers used for making relatively flexible geogrids include polyester fibers. The polyester typically is coated, commonly using a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a latex topcoat. The coating may contain carbon black for ultraviolet (UV) stabilization. Some open structure geogrids comprise polyester yarn for the warp fibers and polypropylene as the fill fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another flexible reinforcing geosynthetic material is geo-textile fabric, i.e., woven or non-woven constructions without large openings. These fabrics typically comprise polymers and may be referred to as geofabrics. The geofabric can be laid between courses of blocks in a wall, and typically is tied into the wall and held there. When blocks are configured to have pin connectors, for example, a hole or slit is formed in the geofabric at the construction site and the geofabric is held on the blocks by fitting it over the pins.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In common use, the geogrid extends behind the retaining wall and ties into the earth behind the wall, thus creating a cohesive soil mass tied into the wall facing that resists overturning. Geogrids are either mechanically connected to a course of blocks or rely on the friction created by placing the geogrid layer between courses of blocks. When the mode of connection is friction alone, the geogrid is placed on top of a course of blocks, and then a succeeding layer of blocks is placed on top of the geogrid. When the connection is mechanical, after placement of a course of blocks to the desired height, geogrid is placed onto a course of blocks and held in place by means of pins in the block (which may have a primary function of aligning and holding blocks together) or by means of special connectors. Flexible geogrid is put under tension by pulling back and staking the geogrid behind the retaining wall. Backfill is placed and compacted over the geogrid. Construction of the wall continues and may include additional layers of geogrid.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such systems have proven reliable in many wall applications. There are limits to their performance however, particularly at the upper portions of the wall, where the load of the blocks above the geogrids layer do not provide as much load on the connection, so that frictional forces are reduced. The use of frictional connections forces the wall designer and builder to use more and higher strength geogrids because connection strength limits the strength of the system, and this adds expense to the wall. Mechanical connectors and retaining mechanisms attempt to overcome this limitation by mechanically connecting the geogrids to the wall facing in a way that is not load dependent. The difficulty with this approach is that in order for such connectors and retaining mechanisms to provide high levels of efficient connection they must add considerable expense to the cost of using the geogrids reinforcement, and add complexity and expense to the installation process. Thus there are shortcomings to both approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, it is desirable to facilitate construction methods of retaining walls as well as to optimize the ease of construction and durability of the wall being built.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It would be desirable to produce a wall block and a wall from the wall block having a pinning system for interlocking blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It would further be desirable for the pinning system to be used with soil reinforcement materials, such as a geogrid.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It would also be desirable to produce a wall block having a pinning system for interlocking blocks and a channel with a channel bar that could be used in combination with soil reinforcement materials, such as a geogrid that would secure the soil reinforcement material to the block.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It would also be desirable to produce a retaining wall from a wall block having a pinning system for interlocking blocks and a channel with a channel bar that could be used in combination with soil reinforcement materials, such as a geogrid, to secure the soil reinforcement material to the block and thus the wall itself to allow for greater stability and durability of the retaining wall.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It would be further desirable to produce a retaining wall from a wall block with a channel bar system that interconnects courses of block with pins.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It would further be desirable to produce a wall, such as a retaining wall, from a wall block with a pinning system and/or a channel bar system that allows for the creation of curved, circular and serpentine shaped walls.</p>

A layer of soil reinforcement material is laid over the pins and receiving channel and then a channel bar with pin receiving slots is placed over the pins and soil reinforcement material and into the receiving channel. The soil reinforcement material is then folded back over the channel bar and pins and extends back towards the retained earth of the wall. The channel bar is manufactured in a manner that allows the channel bar to pivot in the receiving channel as the soil reinforcing material is pulled back towards the retained earth of the wall securing the soil reinforcing material to the retaining wall. The next course of block is placed on the lower course with the head or top of the pins being received in the pin receiving cavities of the upper course providing additional securing of the soil reinforcement material to the retaining wall. The invention also relates to the blocks and channel bar and additionally to methods of constructing walls with the blocks, walls with the blocks and channel bar system and walls with the blocks and pinning system. Multiple embodiments of the block and channel bar are disclosed.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An embodiment of the retaining wall block is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. Block <b>100</b> is made of a rugged, weather resistant material, preferably (and typically) zero-slump molded concrete. Other suitable materials include plastic, reinforced fibers, wood, metal and stone. Block <b>100</b> has parallel top face <b>102</b> and bottom face <b>103</b>, front face <b>104</b>, back face <b>105</b> and first and second side walls <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>. Front face <b>104</b> and back face <b>105</b> each extend from top face <b>102</b> to bottom face <b>103</b>. Side walls <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> extend from top face <b>102</b> to bottom face <b>103</b> and from front face <b>104</b> to back face <b>105</b>. Block <b>100</b> is generally symmetrical about vertical plane of symmetry S.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Block <b>100</b> comprises body portion <b>108</b>, rear portion <b>109</b> and neck portions <b>110</b> which connect body portion <b>108</b> to rear portion <b>109</b>. Front face <b>104</b> forms part of body portion <b>108</b>, while back face <b>105</b> forms part of rear portion <b>109</b>. The body, rear and neck portions <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, and <b>110</b> each extend between top and bottom faces <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and between first and second side walls <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>. Side walls <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> are thus of a compound shape and have side voids <b>112</b> as a result of the reduced width of neck portions <b>110</b> compared to that of body and head portions <b>108</b> and <b>109</b>. Side walls <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> also have side surface <b>111</b> which is part of the body <b>108</b>, and side surface <b>113</b> which is part of rear portion <b>109</b>. The side surface <b>111</b> of side <b>106</b> and side surface <b>111</b> of side wall <b>107</b> are angled back towards the back face <b>105</b> of the block and can create curvature of a wall when side surface <b>111</b> of a block in a course of wall is aligned directly adjacent to side surface <b>111</b> of another block in a course of a wall. It should be noted that the shape of the wall being constructed is not limiting and that the placement of the blocks in a course of a wall being constructed may also be linear or any combination of curved and linear as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Opening or core <b>114</b> extends through neck portion <b>110</b> from top face <b>102</b> to bottom face <b>103</b>. Core <b>114</b> is optional and provides the advantage of reducing the weight of block <b>100</b>. Side voids <b>112</b> also reduce the weight of block <b>100</b>. Lower block weight is both a manufacturing advantage and an advantage when constructing a wall from the blocks as it reduces cost due to less material and makes lifting of the blocks easier.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">First and second pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> are located in body portion <b>108</b> and extend between top and bottom faces <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, i.e., opening onto both top and bottom surfaces. Pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> are referred to as kidney, triangular or slotted shaped, the cavities may be curvilinear, having no sharp angles. The shape and size and location of the cavities are selected to maximize the strength of the block while at the same time, since they extend between the top and bottom surfaces, reducing the weight of the block. Pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> preferably extend all the way through the blocks, however, that is not a requirement of the invention and is not limiting as to the scope of the invention. This is an advantage because construction of a wall with the pinning system of the present invention is simplified since the installer can see the pin in a block in a lower course through the pin receiving cavity of a block in an upper course, thus making alignment easier. The weight of the block is also decreased making handling of the blocks easier and less material is used to make the blocks reducing the overall cost of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> are adjacent a pair of first pin holes <b>116</b>, i.e., first and second pin holes, which are also located in body portion <b>108</b> of the block. The first pair of pin holes <b>116</b> are positioned away from pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> and slightly set back towards core <b>114</b> and towards the line of symmetry S. An optional second pair of pin holes <b>117</b>, i.e., third and fourth pin holes, is also illustrated in block <b>100</b>. This optional set of pin holes is located in a rearward direction and further toward the core and away from the line of symmetry S relative to the first set of pin holes and provides a way to offset stacking blocks when constructing a wall, as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Pin holes typically extend through from the top face <b>102</b> to bottom face <b>103</b> and are sized to receive pin <b>50</b> which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. Pin <b>50</b> has a shaft <b>51</b> which is placed into a pin hole in the top surface <b>102</b> of a lower course of blocks when constructing a wall. Pin <b>50</b> may also have a head which projects from the surface of the block of the lower course and abuts to the perpendicular rear wall of the pin receiving cavity of a block in an upper course of a constructed wall. The head (if there is one) of the pin may have a larger diameter than the shaft <b>51</b> and may also be tapered, square, round or any other desired shape. Additionally the shaft <b>51</b> of the pin may be circular, square or any other desired shape as well. In this manner, the pin in a block on a lower course of blocks in a wall engages a pin receiving cavity of a block in an upper course. This results in an interlocking of the blocks with a predetermined amount of setback or no setback between courses depending upon the location of the pinholes that are utilized in the construction of the wall. It is to be understood that the shape of the pin is not limiting and could be, for example, uniformly shaped with no head or could have any other number of features. Further, although the pin holes are shown as extending through the block from the top surface to the bottom surface the present invention is equally applicable to pin holes that do not extend all the way through the block.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Second pin holes <b>117</b> are disposed toward the rear or head portion and toward side recesses <b>112</b> relative to first pin holes <b>116</b>. Second pin holes <b>117</b> provide increased setback as compared to that provided by first pin holes <b>116</b>. Further pin holes can be provided, if desired, so as to provide for further choices of predetermined setback. Additionally, the location of the pin holes in the body of the block may be varied as desired as well as the location of the pin receiving cavities. Optionally, only one set of pin holes may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as desired depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Top surface <b>102</b> has receiving channel <b>130</b> located in body portion <b>108</b>. Receiving channel <b>130</b> may extend the entire length of the body portion as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref> and open onto side surfaces <b>111</b> of side walls <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>. The channel may also open into the pair of pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> and may additionally align on one side with walls <b>122</b> of the pin-receiving cavity <b>118</b>. The channel may also open into the first pair of pin holes <b>116</b> and into the second pair of pin holes <b>117</b>. The receiving channel may be of sufficient width and depth as to accommodate a channel bar and 2 layers of soil retention material (due to fold over) such as geogrid discussed in greater detail below. The receiving channel may specifically have a depth of &#xbc; of an inch to 1&#xbd; (6.4 to 38 mm) inches but may be wider or narrower depending upon the application. It should be noted that the shape, width and length of the channel can vary depending upon the application and could, for example, only encompass one of the sets of pin holes or could completely encompass the pin receiving cavities as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. It should further be noted that the length need not span the entire length of body portion <b>108</b> and could optionally only open onto one side wall or neither side wall depending upon the application as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Block <b>100</b> is manufactured in the mold with the top surface facing up. A channel mold slat is attached at the top of the mold and imparts the receiving channel <b>130</b> into the top surface <b>102</b> of the block as the material inside the mold sets around the channel mold slat. The channel mold slat is then removed and the block is stripped from the mold with the receiving channel formed into the top surface of the block.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Though the blocks illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> may have various dimensions, block <b>100</b> typically has a height (i.e., the distance between surfaces <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>) of about 8 inches (203 mm), a body length (i.e., the distance from side surface <b>111</b> of side wall <b>106</b> to side surface <b>111</b> of side wall <b>107</b>) of about 18 inches (457 mm) and a width (i.e., the distance from front face <b>104</b> to rear face <b>105</b>) of about 12 inches (305 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An alternative embodiment of the block is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7B</figref>. Block <b>200</b> is substantially similar to block <b>100</b> except that receiving channel walls <b>231</b> or receiving channel <b>230</b> and back face <b>205</b> have been given a radii or rounded edge. This rounded edge helps to minimize the occurrence of the geogrid ripping or tearing on a sharp angle of the receiving channel wall and back face and thus ensures greater stability and durability of a wall built with such blocks. Additionally, pin receiving cavities <b>218</b> each have rear walls <b>222</b> that are substantially perpendicular to top surface <b>202</b> and bottom surface <b>203</b>. The remaining wall surfaces of the kidney, triangular or slotted shape of the pin receiving cavities may be tapered for ease of manufacturing. That is, the surface area of the opening of the kidney shape pin receiving cavity at the top surface <b>202</b> of the block is slightly greater than the surface area of the opening kidney shape pin receiving cavity in the bottom surface <b>203</b> of the block. This taper of some of the surfaces of the pin receiving cavity is used in the manufacturing of the block to strip the pin receiving mold bar used to form the pin receiving cavities from the block in the mold by creating a draft angle which strips the core bar with greater ease from the block in the mold while helping to maintain the integrity of the shape of the pin receiving cavity. Walls <b>222</b> of the pin receiving cavity may be designed to remain substantially perpendicular so as to create a more secure abutment for the receiving of the head of a pin <b>50</b> inside the pin receiving cavity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate the secured interlocking connection between the two courses. Head <b>52</b> of pin <b>50</b> abuts wall <b>222</b> of the pin receiving cavity causing the pin to shift diagonally in the pin hole of the course of blocks below and thus secures the pin in the pin hole and pin receiving cavity. It should be noted that this is not limiting and that all walls of the pin receiving cavity could all be tapered or perpendicular or any combination thereof depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Another embodiment of the block of this invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. A top view of block <b>300</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Receiving channel <b>330</b> has been molded into body portion <b>308</b> on top surface <b>302</b>. Unlike the receiving channel of block <b>100</b>, receiving channel <b>330</b> does not extend and open onto the side walls of block <b>300</b> and is completely contained within the body portion <b>308</b> of the block. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a bottom view of block <b>300</b> that has an additional receiving channel <b>335</b> on the bottom surface <b>303</b> of the block which can receive the head of the pins from a lower course of block at any location inside the channel resulting in greater flexibility of wall design while securing the blocks in one course to the blocks in the next upper course. Receiving channel <b>335</b> allows the blocks of an upper course in a wall the option to follow more accurately and with greater ease of installation contour of the blocks from a lower course in a wall especially curved and curvilinear contours by allowing the pins of a lower course of blocks to be received in a broader range of area along the length of the surface of the block. Receiving channel <b>335</b> could be incorporated into the block in combination with pin receiving cavities, as shown, or in place of the pin receiving cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an additional embodiment of the block of the present invention. Block <b>400</b> is substantially similar to block <b>100</b> except that block <b>400</b> has only one set of pin holes <b>416</b>. Additionally, receiving channel <b>430</b> is wider than receiving channel <b>130</b> and pin receiving cavities <b>418</b> are completely contained within the receiving channel <b>430</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate front face <b>404</b> of block <b>400</b> that has been provided with a desired pattern, design, or texture. These patterns or textures could be applied to the front or back faces of any of the blocks of the present invention. For example, a roughened surface such as the appearance of natural stone is a desirable appearance and can be formed during the molding process with liners as known in the art. It should be noted that the pattern or design is not limiting and any desired pattern could be imprinted onto the block surface as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 17</figref> illustrate different embodiments of a channel bar which can be used in combination with the pinning system or separately from the pinning system described above to help secure soil retaining materials such as geogrid to the wall block and thus to the wall itself. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>which has a rectangular shape and has pin receiving slots <b>71</b><i>a </i>that receive pins <b>50</b> of the wall block pinning system. Channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>has top surface <b>72</b>, bottom surface <b>74</b>, front surface <b>76</b>, back surface <b>78</b> and side surfaces <b>79</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, back surface <b>78</b> has a curved or radial shape and front surface <b>76</b> has a compound angular shape. Receiving slots <b>71</b><i>a </i>have an oval shape and the walls of receiving slots are curvilinear and have a radius that widens from the bottom surface to a halfway point and then narrows to the top surface of the channel bar. It should be noted that the receiving slots can have any number of sizes and shapes depending upon the application. The channel bar is sized in width and length to be accommodated inside the receiving channel of the wall block and can be for example &#x215b; to &#xbc; of an inch (3.2 to 6.4 mm) thick. An advantage of the channel bar having a length substantially similar to the length of the receiving channel of a single block is that the channel bar is easier to carry handle and place when constructing a wall with geogrid from the blocks and channel bar and also allows any wall constructed to have curvature as discussed below. It should be noted that the length, width, and depth of the channel bar is not limiting and the channel bar could have any desired width, length, or depth depending upon the application. The receiving channel can also have any desired width, length, or depth. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 to 26</figref> for an example of a receiving channel with less depth than the receiving channel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 22</figref>. For example, the channel bar may be placed into a receiving channel of one block and may be sized to extend into the receiving channel of an adjacent block or blocks. Further the width of the channel bar could be as wide as the receiving channel or narrower as needed depending on the application. The channel bars of the present invention can be made of any suitable material such as mold injected plastics. It should further be noted that the front surface and back surface of the channel bar may have any desired shape or combination of shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates channel bar <b>70</b><i>b </i>which has a rectangular shape and has pin receiving slots <b>71</b><i>b </i>that receive pins <b>50</b> of the wall block pinning system. Unlike channel bar <b>70</b><i>a</i>, the walls of channel bar <b>70</b><i>b </i>are perpendicular to its top and bottom surfaces. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, pin receiving slots <b>71</b><i>c </i>could also be circular in shape and fit the shape of the pins quite closely. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, the edges of the channel bar that contact the geogrid could also be roughened or grooved to secure the geogrid better. These edges could be rounded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) or straight (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates channel bar <b>70</b><i>c </i>which has channel bar pins <b>75</b> instead of receiving slots extending from the bottom surface. Channel bar <b>70</b><i>c </i>eliminates the need for separate pins and combines the pinning system and geogrid securing system into one part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates channel bar <b>70</b><i>d </i>which is similar to <b>70</b><i>c </i>except that channel bar pins <b>75</b> extend from both the top and bottom surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 22</figref> illustrate the method of constructing a structure such as a retaining wall from blocks <b>400</b> utilizing pins inserted into pinholes <b>416</b> to interlock the blocks and using channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>to secure a geogrid G to the receiving channel <b>430</b> to thus stabilize the structure being constructed. In order to illustrate the method by which the wall is constructed <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 22</figref> show only a small portion of the top surface of a block in the wall including a pinhole <b>416</b> and receiving channel <b>430</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 22</figref> show a cross sectional view of the block <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> taken along the line A-A. The front face of the block is not shown but is oriented to the right in the drawing figures. The earth or soil which is being retained by the wall is oriented or located to the left in the drawings. Generally, when constructing a wall, a trench is excavated to a pre-selected depth and lined with a level base of granular material such as crushed stone. A base layer is then placed and leveled onto the crushed stone. The blocks are placed side to side with front face <b>404</b> facing outward and the bottom surface facing downward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a very enlarged portion of a block <b>400</b> in a course of blocks in the wall showing channel <b>430</b> and pin hole <b>416</b> and where the front of the block is oriented to the right of the drawing and the soil or earth being retained by the wall is oriented to the left of the drawing. Once the base layer is laid additional courses of blocks are placed until the wall reaches a desired height. During construction of the wall, pins <b>50</b> are placed into pin holes <b>416</b> in the top surface of blocks in a lower course as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and the upper portion of the pins are received in pin receiving cavities <b>418</b> in blocks in an adjacent upper course of blocks to connect and stabilize the courses.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the wall has reached a height where reinforcement is desired or required a soil retaining material such as a geogrid G may be placed between courses of blocks in the wall. The geogrid G extends outward from the earth behind the retaining wall and is placed onto the wall block and over pins <b>50</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>is then placed over the geogrid layer and the pins <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>is placed into receiving channel <b>430</b> with top surface <b>72</b> facing up and with back surface <b>78</b> of channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>facing toward the front face of block <b>400</b>, thus front surface <b>76</b> faces toward the rear portion of block <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the geogrid G that extends outward from the front face of the block and away from the earth that is to be retained is then folded back over or around the channel bar and pins and thus extends back towards the retained earth securing the geogrid to the wall block. As the geogrid G is folded back around and pulled securely over the channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>and pins <b>50</b>, the tension created causes the channel bar to pivot inside the receiving channel <b>430</b> of block <b>400</b>. As the channel bar pivots the angular front surface <b>76</b> of channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>engages bottom surface <b>432</b> of the receiving cavity <b>430</b> and the tapered pin receiving slots <b>71</b><i>a </i>engage the surface of pin <b>50</b> thereby locking or fixedly securing the channel bar <b>70</b><i>a </i>inside the receiving channel <b>430</b> of block <b>400</b>. If a channel bar of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> or <b>36</b> is used, the channel bar would have much less of a pivot as the geogrid G is put in tension. The tension of the geogrid causing the securing of the channel bar in the receiving channel is continuously maintained due to the retaining forces of the geogrid. The manufactured shape of the channel bar and receiving slots of the channel bar allow for the geogrid to be fixedly secured in the receiving channel of the block and thereby to the retaining wall adding to the overall structural integrity of the wall being constructed. The next layer of blocks is placed on top of this course with the pin receiving cavities in the lower surfaces of the blocks accepting the pin in the block of the lower course which helps to additionally lock and secure the geogrid and thus the channel bar in the receiving channel. This continues for all subsequent layers of the wall until the desired height of the wall is reached. It should be noted that the receiving channel for the geogrid could be secured to the bottom side of the block by flipping the block of the present invention over so that the top surface of the block becomes the bottom surface of the block in the construction of the wall and thus the geogrid is secured to the bottom surface of the block depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 to 27</figref> illustrate the method of constructing a structure such as a retaining wall from blocks <b>100</b> utilizing pins inserted into pinholes <b>116</b> to interlock the blocks and channel bar <b>70</b><i>b </i>to secure a geogrid G to the receiving channel <b>130</b> and thus the structure being constructed. The blocks are placed side to side with front face <b>104</b> facing outward and the bottom surface facing downward. Once the base layer is laid, pins <b>50</b> are placed into pin holes <b>116</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and additional courses of blocks are placed in a manner similar to that described above until a desired height is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Once the wall has reached a height where reinforcement or stabilization is desired or necessary a soil retaining material such as a geogrid G may be used. Geogrid G extends outward from the earth behind the retaining wall and is placed onto the wall block and over pins <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Channel bar <b>70</b><i>b </i>is then placed over the geogrid layer and over pins <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. The geogrid G is then folded back and pulled securely over the channel bar <b>70</b><i>b </i>and pins <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The next layer of blocks is placed on top of the base course with the pin receiving cavities in the bottom surface of blocks in the next layer accepting the upper portion of pins in the blocks of the lower course which helps to additionally lock and secure the geogrid and thus the channel bar in the receiving channel. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Construction of the wall is continued until the desired height is reached. One or more additional layers of geogrid may be included as desired or necessary to maintain the stability and safety of the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 to 30</figref> illustrate different ways in which the channel bars of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> of the present invention could be utilized to attach geogrid to walls instead of using pins <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows channel bar pins <b>75</b> of channel bar <b>70</b><i>c </i>oriented in a downward direction and being inserted through geogrid G and into pin holes <b>116</b> of receiving channel <b>130</b> with the geogrid G then being readied to be pulled back over channel bar <b>70</b><i>c</i>. The channel bar pins in this embodiment have been provided with friction fins <b>76</b> for additional securing of channel bar <b>70</b><i>c </i>and thus the geogrid to the block. It should be noted that any of the embodiments of the pins or channel bar pins of the present invention may be provided with the friction fins depending upon the application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> shows channel bar <b>70</b><i>c </i>with pins <b>75</b> oriented in an upward direction and being inserted onto a layer of geogrid G into receiving channel <b>130</b> with the geogrid G then being readied to be pulled back over channel bar <b>70</b><i>c </i>and over channel bar pins <b>75</b>. After the geogrid has been pulled back over channel bar <b>70</b><i>c</i>, channel bar pins <b>75</b> are received in the pin receiving cavities of an upper course of blocks. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows geogrid G extending from the earth behind the retaining wall and placed into the receiving channel <b>130</b> of a block. The channel bar pins <b>75</b> of the bottom surface of channel bar <b>70</b><i>d </i>are then threaded through the geogrid and into the pin holes <b>116</b> of the lower course of block. The geogrid is then folded back and wrapped around channel bar <b>70</b><i>d </i>and over the channel bar pins <b>75</b> extending from the top surface of the channel bar <b>70</b><i>d</i>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Once the desired height of the wall is reached a capping layer may be added. Typically, the placement of blocks is vertically offset in adjacent courses in a running bond pattern. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> illustrates a wall constructed with first pair of pin holes <b>116</b> of block <b>100</b> being utilized with pins <b>50</b>. Pin holes <b>116</b> provides near vertical setback between courses resulting in a vertical wall <b>510</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates a straight retaining wall <b>195</b> constructed from blocks <b>100</b> utilizing the second pair of pinholes <b>117</b> to interlock the blocks. As can be seen, use of the second pair of pin holes <b>117</b> with pin <b>50</b>, provides for setback between courses resulting in stepped back wall <b>195</b>. It should be noted that the receiving channel of the block is wide enough to encompass the width of the channel bar to be used to secure the geogrid to the block with the use of the first or second set of pin holes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 to 35</figref> illustrate curved retaining wall <b>500</b> constructed from blocks <b>100</b> utilizing the first pair of pinholes <b>116</b> to interlock the blocks. A trench is excavated to a pre-selected depth and lined with a level base of granular material such as crushed stone. A base layer is then placed and leveled onto the crushed stone. The blocks are placed side to side with angled side surface <b>111</b> of side <b>106</b> adjacent with the angled side surface <b>111</b> of side wall <b>107</b> of an adjacent block in the course of wall. The amount of curvature can vary depending upon how closely the angled side surfaces are from each other. Front face <b>104</b> is placed facing outward and bottom surface <b>103</b> facing downward. It should be noted that the bottom surface <b>103</b> should be placed facing downward so that pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> can receive the heads of the pins from the previous course of blocks. Once the base layer is laid, pins are placed into pin holes <b>116</b>. A soil retaining material such as a geogrid extends from the earth behind the retaining wall and is placed onto the wall block between course of blocks at a height where stabilization of the wall is desired or necessary. The geogrid is placed over pins <b>50</b> and the width of the strip of geogrid material being used may be substantially similar to that of the width of the block along the curvature for greater ease when constructing the wall. It should be noted that this is not limiting and that any width strip of geogrid material may be used. One of the channel bars <b>70</b><i>a </i>or <b>70</b><i>b </i>is then placed over the geogrid layer and over pins <b>50</b>. The geogrid that extends outward from the front face of the block and away from the earth that is to be retained is then folded back over the channel bar and the pins and thus extends back towards the retained earth securing the geogrid to the wall block. The length of geogrid that is folded back over the top of the channel bar is preferably significantly longer then the length of the lower layer of geogrid. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref>, <b>25</b>, and <b>35</b>. The next layer of blocks is placed on top of the base course with the pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> accepting the head <b>52</b> of the pin. This continues for all subsequent layers of the wall until the desired height of the wall is reached. As can be seen, use of first pair of pin holes <b>116</b> with pin <b>50</b> in a lower course of blocks in a wall projecting into pin receiving cavities <b>118</b> of an upper course of blocks, provides near vertical setback between courses resulting in a near vertical wall.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Bottom surface <b>103</b> could be modified to include a pin receiving channel similar to pin receiving channel <b>335</b> of block <b>300</b> so that the pin receiving channel can receive the heads of the pins from the previous course of blocks. The pin receiving channel produces greater flexibility for the curve of the wall by allowing the head of the pin to be received at any position along the length of the body of the block. This flexibility allowed by the pin receiving channel results in the maintainability of the curve through each successive course of blocks of the wall and facilitates the ability to interlock blocks in successive course thus giving the wall more structural stability and strength. It should be noted that a pin receiving channel could be placed in many different block shapes and types and that different types of walls, such as freestanding, may be made using this system to create a curved, circular or serpentine shaped wall depending upon the application.</p>
