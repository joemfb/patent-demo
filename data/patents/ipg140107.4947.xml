<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to an image formation apparatus with a sheet delivery structure which facilitates a smooth transfer of a toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An image formation apparatus such as a copier, a facsimile apparatus or a printer typically has a transfer structure for transferring a toner image formed on an image carrier to a sheet. The transfer structure has a photosensitive drum which is used as the image carrier, a transfer roller which forms a nip portion in cooperation with the photosensitive drum, and a guide element which guides the sheet nearby the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The guide element includes a main guide configured to define a delivery path through which the sheet passes, and a sub-guide attached to the main guide. The main guide has a tip portion near the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum. The sub-guide which protrudes from the tip portion of the main guide toward the nip portion partially occupies a space from the tip portion of the main guide to the nip portion, so that the sheet is stably supported by the sub-guide. Thus, failures in toner image transfer because of trailing end flapping of a sheet become less likely.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The aforementioned sub-guide is formed of a synthetic resin film. In addition, a thickness of the sub-guide is determined for appropriate elastic characteristics, which work for better adhesion of the sheet to the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Friction between the sub-guide made of synthetic resin and a sheet causes electrostatic charge of the sub-guide. The electrostatic charge of the sub-guide causes toner scattering from the photosensitive drum. Contamination of the sub-guide resulting from the toner scattering eventually causes stains on the sheet (stains on a blank surface opposite to a transfer surface onto which the toner image is transferred).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An increase in distance between the sub-guide and the photosensitive drum in order to avoid the stains on the blank surface results in insufficient support for a sheet moving toward the nip portion. As a result, failures in the transfer may be caused by the sheet flapping.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to provide an image formation apparatus for suitably performing transfer of a toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An image formation apparatus for forming a toner image on a sheet according to one aspect of the present invention including: an image carrier configured to carry the toner image; a transfer element configured to electrostatically transfer the toner image on the image carrier to the sheet; and a guide element configured to guide the sheet, wherein the image carrier and the transfer element form a nip portion for nipping the sheet, and the guide element includes a main guide configured to guide the sheet toward the nip portion and a conductive sub-guide protruding from the main guide toward the nip portion.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Image formation apparatuses according to various embodiments are described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted that directional terms hereinafter such as &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;right&#x201d; and alike are used only for the purpose of clarification of the description, and are not intended to limit embodiments of the image formation apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">&#x3c;First Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Entire Structure of Image Formation Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows an internal structure of an image formation apparatus according to the first embodiment. The image formation apparatus described in connection with the first embodiment is a tandem type color printer. It should be noted that the present embodiments may be applied to a printer, a copier, a facsimile apparatus, a multi-function peripheral having functions thereof in combination, or another apparatus configured to perform printing by transferring a toner image to the surface of a print medium on the basis of external image inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A color printer <b>100</b> has a substantially rectangular boxed housing <b>200</b>. The color printer <b>100</b> includes a delivery mechanism <b>300</b> configured to deliver a sheet S in the housing <b>200</b>, an image formation section <b>400</b> configured to form a toner image on the sheet S delivered by the delivery mechanism <b>300</b>, a fixing section <b>500</b> configured to fix the toner image on the sheet S, and a discharge section <b>600</b> configured to discharge the sheet S to the outside of the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> has a cassette <b>310</b> configured to store sheets S. A user may pull the cassette <b>310</b> from the housing <b>200</b> as appropriate. Thereafter, the user may place a stack of sheets S in the cassette <b>310</b>, and then put the cassette <b>310</b> back in the housing <b>200</b>. The cassette <b>310</b> includes a lift plate <b>311</b> configured to support the stack of the sheets S, and a push-up mechanism <b>312</b> configured to push up and tilt the lift plate <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a pick-up roller <b>321</b>. The pick-up roller <b>321</b> abuts on the lead edge of a sheet S on the lift plate <b>311</b>, which is pushed up by the push-up mechanism <b>312</b>. The pick-up roller <b>321</b> rotates to discharge the sheet S from the cassette <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> has a feed roller <b>322</b> and a separation roller <b>323</b>, which are arranged after the pick-up roller <b>321</b>. The feed and separation rollers <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> are arranged to hold a sheet S discharged from the cassette <b>310</b> by the pick-up roller <b>321</b> therebetween. The feed roller <b>322</b> rotates to deliver the sheet S further downstream. The separation roller <b>323</b> rotates to return the sheet S to the cassette <b>310</b>. As a result, several sheets S stacked on each other, which have been sent out from the cassette <b>310</b> by the pick-up roller <b>321</b>, are appropriately separated by the feed and separation rollers <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>. Thus, only the sheet S in direct contact with the feed roller <b>322</b> is delivered downstream one by one.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a feed path <b>324</b> which extends upwardly from the feed roller <b>322</b>, and a delivery roller <b>325</b> which upwardly sends the sheet S. The feed path <b>324</b> extends toward a nip portion N formed between a transfer belt <b>410</b> and a transfer roller <b>420</b> of the image formation section <b>400</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> has a resist roller pair <b>326</b> disposed immediately before the nip portion N. The resist roller pair <b>326</b> sends sheets S, which have been delivered along the feed path <b>324</b> by the delivery roller <b>325</b>, toward the nip portion N in synchronization with formation of toner images in the image formation section <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a pivotal manual feed tray <b>330</b> attached to the housing <b>200</b>. A user may rotate the manual feed tray <b>330</b> so that the manual feed tray <b>330</b> protrudes from the outer surface of the housing <b>200</b>. Thereafter, the user may place a sheet S on the manual feed tray <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a pick-up roller <b>331</b> situated near the pivotal manual feed tray <b>330</b>, which is supported by the housing <b>200</b>. The pick-up roller <b>331</b> abutting on the lead edge of a sheet S on the manual feed tray <b>330</b> rotates to pull the sheet S into the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a feed roller <b>332</b> and a separation roller <b>333</b>, which are arranged after the pick-up roller <b>331</b>. The feed and separation rollers <b>332</b>, <b>333</b> are arranged to hold a sheet S together, which has been pulled into the housing <b>200</b> by the pick-up roller <b>331</b>. The feed roller <b>332</b> rotates to deliver the sheet S further downstream. The separation roller <b>333</b> rotates to return the sheet S to the manual feed tray <b>330</b>. As a result, several the sheets S stacked on each other, which have been sent from the manual feed tray <b>330</b> by the pick-up roller <b>331</b>, are appropriately separated by the feed and separation rollers <b>332</b>, <b>333</b>. Thus, only the sheet S in direct contact with the feed roller <b>332</b> is delivered downstream one by one.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a joining path <b>334</b> which extends from the feed roller <b>332</b> toward the feed path <b>324</b>, and several delivery rollers <b>335</b> disposed along the joining path <b>334</b>. The joining path <b>334</b> substantially horizontally extending above the cassette <b>310</b> is curved upwardly, and joins with the feed path <b>324</b> immediately before the resist roller pair <b>326</b>. Consequently, sheets S sent from the manual feed tray <b>330</b> are also delivered toward the nip portion N by the resist roller pair <b>326</b> in synchronization with formation of toner images in the image formation section <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, the image formation section <b>400</b> forms toner images on sheets S, which have sent to the nip portion N by the resist roller pair <b>326</b>. The image formation section <b>400</b> includes an image formation unit <b>430</b> in addition to the aforementioned transfer belt <b>410</b> and transfer roller <b>420</b>. The image formation unit <b>430</b> includes a first image formation unit <b>430</b>M configured to form images using magenta toner, a second image formation unit <b>430</b>C configured to form images using cyan toner, a third image formation unit <b>430</b>Y configured to form images using yellow toner, and a fourth image formation unit <b>430</b>Bk configured to form images using black toner. Toner images formed by the first to fourth image formation units <b>430</b>M, <b>430</b>C, <b>430</b>Y, <b>430</b>Bk are sequentially transferred onto the transfer belt <b>410</b>. The toner images are superimposed on the transfer belt <b>410</b> to become one full-color toner image. The transfer belt <b>410</b> carries and delivers the full-color toner image to the nip portion N. In the present embodiment, the transfer belt <b>410</b> is exemplified as the image carrier configured to carry a toner image. In addition, in the present embodiment, the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> is exemplified as the first peripheral surface configured to carry the toner image. Alternatively, a photosensitive drum used in a typical image formation apparatus or another apparatus configured to carry toner images may also be worked as the image carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, the transfer belt <b>410</b> and the transfer roller <b>420</b> form the nip portion N for nipping a sheet S. The transfer roller <b>420</b> applies a voltage of polarity, which is opposite to that of the toner on the transfer belt <b>410</b>, to the sheet S. As a result, the full-color toner image on the transfer belt <b>410</b> is electrostatically transferred onto the sheet S. In the present embodiment, the transfer roller <b>420</b> is exemplified as the transfer element. In addition, the outer peripheral surface of the transfer roller <b>420</b> pressed to the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> is exemplified as the second peripheral surface which forms the nip portion N. Alternatively, another apparatus configured to electrostatically transfer a toner image from the image carrier to a sheet S may be used as the transfer element.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image formation unit <b>430</b> includes a substantially cylindrical photosensitive drum <b>431</b>, a charge device <b>432</b> situated below the photosensitive drum <b>431</b>, and an exposure device <b>433</b> situated below the charge device <b>432</b>. The charge device <b>432</b> uniformly charges the peripheral surface of the rotating photosensitive drum <b>431</b>. The exposure device <b>433</b> performs scanning laser light in response to image signals outputted from external equipment such as a computer and alike. As a result, charges on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> caused by the charge device <b>432</b> partially disappear, which results in an electrostatic latent image.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The image formation unit <b>430</b> has a development device <b>434</b> configured to supply toner to the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b>. The toner supply from the development device <b>434</b> to the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> on which there is an electrostatic latent image makes a toner image corresponding to the electrostatic latent image appear on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b>. Thereafter, as described above, the toner image is transferred onto the transfer belt <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The image formation section <b>400</b> includes a drive roller <b>411</b> and an idler <b>412</b>. The transfer belt <b>410</b> situated on the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> is tensioned between the drive roller <b>411</b> and the idler <b>412</b>. The image formation section <b>400</b> includes transfer rollers <b>413</b>, which are situated on the photosensitive drums <b>431</b> of the first to fourth image formation units <b>430</b>M, <b>430</b>C, <b>430</b>Y, <b>430</b>Bk, respectively. The transfer belt <b>410</b> is pushed by each transfer rollers <b>413</b> against the peripheral surface of each photosensitive drum <b>431</b> on which there is a toner image. The drive roller <b>411</b> rotates the transfer belt <b>410</b> at a speed substantially equal to that of the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b>. Thus, the toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> is appropriately transferred onto the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The image formation section <b>400</b> includes a tension roller <b>414</b> abutting on the inner peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b>. The upwardly biased tension roller <b>414</b> appropriately maintains tension of the transfer belt <b>410</b> to stabilize tracking of the transfer belt <b>410</b>. Thus, transfer of a toner image from the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> to the transfer belt <b>410</b> (a primary transfer) and transfer of a toner image from the transfer belt <b>410</b> to a sheet S (a secondary transfer) are appropriately performed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The image formation unit <b>430</b> includes a first cleaning device <b>435</b>. The first cleaning device <b>435</b> removes toner remaining on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> after the primary transfer. The peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b> cleaned by the first cleaning device <b>435</b> is recharged by the charge device <b>432</b>. Thereafter, a new toner image is formed on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The image formation section <b>400</b> includes a second cleaning device <b>415</b>. The second cleaning device <b>415</b> removes toner remaining on the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> after the secondary transfer. New toner images are transferred to the peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> cleaned by the second cleaning device <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After a toner image is transferred onto a sheet S at the nip portion N, the sheet S moves toward the fixing section <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fixing section <b>500</b> configured to fix a toner image on a sheet S includes a fixing belt <b>510</b>, a heating roller <b>520</b> configured to heat the fixing belt <b>510</b>, a pressure roller <b>530</b> configured to apply pressure to the sheet S, and a fixing roller <b>540</b> configured to press the fixing belt <b>510</b> to the pressure roller <b>530</b>. The heating roller <b>520</b> may have, for example, an electric heat generator therein. Thermal energy from the electric heat generator is transmitted to the fixing belt <b>510</b> via the heating roller <b>520</b>. The fixing belt <b>510</b> tensioned between the heating and fixing rollers <b>520</b>, <b>540</b> holds the sheet S, which carries a full-color toner image, between the fixing belt <b>510</b> and the pressure roller <b>530</b>. The fixing roller <b>540</b> pushes the heated fixing belt <b>510</b> against the sheet S, and melts toner on the sheet S. As a result, the toner image is fixed on the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The discharge section <b>600</b> includes a discharge path <b>610</b> extending from the fixing section <b>500</b> to the outside of the housing <b>200</b>. A sheet S passed the fixing section <b>500</b> is discharged to the outside of the housing <b>200</b> through the discharge path <b>610</b>. The sheet S discharged by the discharge section <b>600</b> is stacked on the upper surface of the housing <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transfer roller <b>420</b> is pushed against the peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b>, which is curved in an arc shape along the peripheral surface of the drive roller <b>411</b> to form the nip portion N. The resist roller pair <b>326</b> is situated below the nip portion N. The delivery mechanism <b>300</b> includes a guide structure <b>700</b> configured to guide sheets S in a section from the resist roller pair <b>326</b> to the nip portion N. In the present embodiment, the guide structure <b>700</b> is exemplified as the guide element configured to guide a sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The guide structure <b>700</b> includes a first guide plate <b>710</b> which is curved in a substantially arc shape, and a second guide plate <b>720</b> which is disposed in a more interior side of the housing <b>200</b> than the first guide plate <b>710</b>. The aforementioned feed path <b>324</b> is partially formed between the first and second guide plates <b>710</b>, <b>720</b>. The first guide plate <b>710</b> with a tip portion <b>711</b> closer to the nip portion N than a tip portion <b>721</b> of the second guide plate <b>720</b> guides the sheet S toward the nip portion N. In the present embodiment, the first guide plate <b>710</b> is exemplified as the main guide.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first guide plate <b>710</b> is formed of, for example, a conductive metal plate. The second guide plate <b>720</b> may be formed of, for example, resin integrated with the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The guide structure <b>700</b> includes an auxiliary structure <b>730</b> attached to the tip portion <b>711</b> of the first guide plate <b>710</b>. The auxiliary structure <b>730</b> helps the first guide plate <b>710</b> to guide a sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing the auxiliary structure <b>730</b>. The auxiliary structure <b>730</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The auxiliary structure <b>730</b> includes an auxiliary plate <b>731</b>, and a spacer <b>732</b> situated between the auxiliary plate <b>731</b> and the first guide plate <b>710</b>. The auxiliary plate <b>731</b> is formed by, for example, bending a conductive metal plate. The spacer <b>732</b> may be formed from a conductive metal block. In the present embodiment, the auxiliary structure <b>730</b> is exemplified as the sub-guide.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The auxiliary plate <b>731</b> includes a proximal end piece <b>733</b> attached to the first guide plate <b>710</b> via the spacer <b>732</b>, and a tip piece <b>734</b> which is bent from the proximal end piece <b>733</b> and protruded toward the nip portion N. The tip piece <b>734</b> has a double-plate structure, which is obtained by the bending process. As a result, a tip edge <b>735</b> of the tip piece <b>734</b> which comes in contact with a sheet S moving toward the nip portion N has an arc-like contour. Therefore it is less likely that the sheet S is damaged. In the present embodiment, the auxiliary plate <b>731</b> is exemplified as the conductive portion.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As described above, the conductive auxiliary plate <b>731</b> conducts electricity to the conductive first guide plate <b>710</b> via the conductive spacer <b>732</b>. Therefore it becomes likely that electrostatic charge of the auxiliary plate <b>731</b> resulting from friction between the sheet S and the tip edge <b>735</b> suitably disappears.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The guide structure <b>700</b> includes a resistance element <b>740</b> such as a varistor or a high resistance metal glaze resistor. The resistance element <b>740</b> is situated at a midpoint in a grounding electric wire <b>741</b>, which extends from the first guide plate <b>710</b>. The resistance value of the resistance element <b>740</b> is set to a level sufficient enough to suppress a current flowing from the transfer roller <b>420</b>, which electrostatically performs toner image transfer, toward the first guide plate <b>710</b>. Accordingly, even if the auxiliary plate <b>731</b> is situated nearby the transfer roller <b>420</b>, it is less likely that current unnecessarily flows to the guide structure <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first guide plate <b>710</b> includes a delivery surface <b>712</b> which defines a delivery direction of the sheet S moving toward the nip portion N.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, the auxiliary plate <b>731</b> of the auxiliary structure <b>730</b> includes the tip edge <b>735</b> facing the nip portion N.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is preferable to determine a protrusion amount of the auxiliary plate <b>731</b> from the first guide plate <b>710</b> such that a distance D<b>1</b> between the tip edge <b>735</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> becomes shorter than a distance D<b>2</b> between the first guide plate <b>710</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b>. Thus, the tip edge <b>735</b> is disposed at a position sufficiently close to the transfer belt <b>410</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the nip portion N is defined between a contact start point ST where contact between the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the transfer roller <b>420</b> starts and a contact end point EN where the contact between the outer peripheral surface of the transfer belt <b>410</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the transfer roller <b>420</b> ends.

The delivery surface <b>712</b> is closer to the transfer belt <b>410</b> than the nip tangent line TL, so that the delivery line DL is appropriately directed toward the nip portion N.
