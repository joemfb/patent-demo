<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/610,954, filed Dec. 14, 2006, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Optical networks include various optical switches or nodes coupled through a network of optical fiber links. Optical network failures or faults may be caused by any number of events or reasons, including damaged or severed optical fibers, or equipment failure. Because optical fibers may be installed virtually anywhere, including underground, above ground or underwater, they are subject to damage through a variety of ways and phenomena. Optical fibers and optical equipment may be damaged or severed, for example, by lightning, fire, natural disasters, traffic accidents, digging, construction accidents, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Because optical fibers carry far greater amounts of information than copper wires used to transmit electrical telecommunications signals, the loss of an optical fiber can cause far more user disruptions when compared with the loss of a copper wire. For example, the loss of a single optical link, such as an optical link carrying a Wavelength Division Multiplexed (&#x201c;WDM&#x201d;) signal, may result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of phone calls and computer data transmissions. Additionally, dozens of fibers may be routed within a single cable or conduit, substantially increasing the risk of loss associated with a damaged cable or conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To reduce the negative effects of optical network failures, optical network topologies are provided in arrangements and configurations, such as mesh or ring topologies, so that telecommunications traffic may traverse the optical network using multiple optical links. This allows such optical networks to be reconfigured to route around network failure point. An optical network may include both working links or paths and spare links or paths that may be used to assist with optical network restoration. Due to the large amount of data or bandwidth an optical network carries, the amount of time it takes to identify the location of an optical network failure, and the time it takes then to reconfigure the optical network, may result in significant amounts of telecommunications traffic being lost. In particular, the reconfiguration of an optical network may result in the loss of other telecommunications traffic if not done efficiently or optimally.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known restoration techniques and methodologies are generally designed to restore telecommunications networks operating in the electrical domain as opposed to the optical domain, which presents additional challenges. Unfortunately, switching and restoration in the electrical domain, while fast, results in a significant waste of fiber resources, in that entire optical links are removed from service, even when only a small portion of the fiber is in need of maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another technique involves the use of a central control and database to model the network, monitor network operations, and communicate instructions to each node or optical switch in the network in response to a failure. Unfortunately, as fiber counts and network bandwidth requirements increase, the ability to efficiently switch signals in the optical domain is significantly reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following detailed description of implementations consistent with the present invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Systems and methods consistent with aspects described herein provide a hybrid optical switch for enabling rapid switchover from a working fiber to a backup fiber in the event of required downtime or other maintenance. In one implementation, for example, a combination of a slower, large scale switch and a faster, small scale switch may be used to affect the switchover.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Exemplary Architecture</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary communications system <b>100</b> in which systems and methods consistent with the exemplary embodiments described herein may be implemented. Communications system <b>100</b> may include multiple sites <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, and <b>102</b><i>e </i>connected together by links <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Links <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be implemented using electrical cables, satellites, radio or microwave signals, or optical connections and can stretch for tens or hundreds of miles between sites. Through these links, the communications system <b>100</b> carries data signals among the sites <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>e </i>to effectively interconnect data equipment <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> (e.g., computers, remote terminals, servers, etc.) In the case of fiber optic links, each link may be configured to provide a number of high speed (e.g., 10 Gbps) connections using known WDM techniques. One or more links <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> that connect two sites are collectively referred to as a span <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A span <b>118</b> often includes multiple parallel links to increase working and spare capacity. As discussed above, to protect against data loss from fiber link or other equipment failures, redundant spare links may be commonly added between sites with the intent that they usually carry no data traffic but are available as alternate routes in the event of partial network failure affecting working links. If the network detects a link failure such as a fiber failure, cable cut, or transmitter/receiver nodal failure, traffic may be automatically switched from the failed link to an available spare link.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram conceptually illustrating a high data rate optical span <b>200</b> for a fiber optic cable including four working fibers <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>d</i>. Span <b>200</b> may include a number of transmitting line terminal ends (LTEs) <b>204</b><i>a</i>-<b>204</b><i>d</i>, a number of optical amplifiers <b>206</b><i>a</i>-<b>206</b><i>h</i>, an upstream switch, a downstream switch <b>210</b>, a number of receiving LTEs <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<b>212</b><i>d</i>, and a backup fiber <b>214</b>. In accordance with embodiments described below, fiber lengths between optical amplifiers <b>206</b> may be referred to as nodes. By incorporating upstream and downstream switches <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> for each node, traffic may be switched in the optical domain from a working fiber requiring maintenance (e.g., one of fibers <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>d</i>) to backup fiber <b>214</b>. Although only three working fibers <b>2021</b>-<b>202</b><i>c </i>and one backup fiber <b>202</b><i>d </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it should be understand that any suitable number of fibers may be switched in accordance with embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One exemplary implementation of a high data rate optical span is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a given site A is connected to another site B by a span (Span A-B) consisting of two optical fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>. Additionally, each span may include upstream and downstream digital cross connected switches (DCSs) <b>312</b> and <b>313</b>, transmitting LTEs <b>314</b> and <b>315</b>, optical amplifiers <b>316</b>, <b>317</b>, <b>318</b>, and <b>319</b>, an upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b>, a backup fiber <b>322</b>, a downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b>, receiving LTEs <b>326</b> and <b>327</b>, and controller <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Two electrical data signals are presented at site A via inputs <b>328</b> and <b>330</b>. In normal operation, these signals may be carried through the network span and recovered at Site B as electrical signal outputs <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> respectively. For example, these data signals may be STM-64 synchronous data signals each bearing digital data at about 10 Gbps or the equivalent of 128,000 telephone-quality voice channels. As mentioned briefly above, each fiber <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> may be configured to carry multiple signals using different wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">At site A, the signal presented at input <b>328</b> enters DCS <b>312</b>, and under normal conditions appears as an electrical signal along connection <b>329</b>. The signal at connection <b>329</b> enters LTE <b>314</b>, shown to include an optical transmitter <b>340</b>, such as a semiconductor laser. Light emitted by transmitter <b>340</b> may be wavelength division multiplexed by the electrical data signal that enters along connection <b>329</b> to deliver a modulated optical output signal over optical fiber <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown, fiber length <b>302</b> may include several optical amplifiers <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> for facilitating long haul lengths of optical fibers. Prior to the introduction of WDM, prior optical networks required a separate electrical regenerator every 60 to 100 kilometers. Traffic on each fiber would be converted from the optical to electrical domain and then regenerated for the next span. Conversely, optical amplifiers <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> may reamplify all of the channels on a WDM fiber in the optical domain without the need to de-multiplex, convert to the electrical domain, and individually process the included signals. In one implementation, optical amplifiers <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> may be spaced approximately every 1000 kilometers or so. Although only a pair of optical amplifiers is disclosed for each fiber <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> (i.e., optical amplifiers <b>316</b>, <b>317</b>, <b>318</b>, and <b>319</b>), it should be noted that any number of optical amplifiers may be supported to facilitate transmission of optical signals from site A to site B. In accordance with exemplary embodiments described herein, each optical amplifier may be connected to upstream and downstream hybrid switches to facilitate switchover from a working fiber to a backup fiber in the event of outage or maintenance needs.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In normal operation, each optical signal would proceed through upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b>, along fiber <b>302</b>, through downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b> to receiving LTE <b>326</b> located at site B. Receiving LTE <b>326</b> may include receiver <b>342</b> for receiving the optical signals from fiber <b>302</b> and outputting electrical versions thereof In one implementation, receiver <b>342</b> may include a photodiode. In the illustrated implementation, receiver <b>342</b> is shown to be a part of receiving LTE <b>326</b> that amplifies and conditions the signal to render a faithful electrical reproduction at output <b>344</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although only described above with respect to fiber <b>302</b>, traffic along fiber <b>304</b> may be similarly processed, with an electrical data signal presented at input <b>330</b> being transported from DCS <b>312</b> through connection <b>331</b>, through transmitting LTE <b>315</b> via transmitter <b>341</b>, through optical amplifier <b>317</b>, upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b>, fiber <b>304</b>, downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b>, optical amplifier <b>319</b>, receiving LTE <b>327</b> via receiver <b>343</b> to output port <b>345</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Under normal operation, upstream and downstream hybrid switches <b>320</b> and <b>324</b> simply connect upstream sections of fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> to downstream sections of fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> to complete the end-to-end connection of inputs <b>328</b> and <b>330</b> to outputs <b>332</b> and <b>334</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are referred to as working fibers because they both carry data traffic when all network elements are functioning properly. In contrast, fiber <b>322</b> may be referred to as a spare or backup fiber because it carries data traffic only in the event of failure of one of the working fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> or of the associated LTEs <b>314</b>, <b>315</b>, <b>326</b>, and <b>327</b>. Under normal circumstances, backup fiber <b>322</b> does not carry an optical data signal. It should be understood that while only two working fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this number is merely exemplary and provided for the purposes of brevity and simplicity only. Real world fiber networks may incorporate a significantly higher number of working fibers for each backup fiber, depending on network demands. Additionally, real world fiber networks may incorporate more than one backup fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When maintenance is required for one of working fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, hybrid switches <b>320</b> and <b>324</b> switch data traffic onto backup fiber <b>322</b>. For example, if fiber <b>302</b> requires maintenance, upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b> may connect the output from optical amplifier <b>316</b> to backup fiber <b>322</b>. At the same time, downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b> may connect backup fiber <b>322</b> to the input of optical amplifier <b>318</b>. This switching action restores end-to-end connectivity between input <b>328</b> and output <b>332</b> during a maintenance period for working fiber <b>302</b>. Details regarding the configuration of upstream and downstream hybrid switches <b>320</b> and <b>324</b> are set forth in additional detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">By providing high speed switching between optical amplifiers in the optical domain, rapid switchover to backup fiber <b>322</b> may be realized in the event that a working fiber <b>302</b> or <b>304</b> needs to be taken out of service.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To successfully perform backup fiber switching, controller <b>350</b> may be configured to direct upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b> and downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b> to switch an output of optical amplifier <b>316</b> or <b>317</b> to backup fiber <b>322</b>. As will be described in additional detail below, a final switchover of downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b> may be accomplished without controller direction, such that losses resulting from data &#x201c;trapped&#x201d; in fiber <b>302</b> or <b>304</b> at the time of switchover may be minimized. More specifically, the final switchover of downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b> may be performed in direct response to the switchover of upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b> by using light detection techniques as described below. Controller <b>350</b> may include an imbedded microprocessor, computer, workstation, or other type of processor for controlling the switching of upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>c </i>are a block diagram illustrating a node of fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> positioned between optical amplifiers <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> and <b>317</b> and <b>319</b>, respectively, in various stages of switchover. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b> may include two small scale switching components <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b </i>associated with working fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, respectively. Upstream hybrid switch <b>320</b> may also include a large scale switching component <b>410</b> positioned downstream of small scale switching components <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, downstream hybrid switch <b>324</b> may include a large scale switching component <b>415</b> and small scale switching components <b>420</b><i>a </i>and <b>420</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one implementation, small scale switching components <b>405</b><i>a </i>may include a fast switch configured to switch an output from optical amplifier <b>316</b> between one of two inputs to large scale switching component <b>410</b>. In one exemplary implementation, small scale switching components <b>405</b><i>a</i>-<b>405</b><i>b </i>and <b>420</b><i>a</i>-<b>420</b><i>b </i>may include a 2&#xd7;2 optical switch capable of switching outputs in approximately 20 microseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Large scale switching component <b>410</b> may include an N&#xd7;N switch capable of switching a large number of input signals between a large number of output ports, where N may be a number between 10 and 1000. In one exemplary embodiment, large scale switching components <b>410</b> and <b>415</b> may include 320&#xd7;320 optical switches capable of switching inputs in approximately 20 milliseconds. As shown, large scale switching component <b>410</b> may output to working fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> or backup fiber <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">By nature, large scale switching component <b>410</b> accomplishes its switching functions significantly more slowly than small scale switching components <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b</i>. Because of this factor, using a large scale switching component alone to effect a switchover between one of working fibers <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> and backup fiber <b>322</b> would result in unacceptable loss of data. At the same time, performing backup using only small scale switches would result in the deployment and construction of hundreds or thousands of backup fibers in the optical network, since each working fiber would need to be associated with a backup fiber on a 1 to 1 or perhaps 2 to 1 basis. Neither of these alternatives is tenable to a successful optical network configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Unlike either of these approaches, the described hybrid switching pair <b>320</b> and <b>324</b> enable fast switchover to backup fibers without requiring deployment of large number of backup fibers. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, upon receipt of a command from controller <b>350</b> (not shown) to switch over working fiber <b>302</b> to backup fiber <b>322</b>, large scale switching component <b>410</b> may set up an optical cross connect <b>425</b> between a second output from small scale switching component <b>405</b><i>a </i>associated with fiber <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Following configuration of large scale switching component <b>410</b>, backup fiber <b>322</b> may be configured to receive an output from small scale switching device <b>405</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, downstream large scale switching component <b>415</b> may be configured to set up an optical cross connect <b>430</b> between backup fiber <b>322</b> and a second output associated with small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a</i>. In one exemplary implementation, successful configuration of cross connects <b>425</b> and <b>430</b> may be monitored by testing devices <b>435</b> to ensure that signals will be properly routed following switchover.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">During the configuration of cross connects <b>425</b> and <b>430</b> within upstream and downstream large scale switching components <b>410</b> and <b>415</b>, respectively, working fiber <b>302</b> may continue to transmit data via previously established cross connect <b>440</b> in small scale switching component <b>405</b><i>a </i>and cross connect <b>445</b> in small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>as well as cross connect <b>450</b> in large scale switching component <b>410</b> and cross connect <b>455</b> in large scale switching component <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once configuration of cross connects <b>425</b> and <b>430</b> have been established, switchover from working fiber <b>302</b> to backup fiber <b>322</b> may be performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>, switchover between fiber <b>302</b> and backup fiber <b>322</b> may be effected by switching small scale switching component <b>405</b><i>a </i>between a first output associated with working fiber <b>302</b> and a second output associated with cross connect <b>425</b>. Because cross connect <b>425</b> has been previously established, switching of small scale switching component <b>405</b> enables the output from optical amplifier <b>316</b> to reach backup fiber <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the downstream side, small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>b </i>may be triggered in a variety of manners. In one implementation, controller <b>350</b> (not shown) may trigger the switching of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>b</i>. However, because light &#x201c;data&#x201d; present in fiber <b>302</b> at the time small scale switching component <b>405</b><i>a </i>is triggered should be received by optical amplifier <b>318</b> prior to switchover of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>b</i>, controller <b>350</b> may need to account for a transmission delay related to the length of fiber node between optical amplifiers <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> as well as other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another implementation, traveling wave synchronization may be used to trigger small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>is a block diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of a traveling wave trigger <b>500</b> for triggering switchover of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>from a first input to a second input. As shown, trigger <b>500</b> may include a switch control <b>505</b>, an optical tap <b>510</b> and a photo detector <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In operation, optical tap <b>510</b> may be configured to connect the output of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>to photo detector <b>515</b> via optical tap <b>510</b>. Once small scale switching component <b>405</b><i>a </i>has affected a switchover at the upstream end of fiber <b>302</b>, light transmitted in fiber <b>302</b> will cease. Photo detector <b>515</b> may monitor the output of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>to determine when this has occurred. In one implementation, photo detector <b>515</b> may include a photodiode. Once photo detector <b>515</b> observes a loss of light, a signal indicative thereof may be sent to switch control <b>505</b>. Switch control <b>505</b> may then, in turn, effect the switchover of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>from the first input associated with working fiber <b>302</b> to a second input associated with backup fiber <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In yet another implementation, a reverse principle of traveling wave synchronization may be used to trigger small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>is a block diagram illustrating another exemplary embodiment of a traveling wave trigger <b>520</b> for triggering switchover of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>from a first input to a second input. As shown, trigger <b>520</b> may include a switch control <b>525</b>, an optical tap <b>530</b> and a photo detector <b>535</b>. However, instead of positioning tap downstream of small stream switching component <b>420</b><i>a</i>, tap <b>530</b> may be positioned downstream of large scale switching component <b>415</b> and upstream of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once small scale switching component <b>405</b><i>a </i>has affected a switchover at the upstream end of fiber <b>302</b> onto backup fiber <b>322</b>, light transmitted in fiber <b>322</b> will begin.

Once photo detector <b>535</b> observes the presence of light at this output, a signal indicative thereof may be sent to switch control <b>525</b>. Switch control <b>525</b> may then, in turn, effect the switchover of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>from the first input associated with working fiber <b>302</b> to a second input associated with backup fiber <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By using the absence of light in working fiber <b>302</b> or the presence of light in backup fiber <b>322</b>, triggers <b>505</b> and <b>520</b> may perform switching of small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>with minimal delay and zero loss in data previously transmitted on working fiber <b>302</b>. More specifically, along with the eliminated loss of previously transmitted data, switchover from working fiber <b>302</b> to backup fiber <b>322</b> may be accomplished in an amount of time consistent with the switching times of small scale switching components <b>405</b><i>a </i>(T1)+small scale switching component <b>420</b><i>a </i>(T2)+processing of switch control <b>505</b> or <b>525</b> (Tp).</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Implementations consistent with aspects described herein enable rapid and efficient switchover from a working fiber to a backup fiber.
