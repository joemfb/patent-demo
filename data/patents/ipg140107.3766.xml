<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A drive method for an electrophoretic display device that has an electrophoretic device composed of a suspension fluid containing electrophoretic particles disposed between a common electrode and a plurality of pixel electrodes, a driver that drives the electrophoretic device by applying voltage between the common electrode and the plural pixel electrodes, and a controller that controls the driver. The control method has a display redrawing process that changes the displayed image by applying a common electrode drive pulse that repeats two different potentials to the common electrode, and applying either of the two different potentials to the pixel electrodes according to the updated display content. The display redrawing process includes a first pulse application step that applies a first pulse train to the common electrode as the common electrode drive pulse train, and a second pulse application step that executes after the first pulse application step to apply a second pulse train to the common electrode as the common electrode drive pulse train, the pulses of the second pulse train being wider than the pulses of the first pulse train.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Japanese Patent application No.(s) 2007-286313, and 2008-160463, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a drive method for an electrophoretic display device and to an electrophoretic display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electrophoresis, a technique in which Coulomb's force is used to cause electrophoretic particles to migrate by applying an electric field to a suspension fluid having electrophoretic particles dispersed in a fluid, and electrophoretic display devices that operate by means of electrophoresis, are known from the literature. There is, however, still room for improvement with respect to electrophoretic display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A common drive method used in liquid crystal displays and other types of display devices is to vary the potential of the pixel electrode while also changing the potential of the common electrode (a method also referred to herein as &#x201c;variable common electrode drive&#x201d;). Japanese Unexamined Patent Appl. Pub. JP-A-S52-70791 is directed a variable common electrode drive method for an electrophoretic display device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This drive method controls the potential of the pixel electrode and the common electrode to either of two values, that is, either a high potential or a low potential. This enables lowering the voltage of the drive potential, simplifying the circuit design, and low cost manufacture. When thin film transistors (TFT) are used in the drive circuit, lowering the drive potential as described above can also improve TFT reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Problems with this variable common electrode drive method that remain to be solved are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If a pulse signal with a 200 ms pulse width is applied to the common electrode to change the common electrode potential, flicker results and the flicker can induce user stress. More specifically, when the display is driven by varying the common electrode potential, color changes are sharp when drive starts and flicker occurs easily.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This flicker can be prevented by inputting a pulse signal with a short pulse width such as 20 ms for variable common electrode drive. However, because the pulse width for which voltage is applied is short, the particles cannot be moved enough to saturate the display, and only relatively low reflectance can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Sufficient reflectance also cannot be achieved with a single write operation because pulse signals with a short pulse width are used. The reflectance of pixels that are redrawn from white to white and the reflectance of pixels that are redrawn from black to white therefore differs in an electrophoretic display device that uses white and black electrophoretic particles, resulting in an uneven display, ghosts, and other problems.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The drive method for an electrophoretic display device and the electrophoretic display device according to the present invention suppress flicker and achieve sufficient reflectance (contrast) with a single write operation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A first aspect of the invention is a drive method for an electrophoretic display device that has an electrophoretic device composed of a suspension fluid containing electrophoretic particles disposed between a common electrode and a plurality of pixel electrodes. The method includes driving the electrophoretic device, using a driver for example, by applying voltage between the common electrode and the plural pixel electrodes, and redrawing the display to change the displayed image by applying a common electrode drive pulse that repeats two different potentials to the common electrode, and applying either of the two different potentials to the pixel electrodes according to the updated display content. The display redrawing process includes a first pulse application step that applies a first pulse train to the common electrode as the common electrode drive pulse, and a second pulse application step, executed after the first pulse application step, that applies a second pulse train to the common electrode as the common electrode drive pulse. Each pulse of the second pulse train has a longer width than that of each pulse of the first pulse train.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The actual pulse widths of the first pulses and the second pulses are set according to the characteristics of the electrophoretic display device that is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">More specifically, the pulse width of the first pulses is set to the longest pulse width that will not produce flicker when the first pulse train is applied in the first half of the display redrawing process to the electrophoretic display device that is driven. If a pulse with a relatively long pulse width is applied in the first half of the display redrawing process, flicker results because of the sudden color change at the beginning of the drive period in a variable common electrode drive method. Flicker can be prevented by applying pulses with a short pulse width, but writing the display then becomes time consuming. The first pulses applied in the first half of the display redrawing process therefore preferably has a pulse width that is as long as possible without producing flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The pulse width of the second pulses is set in a range that increases contrast in the displayed image while also preventing a drop in image retention when the second pulse train is applied in the second half of the display redrawing process to the electrophoretic display device that is driven. More specifically, applying a train of longer-width pulses in the second half of the display redrawing process reaches a saturation state that is resistant to flicker because the change in color is subtle. In addition, because contrast increases when the pulse width of the second pulse increases, the lower limit for the pulse width of the second pulses may be set so that the contrast ratio goes to a predetermined level or above. Furthermore, because tests demonstrated that retention of the written image drops if the second pulse width is too long, the upper limit for the pulse width of the second pulse is preferably set so that image retention does not drop.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, the pulse widths of the first pulses and the second pulses are set according to the characteristics of the electrophoretic display device to be driven. For example, the pulse width of the first pulses is preferably less than 25 ms, and the pulse width of the second pulses is preferably greater than or equal to 25 ms. For example, the pulse width of the first pulses may be 20 ms and the pulse width of the second pulses may be 100-200 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Pulse width as used herein means the pulse length of the high level (=V<b>1</b>) portion of a pulse signal that alternates between two different potential levels, such as a pulse signal that alternates between a high level of potential V<b>1</b> and a low level of a different potential V<b>2</b>. Note that because the pulse width of the high level (V<b>1</b>) and the pulse width of the low level (V<b>2</b>) are the same, the pulse width may also be the pulse length of the low level (=V<b>2</b>) portion of the pulse signal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, by executing the first pulse application step first in the display redrawing process and then executing the second pulse application step, the pulse width of the pulse signal applied to the common electrode can be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Because the pulse width of the first pulses is shorter than the pulse width of the second pulses, movement of the electrophoretic particles is less but flicker that is discernible to the user can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While flicker that is discernible to the user is possible when the second pulse train is applied because the width of the second pulses is longer than the width of the first pulses, the electrophoretic particles can be caused to move a greater distance and the electrophoretic particles can be moved to achieve sufficient saturation, that is, until sufficient reflectance is achieved to suitably display black or white.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Therefore, the first pulse train is applied during the period in which flicker may be conspicuous if the second pulse is applied, such as the time from when the display begins to change from black to white until a sufficiently white display is achieved (the first half of the display redrawing process) when changing the display from black to white, and the second pulse train can then be applied during the period in which flicker will not appear even if the second pulse is applied, such as after a sufficiently white display is achieved (the second half of the display redrawing process) when changing the display from black to white.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Flicker can therefore be suppressed and sufficient reflectance (contrast) can be achieved with a single write.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the display redrawing process executes the first pulse application step until the reflectance of the changed image reaches a threshold value set to at least 80% or more of the targeted maximum reflectance, and executes the second pulse application step after the threshold value is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The targeted maximum reflectance as used herein means the reflectance that is set as the desired display reflectance with consideration for current consumption, display response, and other characteristics when designing the electrophoretic display device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, the maximum reflectance when displaying black may be set to 4%, 6%, or other reflectance level. When black is displayed the contrast to white increases as the reflectance decreases and display quality thus improves, but an increase in the movement of the black particles increases power consumption and reduces the display response. Therefore, the maximum reflectance when displaying black may be set to balance display quality with power consumption and display response, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The maximum reflectance when displaying white may likewise be set to 47%, 45%, or other reflectance level. When white is displayed the contrast to black increases as the reflectance increases and display quality thus improves, but an increase in the movement of the white particles increases power consumption and reduces the display response. Therefore, the maximum reflectance when displaying white may be set to balance display quality with power consumption and display response, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">If, for example, the targeted maximum reflectance when displaying white is set to 47%, the image is changed from black to white, and the threshold value is set to 90% of the maximum reflectance, the first pulse application step is executed until the reflectance reaches the threshold value of 47%&#xd7;0.9=42.3%, and the second pulse application step is executed when the threshold value of 42.3% is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If the targeted maximum reflectance when displaying black is set to 4%, the image is changed from white to black, and the threshold value is set to 90% of the maximum reflectance, the first pulse application step is executed until the reflectance reaches the threshold value of 13.6%, and the second pulse application step is executed when the threshold value of 13.6% is reached. The threshold value for black can be obtained by substituting &#x2212;100% for 0% reflectance. For example, if reflectance is 4%, 4&#x2212;100=&#x2212;96%, &#x2212;96%&#xd7;0.9=&#x2212;86.4%, and the threshold value=100&#x2212;86.4=13.6%.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">This aspect of the invention can prevent flicker because the display is driven by applying the first pulse until the reflectance reaches the threshold value, which is a known percentage of the targeted maximum reflectance. More specifically, flicker occurs easily in the first half of the drive period drawing the display to a different color because the color change is abrupt. The invention, however, applies the first pulse train with a short pulse width in the first half of the drive period until the reflectance reaches the threshold value, and can therefore prevent flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the reflectance exceeds the threshold value, however, the invention applies the second pulse to drive the display, and can therefore desirably increase reflectance and improve display quality. More specifically, particle movement reaches a saturation state in the second half of the drive period writing to a different color, the change in color becomes subtle, and flicker does not occur easily. The invention can therefore suppress flicker and improve display quality as a result of applying a second pulse with a long pulse width in the second part of the drive period after the reflectance reaches the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The threshold value is usually set in the range of 80% to 90%. If the threshold value is less than 80%, flicker may be apparent when the second pulse is applied because the percentage of change in the reflectance is great. If the threshold value is greater than 90%, the length of the first pulse drive period increases and more time is required to reach the targeted maximum reflectance. The threshold value is therefore preferably set in the range 80-90% depending on the characteristics of the electrophoretic display device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Depending on the electrophoretic display device, however, the required characteristics can be achieved even if the threshold value is set to less than 80% or more than 90% of the targeted maximum reflectance. More specifically, the threshold value may be set according to the characteristics of the electrophoretic display device in which the invention is used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further preferably, the pulse width of the second pulses is in the range of 2 times to 30 times the pulse width of the first pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the pulse width of the second pulses is less than twice the pulse width of the first pulses, the difference in the pulse widths of the pulses is small, there is little difference in characteristics when the pulse is switched, and effective drive control is not possible.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, if the pulse width of the second pulses is more than 30 times the pulse width of the first pulses, the difference in characteristics when the pulse is switched is too great, and effective drive control is not possible. In addition, if the pulse width of the second pulse is too long, image retention may drop when driving stops.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, by setting the pulse width of the second pulses in the range of 2 to 30 times the pulse width of the first pulses, the change in characteristics when the drive pulse switches is well balanced, effective drive control is possible, and a drop in display retention can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Depending on the electrophoretic display device, however, the required characteristics can be achieved even if the pulse width of the second pulses deviates somewhat from this range of 2-30 times the pulse width of the first pulses. In such cases the pulse width of the second pulse may be set outside the range of 2-30 times the pulse width of the first pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another aspect of the invention the electrophoretic device has electrophoretic particles of a first color for displaying a first color and electrophoretic particles of a second color for displaying a second color, and the sizes of the first-color electrophoretic particles and the second-color electrophoretic particles differ. The common electrode drive pulse repeatedly alternates between a first-color writing voltage that changes the displayed image to the first color and a second-color writing voltage that changes the image to the second color. The last pulses in the common electrode drive pulse train in the display redrawing process correspond to the first-color writing voltage when the electrophoretic particles of the first color are larger than the electrophoretic particles of the second color, and corresponds to the second-color writing voltage when the electrophoretic particles of the second color are larger than the electrophoretic particles of the first color.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electrophoretic display device has second color particles (such as black particles) and first color particles (such as white particles) dispersed in a suspension fluid inside microcapsules. When the sizes of the particles differ, the larger particles have more resistance to movement during migration and do not move easily. In addition, the large particles can be moved closer to the capsule wall and contrast can be improved by making the last pulse in the display redrawing process a pulse for driving the large particles.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, if the first color particles are larger than the second color particles, the final reflectance may drop if the second-color write voltage is applied last after applying the first-color write voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention prevents a drop in the final reflectance, however, by applying the first-color writing voltage last.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further preferably, the first pulse in the common electrode drive pulse stream in the display redrawing process is the first-color writing voltage when the electrophoretic particles of the first color are larger than the electrophoretic particles of the second color, and the first pulse in the common electrode drive pulse stream in the display redrawing process is the second-color writing voltage when the electrophoretic particles of the second color are larger than the electrophoretic particles of the first color.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The common electrode drive pulse starts by applying the writing voltage for moving the large particles, then alternately applies the write voltage for both particles, and ends by applying the writing voltage for moving the large particles. For example, if the first-color particles are larger than the second-color particles, driving starts by applying the voltage for writing the first color, the voltage for writing the second color and the voltage for writing the first color are then alternately applied, and driving ends by applying the voltage for writing the first color.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">This aspect of the invention thus enables applying the voltage for writing the color of the large particles more times than the voltage for writing the color of the small particles is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an electrophoretic display device particles with a large particle size move more slowly than small particles. Therefore, by increasing the number of times the voltage for writing the color of the large particles is applied, the slowly migrating large particles can also be caused to move sufficiently and display quality can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another aspect of the invention is an electrophoretic display device that has an electrophoretic device composed of a suspension fluid containing electrophoretic particles disposed between a common electrode and a plurality of pixel electrodes. A driver drives the electrophoretic device by applying voltage between the common electrode and the plural pixel electrodes; and a controller controls the driver. The controller has a display redrawing component that changes the displayed image by applying a common electrode drive pulse that repeats two different potentials to the common electrode, and applying either of the two different potentials to the pixel electrodes according to the updated display content. The display redrawing component includes a first pulse application unit that applies a first pulse train to the common electrode as the common electrode drive pulse train, and a second pulse application unit that operates after the first pulse application unit and that applies a second pulse train to the common electrode as the common electrode drive pulse train. The pulse width of the second pulses having a width that is longer than the width of the first pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This aspect of the invention can change the pulse width of the pulse signal applied to the common electrode because the display redrawing component that writes images has a first pulse application unit and a second pulse application unit.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, because the pulse width of the first pulses is shorter than the pulse width of the second pulses, movement of the electrophoretic particles is less but flicker that is discernible to the user can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While flicker that is discernible to the user is possible when the second pulse train is applied because it has longer-width pulses than does the first pulse train, the electrophoretic particles can be caused to move a greater distance and the electrophoretic particles can be moved to achieve sufficient saturation, that is, until sufficient reflectance is achieved to suitably display black or white.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, the first pulse train is applied during the period in which flicker may be conspicuous if the second pulse train is applied, such as the time from when the display begins to change from black to white until a sufficiently white display is achieved when changing the display from black to white, and the second pulse train can then be applied during the period in which flicker will not appear even if the second pulse train is applied, such as after a sufficiently white display is achieved when changing the display from black to white.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Flicker can therefore be suppressed and sufficient reflectance (contrast) can be achieved with a single write.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The drive method for an electrophoretic display device and the electrophoretic display device according to the present invention can thus suppress flicker and achieve sufficient reflectance (contrast) with a single write operation.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">More specifically, when the pixel electrode <b>34</b> goes to a low potential (L potential, denoted &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the common electrode <b>32</b> goes high (H potential), the potential difference creates a field from the common electrode <b>32</b> to the pixel electrodes <b>34</b>. This causes the positively charged white particles <b>332</b> to move to the pixel electrode <b>34</b> side and the negatively charged black particles <b>331</b> to move to the common electrode <b>32</b> side. As a result, when the potential of the pixel electrode <b>34</b> is low relative to the potential of the common electrode <b>32</b>, the display color becomes black when seen from the front glass <b>31</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the field is reversed from this black display by driving the pixel electrode <b>34</b> to a high potential (H potential, denoted &#x201c;+&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the common electrode <b>32</b> to a low potential (L potential), reversal of the field changes the color displayed on the display panel <b>30</b> to white.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Gray levels between black and white can also be displayed by changing the time voltage is applied to adjust the distance moved by the black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When applying the field stops, movement of the black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b> also stops, and the color displayed at that time remains displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">6. Driving the Display Panel</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The drive process for driving the display panel <b>30</b> is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The drive characteristics of the display panel <b>30</b> are described first. When the display is driven using the variable common electrode drive method described above, a rectangular pulse signal that alternately applies a high potential and a low potential is input to the common electrode <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the change in reflectance when a first pulse with a pulse width of 20 ms is applied and when a second pulse that is longer than the first pulse and in this example has a pulse width of 100 ms is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The reflectance was determined by measuring the display on the display panel <b>30</b> using a reflectometer. The reflectance of the display panel <b>30</b> according to this embodiment of the invention was approximately 4% when black is displayed and approximately 45-47% when white is displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the initial reflectance was approximately 4% displaying black, and the display changed to white when a drive signal was applied after <b>2</b> seconds as indicated on the x-axis in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The dotted curve <b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> denotes the change in reflectance when the second pulse was applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>. Because the pulse width of the second pulse is long, specifically 100 ms, the change in reflectance is sharp. However, because the reflectance drops when the second pulse changes from low to high and this drop in reflectance is relatively large, it appears as flicker to the viewer.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The final reflectance is approximately 47%, however, and the quality of the white display is superior to that represented by solid curve <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The solid curve <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> denotes the change in reflectance when the first pulse is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>. Because the first pulse is a short 20 ms, the change in reflectance is smoother than the change denoted by curve <b>51</b>, but the drop in reflectance when the first pulse switches from low to high is less and is not perceived as flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">However, the final reflectance is approximately 45%, and the quality of the white display is inferior to that denoted by the dotted curve <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When the pulse applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> changes from low to high, a high signal is applied to the pixel electrodes <b>34</b> displaying white, the same voltage potential is thus applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> and the pixel electrode <b>34</b>, a potential difference theoretically does not occur between the electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> therefore should not move and reflectance should not drop.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In practice, however, reflectance drops as a result of various other factors, including the effect from any adjacent pixel electrode <b>34</b> to which a low signal is applied to display black, and voltage drops resulting from leakage current in the TFT circuit layer <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The present invention determines the display characteristic achieved by the pulse width of the pulse signal applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>, and controls driving the display so that flicker is not apparent and display quality can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In other words, in the process that redraws the display, a first pulse of a short pulse width is applied and a second pulse of a longer pulse width is then applied to improve display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">How this control method can prevent flicker and improve display quality is described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows the microcapsules <b>330</b> with the black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b>. The particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> are shown the same size in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> for illustrative purposes only.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As described above, the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> are charged. As a result, energy (attraction) works between the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> and the capsule wall <b>330</b>A, and between the individual particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Because particles of different colors, that is, black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b>, are oppositely charged (positive and negative), they are held together by a strong force.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Because particles of the same color are identically charged, that is, all black particles <b>331</b> are charged the same and all white particles <b>332</b> are charged the same way, particles of the same color are held together by a weak force because of the difference in the charge between the individual particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The energy that works between the individual particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>, and between the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> and the capsule wall <b>330</b>A, is indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The thickness and length of the arrows represents the strength of the energy, and the strength of the energy at work increases as the thickness and length of the arrow increases.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">When the displayed image is redrawn, the energy (force of attraction) working between the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> must be overcome in order to cause the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> to move. More specifically, the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> must be pulled away from the other particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> or the capsule wall <b>330</b>A, caused to move to the capsule wall <b>330</b>A on the other side, and pushed against that capsule wall <b>330</b>A with sufficient force. As a result, the pulse width of the pulse applied to redraw the display (the first pulse or the second pulse) must be greater than or equal to a predetermined pulse width in order to apply sufficient energy.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">However, flicker occurs if the pulse width is too long. More specifically, because the energy working between the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> is high if the pulse width is long, the distance moved by the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> also increases. When the voltage of the applied pulse changes, a potential difference occurs even between electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> that theoretically should go to the same potential, and the distance moved in the opposite direction by the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> therefore also increases when the pulse width is long.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, if black particles <b>331</b> are gathered on the viewing side of the microcapsules <b>330</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and a pulse with a pulse width great enough to move the black particles <b>331</b> to the opposite side is applied, the migration distance of the black particles <b>331</b> increases because a high energy force is applied and the black particles <b>331</b> move far inside the suspension fluid. As a result, the black particles <b>331</b> move to a position where they cannot be discerned from the front surface side.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If the potential of the pulse applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> then changes from low to high, a potential difference theoretically does not occur between the electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> should not move. In practice, however, other factors such as the electric fields between adjacent electrodes of different voltages and a voltage drop caused by horizontal leakage current produce a potential change that causes the black particles <b>331</b> to also move in the opposite direction to a position where they cannot be discerned from the front surface side, for example. The reflectance therefore changes greatly in a short time as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and flicker results.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">If the pulse width is short, however, the migration distance of the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> decreases and the return distance also decreases. The relative change in reflectance is therefore small and flicker does not occur as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition, when the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> move enough inside the microcapsules <b>330</b> that movement cannot be discerned and a pulse with a large pulse width (second pulse) is applied, the change in reflectance is relatively small and flicker does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">For example, if the black particles <b>331</b> are moving from the viewing side of the microcapsules <b>330</b> to the back side, a pulse with a large pulse width is applied after the black particles <b>331</b> are not visible to cause the black particles <b>331</b> to move a greater distance, and the potential of the common electrode <b>32</b> then changes, the black particles <b>331</b> will return slightly in the opposite direction. The distance that the black particles <b>331</b> return is less than the distance they migrated, however, and movement of the black particles <b>331</b> therefore remains indiscernible. The change in reflectance is therefore reduced and flicker does not occur as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If the second pulse is applied in the latter half of the redrawing process, a high energy force can be applied to the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>. The particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> can therefore be caused to migrate to the opposite wall of the microcapsules <b>330</b> and pushed sufficiently to that wall, and contrast can therefore be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">However, tests demonstrated that if the pulse width of the second pulse is too long, the pigment particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> do not stop moving when driving stops, the color therefore fades, and image retention drops.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Applying pulses with a short pulse width (first pulses) in the first part of the redrawing process (from the beginning to the middle) is therefore preferable in terms of preventing flicker, while applying with a long pulse width (second pulse) in the second half (from the middle to the end) of the process is preferable in terms of improving contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Therefore, because movement of the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> is short if the pulse width is short, the pulse width of the first pulse is preferably set as long as possible within the range that does not produce flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">On the other hand, because the force of attraction holding the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> to the capsule wall <b>330</b>A weakens and contrast drops if the pulse width is short while the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> do not stop and image retention drops if the pulse width is too long, the second pulse is set to a pulse width within the range that can maintain the desired contrast while also preventing a loss of image retention.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The drive method of the electrophoretic display device <b>3</b> is described next with reference to the flow charts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As shown in the flow chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the controller <b>42</b> first controls the drive circuit <b>43</b> by means of the data transfer component <b>421</b> to execute a data transfer process for sending data to each pixel (S<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The display redrawing component <b>422</b> of the controller <b>42</b> then executes the display redrawing process (S<b>2</b>) to redraw the image presented on the display panel <b>30</b> based on the transferred data.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In the display redrawing process (S<b>2</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first pulse applying unit <b>423</b> of the controller <b>42</b> applies the first pulse to the common electrode <b>32</b> (S<b>21</b>). In this embodiment of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the first pulse applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> (COM) is a rectangular pulse signal with a pulse width (the parts of the signal that are high and low) of 20 ms. The first pulse is thus a pulse signal with a period of 40 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The first pulse applying unit <b>423</b> applies the first pulse a predetermined number of times. This number of times may be set based on the results of tests determining how many pulses are required to reach a predetermined percentage (such as 80-90%) of a maximum reflectance set as the target reflectance of the display panel <b>30</b>. To change a pixel displaying black to white, the first pulse applying unit <b>423</b> in this embodiment of the invention is set to output 100 cycles of the first pulse having a 40 ms period, or more specifically to output the first pulse for 40 ms&#xd7;100=4 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The controller <b>42</b> also outputs a low signal to the pixel electrode <b>34</b> for pixels displaying black and a high signal for pixels displaying white in the display redrawing process (S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the timing chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> pixel A displays white and a high signal is therefore output to the pixel electrode <b>34</b>. Pixel B displays black, and a low signal is therefore output to the pixel electrode <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> schematically describes the movement of the black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b> when signals of different levels are applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> and the pixel electrode <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, when a high signal is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> and the same high signal is applied to pixel A, a potential difference does not occur between the common electrode <b>32</b> and pixel electrode <b>34</b>, and the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> do not move.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">However, when a high signal is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> and a low signal is applied to pixel B, a potential difference occurs between the common electrode <b>32</b> and the pixel electrode <b>34</b>. As a result, the negatively charged black particles <b>331</b> migrate to the common electrode <b>32</b> to which the high signal was applied, and the positively charged white particles <b>332</b> migrate to the pixel electrode <b>34</b> to which the low signal was applied.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, when a low signal is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> and the same low signal is applied to pixel B, a potential difference does not occur between the common electrode <b>32</b> and pixel electrode <b>34</b>, and the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> do not move.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">However, when a low signal is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> and a high signal is applied to pixel A, a potential difference occurs between the common electrode <b>32</b> and the pixel electrode <b>34</b>. As a result, the positively charged white particles <b>332</b> migrate to the common electrode <b>32</b> to which the low signal was applied, and the negatively charged black particles <b>331</b> migrate to the pixel electrode <b>34</b> to which the high signal was applied.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In this embodiment of the invention, therefore, when the common electrode <b>32</b> is high, a low signal is applied to the pixel electrode <b>34</b> of the pixel selected to display black in order to redraw that pixel black. When the common electrode <b>32</b> is low, a high signal is applied to the pixel electrode <b>34</b> of the pixel selected to display white to redraw that pixel white.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Because the first pulse starts low, which embodiment of the invention first writes white, then alternately writes black and then white, and finally ends by writing black. The second pulse also starts low and therefore first writes white, then alternately writes black and then white, and finally ends by writing black.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">While writing white and writing black actually alternate at precise 20 ms intervals, the switching time is short and the display therefore appears to the user to change simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Because the pulse width of the first pulse applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> in the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> is a short 20 ms, the drop in reflectance when switching the signal level of the first pulse is small. This drop in reflectance occurs when the first pulse changes from low to high when redrawing the display from black to white as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, but can be made small enough to be indiscernible as flicker to the user viewing the display panel <b>30</b> by driving the first pulse with a short pulse width of 20 ms, for example. Stress-inducing flicker can therefore be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">When the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> ends, the second pulse applying unit <b>424</b> of the controller <b>42</b> applies the second pulse to the common electrode <b>32</b> (S<b>22</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The second pulse in this embodiment of the invention is a rectangular wave with a pulse width (the parts of the signal that are high and low) of 100 ms. The second pulse is thus a pulse signal with a period of 200 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The second pulse applying unit <b>424</b> applies the second pulse a predetermined number of times. This number of times may be set based on the results of tests determining how many pulses are required to reach a maximum reflectance set for the display panel <b>30</b>. To change a pixel displaying black to white, the second pulse applying unit <b>424</b> in this embodiment of the invention is set to output 2 cycles of the second pulse having a 100 ms period, or more specifically to output the second pulse for 200 ms&#xd7;2=0.4 second.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> ends, the black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b> have respectively moved to the common electrode <b>32</b> and pixel electrode <b>34</b> sides in pixels A and pixels B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, and the display as seen from the common electrode <b>32</b> or front glass <b>31</b> side appears white in pixels A and black in pixels B.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Because the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> uses the second pulses having a longer pulse width than the first pulses, the drop in reflectance is somewhat greater as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, but the display is already near the maximum reflectance and the drop in flicker is suppressed to an indiscernible level. Furthermore, because the pulse width of the second pulse is approximately five times longer than the first pulse, the time voltage is applied by one pulse is longer, movement of the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> increases and the change in reflectance can be increased accordingly. As a result, the final reflectance attained at the completion of the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> is higher than if only the first pulse is used, and the display quality can therefore also be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">When the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> ends, the controller <b>42</b> stops inputting signals to the common electrode <b>32</b> and pixel electrodes <b>34</b>, and the electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are controlled to a high impedance state (S<b>23</b>). When driving stops (S<b>23</b>), a potential difference is not produced between the common electrode <b>32</b> and pixel electrode <b>34</b>, and the image drawn by the display redrawing process S<b>2</b> (first pulse application step S<b>21</b> and second pulse application step S<b>22</b>) continues to be displayed on the display panel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The controller <b>42</b> controls refreshing the display according to the flow charts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> each time the image displayed on the display panel <b>30</b> is updated. For example, if time information such as the year, month, day, hour, and minute are displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, displaying the minute is updated every minute, and the controller <b>42</b> therefore controls updating the display every minute in the pixel area where the minute is displayed. The controller <b>42</b> also controls updating the display in the areas displaying other data units at the appropriate update intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The effect of this embodiment of the invention is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">(1) By executing the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> first in the display redrawing process S<b>2</b>, the drop in reflectance can be minimized and flicker can be prevented. In addition, by executing the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> at the end of the display redrawing process S<b>2</b>, greater reflectance can be achieved than if only the first pulse is applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>, greater contrast can be achieved in the electrophoretic display elements, and display quality can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The display panel <b>30</b> using electrophoretic display elements can therefore be redrawn smoothly with high display quality, and display characteristics can be improved without inducing stress in the user.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">(2) The total drive time of the display redrawing process S<b>2</b> is substantially the same as when the display is driven using only one type of pulse as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and an increase in power consumption can therefore be prevented. Therefore, because power consumption when holding the displayed image is zero, the method of the invention does not interfere with the characteristics of a low power consumption electrophoretic display device.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">(3) By applying both a first pulse application step S<b>21</b> and a second pulse application step S<b>22</b>, saturation drive causing the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> to move completely to one of the electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> is possible. Ghosting in which the previously displayed image reappears can therefore be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">A timepiece according to a second embodiment of the invention is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The timepiece according to this second embodiment of the invention differs from the timepiece of the first embodiment in that the number of drive pulses applied by the controller <b>42</b>, and specifically the number of second pulses input in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b>, differs from the number of pulses applied in the first embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Other aspects of this embodiment are the same as in the first embodiment, and further description thereof is omitted or simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The controller <b>42</b> controls updating the display according to the flow charts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and described in the first embodiment above.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the controller <b>42</b> (first pulse applying unit <b>423</b>) controls the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> as described in the first embodiment. A first pulse is therefore applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>, a high signal is applied to the pixels A that are to display white, and a low signal is applied to the pixels B that are to display black.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">After executing the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> for 4 seconds, the second pulse applying unit <b>424</b> of the controller <b>42</b> then executes the second pulse application step S<b>22</b>. In the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> the controller <b>42</b> applies one low second pulse with a 100 ms pulse width to the common electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The controller <b>42</b> then executes the stop driving step S<b>23</b> to stop applying signals and hold the electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> in the high impedance state.</p>

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The second embodiment of the invention has the same effect as the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">(4) In addition, because only a low level signal is applied as the second pulse in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> and writing white then stops, the second pulse does not change from low to high, and a drop in reflectance in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> can be prevented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">However, because the first embodiment applies the second pulse for two periods (applies the 100 ms low signal twice), the final reflectance achieved is higher in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">(5) In addition, because the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> starts with a low signal and thus starts by writing white, and the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> ends with a low signal and thus ends by writing white, white is written one more time than black is written.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As a result, the reflectance of the white display can be increased and display quality can be improved. More specifically, because the black particles <b>331</b> are smaller than the white particles <b>332</b> as described above, response is faster when writing black than when writing white, and the black particles <b>331</b> can move sufficiently when a short pulse is applied. Reflectance sufficient for a black display (such as 4%) can therefore be achieved even if the write count of the black display is less than the write count of the white display.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Therefore, by writing white, which has a slower response time than black, more times than black, and applying the second pulse with a long pulse width as a signal for writing white, both white and black can be displayed at the respective maximum reflectance (such as 4% for black and 48% for white), and the electrophoretic display elements of the display panel <b>30</b> can be reliably driven to saturation.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">A timepiece according to a second embodiment of the invention is described next.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The timepiece according to this third embodiment of the invention differs from the timepiece of the first and second embodiments in that the number of drive pulses applied by the controller <b>42</b>, and specifically the number of second pulses input in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b>, differs from the number of pulses applied in the first and second embodiments as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Other aspects of this embodiment are the same as in the first and second embodiments, and further description thereof is omitted or simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The controller <b>42</b> controls updating the display according to the flow charts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and described in the first embodiment above.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the controller <b>42</b> controls the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> as described in the first embodiment. A first pulse is therefore applied to the common electrode <b>32</b>, a high signal is applied to the pixels A that are to display white, and a low signal is applied to the pixels B that are to display black.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">This third embodiment differs, however, in that inputting the first pulse starts when the pulse is high, that is, writes black.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">After executing the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> for 4 seconds, the controller <b>42</b> then executes the second pulse application step S<b>22</b>. In the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> the controller <b>42</b> applies the second pulse for one cycle, that is high for 100 ms and low for 100 ms, to the common electrode <b>32</b>. The second pulse thus applies a 100 ms pulse width high signal and then a 100 ms pulse width low signal, and then stops.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The controller <b>42</b> then executes the stop driving step S<b>23</b> to stop applying signals and hold the electrodes <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> in the high impedance state.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Reflectance changes as shown by the graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> in this third embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The third embodiment of the invention has the same effect as the first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">(6) In addition, because the second pulse in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> applies a high signal and then a low signal and then writing white stops, the final reflectance achieved at the end of the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> can be improved as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> when control stops, and the drop in reflectance can be suppressed accordingly. More specifically, when switching from the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> to the second pulse application step S<b>22</b>, the pulse signal applied to the common electrode <b>32</b> changes from low to high, but the drop in reflectance when switching to a high signal in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> is small because the pulse width of the first pulse is short. Furthermore, because there is no change from a long pulse width low signal to a high signal in the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> as there is in the first embodiment, a drop in reflectance at the end of the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> such as occurs in the first embodiment can be prevented. The reflectance of the white display can therefore be increased and the display quality can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Other Embodiments of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Preferred embodiments of the invention are described above but the invention is not so limited and can be modified and improved in various ways without departing from the scope of the accompanying claims.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The embodiments described above always execute the display redrawing process S<b>2</b> including the first pulse application step S<b>21</b> and the second pulse application step S<b>22</b> when updating the image display. Alternatively, however, flicker-suppressing drive control can be applied using the display redrawing process S<b>2</b> of the invention, or drive control that uses only pulses with a long pulse width and does not address flicker, can be selected according to the display content.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">For example, the flicker-suppressing drive control method of the invention may be usually applied while drive control without flicker suppression can be applied when it is desirable to use flicker as a desirable display effect to highlight the change in displayed content. Drive control without suppressing flicker can conversely enhance the visual display when highlighting the change in displayed content by producing flicker is desirable, such as to announce the time when an alarm sounds or when displaying a warning, or to emphasize the appearance of falling snow or leaves.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The pulse width of the first pulse and the pulse width of the second pulse are also not limited to the values used in the foregoing embodiments. The pulse widths may be set appropriately according to the characteristics of the electrophoretic display elements to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">More specifically, the first pulse may be set to a pulse width that is short enough so that the viewer cannot discern any flicker when the first pulse is applied at the beginning of the display redrawing process. In order to increase movement of the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b>, the pulse width is also preferably as long as possible within the range that will not cause flicker.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The pulse width of the second pulse may be set in the range that improves image contrast while also assuring sufficient image retention when the second pulse is applied in the second half of the display redrawing process.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">For example, the pulse width of the first pulse is preferably less than 25 ms, and the pulse width of the second pulse is preferably greater than or equal to 25 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Further preferably, the pulse width of the second pulse is set to 2 to 30 times the pulse width of the first pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">If the pulse width of the first pulse is too short, the particles <b>331</b> and <b>332</b> cannot be caused to move and a certain width is therefore necessary. It is therefore necessary to also set an appropriate lower limit for the pulse width of the first pulse, and this pulse width is set to 15 ms or longer, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In addition, if the pulse width of the second pulse is too long, the user will be able to see that black and white are alternately written, redrawing the display becomes time-consuming, and image retention also drops. It is therefore necessary to also set an appropriate upper limit for the pulse width of the second pulse, and this pulse width is set to 200-300 ms or less, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The pulse width of the second pulse is thus not limited to a range of 2-30 times the pulse width of the first pulse, and may be greater than this range of 2-30 times the pulse width of the first pulse if the above conditions are met.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The threshold for switching application of pulses of different pulse widths is not limited to a range of 80-90% of the targeted maximum reflectance, and may be less than 80% or more than 90%. The specific threshold value may be set according to the specific electrophoretic display device <b>3</b> in which the invention is used.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Furthermore, two different pulses, a first pulse and a second pulse, are applied in the embodiments described above, but the invention is not so limited. More specifically, three or more pulses of different pulse widths may be sequentially applied starting from the pulse with the shortest pulse width.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">For example, a first pulse with a 20 ms pulse width may be applied first until the reflectance reaches 70% of the targetted maximum reflectance, a second pulse with a 60 ms pulse width may then be applied until the reflectance reaches 85% of the targetted maximum reflectance, and a third pulse with a pulse width of 100 ms may then be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Further alternatively, first to n pulses ranging in pulse width from 20 ms to 21, 22, . . . 97, 98, 99, and 100 ms in 1 ms increments per period may be sequentially applied.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">If the applied pulse width can be changed in more stages, the reflectance can be changed smoothly until the targetted maximum reflectance is reached without noticeable flicker, and the display can be redrawn smoothly with high display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The embodiments described above apply the invention to a dot matrix display panel <b>30</b> using an active matrix drive circuit with a TFT circuit, but the invention can also be applied to segmented display panels having electrodes shaped like numbers or other display patterns. Note that if a segment display panel is used the data transfer component <b>421</b> and data transfer step S<b>1</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The foregoing embodiments describe a black and white, two particle electrophoretic system using black particles <b>331</b> and white particles <b>332</b>, but the invention is not so limited. More specifically, the invention can also be applied to single particle electrophoretic devices having blue/white particles, or a combination other than black and white.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Tests demonstrated that the electrophoretic display device <b>3</b> and the drive method of the invention are effective even when the temperature of the environment where the electrophoretic display device <b>3</b> is used changes. The invention can therefore be used in electrophoretic display devices that are used in different temperature environments.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The electrophoretic display device of the invention can be used in a wide range of electronic devices that have a display panel using electrophoretic devices, including personal digital assistants (PDA), cell phones, digital cameras, video cameras, printers, and personal computers.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The best modes and methods of achieving the present invention are described above, but the invention is not limited to these embodiments. More specifically, the invention is particularly shown in the figures and described herein with reference to specific embodiments, but it will be obvious to one with ordinary skill in the related art that the shape, material, number, and other detailed aspects of these arrangements can be varied in many ways without departing from the technical concept or the scope of the object of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Therefore, description of specific shapes, materials and other aspects of the foregoing embodiments are used by way of example only to facilitate understanding the present invention and in no way limit the scope of this invention, and descriptions using names of parts removing part or all of the limitations relating to the form, material, or other aspects of these embodiments are also included in the scope of this invention.</p>
