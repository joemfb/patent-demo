<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a head cleaning method and a head cleaning apparatus, and more particularly, to a head cleaning method and a head cleaning apparatus for wiping and cleaning a nozzle surface with a liquid absorbing body.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an inkjet recording apparatus which carries out image recording by ejecting very fine ink droplets from nozzles, if a recording operation is performed continuously, then ink in the form of a mist ejected from the nozzles adheres to and accumulates on the vicinity of the nozzles, and can give rise to nozzle blockages. Consequently, in an inkjet recording apparatus, cleaning of the nozzle surface is carried out periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-205712 discloses, as a method for cleaning the nozzle surface, a method in which the nozzle surface is wiped with a blade and then the nozzle surface is further wiped with an ink absorbing body (wiping member).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in a method where a nozzle surface is wiped with an ink absorbing body as in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-205712, if the absorption capability of the ink absorbing body used is high, then ink is drawn out from the nozzles by the ink absorbing body and there is a possibility that small liquid droplets are left after the passage of the ink absorbing body (hereinafter, a phenomenon of this kind is called &#x201c;wiping trace&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If, on the other hand, the absorption capability of the ink absorbing body used is low, then the liquid droplets on the nozzle surface are not absorbed completely and there is a possibility that large liquid droplets are left on the nozzle surface (hereinafter, a phenomenon of this kind is called &#x201c;wiping omission&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Wiping traces or wiping omissions of this kind have an adverse effect on the flight of the liquid droplets ejected from the nozzles and cause deterioration of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A conceivable method of avoiding this might be to wipe the nozzle surface using an ink absorbing body having an optimal absorption capability, but this is problematic in that it places restrictions on the choice of the ink absorbing body. Furthermore, depending on conditions such as the nozzle hole diameter and the resistance of the lyophobic film on the nozzle surface, there may not exist any ink absorbing body which fulfils the desired properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been contrived in view of these circumstances, an object thereof being to provide a head cleaning method and a head cleaning apparatus whereby the range of selection of usable ink absorbing bodies can be increased, and a nozzle surface can be cleaned without giving rise to wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the invention is directed to a head cleaning method of wiping and cleaning a nozzle surface of a head with a band-shaped liquid absorbing body by, while pressing and abutting a pressing member on which the liquid absorbing body that travels is wrapped against the nozzle surface of the head, sliding the pressing member over the nozzle surface of the head, the head cleaning method comprising: a first cleaning step of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with a non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body; a wet region forming step of forming a wet region on the liquid absorbing body; and a second cleaning step of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with the wet region of the liquid absorbing body.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to this aspect, firstly, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned using a non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body (first cleaning step). Thereupon, a wet region is formed on the liquid absorbing body (wet region forming step) and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned using the wet region thus formed (second cleaning step). By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. In other words, since the non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body has not yet absorbed liquid, then the liquid absorption capability is high and by wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface using this non-wet region having a high liquid absorption capability, it is possible to prevent wiping omissions. On the other hand, if the nozzle surface is wiped and cleaned using a liquid absorbing body having a high liquid absorption capability in this way, then there is a possibility of creating wiping traces on the nozzle surface. However, according to the present aspect, since the nozzle surface is wiped and cleaned using a non-wet region and the absorption capability of the liquid absorbing body is then reduced by wetting the liquid absorbing body and the nozzle surface is wiped and cleaned again using this liquid absorbing body having reduced absorption capability, then even if wiping traces have occurred in the first wiping and cleaning actions, these traces can be wiped away. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by this means, it is possible to ease the conditions relating to the liquid absorbing body which can be used, and therefore the range of selection of the liquid absorbing body can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Desirably, in the wet region forming step, the wet region is formed by depositing liquid from a liquid deposition device onto the liquid absorbing body on an upstream side of the pressing member in terms of a direction of travel of the liquid absorbing body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this aspect, a wet region is formed by depositing liquid from the liquid deposition device onto the liquid absorbing body on the upstream side of the pressing member, in other words, the liquid absorbing body before sliding in contact with the nozzle surface of the head. Therefore, it is possible to form a wet region in a prescribed region of the liquid absorbing body, in a straightforward fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Desirably, the first cleaning step is carried out after previously depositing liquid onto the nozzle surface of the head, and the wet region is formed by causing the liquid absorbing body to absorb the liquid which has been deposited onto a region of the nozzle surface other than a nozzle forming region of the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present aspect, the first cleaning step is carried out after previously depositing liquid (for example, a prescribed cleaning liquid) onto the nozzle surface of the head. The wet region is formed by causing the liquid absorbing body to absorb liquid which has been deposited onto the region of the nozzle surface other than the nozzle forming region. In other words, normally, there is a region where nozzles are not formed on the nozzle surface, and since this region is relatively clean compared to the region where nozzles are formed, then a wet region is formed on the liquid absorbing body by making the liquid absorbing body absorb the liquid that has been deposited onto this region. By this means, it is possible to form a wet region on the liquid absorbing body, in a straightforward fashion. In this case, the liquid absorbing body is used by being wound back according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Desirably, the wet region forming step forms the wet region by causing liquid to seep out from nozzles formed in the nozzle surface of the head and causing the liquid absorbing body to absorb the liquid that has seeped out from the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present aspect, the wet region is formed by causing liquid to seep out from the nozzles formed on the nozzle surface of the head and causing the liquid absorbing body to absorb this seeped liquid. By this means, it is possible to form a wet region on the liquid absorbing body, in a straightforward fashion. In this case, the liquid absorbing body is used by being wound back according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Desirably, in the first cleaning step, the liquid absorbing body is caused to travel in a direction opposite to a direction of relative movement of the head with respect to the pressing member.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to this aspect, the first cleaning step is carried out by causing the liquid absorbing body to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of relative movement of the head with respect to the pressing member. By this means, it is possible to increase the relative speed of travel of the liquid absorbing body with respect to the nozzle surface and the cleaning effect can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Desirably, in the second cleaning step, the liquid absorbing body is caused to travel in a direction opposite to a direction of relative movement of the head with respect to the pressing member.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this aspect, the second cleaning step is carried out by causing the liquid absorbing body to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of relative movement of the head with respect to the pressing member.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Desirably, in the second cleaning step, the liquid absorbing body is caused to travel in a same direction as a direction of relative movement of the head with respect to the pressing member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to this aspect, the second cleaning step is carried out by causing the liquid absorbing body to travel in the same direction as the direction of relative movement of the head with respect to the pressing member.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Desirably, in the wet region forming step, the wet region is formed by increasing an amount of wetting, as a relative speed differential between the head and the liquid absorbing body increases in the second cleaning step.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this aspect, a wet region is formed by increasing the amount of wetting, the greater the relative speed differential between the head and the liquid absorbing body in the second cleaning step. In other words, since the liquid absorption capability becomes greater, the faster the relative speed of the liquid absorbing body with respect to the head, then the amount of wetting is increased so as to restrict the absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to carry out the second cleaning step by setting the liquid absorbing body to a suitable absorption capability, and wiping traces can be removed appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another aspect of the invention is directed to a head cleaning apparatus which wipes and cleans a nozzle surface of a head with a band-shaped liquid absorbing body by, while pressing and abutting a pressing member on which the liquid absorbing body that travels is wrapped against the nozzle surface of the head, sliding the pressing member over the nozzle surface of the head, the head cleaning apparatus comprising: a liquid deposition device which deposits liquid on the liquid absorbing body on an upstream side of the pressing member in terms of a direction of travel of the liquid absorbing body so as to wet the liquid absorbing body with the liquid; and a control device which controls the travel of the liquid absorbing body, sliding of the pressing member and deposition of the liquid by the liquid deposition device, wherein the control device implements control in such a manner that, after the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with a non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body, a wet region is formed on the liquid absorbing body by depositing the liquid on the liquid absorbing body from the liquid deposition device, and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with the wet region.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this aspect, the nozzle surface is firstly wiped and cleaned by using a non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body. Thereupon, liquid is applied to the liquid absorbing body from the liquid deposition device to form a wet region on the liquid absorbing body. The nozzle surface is then wiped again using the wet region thus formed. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by this means, it is also possible to ease the conditions relating to the liquid absorbing body which can be used, and therefore the range of selection of the liquid absorbing body can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Desirably, an amount of the liquid deposited by the liquid deposition device can be altered in accordance with a relative speed differential between the head and the liquid absorbing body.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to this aspect, the amount of liquid deposited onto the liquid absorbing body from the liquid deposition device, in other words, the amount of wetting, is set in accordance with the relative speed differential between the head and the liquid absorbing body when the nozzle surface is wiped and cleaned with the wetted liquid absorbing body. By this means, it is possible to remove wiping traces suitably.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Another aspect of the invention is directed to a head cleaning apparatus which wipes and cleans a nozzle surface of a head with a band-shaped liquid absorbing body by, while pressing and abutting a pressing member on which the liquid absorbing body that travels is wrapped against the nozzle surface of the head, sliding the pressing member over the nozzle surface of the head, the head cleaning apparatus comprising: a liquid deposition device which deposits liquid onto the nozzle surface of the head; and a control device which controls travel of the liquid absorbing body, sliding of the pressing member and deposition of the liquid by the liquid deposition device, wherein the control device implements control in such a manner that, after the liquid is deposited onto the nozzle surface of the head from the liquid deposition device, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with a non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body, and then after this wiping and cleaning action, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned again with a wet region formed by wiping a region of the nozzle surface other than a nozzle forming region of the nozzle surface.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to this aspect, after depositing liquid from the liquid deposition device onto the nozzle surface of the head, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned by using a non-wet region of the liquid absorbing body. After this wiping and cleaning action using the non-wet region, the nozzle surface is wiped and cleaned again using a wet region formed by wiping over a region of the nozzle surface other than the nozzle forming region. Accordingly, it is possible to clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by this means, it is also possible to ease the conditions relating to the liquid absorbing body which can be used, and therefore the range of selection of the liquid absorbing body can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Desirably, the head cleaning apparatus further comprises a wet region determination device which determines the wet region of the liquid absorbing body.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to this aspect, it is possible to determine a wet region of the liquid absorbing body. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surface by switching the wet region and the non-wet region appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another aspect of the invention is directed to a head cleaning method of wiping and cleaning a nozzle surface of a head with a wiping member by, while pressing and abutting the wiping member against the nozzle surface of the head, sliding the wiping member over the nozzle surface of the head, the head cleaning method comprising: a first cleaning step of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with a wiping member having a first liquid absorption capability; and a second cleaning step of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with a wiping member having a second liquid absorption capability which is lower than the first liquid absorption capability, after the first cleaning step.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to this aspect, when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped using a wiping member having a high liquid absorption capability, wiping omissions can be prevented, but there is a possibility of the occurrence of wiping traces due to ink being drawn out from the nozzles during wiping. On the other hand, when the nozzle surface is wiped using a wiping member having a low liquid absorption capability, wiping traces can be prevented, but there is a possibility of the occurrence of wiping omissions. Therefore, according to the this aspect, after wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with a wiping member having a first liquid absorption capability, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with a wiping member having a second liquid absorption capability, which is lower than the first liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by wiping the nozzle surface a plurality of times while changing the liquid absorption capability in this way, it is possible to increase the range of selection of the wiping member and cost reductions can be made, compared to a case where wiping is performed using a wiping member having an optimal liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">This aspect includes an aspect where the liquid absorption capability is switched in a stepwise fashion. More specifically, this aspect includes an aspect where, between the first cleaning step and the second cleaning step, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned by a wiping member having an intermediate liquid absorption capability between the first liquid absorption capability and the second liquid absorption capability. Furthermore, this aspect also includes an aspect where the first cleaning step is carried out a plurality of times using a wiping member having a high liquid absorption capability, whereupon the second cleaning step is carried out. More specifically, according to the aspect, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with a wiping member having a first liquid absorption capability at least once, and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned finally with a wiping member having a second liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Desirably, the first liquid absorption capability is set to a high liquid absorption capability of a level which avoids creating wiping omissions when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped; and the second liquid absorption capability is set to a low liquid absorption capability of a level which avoids drawing out ink from nozzles when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the present aspect, the first liquid absorption capability is set to a liquid absorption capability of a level which avoids the occurrence of wiping omissions when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped, and the second liquid absorption capability is set to a liquid absorption capability of a level which avoids drawing out ink from the nozzles when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped. By this means, it is possible to prevent wiping omissions in the first cleaning step and it is possible to remove wiping traces produced during wiping, in the second cleaning step.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Desirably, the wiping member having the first liquid absorption capability and the wiping member having the second liquid absorption capability are arranged, and the first cleaning step and the second cleaning step are carried out by switching the wiping member to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to this aspect, a wiping member having a first liquid absorption capability and a wiping member having a second liquid absorption capability are provided and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned by switching the wiping member used. In this case, after wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with a wiping member having a first liquid absorption capability, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned by switching to the wiping member having a second liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surface of the head without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Desirably, the liquid absorption capability displayed by the wiping member switches between the first liquid absorption capability and the second liquid absorption capability according to orientation of the wiping member with respect to a direction in which the wiping member is slid, and the orientation of the wiping member is changed between in the first cleaning step and in the second cleaning step.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to this aspect, a wiping member of which the liquid absorption capability switches between a first liquid absorption capability and a second liquid absorption capability by changing orientation is used, and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned while changing the orientation of the wiping member. In this case, after wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head in the orientation set to the first liquid absorption capability, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned by switching the orientation of the wiping member to the orientation set to the second liquid absorption capability. For example, the wiping member used is set to have a first liquid absorption capability when the member is wiped in a longitudinal direction and is set to have a second liquid absorption capability when wiped in a lateral direction; after wiping and cleaning in a longitudinal orientation, wiping and cleaning is then carried out by switching the orientation of the wiping member to a lateral orientation. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surface of the head without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions, in a simple fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Desirably, the wiping member is formed in a band shape, and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with the wiping member by sliding the wiping member over the nozzle surface of the head by causing the wiping member to travel in a lengthwise direction while changing a slide portion in contact with the nozzle surface of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to this aspect, the wiping member is formed in a band shape and is slid over the nozzle surface of the head while changing the portion sliding in contact with the nozzle surface of the head, by causing the wiping member to travel in the lengthwise direction. By this means, it is possible to increase the relative speed of the wiping member with respect to the nozzle surface of the head, and the cleaning effect can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Desirably, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with the wiping member by sliding the wiping member over the nozzle surface of the head while causing the wiping member to travel in a direction opposite to a direction of sliding.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to this aspect, the wiping member is slid over the nozzle surface of the head while causing the wiping member to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of sliding. By this means, it is possible further to increase the relative speed of the wiping member with respect to the nozzle surface of the head, and the cleaning effect can be enhanced yet further.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Another aspect of the invention is directed to a head cleaning apparatus which cleans a nozzle surface of a head, comprising: a plurality of wiping members having different liquid absorption capabilities; a pressing device which presses and abuts the wiping member against the nozzle surface of the head; a switching device which switches the wiping member pressed and abutted against the nozzle surface of the head by the pressing device; and a movement device which causes the head and the wiping member pressed and abutted against the nozzle surface of the head to move relatively in such a manner the wiping member pressed and abutted against the nozzle surface of the head slides over the nozzle surface of the head, wherein the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned a plurality of times while switching from the wiping member having a high liquid absorption capability to the wiping member having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>

By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At least two wiping members having different liquid absorption capabilities should be used. Therefore, it is also possible to wipe the nozzle surface using three or more wiping members having different liquid absorption capabilities. In this case, the wiping member used is switched in a stepwise fashion. Furthermore, the number of times wiping is carried out with each wiping member should be at least once and may be several times. More specifically, according to this aspect, a composition should be adopted in which the nozzle surface is wiped at least once with a wiping member having high liquid absorption capability and is wiped finally with a wiping member having the lowest liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Desirably, the plurality of wiping members include a wiping member having a high liquid absorption capability which does not give rise to wiping omissions when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped, and a wiping member having a low liquid absorption capability which does not draw out ink from nozzles when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped, and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with the wiping member having the high liquid absorption capability, and then the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned with the wiping member having the low liquid absorption capability.</p>

By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surface without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The liquid absorption capability of the wiping member should be switched in at least two steps. Therefore, it is also possible to use a wiping member which switches liquid absorption capability in three or more steps. In this case, the liquid absorption capability is switched so as to reduce in a stepwise fashion. Furthermore, if the liquid absorption capability is switched in a plurality of steps, then at least the final wiping action should be carried out in a state of low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Desirably, the wiping member is set to displaying a high liquid absorption capability which does not give rise to wiping omissions when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped, when set to a first orientation, and the wiping member is set to displaying a low liquid absorption capability which does not draw ink out from nozzles when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped, when set to a second orientation.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to this aspect, firstly, the nozzle surface of a head is wiped and cleaned by sliding a wiping member over the nozzle surface of the head while suctioning at a first suctioning force (first cleaning step). By suctioning the wiping member at a first suctioning force in this way, it is possible to raise the suctioning force of the wiping member and wiping omissions can be prevented. On the other hand, when the nozzle surface is wiped with a wiping member having a high absorption capability in this way, there is a possibility of the occurrence of wiping traces due to ink being drawn out from the nozzles. Therefore, according to the present aspect, after the first cleaning step, the wiping member is slid over the nozzle surface of the head while suctioning at a second suctioning force which is weaker than the first suctioning force, or without suctioning, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head with the wiping member (second cleaning step). By wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of the head in this way by sliding the wiping member over the nozzle surface of the head while suctioning at a second suctioning force which is set to be weaker than the first suctioning force, or without suctioning, it is possible to prevent the drawing out of ink from the nozzles, while being able to remove wiping traces caused by the first cleaning step, and therefore the nozzle surface can be cleaned without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by switching the suctioning force from the suction hole and thus switching the suctioning force applied to the wiping member in this way, it is possible to ease the conditions relating to the wiping members which can be used, and therefore the range of selection of usable wiping members can be increased. According to the present aspect, since the suctioning force of the wiping member is switched by means of the suctioning force acting via the suction hole in this way, desirably, the wiping member is one which inherently has a low liquid absorption capability.</p>

<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Head Cleaning Method</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Next, a cleaning method for a head using the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The cleaning of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is carried out by wiping respectively with a wiping web <b>110</b> after applying a cleaning liquid to the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. In the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment, the operation of wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs <b>110</b> is divided into two separate actions. More specifically, the first wiping action involves wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> in a normal state of high absorption capability, and the second wiping action involves wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of low absorption capability. In this way, by wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in two separate wiping actions, it is possible to prevent wiping traces and wiping omissions. In other words, the first wiping action prevents wiping omissions by wiping the nozzle surface with a wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of normal high absorption capability, thereby removing large liquid droplets on the nozzle surface. The subsequent second wiping action removes the wiping trace produced by the first wiping action as well as preventing ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes, by wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of low absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Here, the switching of the absorption capability of the wiping web <b>110</b> is achieved by wetting the wiping web <b>110</b> and lowering the absorption capability by making the wiping web <b>110</b> absorb a prescribed amount of cleaning liquid. Therefore, the second wiping action is carried out using a wetted region (wet region) of the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment, the wet region used for the second wiping action is created by wiping the wiping web <b>110</b> on a region of the nozzle surface <b>30</b>C where nozzles are not formed. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the nozzles <b>90</b> are not formed over the whole of the breadthways direction of the nozzle surface <b>30</b>, but rather are formed so as to correspond to the width of the paper that is to be recorded on. Therefore, normally, there is a region at either end where nozzles are not formed (nozzle free region). The nozzle free regions (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the obliquely shaded regions at either end of the head) are in a relatively clean state and therefore the wiping web <b>110</b> does not become soiled even after wiping these regions. Consequently, even if the wiping web <b>110</b> is reused, the nozzle surface <b>30</b> is not soiled thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In this way, in the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment, a second wiping action is carried out using a wet region of a wiping web <b>110</b> which is produced by wiping over the nozzle free region in the first wiping action.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">In the example of the head <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, nozzle rows are formed by arranging nozzles <b>90</b> in a staggered matrix configuration on the nozzle surface <b>30</b>. By adopting an arrangement of this kind for the nozzles <b>90</b>, it is possible to reduce the effective pitch between the nozzles <b>90</b> as projected to the lengthwise direction of the head <b>16</b> (namely, a direction perpendicular to the conveyance direction of the paper; in other words, the breadthways direction of the paper), and therefore a high-density configuration of the nozzles <b>90</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Below, a specific cleaning method for the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K using the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Firstly, cleaning liquid is applied to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in order to dissolve the adhering material created by the ink which is adhering to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The cleaning liquid is applied by moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the image formation position towards the maintenance position (or from the maintenance position towards the image formation position), as well as spraying cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K toward the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. More specifically, the procedure is as follows. When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved from the image formation position toward the maintenance position, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K pass over the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K and therefore cleaning liquid is sprayed from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K in coordination with the passage of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By this means, cleaning liquid is applied to the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, including the nozzle free regions.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The application of cleaning liquid may be carried out once, or a plurality of times. If cleaning liquid is applied a plurality of times, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved back and forth a plurality of times during application.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">When the application of the cleaning liquid has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned temporarily to the image formation position. Thereupon, a first wiping and cleaning action (first cleaning step) is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As described above, this first wiping action is carried out using a wiping web in a normal state of high absorption capability. In other words, this wiping action is carried out using an unused region of the wiping web <b>110</b> which has not been wetted (non-wet region). More specifically, the procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Firstly, the position of the non-wet region of the wiping web (head position) is located. More specifically, the position of the wiping web <b>110</b> is located in such a manner that the non-wet region is wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b> (so that the non-wet region is abutted against the nozzle surface). This step is carried out on the basis of the output from the wet region determination sensor <b>124</b> and is performed by winding the wiping web <b>110</b> onto the take-up reel <b>116</b> until a wet region ceases to be determined by the wet region determination sensor <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">After locating the position of the non-wet region in this way, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are respectively pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while being caused to travel at a uniform speed in the take-up direction, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. More specifically, the procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Firstly, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved towards the maintenance position. As the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved toward the maintenance position, they are halted temporarily when the end portion on one side thereof (the end portion on the maintenance position side) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In this case, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K are situated in a prescribed withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position. As a result of this, the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>122</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are slid in contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the relative differential velocity, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>. The travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is also halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By this means, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed and the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K is wiped and cleaned by the wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">As described above, nozzle free regions are formed in the respective end portions of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, in the first wiping and cleaning action, these nozzle free regions are also wiped and cleaned. The second wiping and cleaning action is carried out by using the wet regions formed on the wiping webs <b>110</b> by the wiping and cleaning of these nozzle free regions.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Here, since the wet region will have already been taken up onto the take-up reel <b>116</b> side, then a prescribed wind-back operation is carried out. In other words, in each of the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>, when the travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is halted, the pressing roller <b>118</b> is temporarily withdrawn to a withdrawn position and the wiping web <b>110</b> is wound back to the side of the pay-out reel <b>114</b> in accordance with the amount which has wiped the nozzle free region.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The amount of winding back is determined on the basis of the length of the nozzle free region, the speed of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b>, the feed velocity of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">As described above, the wiping web <b>110</b> is wound back to the side of the pay-out reel <b>114</b> in accordance with the amount which has wiped the nozzle free region, thereby forming a wet region for the second wiping and cleaning action.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">While this wind-back processing of the wet region is carried out, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned until the end portion on the one side is situated at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">When the wind-back processing of the wet region is completed and the end portion on the one side of each of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K has been disposed at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>, then the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to the pressing position and the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>122</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref>, the wet regions of the wiping webs <b>110</b> are slid in contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the wet regions of the wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">In this second wiping and cleaning action, the wiping webs <b>110</b> travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the relative differential velocity, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Since the wet region that is wound back is limited in size, then during the second wiping and cleaning action the speed of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is adjusted so as to be able to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K by using the wet region that has been wound back.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In this way, the second wiping and cleaning action is carried out using a wet region of the wiping web <b>110</b>. By using a wet region to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in this way, it is possible effectively to remove any wiping traces which may have occurred during the first wiping and cleaning action. Furthermore, by wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K using a wet region in this way, it is possible to prevent ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes by the wiping action (namely, to prevent the occurrence of wiping traces). In each of the respective head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, the travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is halted when the other side end portion of the head <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K has passed the pressing roller <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, on the other hand, are moved directly towards the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K in which the travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> has been halted, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are withdrawn to the withdrawn position, whereby the cleaning operation is ended.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">After this, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K carry out location of a non-wet region for the next cleaning process, according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">As described above, in the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment, after wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs <b>110</b> once, the absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is lowered and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned again with the wiping webs <b>110</b>. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by switching the absorption capability through wetting the wiping webs <b>110</b> in this way, it is possible to increase the range of choice of the wiping web that can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In the present example, the first wiping and cleaning action which uses a non-wet region is carried out just once, but it may also be carried out a plurality of times. More specifically, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K may be moved back and forth a plurality of times with the wiping webs <b>110</b> pressed and abutted against the heads, so as to carry out the first wiping and cleaning action. Similarly, the second wiping and cleaning action which uses a wet region may be carried out a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Furthermore, in the present example, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are made to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K when carrying out the second wiping and cleaning action using the wet region, but this wiping and cleaning action may also be carried out with the webs traveling in the same direction as the heads. In this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K while conveying the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position and winding back the wiping webs <b>110</b> in accordance with the amount of web which has wiped and cleaned the nozzle free region. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K while causing the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel in the same direction as the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Furthermore, it is also possible to carry out two wiping and cleaning actions using a wet region in a state where the wiping webs <b>110</b> have been halted and are not traveling.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The amount of wetting of the wet region used in the second wiping and cleaning action is desirably set appropriately in accordance with the absorption capacity of the wiping web <b>110</b> used (for example, the wet region is wetted so that the absorption capability falls to 20% approximately). In this case, desirably, the amount of wetting is increased, the greater the relative velocity differential between the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K and the wiping webs <b>110</b> during the second wiping and cleaning action. By this means, the absorption capability can be adjusted appropriately and the second wiping and cleaning action can be carried out in a suitable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">In order to adjust the wetting amount, the amount of cleaning liquid applied to the nozzle free region is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Furthermore, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K according to the present embodiment respectively comprise a wet region determination sensor <b>124</b>, but this wet region determination sensors <b>124</b> does not necessarily have to be provided, and it is also possible to locate the wiping web <b>110</b> in a desired position by controlling the amount of winding out and winding back of the wiping web <b>110</b>. By providing a wet region determination sensor <b>124</b>, it is possible to achieve accurate positional location, as well as being able to determine the presence or absence of the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Furthermore, in the present example, the wet regions are formed respectively by wiping the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b> on the nozzle free regions formed on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, but wet regions can also be formed by causing ink to seep out from the nozzles after the first wiping and cleaning action and wiping the wiping webs <b>110</b> on this ink. In this case, it is not particularly necessary to cause ink to seep out from all of the nozzles, and ink should be caused to seep out from nozzles in a necessary range in order to create a wet region.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Furthermore, normally, the cleaning liquid absorbed into the wiping web <b>110</b> wets and spreads, and therefore the region into which the liquid wets and spreads in an unused part of the web is used as the wet region.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Moreover, in the present example, in order to dissolve the adhering material caused by the ink, cleaning liquid is applied previously to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in order to wet the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, but there are no particular restrictions on the method of wetting the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. For example, it is also possible to use ink as a wetting liquid. In this case, ink is caused to seep out from the nozzles formed on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, so as to wet the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. Furthermore, in this case, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are sealed with a cap, the internal pressure of the cap is reduced, and the ink is suctioned onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K and thus caused to seep out from the nozzles. Alternatively, the ink is caused to seep out onto the nozzle surfaces by applying pressure to the flow channels from the ink tanks to the heads.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">If ink is used as the wetting liquid in this way, then it is possible to omit the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Second Embodiment of First Mode</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a front view diagram of a second embodiment of a head cleaner according to the first mode. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the head cleaner <b>200</b> according to the present embodiment comprises a wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b> for wetting the wiping web <b>110</b> by depositing cleaning liquid thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Apart from the fact that this wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b> is provided, this head cleaner is the same as the head cleaner <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment of the first mode which is described above. Consequently, only the wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b> is described here.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b> is disposed between the pay-out guide roller <b>134</b> and the pressing roller <b>118</b> (on the upstream side of the pressing roller <b>118</b> in terms of the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> when being taken up onto the take-up reel <b>116</b>). This wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b> has a spray port corresponding to the width of the wiping web <b>110</b>, and sprays a wetting liquid onto the wiping web <b>110</b> which travels between the pay-out guide roller <b>134</b> and the pressing roller <b>118</b> (the wiping web <b>110</b> on the upstream side of the pressing roller <b>118</b> in terms of the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> when being taken up onto the take-up reel <b>116</b>), thereby wetting the wiping web <b>110</b>. By this means, it is possible to wet the wiping web <b>110</b> before the web is pressed and abutted against the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The wetting liquid is supplied from a wetting liquid tank <b>214</b> via a wetting liquid supply pipe <b>212</b> which is connected to the wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b>, and by driving a wetting liquid spray pump <b>216</b> which is provided at an intermediate point of the wetting liquid supply pipe <b>212</b>, the wetting liquid is sprayed from the wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Head Cleaning Method</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Next, a cleaning method for a head using the head cleaner according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The fact of switching the absorption capability of the wiping web <b>110</b> and wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in two separate actions is the same as the cleaning method of the first embodiment of the first mode which is described previously. More specifically, the first action involves wiping by a wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of normal high absorption capability, and the second action involves wiping by a wetted wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of low absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Firstly, the non-wet region of the wiping web is located in position. As described above, the first wiping action is carried out using a wiping web in a normal state of high absorption capability, in other words, an unused region which has not been wetted (non-wet region), and therefore this non-wet region is located in position. If this positional location of the non-wet region has already been completed, then this process is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">When the respective non-wet regions have been located in position, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved towards the maintenance position. As the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved toward the maintenance position, they are halted temporarily when the end portion on one side thereof (the end portion on the maintenance position side) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. In this case, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K are situated in a prescribed withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position. As a result of this, the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>122</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven to convey the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>, the respective wiping webs <b>110</b> are slid in contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the relative differential velocity, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>. The travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is also halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By this means, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed and the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K is wiped and cleaned by the wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">When the first wiping and cleaning action has been completed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, each pressing roller <b>118</b> is withdrawn temporarily to a withdrawn position. Furthermore, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned in such a manner that the end portion on one side thereof is disposed at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">When the end portion on one side of each of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is situated at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>, then as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position and the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>122</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven to convey the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. Furthermore, simultaneously with this, the respective wetting liquid spray pumps <b>216</b> are driven and wetting liquid is sprayed toward the wiping webs <b>110</b> from the wetting liquid deposition nozzles <b>210</b>. Consequently, wetting liquid is deposited onto the wiping webs <b>110</b> before making contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (namely, the wiping webs <b>110</b> on the upstream side of the pressing roller <b>118</b>), thereby wetting the wiping webs <b>110</b> (forming wetted regions) before the webs make contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By taking the wiping web <b>110</b> up onto the take-up reel <b>116</b> while spraying wetting liquid from the wetting liquid deposition nozzle <b>210</b> toward the wiping web <b>110</b> in this way, a wet region of the wiping web <b>110</b> is slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref>, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are each wiped and cleaned by a wet region of the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In this way, the second wiping and cleaning action is carried out using a wet region of the wiping web <b>110</b>. By using a wet region to perform the second wiping and cleaning action in this way, it is possible effectively to remove any wiping traces which may have occurred during the first wiping and cleaning action. Furthermore, by using a wet region to perform the second wiping and cleaning action in this way, it is possible to prevent ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes by the wiping action.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">In each of the respective head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, the travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is halted when the other side end portion of the head <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K has passed the pressing roller <b>118</b>. Furthermore, the driving of the wetting liquid spray pump <b>216</b> is also halted simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, on the other hand, are moved directly towards the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K in which the travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> has been halted, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are withdrawn to the withdrawn position, and the cleaning operation is thereby ended.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">After this, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K carry out location of a non-wet region for the next cleaning process, according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">As described above, in the present embodiment, after wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs <b>110</b> once, the absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is lowered and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned again using the wiping webs <b>110</b>. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by switching the absorption capability through wetting the wiping webs <b>110</b> in this way, it is possible to increase the range of choice of the wiping web that can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In the present example, the first wiping and cleaning action which uses a non-wet region is carried out just once, but it may also be carried out a plurality of times. More specifically, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K may be moved back and forth a plurality of times with the wiping webs <b>110</b> pressed and abutted against the heads, so as to carry out the first wiping and cleaning action. Similarly, the second wiping and cleaning action which uses a wet region may also be carried out a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Furthermore, in the present example, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are made to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K when carrying out the second wiping and cleaning action using the wet region, but this wiping and cleaning action may also be carried out with the webs traveling in the same direction as the heads. In this case, for example, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K traveling from the maintenance position toward the image formation position, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Furthermore, it is also possible to carry out two wiping and cleaning actions in a state where the wiping webs <b>110</b> have been halted and are not traveling.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The amount of wetting of the wet region used in the second wiping and cleaning action is desirably set appropriately in accordance with the absorption capacity of the wiping web <b>110</b> used (for example, the wet region is wetted so that the absorption capability falls to 20% approximately). In this case, desirably, the amount of wetting (the amount of wetting liquid supplied from the wetting liquid deposition nozzles <b>210</b>) is increased, the greater the relative velocity differential between the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K and the wiping webs <b>110</b> during the second wiping and cleaning action. By this means, the absorption capability can be adjusted appropriately and the second wiping and cleaning action can be carried out in a suitable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Furthermore, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K according to the present embodiment respectively comprise a wet region determination sensor <b>124</b>, but this wet region determination sensor <b>124</b> does not necessarily have to be provided, and it is also possible to locate the wiping web <b>110</b> in a desired position by controlling the amount of winding out and winding back of the wiping web <b>110</b>. By providing a wet region determination sensor <b>124</b>, it is possible to achieve accurate positional location, as well as being able to determine the presence or absence of the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Furthermore, in the series of embodiments described above, a case where the nozzle surface of a line head is wiped and cleaned is described, but the application of the present invention is not limited to this. The invention can also be applied similarly to a case of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of a so-called shuttle scanning type of head.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Second Mode</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Next, desirable embodiments of a second mode of the present invention will be described. Explanation for elements that are the same as or similar to those in the first mode described above is omitted in the second mode.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a plan view diagram showing a composition of the nozzle surface of a head <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, nozzle rows <b>32</b> are formed in the lengthwise direction of the head <b>16</b> in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> (<b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K) of the head <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Each of the heads <b>16</b> which are installed on a head supporting frame <b>40</b> is disposed with the nozzle rows <b>32</b> which are formed in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> arranged perpendicularly with respect to the direction of conveyance of the paper <b>12</b>. Ink droplets are ejected perpendicularly from the nozzle rows <b>32</b> formed in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> toward the outer circumferential surface of the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In the example of the head <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, nozzles rows <b>32</b> are formed by arranging nozzles <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, in a staggered matrix configuration on the nozzle surface <b>30</b>. By adopting an arrangement of this kind for the nozzles <b>34</b>, <b>34</b> . . . it is possible to reduce the effective pitch between the nozzles <b>34</b> as projected to the lengthwise direction of the head <b>16</b> (namely, a direction perpendicular to the conveyance direction of the paper; in other words, the breadthways direction of the paper), and therefore a high-density configuration of the nozzles <b>34</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The head supporting frame <b>40</b> where the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are installed is provided movably in a direction parallel to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation unit <b>14</b> (namely, in the lengthwise direction of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K installed thereon) and is composed in such a manner that the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K can be withdrawn to a prescribed maintenance position. This point is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The image formation unit <b>10</b> has the composition described above. In this image formation unit <b>10</b>, paper <b>12</b> is received onto the image formation drum <b>14</b> from a previous step via the conveyance drum <b>26</b>, and is conveyed in rotation while being held by suction on the circumferential surface of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. The paper <b>12</b> passes below the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K during this conveyance and ink droplets are ejected from the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K onto the recording surface of the paper as the paper passes, thereby forming a color image on the recording surface. After having completed image recording, the paper <b>12</b> is transferred from the image formation drum <b>14</b> to the conveyance drum <b>28</b> and is conveyed to a subsequent step.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">The driving of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (ink ejection) and the driving of the image formation unit <b>14</b>, and the like, are controlled by a system controller, which is not illustrated. This system controller performs overall control of the operations of the whole inkjet recording apparatus and controls the driving of the respective units in accordance with a prescribed control program.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Movement Mechanism of Head Supporting Frame</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">As described above, the head supporting frame <b>40</b> is provided movably in the direction parallel to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. Below, the movement mechanism of the head supporting frame <b>40</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">This head supporting frame <b>40</b> is supported slidably via sliders <b>52</b>, <b>52</b> on a pair of guide rails <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> which are arranged in parallel with the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. The head supporting frame <b>40</b> slides in a direction parallel to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b> by sliding along the guide rails <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Furthermore, a nut section <b>56</b> which screws onto a screw bar <b>54</b> is coupled to the head supporting frame <b>40</b>. The screw bar <b>54</b> is arranged in parallel with the guide rail <b>50</b> and the respective end portions thereof are supported rotatably on bearings <b>58</b>, <b>58</b> which are provided in the main body frame of the inkjet recording apparatus. A head feed motor <b>60</b> is coupled to this screw bar <b>54</b>, which is driven to rotate by the head feed motor <b>60</b>. The head supporting frame <b>40</b> slides along the guide rails <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> by driving the head feed motor <b>60</b> and turning the screw bar <b>54</b>. In other words, the head supporting frame <b>40</b> slides in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">A system controller, which is not illustrated, causes the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K to move from a prescribed image formation position to a maintenance position by controlling the driving of the head feed motor <b>60</b> and controlling the movement of the head supporting frame <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the heads are moved from the maintenance position to the image formation position.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">When disposed in the image formation position, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are arranged about the periphery of the image formation drum <b>14</b>, as indicated by the solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and are able to record an image onto paper <b>12</b> conveyed in rotation by the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">On the other hand, when the heads are disposed in the maintenance position, as indicated by the dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, then the heads are withdrawn from the periphery of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. By this means, it is possible to carry out maintenance of both the image formation drum <b>14</b> and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">A moisturizing unit <b>62</b> for moisturizing the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is provided in this maintenance position.

<p id="p-0281" num="0280">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>, the head cleaner <b>100</b> wipes and cleans the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b> by wrapping a band-shaped wiping web <b>110</b> about a pressing roller <b>118</b> and pressing and abutting the wiping web <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b> against the nozzle surface <b>30</b> (<b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K) of the corresponding head <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K).</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">This head cleaner <b>100</b> principally comprises a main body frame <b>112</b>, a pay-out reel <b>114</b> which pays out a wiping web <b>110</b>, a take-up reel <b>116</b> which winds up the wiping web <b>110</b>, the pressing roller <b>118</b> that is presses and abuts the wiping web <b>110</b> against the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b>, a take-up motor <b>1120</b> which drives the take-up reel <b>116</b> to rotate and take up the wiping web <b>110</b> onto the take-up reel <b>116</b>, a wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b> comprising a used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> which determines a used region of the wiping web <b>110</b>, a travel direction switching motor <b>1124</b> that rotates the wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b> to switch the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b>, and an elevator cylinder <b>126</b> which abuts and separates the wiping web <b>110</b> with respect to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of a head <b>16</b> by advancing and retracting the wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b> perpendicularly with respect to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The wiping web <b>110</b> is formed in a band shape of woven high-density fibers, such as polyester, acrylic, nylon, or the like, and winding cores <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B are attached to either end thereof. The wiping web <b>110</b> in an unused state is supplied in the form of a roll wound up onto one of the winding cores <b>110</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">This wiping web <b>110</b> is composed in such a manner that the liquid absorption capability thereof changes when the direction of sliding movement of the wiping web <b>110</b> is changed. In the present embodiment, when the web is slid in the lengthwise direction, a high liquid absorption capability is obtained (a liquid absorption capability sufficient to avoid wiping omissions when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped), and when the web is slid in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction, the liquid absorption capability is reduced by a certain amount (to a level whereby ink is not drawn out from the nozzles when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped). For example, the web is composed in such a manner that when the web is slid in the direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction, the liquid absorption capability is reduced by approximately 20% compared to a case where the web is slid in the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Consequently, if the wiping web <b>110</b> is slid in a direction following the lengthwise direction, then it is possible to wipe the nozzle surface in a state of high liquid absorption capability (a liquid absorption capability sufficient to avoid the occurrence of wiping omissions when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped), and if the wiping web <b>110</b> is slid in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction, then it is possible to wipe the nozzle surface in a state of low liquid absorption capability (a liquid absorption capability of a level whereby ink is not drawn out from the nozzles even when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped).</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">A wiping web of this kind can be achieved, for example, by altering the material of the fibers used, altering the thickness of the fibers, altering the weaving method (or weaving direction), or altering the amount of fibers per unit length, between the direction following the lengthwise direction and the direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">As described hereinafter, the wiping web <b>110</b> is installed on the head cleaner <b>100</b> by mounting the winding core <b>110</b>A which is wound with the wiping web <b>110</b> in the form of a roll on the pay-out reel <b>114</b>, and mounting the winding core <b>110</b>B at the end of the web on the take-up reel <b>116</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The take-up reel <b>116</b> and the pay-out reel <b>114</b> are disposed in parallel in the lateral direction at a uniform spacing apart.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The pressing roller <b>118</b> is disposed above the intermediate position between the pay-out reel <b>114</b> and the take-up reel <b>116</b>, and the wiping web <b>110</b> which travels between the pay-out reel <b>114</b> and the take-up reel <b>116</b> is wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b>.

<p id="p-0299" num="0298">A used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> is arranged between the pressing roller <b>118</b> and the take-up guide roller <b>138</b> and determines the used region of the wiping web <b>110</b> traveling between same. The used region is determined by determining the wet region of the wiping web <b>110</b>, for instance. In other words, the used region becomes wet due to absorbing ink or cleaning liquid and therefore the used region is determined by determining this wet region. The used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> is constituted by a photosensor comprising a light emitting section and a light receiving section, for example, and determines the used region (wet region) of the wiping web <b>110</b> by receiving the reflected light of the light which is emitted toward the wiping web <b>110</b> from the light emitting section. The system controller controls the used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> and carries out processing for determining the used region.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The travel direction switching motor <b>1124</b> is disposed below the wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b>.

The wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b> is rotated about an axis S perpendicular to the bottom surface portion <b>112</b>A (namely, an axis perpendicular to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b>) by driving the travel direction switching motor <b>1124</b>. The pressing roller <b>118</b> is disposed perpendicularly with respect to the axis S, and the center of the roller in the breadthways direction is disposed on this axis S. As a result of this, when the travel direction switching motor <b>1124</b> is driven and the wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b> is caused to rotate, the wiping web <b>110</b> turns about the axis S perpendicular to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the corresponding head <b>16</b>, thereby switching the direction of travel. For example, if the wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b> is rotated through 180 degrees, then the direction of travel is reversed. The system controller controls the driving of the travel direction switching motor <b>1124</b> and thereby controls the switching of the travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> with respect to the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the corresponding head <b>16</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0321" num="0320">The application of cleaning liquid may be carried out once, or a plurality of times. If cleaning liquid is applied a plurality of times, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved back and forth a plurality of times during application.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">When the application of the cleaning liquid has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned temporarily to the image formation position. Thereupon, a first wiping and cleaning action (first cleaning step) is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">As described above, the first wiping action is carried out with the web set to a state of high liquid absorption capability by setting the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> (the orientation with respect to the direction of sliding the web) to the first direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>).

This step is carried out on the basis of the output from the used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> and is performed by winding the wiping web <b>110</b> onto the take-up reel <b>116</b> until the wet region ceases to be determined by the used region determination sensor <b>1122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">If the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> at this stage has not been set to the first direction, then the travel direction switching motor <b>1124</b> is driven and the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is set to the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">When the positional location of the unused region is completed, then the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position, and the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been sent to the maintenance position, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.

In this case, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K are situated in a prescribed withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position.

The travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">By means of the above, the second wiping and cleaning action is completed.

<p id="p-0343" num="0342">When the second wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed directly toward the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">On the other hand, in the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are disposed in the withdrawn position. After this, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K carry out location of an unused region of the wiping web for the next cleaning process, according to requirements.

<p id="p-0345" num="0344">By means of the steps described above, the cleaning of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">As described previously, in a head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment, the liquid absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b> which wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is switched and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned in two separate actions. In other words, in a first action, wiping is performed in a state of high liquid absorption capability by sliding the wiping webs <b>110</b> in the lengthwise direction, and in a second action, wiping is performed in a state of low liquid absorption capability by sliding the wiping webs <b>110</b> in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">In the present embodiment, the first wiping and cleaning action which is carried out with the direction of travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> set to the first direction is implemented just once, but it may also be carried out a plurality of times. In this case, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved back and forth a plurality of times, while the wiping webs <b>110</b> remain pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. In a similar fashion, the second wiping and cleaning action which is carried out with the direction of travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> set to the second direction may also be carried out a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Furthermore, in the present example, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are slid while traveling in both the first and second actions, but the wiping webs <b>110</b> may also be slid in a halted state. By sliding the wiping webs <b>110</b> while traveling as in the present example, it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by using a clean part of the web at all times. By this means, the cleaning effect can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Furthermore, according to the present example, in the first wiping and cleaning action, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, but the wiping webs <b>110</b> may also be pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while traveling in the same direction. By pressing and abutting the wiping webs <b>110</b> against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, it is possible to raise the relative velocity of travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> with respect to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and hence the cleaning effect can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Moreover, in the example described above, the application of cleaning liquid, the first wiping and cleaning action and the second wiping and cleaning action are carried out during a step of moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the image formation position to the maintenance position, but it is also possible to carry out the application of cleaning liquid, the first wiping and cleaning action and the second wiping and cleaning action during a step of moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the maintenance position to the image formation position. Furthermore, it is also possible to carry out the application of the cleaning liquid, the first wiping and cleaning action and the second wiping and cleaning action during back and forth movement steps. For example, the application of the cleaning liquid is carried out during a step of moving the image formation position to the maintenance position, and the first wiping and cleaning action is carried out during a step of moving from the maintenance position to the image formation position. The second wiping and cleaning action is then carried out during a step of moving from the image formation position to the maintenance position. By this means, it is possible to shorten the cleaning time. In this case, the direction of travel of the wiping web <b>110</b> is switched appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Moreover, in the example described above, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by wrapping the wiping webs <b>110</b> about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> and pressing and abutting the pressing rollers <b>118</b> against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, but there are no particular restrictions on the device which presses and abuts the wiping webs <b>110</b> against of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">For example, it is possible to adopt a composition where a guide member having a circular arc-shaped guide surface is fixed to a main body frame, and a wiping web is pressed and abutted against the nozzle surface of the head by being wrapped about the guide surface of this guide member. Furthermore, if using a guide member that is not rotated in this way, the guide surface does not necessarily have to be a circular arc-shaped surface, and it is also possible to form a plate-shaped guide surface provided in parallel with the nozzle surface and to press and abut a wiping web wrapped about this guide surface against the nozzle surface of the head. By this means, it is possible to create face-to-face contact between the wiping web and the nozzle surface of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Furthermore, in the example described above, a wiping web <b>110</b> formed in a band shape is used, but the mode of the wiping member is not limited to this. It is also possible to use a wiping member which is in the form of a cloth. In this case also, a wiping member which changes the liquid absorption capability by changing orientation is used, and in the first action, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped using the orientation set to high liquid absorption capability, and in the second action, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped using the orientation set to low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Furthermore, in the example described above, the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web is switched between two levels, a high level and a low level, and the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned in two separate actions, but a composition can also be adopted in which the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web is switched in a greater number of levels, in such a manner that the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned in a plurality of separate actions. For example, it is possible to adopt a composition in which the liquid absorption capability can be switched between three levels (high, medium, low) by switching the direction of travel, and in such a manner that the nozzle surface of the head is wiped and cleaned in three separate actions. In this case, the nozzle surface of the head is wiped by switching the liquid absorption capability in such a manner that the liquid absorption capability reduces in a stepwise fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">In this case as well, it is also possible to carry out wiping a plurality of times at each of the respective levels. In other words, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surface of the head should be wiped and cleaned at least once in a state of high liquid absorption capability, and the nozzle surface of the head should be wiped and cleaned finally in a state of low liquid absorption capability.</p>

<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Head Cleaning Method</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Next, a cleaning method for a head using the head cleaner <b>1200</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">Similarly to the head cleaning apparatus of the first embodiment of the second mode described above, the cleaning of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is carried out by wiping respectively with a wiping web <b>110</b> after applying a cleaning liquid to the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. In a head cleaning apparatus which uses the head cleaner <b>1200</b> according to the present embodiment, the operation of wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs is carried out in two separate actions. More specifically, the first action (first cleaning step) involves wiping the nozzle surface using a first wiping web <b>110</b>L having a high liquid absorption capability and the second action (second cleaning step) involves wiping the nozzle surface using a second wiping web <b>110</b>R having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">In this way, by wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in two separate wiping actions, it is possible to prevent wiping traces and wiping omissions. More specifically, large liquid droplets present on the nozzle surface are removed, thereby preventing wiping omissions, by the first wiping action performed with the first wiping web <b>110</b>L in a state of high liquid absorption capability. In the subsequent second wiping action performed by the second wiping web <b>110</b>R in a state of low liquid absorption capability, the wiping traces produced by the first wiping action are removed, as well as preventing ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">Below, a specific cleaning method for the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K using the head cleaners <b>1200</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">Firstly, cleaning liquid is applied to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in order to dissolve the adhering material created by the ink which is adhering to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">The cleaning liquid is applied by moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the image formation position towards the maintenance position (or from the maintenance position towards the image formation position), as well as spraying cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K toward the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">When the application of the cleaning liquid has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned provisionally to the image formation position. Thereupon, a first wiping and cleaning action (first cleaning step) is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">As described above, this first wiping action is carried out by using first wiping webs <b>110</b>L having a high liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Firstly, the respective slide driving motors <b>1210</b> are driven and the sliding stages <b>202</b> are moved to the first position (if the sliding stages <b>202</b> are not already situated in the first position). By this means, the first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L are positioned over the path of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">Furthermore, in this case, if the unused region of the first wiping web <b>110</b>L has not been located in position, then positional location is carried out. When this positional location of the unused region has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed by a prescribed amount toward the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">As the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved toward the maintenance position, they are halted temporarily when the end portion on one side thereof (the end portion on the maintenance position side) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>. In this case, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the head cleaners <b>1200</b>C, <b>1200</b>M, <b>1200</b>Y and <b>1200</b>K are situated in the withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>1216</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position. By this means, the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L which are wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the respective first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">When the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, then the take-up motors <b>1120</b> of the first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L are driven. By this means, the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L are wound up respectively onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L which are wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L travel at a uniform speed of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Furthermore, simultaneously with this, the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position at a uniform speed of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">As a result of this, the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L are slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L travel in the direction opposite to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K by means of the traveling first wiping webs <b>110</b>L.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing rollers <b>118</b>. The travel of the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L is halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">By means of the above, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed. As described above, this first wiping and cleaning action involves wiping by using the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L having a high liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">When the first wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the elevator cylinders <b>1216</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L are moved to a withdrawn position. Furthermore, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned toward the image formation position. The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been returned toward the image formation position are halted when the end portion on the one side is situated at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b> of the first wiping web travel drive unit <b>123</b>L. Thereupon, a second wiping and cleaning action (second cleaning step) is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">Firstly, the wiping web used is switched. More specifically, the respective sliding drive motors <b>1210</b> are driven and the sliding stages <b>202</b> are moved to the second position. By this means, the second wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>R are positioned over the path of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">Furthermore, in this case, if the unused region of the second wiping web <b>110</b>R has not been located in position, then positional location of the second wiping web <b>110</b>R is carried out. When positional location of the unused region has been completed, the elevator cylinders <b>1216</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to the pressing position. By this means, the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R which are wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the respective second wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>R are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">When the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the second wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>R are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, then the take-up motors <b>1120</b> of the second wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>R are driven. By this means, the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R are wound up respectively onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R which are wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the second wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>R travel at a uniform speed of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">Furthermore, simultaneously with this, the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position at a uniform speed of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">As a result of this, the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R are slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R travel in the direction opposite to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K by means of the traveling second wiping webs <b>110</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing rollers <b>118</b>. The travel of the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R is halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">By means of the above, the second wiping and cleaning action is completed. As described above, this second wiping and cleaning action wipes the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R which have low liquid absorption capability, and therefore it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K without drawing ink out from the nozzles (without creating wiping traces). Furthermore, if wiping traces have occurred in the first wiping and cleaning action, it is possible to wipe away these traces effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">When the second wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed directly toward the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">On the other hand, in the head cleaners <b>1200</b>C, <b>1200</b>M, <b>1200</b>Y and <b>1200</b>K, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are disposed in the withdrawn position. After this, the head cleaners <b>1200</b>C, <b>1200</b>M, <b>1200</b>Y and <b>1200</b>K carry out location of an unused region of the wiping web for the next cleaning process, according to requirements. Furthermore, the sliding stages <b>202</b> are moved in such a manner that the first wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>L are respectively disposed above the path of movement of the heads <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">By means of the steps described above, the cleaning of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">As described above, in the present embodiment, the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web which wipes and cleans the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is switched and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned in two separate actions, whereby it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions, similarly to the first embodiment of the second mode which is described above.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">By using two wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities in this way, it is possible to increase the range of selection of the wiping webs which can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">In the present embodiment, the first wiping and cleaning action which is carried out using the first wiping webs <b>110</b>L is implemented just once, but it may also be carried out a plurality of times. In a similar fashion, the second wiping and cleaning action which is carried out using the second wiping webs <b>110</b>R may be carried out a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Furthermore, in the present example, the wiping webs are slid while traveling in both the first and second actions, but the wiping webs may also be slid in a halted state. By sliding the wiping webs while traveling as in the present example, it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by using a clean part of the web at all times. By this means, the cleaning effect can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">Furthermore, according to the present example, the wiping webs are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs to travel in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, but the wiping webs may also be pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while traveling in the same direction. By pressing and abutting the wiping webs against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs to travel in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, it is possible to raise the relative velocity of travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> with respect to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the cleaning effect can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Furthermore, in the example described above, the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped and cleaned in two separate actions by using two wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities, but it is also possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces of the heads in a plurality of separate actions by using a plurality of wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities. For example, it is possible to use three wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities (high, medium and low) in such a manner that the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped and cleaned in three separate actions. In this case, the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped by switching the wiping webs in such a manner that the liquid absorption capability reduces.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">In this case as well, it is also possible to carry out wiping a plurality of times at each of the respective levels. In other words, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surfaces of the head should be wiped and cleaned at least once with a wiping web having a high liquid absorption capability, and the nozzle surfaces of the head should be wiped and cleaned finally with a wiping web having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>

<p id="p-0420" num="0419">Next, a cleaning method for a head using the head cleaner <b>300</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">Similarly to the head cleaning apparatus of the first embodiment of the second mode described above, the cleaning of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is carried out by wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> after applying a cleaning liquid to the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. In a head cleaning apparatus which uses the head cleaner <b>1200</b> according to the present embodiment, the operation of wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs is carried out in two separate actions. More specifically, a first action (first cleaning step) involves wiping the nozzle surface using a forward wiping web <b>110</b>M having a high liquid absorption capability and a second action (second cleaning step) involves wiping the nozzle surface using a rearward wiping web <b>110</b>N having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">In this way, by wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in two separate wiping actions, it is possible to prevent wiping traces and wiping omissions. More specifically, large liquid droplets present on the nozzle surface are removed, thereby preventing wiping omissions, by the first wiping action which is performed with the forward wiping web <b>110</b>M having high liquid absorption capability. In the subsequent second wiping action which is performed with the rearward wiping web <b>110</b>N having low liquid absorption capability, the wiping trace produced by the first wiping action is removed, as well as preventing ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">Below, a specific cleaning method for the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K using the head cleaner <b>300</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">Firstly, cleaning liquid is applied to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in order to dissolve the adhering material created by the ink which is adhering to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">The cleaning liquid is applied by moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the image formation position towards the maintenance position (or from the maintenance position towards the image formation position), as well as spraying cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K toward the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">When the application of the cleaning liquid has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned provisionally to the image formation position. Thereupon, a first wiping and cleaning action (first cleaning step) is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">As described above, this first wiping action is carried out by using the forward wiping web <b>110</b>M which has a high liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">Firstly, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved through a prescribed amount towards the maintenance position.

<p id="p-0433" num="0432">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing rollers <b>118</b>. The travel of the forward wiping webs <b>110</b>M is halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">By means of the above, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed.

<p id="p-0435" num="0434">When the first wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the elevator cylinders <b>302</b>M of the forward wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>M are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the forward wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>M are thereby moved to a withdrawn position. Furthermore, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned toward the image formation position.

<p id="p-0449" num="0448">Furthermore, according to the present example, the wiping webs are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs to travel in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, but the wiping webs may also be pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while traveling in the same direction. By pressing and abutting the wiping webs against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs to travel in the opposite direction with respect to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, it is possible to raise the relative velocity of travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> with respect to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">Furthermore, in the example described above, the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped and cleaned in two separate actions by using two wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities, but it is also possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces of the heads in a plurality of separate actions by using a plurality of wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities. For example, it is possible to use three wiping webs having different liquid absorption capabilities (high, medium and low) in such a manner that the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped and cleaned in three separate actions. In this case, the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped by switching the wiping webs in such a manner that the liquid absorption capability reduces in a stepwise fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">In this case as well, it is also possible to carry out wiping a plurality of times at each of the respective levels. In other words, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surfaces of the heads should each be wiped and cleaned at least once with a wiping web having a high liquid absorption capability, and the nozzle surface of the head should be wiped and cleaned finally with a wiping web having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">Furthermore, in the example described above, the forward wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>M and the rearward wiping web travel drive units <b>123</b>N are raised and lowered respectively and independently, but they may also be raised and lowered simultaneously. By this means, the wiping and cleaning action using the forward wiping web <b>110</b>M and the wiping and cleaning action using the rearward wiping web <b>110</b>N can be carried out simultaneously.</p>

<p id="p-0453" num="0452"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a front view diagram of a fourth embodiment of a head cleaner according to the second mode.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">The head cleaner <b>400</b> (<b>400</b>C, <b>400</b>M, <b>400</b>Y and <b>400</b>K) according to the present embodiment also wipes and cleans the nozzle surface of the head in two separate actions, by switching the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">The head cleaner <b>400</b> according to the present embodiment switches the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web by depositing liquid onto the wiping web. For this purpose, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the head cleaner <b>400</b> according to the present embodiment comprises a liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b> for depositing cleaning liquid onto the wiping web <b>402</b>. Apart from the fact that this liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b> is provided, this head cleaner is the same as the head cleaner <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment of the second mode which is described above. Consequently, only the liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b> is described here.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b> is disposed between the pay-out guide roller <b>134</b> and the pressing roller <b>118</b>. The liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b> has a spray port corresponding to the width of the wiping web <b>402</b>, and wets the wiping web <b>402</b> by spraying liquid onto the wiping web <b>402</b> as the web travels between the pay-out guide roller <b>134</b> and the pressing roller <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">The liquid is supplied from a liquid tank <b>414</b> via a liquid supply pipe <b>412</b> which is connected to the liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b>, and by driving a liquid spray pump <b>416</b> which is provided at an intermediate point of the liquid supply pipe <b>412</b>, the liquid is sprayed from the liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">The object of the liquid is to reduce the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web <b>402</b>, and the type of liquid is therefore not limited in particular, provided that the liquid satisfies this object. Consequently, it is also possible to deposit a cleaning liquid, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">Furthermore, the wiping web <b>402</b> used does not necessarily have to be one which switches liquid absorption capability depending on the direction of sliding, as in the wiping web <b>110</b> according to the first embodiment of the second mode which is described above.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Head Cleaning Method</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">Next, a cleaning method for a head using the head cleaner according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">The fact of switching the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web and wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in two separate actions is the same as the first embodiment of the second mode which is described previously. In the present embodiment, the first action (first cleaning step) involves wiping with a wiping web in a normal state (a wiping web having high liquid absorption capability which does not produce wiping traces when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped) and the second action (second cleaning step) involves wiping with a wiping web in a state of reduced liquid absorption capability by previously depositing liquid (a wiping web in a state of reduced liquid absorption capability to a level which avoids drawing out of ink from the nozzles even when the nozzle surface of the head is wiped). More specifically, the wiping procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">Firstly, the non-wet region of the wiping web is located in position. When the respective non-wet regions have been located in position, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved towards the maintenance position. As the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved toward the maintenance position, they are halted temporarily when the end portion on one side thereof (the end portion on the maintenance position side) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>. In this case, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> of the cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K are situated in a prescribed withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position. As a result of this, the wiping webs <b>402</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>1120</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>402</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. The wiping webs <b>402</b> are slid in contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing rollers <b>118</b>. The travel of the wiping webs <b>402</b> is also halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By this means, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">When the first wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are withdrawn temporarily to the withdrawn position. Furthermore, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned in such a manner that the end portion on one side thereof is disposed at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">When the end portion on one side of each of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is situated at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>118</b>, then the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are moved to a pressing position and the wiping webs <b>402</b> which are wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>1120</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>402</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven to convey the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. Furthermore, simultaneously with this, the respective liquid spray pumps <b>416</b> are driven and liquid is sprayed toward the wiping webs <b>402</b> from the liquid deposition nozzles <b>410</b>. By this means, liquid is deposited on the wiping webs <b>402</b> before they are wrapped about the respective pressing rollers <b>118</b>, thereby forcibly reducing the liquid absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>402</b> before wrapping about the pressing rollers <b>118</b>. Thereupon, by wrapping the wiping webs <b>402</b> about the take-up reels <b>116</b> while spraying liquid toward the wiping webs <b>402</b> from liquid deposition nozzles <b>410</b> in this way, the wetted wiping webs <b>402</b> onto which liquid has previously been deposited are slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are thereby wiped and cleaned by the wetted wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">In this way, the second wiping and cleaning action is carried out using wiping webs <b>402</b> which have been wetted by depositing liquid thereon, in other words, wiping webs <b>402</b> of which the liquid absorption capability has been forcibly reduced. By using wetted wiping webs <b>402</b> to perform the second wiping and cleaning action in this way, it is possible effectively to remove any wiping traces which may have occurred during the first wiping and cleaning action. Furthermore, by using wetted wiping webs <b>402</b> to perform the second wiping and cleaning action in this way, it is possible to prevent ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes by the wiping action.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469">In each of the respective head cleaners <b>400</b>C, <b>400</b>M, <b>400</b>Y and <b>400</b>K, the travel of the wiping web <b>402</b> is halted when the other side end portion of the head <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K passes the pressing roller <b>118</b>. Furthermore, the driving of the liquid spray pump <b>416</b> is also halted simultaneously with this.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, on the other hand, are moved directly towards the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">In the head cleaners <b>400</b>C, <b>400</b>M, <b>400</b>Y and <b>400</b>K, after halting the travel of the wiping webs <b>402</b>, the pressing rollers <b>118</b> are withdrawn to the withdrawn position, thereby ending the cleaning operation.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">After this, the head cleaners <b>400</b>C, <b>400</b>M, <b>400</b>Y and <b>400</b>K carry out location of an unused region for the next cleaning process, according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">As described above, in the present embodiment, after first wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with wiping webs <b>402</b> in a state of high liquid absorption capability, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned with wiping webs <b>402</b> in a state of low liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions. Furthermore, by switching the absorption capability through wetting the wiping webs <b>402</b> in this way, it is possible to increase the range of choice of the wiping web that can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">In the present embodiment, the wiping web <b>402</b> is wetted by depositing liquid onto the wiping web <b>402</b> from a liquid deposition nozzle <b>410</b> provided in the main body frame <b>112</b>, but the method of wetting the wiping web <b>402</b> is not limited in particular to this method. For example, it is also possible to wet the wiping web <b>402</b> by causing the wiping web <b>402</b> to absorb cleaning liquid which has been deposited onto the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b> (and in particular, cleaning liquid deposited onto the portions where nozzles are not formed). In this case, the wiping web <b>402</b> is used by winding the web back by a prescribed amount.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surfaces of the heads are wiped in two separate actions, but it is also possible to perform a plurality of separate wiping actions, by changing the liquid absorption capability of the wiping webs in a stepwise fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">In this case as well, it is also possible to carry out wiping a plurality of times at each of the respective levels. In other words, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surfaces of the heads should be wiped and cleaned at least once with a wiping web in a state of high liquid absorption capability, and the nozzle surfaces of the heads should be wiped and cleaned finally with a wiping web in a state of low liquid absorption capability.</p>

More specifically, the wiping procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">Firstly, cleaning liquid is applied to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in order to dissolve the adhering material created by the ink which is adhering to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">The cleaning liquid is applied by moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the image formation position towards the maintenance position (or from the maintenance position towards the image formation position), as well as spraying cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K toward the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">When the application of cleaning liquid has been completed, a first wiping and cleaning action is carried out. As described above, this first wiping action is carried out using a wiping web in a state of high absorption capability. More specifically, the first wiping action is carried out using a wiping web <b>502</b> in a state of high suctioning force by suctioning via the pressing roller <b>510</b>. More specifically, the procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0503">Firstly, an unused region of the wiping web is located in position. More specifically, the wiping web <b>502</b> is located in position in such a manner that an unused region of the wiping web <b>502</b> is wrapped about the pressing roller <b>510</b>. This step is carried out on the basis of the output from the used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> and is performed by winding the wiping web <b>502</b> onto the take-up reel <b>116</b> until the wet region ceases to be determined by the used region determination sensor <b>1122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">When the positional location of the unused region has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position, and the traveling wiping webs <b>502</b> are pressed against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been sent to the maintenance position, thereby wiping and cleaning the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. More specifically, the procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505">Firstly, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved towards the maintenance position. As the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved toward the maintenance position, they are halted temporarily when the end portion on one side thereof (the end portion on the maintenance position side) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>510</b>. In this case, the pressing rollers <b>510</b> of the cleaners <b>500</b>C, <b>500</b>M, <b>500</b>Y and <b>500</b>K are situated in a prescribed withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0506">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>510</b> are moved to a pressing position. By this means, the wiping webs <b>502</b> wrapped about the respective pressing rollers <b>510</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="0507">When the respective wiping webs <b>502</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>510</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, the suction pumps <b>524</b> are driven and the air inside the pressing rollers <b>510</b> is suctioned by a prescribed suctioning force. As a result of this, the interior of each pressing roller <b>510</b> is set to a negative pressure, and the wiping webs <b>502</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>510</b> (the wiping webs which are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K) are suctioned with a prescribed suctioning force.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="0508">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>1120</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>502</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven to convey the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. As a result of this, the wiping webs <b>502</b> are slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0509">In this case, the wiping webs <b>502</b> travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the relative differential velocity, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0510">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>510</b>. The travel of the wiping webs <b>502</b> and the suctioning of air are also halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0511">By means of the above, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed. As described above, the first wiping and cleaning action is carried out while suctioning the wiping webs <b>502</b> and therefore it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with wiping webs <b>502</b> in a state of high liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0512">When the first wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>510</b> are moved to a withdrawn position. Furthermore, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned toward the image formation position. The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been returned toward the image formation position are halted when the end portion on the one side is situated at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>510</b>. Thereupon, a second wiping and cleaning action is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0513">Firstly, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>510</b> are moved to a pressing position. By this means, the wiping webs <b>502</b> wrapped about the respective pressing rollers <b>510</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0514">When the respective wiping webs <b>502</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>510</b> have been pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, the take-up motors <b>1120</b> are driven and the wiping webs <b>502</b> are wound up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed. Accordingly, the wiping webs <b>502</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>510</b> (namely, the wiping webs which are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K) travel toward the take-up reels <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">Furthermore, simultaneously with the driving of the take-up motors <b>1120</b>, the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position at a uniform speed. As a result of this, the wiping webs <b>502</b> are slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">Furthermore, in contrast to the first wiping and cleaning action, in this second wiping and cleaning action, the wiping webs <b>502</b> are slid over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K without suctioning the webs. By this means, it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by using wiping webs <b>502</b> having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side arrives at the installation position of the pressing rollers <b>510</b>. The travel of the wiping webs <b>502</b> is halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0518">By means of the above, the second wiping and cleaning action is completed. As described above, the second wiping and cleaning action is carried out without suctioning the wiping webs <b>502</b> and therefore it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with wiping webs <b>502</b> in a state of low liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K without drawing out ink from the nozzles (without the occurrence of wiping traces). Furthermore, if wiping traces have occurred in the first wiping and cleaning action, it is possible to wipe away these traces effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0519">When the second wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed directly toward the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0520">On the other hand, in the head cleaners <b>500</b>C, <b>500</b>M, <b>500</b>Y and <b>500</b>K, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>510</b> are disposed in the withdrawn position. After this, the head cleaners <b>500</b>C, <b>500</b>M, <b>500</b>Y and <b>500</b>K carry out location of an unused region for the next cleaning process, according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0521">By means of the steps described above, the cleaning of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0522">As described previously, in the present embodiment, the liquid absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>502</b> which wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is switched and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned in two separate actions. More specifically, in a first action, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned with wiping webs <b>502</b> in a state of high absorption capability by suctioning the wiping webs <b>502</b>, and in a second action, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned with wiping webs <b>502</b> in a state of low absorption capability by not suctioning the wiping webs <b>502</b>. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0523">Furthermore, by switching the suctioning force of the wiping webs <b>502</b> by suctioning in this way, it is possible to increase the range of selection of the wiping web which can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0524">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surfaces are wiped in two separate actions, but it is also possible to perform a plurality of wiping actions by switching the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web in a stepwise fashion. In this case, the suctioning force of the wiping web <b>502</b> by the pressing roller <b>520</b> is switched in a stepwise fashion, whereby the liquid absorption capability of the wiping web is switched in a stepwise fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0525">In this case as well, it is also possible to carry out wiping a plurality of times at each of the respective levels. In other words, in the present embodiment, the nozzle surfaces of the head should be wiped and cleaned at least once with a wiping web having a high liquid absorption capability, and the nozzle surfaces of the heads should be wiped and cleaned finally with a wiping web having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0526">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the liquid absorption capability is adjusted by controlling the suctioning force from the pressing holes, and therefore it is desirable that the absorption capacity of the wiping web itself should be low (this is because if the absorption capacity is high, then wiping traces will occur in the second wiping action).</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Other Embodiments of Second Mode</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0527">Furthermore, the head cleaners according to the present embodiment respectively comprise a used region determination sensor <b>1122</b>, but this used region determination sensor <b>1122</b> does not necessarily have to be provided, and it is also possible to locate the wiping web in a desired position by controlling the amount of winding out and winding back of the wiping web. By providing used region determination sensors <b>1122</b>, it is possible to achieve accurate positional location, as well as being able to determine the presence or absence of the wiping webs.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">Moreover, in the present example, in order to dissolve the adhering material caused by the ink, cleaning liquid is applied previously to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in order to wet the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, but there are no particular restrictions on the method of wetting the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. For example, it is also possible to use ink as a wetting liquid. In this case, ink is caused to seep out from the nozzles formed on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, so as to wet the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. Furthermore, in this case, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are sealed with a cap, the internal pressure of the cap is reduced, and the ink is suctioned onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K and thus caused to seep out from the nozzles. Alternatively, the ink is caused to seep out onto the nozzle surfaces by applying pressure to the flow channels from the ink tanks to the heads.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0529">Furthermore, in the series of embodiments described above, a case where the nozzle surface of a line head is wiped and cleaned is described, but the application of the present invention is not limited to this. The invention can also be applied similarly to a case of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of a so-called shuttle scanning type of head.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">In the series of embodiments described above, the heads are moved so as to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces of the heads, but it is also possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces of the heads by moving the head cleaning apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">Third Mode</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0531">Next, desirable embodiments of a third mode of the present invention will be described. Explanation for elements that are the same as or similar to those in the first mode and the second mode described above is omitted in the third mode.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0532">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, nozzle rows <b>32</b> are formed in the lengthwise direction of the head <b>16</b> in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> (<b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K) of the head <b>16</b> (<b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K).</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0533">Each of the heads <b>16</b> which are installed on a head supporting frame <b>40</b> is disposed with the nozzle rows <b>32</b> which are formed in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> arranged perpendicularly with respect to the direction of conveyance of the paper <b>12</b>. Ink droplets are ejected perpendicularly from the nozzle rows <b>32</b> formed in the nozzle surface <b>30</b> toward the outer circumferential surface of the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0534">In the example of the head <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, nozzles rows <b>32</b> are formed by arranging nozzles <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, . . . in a staggered matrix configuration on the nozzle surface <b>30</b>. By adopting an arrangement of this kind for the nozzles <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, . . . , it is possible to reduce the effective pitch between the nozzles <b>34</b> as projected to the lengthwise direction of the head <b>16</b> (namely, a direction perpendicular to the conveyance direction of the paper; in other words, the breadthways direction of the paper), and therefore a high-density configuration of the nozzles <b>34</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0535">The head supporting frame <b>40</b> where the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are installed is provided movably in a direction parallel to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation unit <b>14</b> (namely, in the lengthwise direction of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K installed thereon) and is composed in such a manner that the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K can be withdrawn to a prescribed maintenance position. This point is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0536">The image formation unit <b>10</b> has the composition described above. In this image formation unit <b>10</b>, paper <b>12</b> is received onto the image formation drum <b>14</b> from a previous step via the conveyance drum <b>26</b>, and is conveyed in rotation while being held by suction on the circumferential surface of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. The paper <b>12</b> passes below the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K during this conveyance and ink droplets are ejected from the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K onto the recording surface of the paper as the paper passes, thereby forming a color image on the recording surface. After having completed image recording, the paper <b>12</b> is transferred from the image formation drum <b>14</b> to the conveyance drum <b>28</b> and is conveyed to a subsequent step.</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">The driving of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (ink ejection) and the driving of the image formation unit <b>14</b>, and the like, are controlled by a system controller, which is not illustrated. This system controller performs overall control of the operations of the whole inkjet recording apparatus and controls the driving of the respective units in accordance with a prescribed control program.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Movement Mechanism of Head Supporting Frame</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0538">As described above, the head supporting frame <b>40</b> is provided movably in the direction parallel to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b>. Below, the movement mechanism of the head supporting frame <b>40</b> will be described.</p>

The head supporting frame <b>40</b> slides in a direction parallel to the rotating shaft <b>18</b> of the image formation drum <b>14</b> by sliding along the guide rails <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0541" num="0540">Furthermore, a nut section <b>56</b> which screws onto a screw bar <b>54</b> is coupled to the head supporting frame <b>40</b>. The screw bar <b>54</b> is arranged in parallel with the guide rail <b>50</b> and the respective end portions thereof are supported rotatably on bearings <b>58</b>, <b>58</b> which are provided in the main body frame of the inkjet recording apparatus. A head feed motor <b>60</b> is coupled to this screw bar <b>54</b>, which is driven to rotate by the head feed motor <b>60</b>. The head supporting frame <b>40</b> slides along the guide rails <b>50</b>, <b>50</b> by driving the head feed motor <b>60</b> and turning the screw bar <b>54</b>. In other words, the head supporting frame <b>40</b> slides in a direction parallel to the axis of rotation of the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0541">A system controller, which is not illustrated, causes the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K to move from a prescribed image formation position to a maintenance position by controlling the driving of the head feed motor <b>60</b> and controlling the movement of the head supporting frame <b>40</b>. Alternatively, the heads are moved from the maintenance position to the image formation position.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0542">When disposed in the image formation position, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are arranged about the periphery of the image formation drum <b>14</b>, as indicated by the solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and are able to record an image onto paper <b>12</b> conveyed in rotation by the image formation drum <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0543">On the other hand, when the heads are disposed in the maintenance position, as indicated by the dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, then the heads are withdrawn from the periphery of the image formation drum <b>14</b>.

The wiping web <b>110</b> is installed on the head cleaner <b>100</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0593" num="0592">Firstly, the winding core <b>110</b>A on the pay-out side is installed on the pay-out reel <b>114</b>. The wiping web <b>110</b> installed on the pay-out reel <b>114</b> is paid out a small amount at a time and wrapped in sequence about the pay-out guide roller <b>134</b>, the pressing roller <b>2200</b> and the take-up guide roller <b>138</b>, and the winding core on the front end (the take-up side winding core) <b>110</b>B is installed on the take-up reel <b>116</b>. By this means, the wiping web <b>110</b> is installed on the head cleaner <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0594" num="0593">The head cleaner <b>100</b> on which the wiping web <b>110</b> is installed winds the wiping web <b>110</b> up from the pay-out reel <b>114</b> to the take-up reel <b>116</b> by driving the winding motor <b>122</b> to rotate. By this means, the wiping web <b>110</b> which is wrapped about the pressing roller <b>2200</b> is caused to travel.</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="0594">The wiping web <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing roller <b>2200</b> travels in parallel with the direction of movement of the head <b>16</b>, and travels in the opposite direction when the head <b>16</b> is moved from the image formation position to the maintenance position. Furthermore, the wiping web <b>110</b> travels in the same direction when the head <b>16</b> is moved from the maintenance position to the image formation position.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0595">The system controller cleans the nozzle surface <b>30</b> of the head <b>16</b>, by controlling the driving of the wind-back motor <b>120</b>, the take-up motor <b>122</b>, the elevator cylinder <b>126</b> and the head feed motor <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Head Cleaning Method</p>
<p id="p-0597" num="0596">Next, a cleaning method for a head using the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0597">The cleaning of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is carried out by wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> after applying a cleaning liquid to the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. In the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> of the present embodiment, the operation of wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with the wiping webs <b>110</b> is carried out in two separate actions. More specifically, a first action involves wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of high liquid absorption capability by suctioning the wiping web <b>110</b> by the pressing roller <b>2200</b>, and a second action involves wiping with a wiping web <b>110</b> in state of low liquid absorption capability by weakening the suctioning force used to suction the wiping web <b>110</b>, or by not suctioning the wiping web <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0599" num="0598">In this way, by wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in two separate wiping actions, it is possible to prevent wiping traces and wiping omissions. More specifically, large liquid droplets present on the nozzle surface are removed, thereby preventing wiping omissions, by the first wiping action performed with the wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of high liquid absorption capability. In the subsequent second wiping action performed with the wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of low liquid absorption capability, the wiping traces produced by the first wiping action are removed, as well as preventing ink from being drawn out from the nozzle holes. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0600" num="0599">Below, a specific cleaning method for the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K using the head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0601" num="0600">Firstly, cleaning liquid is applied to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in order to dissolve the adhering material created by the ink which is adhering to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="0601">The cleaning liquid is applied by moving the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K from the image formation position towards the maintenance position (or from the maintenance position towards the image formation position), as well as spraying cleaning liquid from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K toward the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. More specifically, the procedure is as follows. When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved from the image formation position toward the maintenance position, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K pass over the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K and therefore cleaning liquid is sprayed from the cleaning liquid application nozzles <b>80</b>C, <b>80</b>M, <b>80</b>Y and <b>80</b>K in coordination with the passage of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By this means, cleaning liquid is applied to the whole area of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, including the nozzle free regions.</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0602">The application of cleaning liquid may be carried out once, or a plurality of times. If cleaning liquid is applied a plurality of times, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved back and forth a plurality of times during application.</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0603">When the application of the cleaning liquid has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned temporarily to the image formation position. Thereupon, a first wiping and cleaning action (first cleaning step) is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0604">As described above, this first wiping action is carried out using a wiping web in a state of high absorption capability. In other words, wiping is carried out by using a wiping web <b>110</b> in a state of raised absorption capability, by suctioning the air inside the pressing roller <b>2200</b> and setting the interior of the pressing roller <b>2200</b> to a negative pressure. More specifically, the procedure is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0606" num="0605">Firstly, an unused region of the wiping web is located in position. In other words, the wiping web <b>110</b> is located in position in such a manner that the unused region of the wiping web <b>110</b> is wrapped about the pressing roller <b>118</b>. This step is carried out on the basis of the output from the used region determination sensor <b>124</b> and is performed by winding the wiping web <b>110</b> onto the take-up reel <b>116</b> until the wet region ceases to be determined by the used region determination sensor <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0607" num="0606">When this positional location of the unused region has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position. As the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved toward the maintenance position, they are halted temporarily when the end portion on one side thereof (the end portion on the maintenance position side) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>2200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38A</figref>. In this case, the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> of the cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K are situated in a prescribed withdrawn position.</p>
<p id="p-0608" num="0607">When the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are halted, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are moved to a pressing position. By this means, the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref>)).</p>
<p id="p-0609" num="0608">When the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, the suction pumps <b>2214</b> are driven, the air inside the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> is suctioned and the interiors of the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are set to a negative pressure. As a result of this, the wiping webs wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> (namely, the wiping webs which are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K) are suctioned with a prescribed suctioning force.</p>
<p id="p-0610" num="0609">Thereupon, the take-up motors <b>122</b> are driven, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed, and the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed at a uniform speed toward the maintenance position. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38C</figref>, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are slid in contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0611" num="0610">In this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the relative differential velocity, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0612" num="0611">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side (the end portion on the side of the image formation position) arrives at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>2200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38D</figref>. The travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> and the suctioning of air are also halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0612">By means of the above, the first wiping and cleaning action is completed. As described above, the first wiping and cleaning action is carried out while suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b> and therefore it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with wiping webs <b>110</b> in a state of high liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0614" num="0613">When the first wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are moved to a withdrawn position. Furthermore, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are returned toward the image formation position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38E</figref>, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been returned toward the image formation position are halted when the end portion on the one side is situated at the installation position of the pressing roller <b>2200</b>. When this conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K has been halted, the second wiping and cleaning action is started.</p>
<p id="p-0615" num="0614">Firstly, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are moved to a pressing position. By this means, the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the respective pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0616" num="0615">When the respective wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, the take-up motors <b>122</b> are driven and the wiping webs <b>110</b> are wound up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b> at a uniform speed. Accordingly, the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped about the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> (namely, the wiping webs which are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K) travel toward the take-up reels <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0616">Furthermore, simultaneously with the driving of the take-up motors <b>122</b>, the head feed motor <b>60</b> is driven and the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed toward the maintenance position at a uniform speed. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38F</figref>, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are slid in contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are wiped and cleaned by the traveling wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0617">In this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Accordingly, it is possible to increase the relative differential velocity, and the cleaning effect can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0618">Furthermore, in contrast to the first wiping and cleaning action, this second wiping and cleaning action is carried out without suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b>. By this means, it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by using wiping webs <b>110</b> having a low liquid absorption capability.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0619">The heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which have been conveyed to the maintenance position are halted when the end portion on the other side arrives at the installation position of the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38D</figref>). The travel of the wiping webs <b>110</b> is halted in synchronism with the halting of the conveyance of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0620">By means of the above, the second wiping and cleaning action is completed. As described above, the second wiping and cleaning action is carried out without suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b> and therefore it is possible to wipe the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K with wiping webs <b>110</b> in a state of low liquid absorption capability. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K without drawing out ink from the nozzles (without the occurrence of wiping traces). Furthermore, if wiping traces have occurred in the first wiping and cleaning action, it is possible to wipe away these traces effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0622" num="0621">When the second wiping and cleaning action has been completed, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are conveyed directly toward the maintenance position.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0622">On the other hand, in the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K, the elevator cylinders <b>126</b> are driven and the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> are disposed in the withdrawn position. After this, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K carry out location of an unused region for the next cleaning process, according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0624" num="0623">By means of the steps described above, the cleaning of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0625" num="0624">As described above, in a head cleaning apparatus <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment, the absorption capability of the wiping webs <b>110</b> which wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K is switched and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned in two separate actions. More specifically, in a first action, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned with wiping webs <b>110</b> in a state of high absorption capability by suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b>, and in a second action, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned with wiping webs <b>110</b> in a state of low absorption capability by not suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b>. By this means, it is possible to clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K without the occurrence of wiping traces or wiping omissions.</p>
<p id="p-0626" num="0625">Furthermore, it is possible to increase the range of selection of the wiping web which can be used, by switching the absorption capability of the wiping web <b>110</b> by suctioning in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0627" num="0626">In the present embodiment, the first wiping and cleaning action which is carried out while suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b> is implemented just once, but this first action may also be carried out a plurality of times. In this case, the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are moved back and forth a plurality of times, while the wiping webs <b>110</b> in a suctioned state remain pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. Similarly, the second wiping and cleaning action, which is performed without suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b>, may also be carried out a plurality of times.</p>
<p id="p-0628" num="0627">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, when carrying out the second wiping and cleaning action, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are not suctioned, but this action may also be carried out while suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b>. More specifically, the second wiping and cleaning action may be carried out by pressing and abutting the wiping webs <b>110</b> against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while suctioning the wiping webs <b>110</b> with a suctioning force of a level which avoids drawing out ink from the nozzles. Therefore, in this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> must necessarily be suctioned by setting the suctioning force to a weaker force than that during the first wiping and cleaning action.</p>
<p id="p-0629" num="0628">Desirably, the suctioning forces applied to the wiping webs <b>110</b> in the first and second actions are set by carrying out a wiping test in advance, and setting a suctioning force of a level which avoids the occurrence of wiping omissions for the first action, and setting a suctioning force of a level which avoids drawing out of ink from the nozzles for the second action.</p>
<p id="p-0630" num="0629">Furthermore, the liquid absorption capability during wiping is adjusted by controlling the suctioning force from the pressing holes, and therefore it is desirable that the inherent absorption capacity of the wiping web should be low (this is because if the absorption capacity is high, then wiping traces will occur in the second wiping action). The required absorption capacity varies depending on the properties of the ink and the nozzle diameter, but in the present embodiment, a value of 100 mm or less according to the JISL1018 Byreck method is considered suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0631" num="0630">Furthermore, similarly to the setting of the suctioning force, the wiping webs used may also be selected by carrying out a wiping test in advance and using a web having an absorption capability of a level which avoids drawing ink out from the nozzles when the nozzle surface is wiped without suctioning via the suction holes.</p>
<p id="p-0632" num="0631">Furthermore, in the present example, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are made to travel in the opposite direction to the direction of movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K when carrying out the second wiping and cleaning action using reduced absorption capability, but this wiping and cleaning action may also be carried out with the webs traveling in the same direction as the heads. In this case, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K which are moving toward the maintenance position, while the wiping webs <b>110</b> are taken up onto the take-up reels <b>116</b>. By this means, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K while causing the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel in the same direction as the movement of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0633" num="0632">Furthermore, it is also possible to carry out two wiping and cleaning actions by pressing and abutting the wiping webs <b>110</b> against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K in a state where the wiping webs <b>110</b> have been halted and are not traveling.</p>

<p id="p-0634" num="0633">In the embodiment described above, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned in two actions by switching the suctioning force applied to the wiping webs <b>110</b>, but it is also possible to complete wiping and cleaning in one action by optimizing the suctioning force applied to the wiping webs <b>110</b>. More specifically, by adjusting the suctioning force applied to the wiping webs <b>110</b> in accordance with the diameter of the nozzles formed in the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K and the properties of the ink, and the like, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K can be cleaned while preventing both wiping omissions and wiping traces, in a single wiping and cleaning action. In this case, a wiping test is carried out previously and the suctioning force applied to the wiping webs <b>110</b> is optimized (the suctioning force is set to a level which prevents the occurrence of wiping omissions and wiping traces by means of a single wiping and cleaning action).</p>
<p id="p-0635" num="0634">This optimization of the suctioning force applied to the wiping webs <b>110</b> is premised on the inclusion of a high-performance suction pump which is capable of adjusting the suctioning force with a high degree of accuracy. On the other hand, by adopting a composition in which the wiping and cleaning is carried out a plurality of times by switching the suctioning force, it is possible to set and control the suctioning capacity of the suction pump in an approximate fashion, and therefore costs can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0636" num="0635">Moreover, in the embodiment described above, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by wrapping the wiping webs <b>110</b> about the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> and pressing and abutting the pressing rollers <b>2200</b> against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, but there are no particular restrictions on the device which presses and abuts the wiping webs <b>110</b> against of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0636">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, it is also possible to adopt a composition in which each wiping web <b>110</b> is wrapped about a circular arc-shaped guide surface <b>2302</b> formed on a guide member <b>2300</b> fixed to the main body frame <b>112</b>, and by pressing and abutting the guide members <b>2300</b> against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. In this case also, a plurality of suction holes are formed in the circular arc-shaped guide surface <b>2302</b> of the guide member <b>2300</b>, in such a manner that the wiping webs <b>110</b> wrapped thereabout can be suctioned. Furthermore, the guide surfaces <b>2302</b> are coated with an elastic body.</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0637">If the wiping webs <b>110</b> are each wrapped about a guide member <b>2300</b> which does not rotate in this way, then when the wiping webs <b>110</b> are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K, the guide member <b>2300</b> does not need to have a double-tube structure and therefore the composition can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0638">Furthermore, if using a guide member that is not rotated in this way, the guide surface does not necessarily have to be a circular arc-shaped surface, and it is also possible to form a plate-shaped guide surface provided in parallel with each of the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K and to press and abut a wiping web <b>110</b> wrapped about this guide surface respectively against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. By this means, the wiping webs <b>110</b> can be caused to make face-to-face contact with the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0640" num="0639">Furthermore, in the embodiment described above, wiping webs <b>110</b> formed in a band-shape are used and are pressed and abutted against the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K while causing the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel, but the mode of the wiping members used is not limited to this. It is also possible to adopt a composition in which the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned by sliding wiping members formed in a cloth shape over the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K. In this case also, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned while suctioning the wiping members in a first wiping action, and the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K are wiped and cleaned while suctioning the wiping members at a weaker suctioning force than in the first action, or without suctioning the wiping members, in a second wiping action.</p>
<p id="p-0641" num="0640">By wiping the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by using wiping webs <b>110</b> formed in a band shape and while causing the wiping webs <b>110</b> to travel, it is possible to wipe and clean the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K of the heads <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>M, <b>16</b>Y and <b>16</b>K by using a clean part of the web at all times, and therefore the cleaning effect can be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0641">Furthermore, the head cleaners <b>100</b>C, <b>100</b>M, <b>100</b>Y and <b>100</b>K according to the present embodiment respectively comprise a used region determination sensor <b>124</b>, but this used region determination sensor <b>124</b> does not necessarily have to be provided, and it is also possible to locate the wiping web <b>110</b> in a desired position by controlling the amount of winding out and winding back of the wiping web <b>110</b>. By providing used region determination sensors <b>124</b>, it is possible to achieve accurate positional location, as well as being able to determine the presence or absence of the wiping webs <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0642">Moreover, in the present example, in order to dissolve the adhering material caused by the ink, cleaning liquid is applied previously to the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K in order to wet the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, but there are no particular restrictions on the method of wetting the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. For example, it is also possible to use ink as a wetting liquid. In this case, ink is caused to seep out from the nozzles formed on the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K, so as to wet the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K. Furthermore, in this case, the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K are sealed with a cap, the internal pressure of the cap is reduced, and the ink is suctioned onto the nozzle surfaces <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>M, <b>30</b>Y and <b>30</b>K and thus caused to seep out from the nozzles. Alternatively, the ink is caused to seep out onto the nozzle surfaces by applying pressure to the flow channels from the ink tanks to the heads.</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0643">Furthermore, in the series of embodiments described above, a case where the nozzle surface of a line head is wiped and cleaned is described, but the application of the present invention is not limited to this. The invention can also be applied similarly to a case of wiping and cleaning the nozzle surface of a so-called shuttle scanning type of head.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0644">It should be understood that there is no intention to limit the invention to the specific forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, alternate constructions and equivalents falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.</p>
