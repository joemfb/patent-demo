<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of heat engines have been designed that perform useful work by extracting a portion of the energy that exists in a heat source relative to an environment. In a general sense, these engines often convert the microscopic kinetic energy of molecules to a macroscopic form of energy that can be utilized to perform work, such as moving a vehicle, pumping water, or rotating the armature of an electric generator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One engine, the reciprocating steam engine, was used in early automobiles and locomotives because of the simplicity of design, flat torque curve, and multiple fuel capability. Such steam engines were inefficient and may have only had an efficiency of 8-10%. Therefore, internal combustion engines superseded steam engines because of their better thermodynamic efficiency and ease of use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Internal combustion engines have provided good service as prime movers for transportation and auxiliary power sources, however, they have significant weaknesses. For example such engines are noisy, polluting, have narrow speed/torque characteristics, have stringent fuel chemistry requirements, have concentrated thermal signatures and are high maintenance. A typical gasoline internal combustion engine may have an efficiency of 15-30%, and a diesel engine may only be 25-40% efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an attempt to address the many inadequacies of the internal combustion engine, engineers formulated the idea of an external combustion rotary heat engine. Such engines in comparison with other types of heat engines, offer quietness and low pollution. Furthermore, external combustion rotary heat engines may offer simplicity and improved efficiency. Rotary heat engines, however, have never been commercialized because of certain short comings.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, some rotary heat engines/heat pumps have heat transfer structures that have not been optimized to promote nucleate boiling and dropwise condensation, and their primary energy sources have not been optimized to produce a high energy density. Such engines typically utilize convection or forced convection as the primary heat vector. In these engines, fins, staggered heat exchange tubes, and fan blades are provided to increase convective interaction with the hot side gases and to provide high thermal conductivity. Many of these engines operate in a temperature regime where the Newtonian cooling law describes the predominate heat delivery mechanism Q=h&#xd7;A&#xd7;&#x394;T, where h=heat transfer coefficient (100 W/m<sup>2</sup>K for force convection air). At a 1000&#xb0; C. temperature differential, approximately 100 Kw/m<sup>2 </sup>can be convectively delivered to a conductive receiving surface. Therefore, these engines are very limited, and would require very large rotating heat absorption surfaces. For example, an automotive engine of 30 Kw operating at 30% thermal-to-work efficiency would require 1 m<sup>2 </sup>of emitter/absorber surface areas. The need for this overly large rotating heat absorption structure has prevented the development and deployment of this type of engine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, rotating heat engines/heat pumps do not completely utilize the rotating nature of the engine/heat pump. For example, synergy has not been developed between output waste heat and the possible uses of the energy contained in the waste heat output, and the combined thermodynamic cycle capability of the rotating engine/heat pump has not been developed and exploited. There is some mention of incorporating fins or blades to help move the external cooling fluid through the engine, however, the idea of using the rotating heat rejecter structures to produce thrust has not been developed. Accordingly, a rotating heat engine that incorporates heat rejecters capable of using a predetermined portion of the rotative energy to develop thrust, preferably combined with the expansive force of a heat rejection fluid, would further the development and deployment of a rotary heat engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If a rotating engine is to be of practical value it must be manufacturable, cost effective, and have a volume and mass power density that permits its use in typical applications, such as, automotive, aerospace, commercial, and industrial applications. To fulfill these requirements, energy must be transformed, delivered, and made to do work at a rate that compares favorably with traditional engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An energy conversion device that may use multiple sources of energy, may utilize multiple thermodynamic cycles, may be quiet when running, may be made from readily available materials, may be compact and energy efficient, and/or may be made in a variety of speed torque curve characteristics is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, such an energy conversion device may include a heat absorber having a working fluid therein, a power converter in fluid communication with the heat absorber, and a heat rejecter in fluid communication with each one of the heat absorber and the power converter. The device may also include an energy source to provide energy to the heat absorber. In some embodiments the heat absorber, the power converter and the heat rejecter may be connected together to rotate as a single rotary unit relative to a shaft. In other embodiments the heat absorber and the heat rejecter may rotate relative to the power converter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In all embodiments, the energy conversion device may include several features to increase the device's efficiencies. For example, the device may be made more efficient by utilizing an energy source that provides radiant energy to the heat absorber, by utilizing a segmented energy source that may have a plurality of segments, wherein each segment may be either activated or deactivated to deliver the radiant energy to the heat absorber, by utilizing the waste heat produced by the device to create additional work, and/or utilizing multiple thermodynamic cycles. These features may be implemented individually, or in combination with each other to increase the device's efficiencies.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The invention generally relates to devices capable of use in heat to mechanical energy, and mechanical energy to heat pumping processes. In particular, the below-described energy conversion device may be used in a variety of applications, such as where gasoline, diesel, steam, and turbine type engines are now used. Unlike the engines/heat pumps of today, however, the energy conversion device is capable of absorbing and rejecting heat energy in a more efficient manner due to several features such as the rotating nature of the device, the use of radiant energy, the use of waste heat, and/or the combination of thermodynamic cycles utilized, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an energy conversion device <b>10</b> may include a heat absorption unit <b>14</b>, a power converter <b>18</b>, and a heat rejection unit <b>22</b>. Fuel <b>26</b> and air <b>30</b> may be combined in a primary energy source <b>34</b> such as a combustor to create heat energy <b>36</b>. The heat energy <b>36</b> is received by the heat absorber <b>14</b> where a working fluid <b>38</b> expands and does work in the power converter <b>18</b>. Heat, not converted to work may be dissipated in the heat rejection units <b>22</b>. In some embodiments the heat absorber <b>14</b>, the power converter <b>18</b> and the heat rejecter <b>22</b> are connected together to rotate as a single rotary unit relative to a shaft <b>42</b>. In other embodiments the heat absorber <b>14</b> and the heat rejecter <b>22</b> may rotate relative to the power converter <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The heat energy <b>36</b> may be transformed, delivered, and made to do work at a rate that compares favorably with traditional engines. For example, by using thermal radiation as the primary heat delivery vector, a greater work output can be generated. Preferably the heat energy <b>36</b> delivered may be at least 51% radiant energy. Even more preferable, the energy delivered may be at least 70% radiant energy. The Stefan-Boltzman equation defines the parameters of radiant heat flow:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>H</i><sub>net</sub>=&#x3b5;(<i>T</i>)&#xd7;&#x3c3;&#xd7;<i>A</i>&#xd7;(<i>T</i><sub>H</sub><sup>4</sup><i>&#x2212;T</i><sub>L</sub><sup>&#x2212;4</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Where &#x3b5;(T) is emissivity, &#x3c3; is the Stefan-Boltzman constant, A is the surface area, T<sub>H </sub>is the temperature of the emitting surface, and T<sub>L </sub>is the temperature of the receiving surface. According to the equation, an automotive engine operating at a 1000&#xb0; C. differential between emitter surface and heat absorber surface would only require a heat absorber surface area of 0.35 m<sup>2</sup>. Also, as shown by the equation, as emission temperatures are increased, the necessary receiver and emitter surface areas are decreased exponentially. Accordingly, radiant heat transfer provides the means to create a rotating engine with a competitive power density to other engines. The heat energy <b>36</b> may result from a process such as combustion of a fuel and an oxidant, solar radiation, and radiation emanating from a radioactive material, for example.
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, by using radiant energy the combustion process may be better controlled. For example, forced convection requires high flow rates to increase heat transfer rates and large heat transfer structures which may introduce thermal inertia. Radiant energy may be produced by the stoichiometric combustion of air or oxygen and fuel. This may lower the exhaust gas flow rate. The primary energy source <b>34</b> may be made from various materials such as micro-porous ceramics, woven or fiber type materials, and catalysts may optimize combustion and improve emissivity and spectral radiance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the primary energy source <b>34</b> may be a segmented radiant energy source having a plurality of segments <b>44</b> implemented to surround the heat absorber <b>14</b>. If the engine is to be operated at multiple power and speed settings, the segments <b>44</b> may be activated and deactivated to correspond to energy input requirements. The entire emitter surface may be divided so that quantum energy levels are available. Each quanta may either be off or operating at maximum efficiency. Each segment <b>44</b> may be optimized to support complete combustion at lower than NOx producing temperatures. As the heat absorber <b>14</b> rotates, all areas may be irradiated equally regardless of combustion setting.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The segments <b>44</b> may have interleaved back channels designed to separately introduce fuel and oxidizers into the primary energy source <b>34</b>. Alternatively, fractal fluid dynamics software may be used to optimize delivery and mixing of the combustion components. Combustion may take place primarily at the emitter surface or incrementally from the back to the surface. Channels may also be provided for the exit of combustion products.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The heat absorber <b>14</b> may have a variety of designs that help optimize the heat transfer process. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a surface <b>48</b> of the heat absorber <b>14</b> may be smooth to reduce turbulence, or may contain surface features that help move combustion products out of the system. The absorber surface <b>48</b> may have concavities that promote micro implosions thereby maintaining surface cleanliness. Heat absorber and heat rejecter surfaces may be coated with materials that increase heat flux or promote boiling or condensation Micro frits and diamond-like coatings are examples of coating techniques. In embodiments where forced convection is the primary method of heat transfer, the device <b>10</b> may be made practical by utilizing a regenerative blower <b>50</b> arrangement to provide multiple convective pathways for the external heating fluid. Also, the heat absorber <b>14</b> may have surfaces that perform the separate functions of liquid vaporization and vapor superheating. The heat absorber <b>14</b> may have spectral selective surfaces tuned to match the spectrum of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The heat absorber <b>14</b> may be contained within a volume having a spectrally transparent window. Heat resistant silica glass, high temperature glass ceramic, and quartz pure glass, as well as other materials may be used as windows. The heat absorbing material behind the window may be fibrous, corrugated, conical, or hemispherical, and may have mini to micro channels designed to distribute the condensed working fluid <b>38</b> in a manner that may minimize hot spots and flow resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The heat absorber <b>14</b> may be made of any material having the conductivity and mechanical characteristics necessary for the intended pressures and temperature range. The heat absorber <b>14</b> may be transparent to radiated energy, and the unit may have a heat absorbing media inside, that converts the radiant energy to heat, and transfers that heat to the working fluid <b>38</b>. This arrangement allows for a much faster heat transfer rate change than a heat absorption unit that relies on conduction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">There are a number of working fluids <b>38</b> that may be used. For example the working fluid <b>38</b> may be a gas, a super critical fluid, a phase change material or a binary fluid. Working fluids <b>38</b> that exist as a liquid at the heat rejection temperature and pressures allow for better regenerators and superior heat absorption rates. The working fluids <b>38</b> are selected to match the operating conditions of the engine or heat pump. Water, alcohol, butane, propane, hydrogen, super critical carbon dioxide, proprionic acid, and binary fluids are possible fluids <b>38</b>. Also, refrigerants, organic fluids, and lubricants commonly used in refrigeration, heat pump, and freezer applications may be used as working fluids <b>38</b> in the energy conversion device <b>10</b> in both heat pump and engine formats.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The power converter <b>18</b> may be connected to and in fluid communication with the heat absorber <b>14</b>. The power converter <b>18</b> may have multiple configurations. For example, the power converter <b>18</b> may include axial pistons, radial pistons, or turbines that are driven by the working fluid <b>38</b>. The power converter <b>18</b> is not limited to such structures and may include other structures that may be driven by the working fluid <b>38</b>. The power converter <b>18</b> may incorporate such structures in a number of embodiments to convert the heat energy into work.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the power converter <b>18</b> having pistons <b>52</b> driven by a swash plate <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the power converter <b>18</b> having a uni-flow design. As shown, the uni-flow engine may include a piston cylinder <b>54</b> containing a power piston <b>58</b> and an exhaust opening <b>62</b> substantially at its center. The uni-flow system may also include two inlet valves <b>66</b> located at each end of the piston cylinder <b>54</b>. Vapor may be admitted at either one of the inlet valves <b>66</b>, thereby driving the power piston <b>58</b> and then exit at the central opening <b>62</b>. In the uni-flow design, thermal efficiency is achieved by having a temperature gradient along the cylinder <b>54</b>. Vapor may enter at the hot end of the cylinder and may exhaust at the cooler center. By this means, cyclic heating and cooling of the cylinder wall may be avoided. One advantage of the uni-flow system is that it potentially allows for greater expansion in a single cylinder, which may allow for greater thermal efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the power converter <b>18</b> having an Alpha type Stirling engine design. As shown, such an engine/heat pump may have a heat absorbing end <b>14</b>, a heat rejecting end <b>22</b>, regenerators <b>106</b>, piston/cylinder assemblies <b>74</b>, and mechanical connection <b>102</b>. The device may be arranged in radial fashion as shown, or may have pistons/cylinders arranged coaxial to the central shaft. The heat absorbing end <b>14</b> and the heat rejecting end <b>22</b> may form annular areas, or in the axial configuration may be at opposite axial positions. The working fluid <b>38</b> may move back and forth between the heat absorbing end <b>14</b> and the heat rejecting end <b>22</b> of adjacent piston/cylinder assemblies <b>74</b> which are mechanically connected 90 degrees out of phase as in typical Alpha type Stirling devices. The heat absorbing <b>14</b> and heat rejecting <b>22</b> ends of the device may interact with external fluids as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the power converter <b>18</b> having a turbine type design. As shown, such a turbine may have stationary components <b>110</b> and rotating components <b>114</b> encased in a housing <b>118</b>. It should be understood that the turbine type designs may include turbine blades or may be bladeless such as a Tesla-type turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The forgoing configurations of the power converter <b>18</b> were for illustrative purposes only. Therefore, the power converter <b>18</b> may include other configurations that enable the energy conversion device <b>10</b> to produce work from the working fluid <b>38</b> such as a nutating disc for example.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, mechanical work produced by the power converter <b>18</b> may be delivered by a drive <b>122</b> to a differential which may be attached to the driving wheels for certain embodiments of the device. The drive <b>122</b> may include a pulley, a gear, a sprocket, an electric generator component, a fan, an impeller, a propeller or any other component capable of delivering the rotational energy. The components of the drive <b>122</b> may depend on the embodiment of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the heat rejecter <b>22</b> may be connected to and in fluid communication with both the power converter <b>18</b> and the heat absorber <b>14</b>. The heat rejecter <b>22</b> may have an internal surface <b>126</b> for contacting the working fluid <b>38</b> and an external surface <b>130</b> for contacting a cooling fluid <b>134</b>. The cooling fluid <b>134</b> may be air or water or a process fluid for example. The internal surface <b>126</b> may include channels, micro-channels, vanes, or an expansion chamber. Because the energy conversion device <b>10</b> may be designed to operate in a variety of environments, the external surface <b>130</b> of the heat rejecter <b>22</b> may take different forms and have different geometries. For example, a device designed primarily to produce torque will have heat rejecters <b>22</b> that are oriented to produce the least aerodynamic or fluid drag while still rejecting the requisite amount of heat to the environment. A device designed to produce both torque and thrust may have heat rejecters <b>22</b> that accelerate the external cooling fluid <b>134</b>, thus dividing the work output of the engine between thrust and torque. If the device is designed to act as a heat pump, the heat rejection <b>22</b> and heat absorbing structures <b>14</b> would serve both to transfer heat and to accelerate the environmental fluids making up or in contact with the high and low temperature sides of the heat pump. The rejecter surface may have concavities that produce micro implosions, thereby maintaining surface cleanliness and mechanically producing heat. The rejecter surfaces should be oriented to sling condensate off the surface as soon as it forms. Thus heat rejecter surfaces should be substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation. In embodiments where forced convection is the predominate heat transfer mechanism of the heat rejecter <b>22</b>, a regenerative blower <b>138</b> arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, may be used to provide multiple heat transfer paths for the cooling fluid <b>134</b>. The regenerative blower <b>138</b> can also produce an enhanced pumping effect. If the device is designed to act as a pump, the heat rejection <b>22</b> and heat absorbing <b>14</b> structures would serve both to transfer heat and to accelerate the environmental fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">High efficiency of the device may further be improved by using the waste heat generated by the energy-to-work process. The waste heat may contain 60-85% of the fuel energy. The rotating heat rejecter <b>22</b> may accelerate the cooling fluid <b>134</b> past the engine, thereby increasing the temperature of the cooling fluid <b>134</b>. By increasing its temperature, the volume of the cooling fluid <b>134</b> may increase and accelerate the cooling fluid <b>134</b> as it exits the device. The thrust created, may help counteract drag forces or may otherwise contribute to the energy output of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the heat rejecters <b>22</b> may include circulator pumps <b>142</b>. Circulator pumps <b>142</b> may also be used to circulate the working fluid <b>38</b>. These preferably piston type pumps may be located at points radially distant from the axis of rotation in the heat rejecters <b>22</b>. The cooled working fluid <b>38</b> may be forced by centrifugal action to the inlets of the circulating pumps <b>142</b>. The pumps <b>142</b> may be operated via a linking mechanism by action of a shaft mounted cam or eccentric co-located on the stationary reaction member, or by other mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic methods.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the circulating pumps <b>142</b> may deliver the working fluid <b>38</b> from a low pressure recuperating heat exchanger <b>146</b> to the high pressure heat absorption unit <b>14</b>. The heat exchanger <b>146</b> may absorb some of the waste heat from the working fluid <b>38</b> exiting the power converter <b>18</b>. After cooling in the heat rejection unit <b>22</b>, the working fluid <b>38</b> may reabsorb some of the heat held in the heat exchanger <b>146</b> before being delivered to the heat absorption unit <b>14</b>. The heat exchanger <b>146</b> preferably may have a surface area to volume ratio of at least 10:1, more preferably 100:1, and even more preferably 1000:1. The micro scale features may have surface area to volume ratios of up to 5000:1. Heat recuperation at theses stages of the engine operation may provide significant efficiency gains similar to those achieved by Stirling engine and stationary Rankine cycle electric generator applications.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the phase change working fluid <b>38</b> is employed, the liquid phase material may be forced by centrifugal force against the interior surface of the heat absorber <b>14</b> and the heat rejecter <b>22</b>. This may prevent the formation of micro bubbles of vaporized fluid. In conventional heat absorber and heat rejecter structures these micro bubbles act as insulators, preventing the flow of heat from the heat absorber and heat rejecter structures into the working fluid. By implementing a rotating heat absorber <b>14</b> and heat rejecter <b>22</b>, the environmental heat exchange fluids (i.e. air, water, combustion gases) may also move through the engine with greater ease.
