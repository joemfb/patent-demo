<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an anti-glare lens and a table lamp with an anti-glare lens, and more particularly to an anti-glare lens and a table lamp with an anti-glare lens that can reduce the glare and can improve the light utilization rate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a conventional table lamp has a lamp stand <b>90</b>, an adjusting arm <b>91</b>, a lamp head <b>92</b> and a lens <b>93</b>. The adjusting arm <b>91</b> is connected to and protrudes upwardly from the lamp stand <b>90</b> and has a top end. The lamp head <b>92</b> is connected to the top end of the adjusting arm <b>91</b> and has an inner surface and a luminescence module. The luminescence module is mounted in the inner surface of the lamp head <b>92</b>, is electrically connected to an external power source and has a luminous element. The lens <b>93</b> is mounted on the inner surface of the lamp head <b>92</b>, is mounted around the luminescence module of the lamp head <b>92</b> and has a light entering face and a light ejecting face. The light entering face faces the luminous element of the luminescence module. The light ejecting face is a symmetrically-curved face and is formed around the light entering face of the lens <b>93</b> to enable the light of the luminous element to emit out of the lens <b>93</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the symmetrically-curved face of the lens <b>93</b>, a polar candela distribution plot of the conventional table lamp is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, wherein the distributions of the light intensity between angles 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; are roughly overlapped. In accordance with the illuminance distribution and the light projection state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15A</figref> to <b>15</b>C, the position of the peak value of the distribution of the light intensity of the conventional table lamp is perpendicular to the lamp head <b>92</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a target zone <b>95</b> formed by the light of the lamp head <b>92</b> on a table is perpendicular to the lamp head <b>92</b>. Then, a reader needs to adjust the lamp head <b>92</b> to move it close to the reader to increase the illuminance for reading. However, when the lamp head <b>92</b> is moved close to the reader, the reader may directly face the glare, the reader's eyes may be tired and the shadow may affect reading comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the reader may adjust the angle of the lamp head <b>92</b> to lift the lamp head upwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, and this will make the peak value of the distribution of the light intensity occur at where light obliquely emits to the reader. Then, the target zone <b>95</b> of the lamp head <b>92</b> will deviate to the reader to reduce the influence of shadow. However, the reader still feels the glare and the reader's eyes may be tired.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention provides an anti-glare lens and a table lamp with an anti-glare lens to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The main objective of the present invention is to provide an anti-glare lens and a table lamp with an anti-glare lens, and more particularly to an anti-glare lens and a table lamp with an anti-glare lens that can reduce the glare and can improve the light utilization rate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The table lamp in accordance with the present invention has a lamp stand, an adjusting arm, a lamp head and an anti-glare lens. The adjusting arm is connected to the lamp stand. The lamp head is connected to the adjusting arm and has a luminous element. The anti-glare lens is mounted on the lamp head and has a body. The body has a bottom, a front end, a rear end, a light entering concave face, a light source region, a total reflection face and a light ejecting convex face. The bottom is flat and has a zero axis to divide the bottom equally. The light entering concave face is formed in the body. The light source region is formed in the body between the light entering concave face and the bottom of the body. The total reflection face is obliquely formed on and protrudes from the rear end of the body and is formed with the bottom of the body. An angle between the zero axis of the bottom of the body and the total reflection face is between 90 and 180 degrees. The light ejecting convex face is formed from the rear end to the front end of the body, is formed with the total reflection face and has at least one curvature.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> and <b>8</b>, an anti-glare lens in accordance with the present invention comprises a body <b>10</b>. The body <b>10</b> has a bottom, a front end, a rear end, a light entering concave face <b>12</b>, a light source region <b>13</b>, a total reflection face <b>14</b> and a light ejecting convex face <b>15</b>. The bottom of the body <b>10</b> is flat and has a zero axis <b>11</b> to divide the bottom of the body <b>10</b> equally. The light entering concave face <b>12</b> is formed in the bottom of the body <b>10</b> and is divided equally by the zero axis <b>11</b> of the bottom of the body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The light source region <b>13</b> is formed in the body <b>10</b> between the light entering concave face <b>12</b> and the bottom of the body <b>10</b>. The total reflection face <b>14</b> is obliquely formed on and protrudes from the rear end of the body <b>10</b>, is formed with the bottom of the body <b>10</b> and is divided equally by the zero axis <b>11</b> of the bottom of the body <b>10</b>. An angle between the zero axis <b>11</b> of the bottom of the body <b>10</b> and the total reflection face <b>14</b> is between 90 and 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> is formed from the rear end to the front end of the body <b>10</b>, is formed with the total reflection face <b>14</b> and is divided equally by the zero axis <b>11</b> of the bottom of the body <b>10</b> and has at least one curvature. Each one of the at least one curvature of the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> has a center of curvature <b>60</b> set out of the light source region <b>13</b> and close to the rear end of the body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a table lamp with an anti-glare lens in accordance with the present invention comprises a lamp stand <b>20</b>, an adjusting arm <b>30</b>, a lamp head <b>40</b> and the above-mentioned anti-glare lens.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lamp stand <b>20</b> has a top. The adjusting arm <b>30</b> is connected to the lamp stand <b>20</b> and has a lower end and an upper end. The lower end of the adjusting arm <b>30</b> is connected to the top of the lamp stand <b>20</b>. The lamp head <b>40</b> is connected to the upper end of the adjusting arm <b>30</b> and has an inner surface and a luminous element <b>41</b>. The luminous element <b>41</b> may be a light-emitting diode, is mounted on the inner surface of the lamp head <b>40</b> and can emit a light <b>51</b>. The bottom of the body <b>10</b> of the anti-glare lens is mounted on the inner surface of the lamp head <b>40</b> to enable the light source region <b>13</b> of the body <b>10</b> of the anti-glare lens to be mounted around the luminous element <b>41</b> of the lamp head <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In use, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> emits into the light source region <b>13</b> and firstly reflects from the light entering concave face <b>12</b>. A part of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> emits out of the body <b>10</b> of the anti-glare lens via the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b>. Another part of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> emits to the total reflection face <b>14</b>. When the part of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> emits to the total reflection face <b>14</b>, the angle of incidence of the light <b>51</b> is larger than the critical angle of the light <b>51</b>. Then, the part of the light <b>51</b> totally reflects to the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the part of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> emits to the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b>, due to the curvature scheme of the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b>, the part of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> is secondary reflected by the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> and emits to the front end of the body <b>10</b>. Therefore, if the lamp head <b>40</b> is adjusted to a horizontal position, the peak value of the distribution of the light intensity of the light <b>51</b> does not occur at where perpendicular to the lamp head <b>10</b> and moves away from the lamp stand <b>20</b>. Then, a target zone <b>50</b> formed by the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> on a table is obliquely moved away from the lamp stand <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, a polar candela distribution plot of the table lamp is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the distributions of the light intensity of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> between angles 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; are symmetrized on the zero axis <b>11</b> and are not overlapped. The distribution of the light intensity of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> moves toward the direction of 50 degrees. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the position of the peak value of the distribution of the light intensity of the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> is not perpendicular to the lamp head <b>40</b> and moves away from the lamp stand <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>11</b>B and <b>11</b>C, the target zone <b>50</b> formed by the light <b>51</b> of the lamp head <b>40</b> on a table is not perpendicular to the lamp head <b>40</b>, moves away from the lamp stand <b>20</b> and close to a reader. In addition, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the light entering concave face <b>12</b>, the total reflection face <b>14</b> and the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> are symmetrized on the zero axis <b>11</b>, and this can enable the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> to emit out of the body <b>10</b> of the anti-glare lens symmetrically. Additionally, the light entering concave face <b>12</b>, the total reflection face <b>14</b> and the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> are not perpendicular to the zero axis <b>11</b> of the body <b>10</b> and this can enable the light <b>51</b> to obliquely emit out of the body <b>10</b> of the anti-glare lens via the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> of the body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Consequently, the anti-glare lens and the table lamp with the anti-glare lens as described have the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">1. The total reflection face <b>14</b> of the body can totally reflect the light <b>51</b> to increase the illuminance of the luminous element <b>41</b> and adjust the emitting direction of the light <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">2. The light entering concave face <b>12</b> and the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> of the anti-glare lens can adjust the emitting direction of the light <b>51</b>, and the center of curvature <b>60</b> of the light ejecting convex face <b>15</b> is set out of the light source region <b>13</b>, close to the rear end of the body <b>10</b> and is not overlapped with the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b>. Then, the anti-glare lens can form anti-symmetric distribution of light intensity and illuminance on a table when the lamp head <b>40</b> is adjusted to a horizontal position and this can enable the light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b> to obliquely emit on the table. Then, the reader does not need to adjust the lamp head <b>40</b> to move close to the reader or adjust the angle of the lamp head <b>40</b> and can read clearly.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">3. The anti-glare lens in accordance with the present invention can increase the illuminance of the luminous element <b>41</b>, can reduce the glare and prevent the reader's eyes from tiring. In addition, the anti-glare lens also can prevent the table lamp from forming shadow and can improve the utilization rate of light <b>51</b> of the luminous element <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present utility model have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and features of the utility model, the disclosure is illustrative only. Changes may be made in the details, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
