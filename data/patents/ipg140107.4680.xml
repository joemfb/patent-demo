<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications, and more particularly to casual collaborative conferencing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">B. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The World Wide Web (WWW), one type of service provided through the Internet, allows a user to access a universe of information which combines text, audio, graphics and animation within a hypermedia document. Links are contained within a WWW document which allow simple and rapid access to related documents. The WWW was developed to provide researchers with a system that would enable them to quickly access all types of information with a common interface, removing the necessity to execute a variety of numerous steps to access the information. During 1991, the WWW was released for general usage with access to hypertext and UseNet news articles. Interfaces to WAIS, anonymous FTP, Telnet and Gopher were added. By the end of 1993, WWW browsers with easy to use interfaces had been developed for many different computer systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">UseNet is a network of news groups on thousands of different topics which allow the on-line discussion through the posting of individual messages (articles) which can be read by participants. An article is similar to an e-mail message, having a header, message body and signature.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an example of a program that facilitates Web chat. &#x201c;Chatting&#x201d; is the term used for the network equivalent of the old telephone party line. IRC is accessed through an Internet connection. This technology permits the user to chat with users from all over the world about hundreds of different subjects at any time. In a way, it is as if the UseNet newsgroups were a live discussion group rather than postings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The word &#x201c;chat&#x201d; may be somewhat misleading, because persons participating in a chat session are not necessarily speaking, but they are typing and reading text messages that chat participants write. Moreover, if the information communicated is not only in text form, but is real-time audio and video, chat rooms are better described by the term virtual space rooms. Once a person enters a chat room, which is really just a web page, that person can choose to only read the exchanges, known as lurking, or the person can join in and post messages.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many chat rooms focus the conversation on specific topics, such as health, politics, and football. In that way, people with similar interests can find one another.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first step for a person interested in joining a chat session, is to locate a chat room that interests the person. Once the person is on the web site (leading to the chat room), the interested person will usually be asked to register. For privacy purposes, people do not register using their real name, but instead people make up a name.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once the person is equipped with a registration name, the person clicks a button and follows the instructions on the web site to choose a chat room, depending on the interests of the person. Joining a chat room is like walking into a room full of people talking to each other, sometimes with several conversations going on at once. Once inside the chat room, the person will probably find himself or herself in the middle of a conversation. There is no need to jump into the conversation. It is not uncommon for chat rooms to have many more lurkers than participants. As the interaction continues, new postings appear on the computer screen. When the person decides to join the conversation, all it takes is to type a message in a blank box in the screen and click a Talk button (or hit the Enter or Return key on the keyboard). Soon the message will be posted in the chat room and people may respond. In addition to chatting on a chat room where the text is broadcast to everyone on that chat room, there are ways to enter into a private chat.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A number of Internet phone software products offer voice capabilities in real time over the Internet. Internet phoneware vendors typically provide their own directory servers, organized by topic as well as by name. Voice quality varies from moment to moment. Such variations are due to the processing delay that results from encoding and decoding the conversation as well as the inherent delay of the Internet, which varies according to the amount of traffic at any given time and the route through which the signal must travel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The Web chat is, however, only one level of an area of technology known as collaborative conferencing. Collaborative conferencing is the ability for two or more individuals to work together in real-time, in a coordinated manner over time and space by using computers. Collaborative conferencing is not limited to a live text exchange, but includes data conferencing/shared whiteboard applications, group interactive document editing, and audio and video multi-point conferencing among others.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The technique of Internet chat has the disadvantage that it is limited in the choices that individuals can make respecting whom they want to establish communication with. Namely, they have to join a chat room that has a specific discussion topic, and can only pick people in that chat room with whom to engage in a private chat. To solve this problem, a solution has been proposed and implemented, in which matches between different individuals connected to the WWW are created. This requires the inconvenient step of requesting information to the user, so as to create a user profile, and thus, perform matches based on those profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, there is a need in the art for a system that offers more flexibility to individuals to choose other individuals with whom they want to engage in a conversation, the conversation not being limited to a conventional Internet chat (text).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to meet the foregoing needs by providing systems and methods that efficiently enable real-time communication among two or more individuals separated in space.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Specifically, a method for meeting the foregoing needs is disclosed. The method includes the steps of determining that a first individual is likely to be interested in communicating with a second individual via a first communications link; retrieving information via the first communications link about one or more additional individuals from electronic memory means associated with the second individual; and establishing communication with at least one of the additional individuals based on the retrieved information.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a general collaborative conferencing system <b>100</b>. The system includes communication means associated with users A-F (<b>10</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>19</b>), a Wide Area Network (WAN) <b>14</b>, and a chat server <b>22</b>. The WAN <b>14</b> is any network that is capable of transferring data at speeds fast enough as to support collaborative conferencing. An example of a WAN is the Internet. The chat server <b>22</b> is a computer connected to the WAN <b>14</b> that offers a chat service. That is, the chat server <b>22</b> runs software that enables the creation of a chat room. The users A-F can enter the chat room if connected to the chat server <b>22</b>. As mentioned above, a chat room is nothing more that a web page, which in this case is supported by the chat server <b>22</b>. By contrast, supporting a virtual space room might require equipment other than a single server. Support for the virtual space room can be offered by several servers (not shown) that are part of the WAN <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the system <b>100</b>, user A determines that user B is a person that is likely to be interesting enough so as to get involved in a casual collaborative conversation with that person. That is, if user A believes that he or she shares common interests with user B, user A will engage in collaborative conferencing with user B. This determination is made after obtaining information about user B. The information is obtained by communicating with user B. The manner in which user A communicates with user B in order to determine whether he or she is likely to be interested in communicating with user B (possibly via some other communication means or links) includes, but is not limited to, telephonic conversations, e-mail, voice mail, real-time video, and real-time text.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once user A determines he or she is likely to be interested in communicating with user B, user A targets or spots user B when user B enters into a chat room or virtual space room. User A will see on his computer screen (<b>208</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) either the name or an image of user B whenever user B is &#x201c;on-line&#x201d;. Each user in the system <b>100</b> has a personal directory <b>20</b> containing the names of other people with collaborative conferencing capability.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Unlike conventional methods of matchmaking in a chat room context, user A does not rely on a computer program to pick interesting persons for him or her. Instead, user A relies on user B's personal directory <b>20</b> as a starting point to find more interesting persons. User A accesses some of the information contained in directory <b>20</b> about other users with collaborative conferencing capability, with whom user B communicates. This technique is called recursive identification of individuals. The information that user A can access is limited according to permissions assigned to each record in the directory by user B.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of different permissions designated by user B. The directory <b>20</b> contains individual records <b>300</b>-<b>304</b> that correspond to individuals with collaborative conferencing capability. The list of users (<b>300</b>-<b>304</b>) is by no means extensive and is not representative of all of the possible users that could be included in the directory <b>20</b>. Records <b>300</b>-<b>304</b> contain user information that includes, but is not limited to, users' e-mail address, users' names and virtual space room login names, picture id's, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">There are different levels of permissions that the user B can assign to the users records (<b>300</b>-<b>304</b>) in the directory <b>20</b>. Because any other user of the system in the present invention can get access to some information, user <b>12</b> assigns access permissions to records <b>300</b>-<b>304</b>. These permissions define how much information can be accessed by the other users via their respective communications means (<b>10</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>19</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One level of access corresponds to the type of service that is used within the system. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the record <b>300</b>, corresponding to user C, can be accessed by the entire public that communicates with user B via Web chat (e.g., a chat server <b>22</b>). The term &#x201c;public&#x201d; refers to all of the persons with collaborative conferencing capabilities. On the other hand, when another level in collaborative conferencing is in use, namely, video conferencing, only users A and D can access record information <b>300</b> about user C from user B's directory <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Other levels of permissions include, but are not limited to, giving the public access to the entire directory <b>20</b>, giving specific persons access to the entire directory <b>20</b>, giving the public access to information contained in some of the records <b>300</b>-<b>304</b>, and giving specific persons access to information contained in some of the records <b>300</b>-<b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The directory <b>20</b> can be created by user B manually. That is, user B can gather a list of names of individuals that he or she communicates with, and enters that list into the directory <b>20</b>. In the present invention, an alternative to manually creating the directory is to have the software that enables collaborative conferencing create the directory <b>20</b> for the user. The software has a routine that monitors the communication between user B and other users (e.g., C-F) and that adds to the directory <b>20</b> information about the users that communicate with user B. As an option, the software can sort the information in the directory <b>20</b>, according to the frequency of the communications between user B and the individuals named in the directory <b>20</b>. Moreover, another option consists of automatically deleting information from the directory <b>20</b>, when the software determines that persons that do not communicate frequently with user B, have not actually communicated with user B for specified period of time. For example, the software could look at the sorted directory <b>20</b>, and determine whether the individual whose information is at the bottom of the directory (less frequency) has communicated with user B in the past two months. If the person at the bottom has not done so, that person's information is deleted from the directory <b>20</b>. The period of two months is only an example of a parameter that can be adjusted according to the directory's owner preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows communication means <b>10</b> for enabling communication between user A and other users (e.g., users B-F) of the system <b>100</b>, and that corresponds to user A in this particular example. The communication means <b>10</b> includes a computer system <b>202</b> with a keyboard <b>206</b> and a screen <b>208</b>; and a speaker <b>204</b>, camera <b>212</b>, and microphone <b>210</b> connected to the computer <b>202</b>. The computer <b>202</b> runs software that displays on screen <b>208</b> a representation of other users <b>220</b>-<b>222</b> present (on-line) in a virtual space room. The ability of communicating with these other parties in real-time via the computer system <b>202</b> is what makes the system a collaborative conferencing system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The computer <b>202</b> only displays an image of those users that have been determined to be of interest to user A <b>10</b>. As seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, user A has determined that he or she is likely to be interested in communicating with users C, E and F. The representation of users C, E and F in the computer screen is denominated by numerals <b>220</b>-<b>222</b>, and it includes image information as well as other personal information about the users. User A uses different means to communicate with any of the users in the virtual space room. These means include, but are not limited to, voice, interactive text (chat), e-mail, and video.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The speaker <b>204</b> is used for listening to voice messages sent by the users in the virtual space room. On the other hand, the microphone <b>210</b> is used to send voice messages to users in the virtual space room. These voice messages are either voice mail messages, stored either locally in the computer <b>202</b> or in some other recording means, or real-time voice messages (i.e., real-time telephony).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The camera <b>212</b> is used to capture an image of user A, which is presumably displayed in the computer screen associated with other users participating in the virtual space room. The camera <b>212</b> is turned off when user A does not desire to transmit an image of herself/himself. It is possible to have a participant in the virtual space room that does not want his or her image displayed. For example, a chat window <b>224</b> displays interactive text communications between user B and user A. As seen from the display, an image of user B is not shown in the screen <b>208</b>. The chat window <b>224</b> is used by any of the users in the virtual space room, and its use is limited to displaying text messages from all of the parties, as it would for a conventional chat room.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When user A decides to communicate via interactive text, he or she needs to type the message on the keyboard <b>206</b>. The user can edit the entered text which is displayed on the window <b>228</b>. After the changes have been entered, the text is displayed on the chat window <b>224</b> when user A hits the button <b>226</b> displayed on the screen <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one notices that the image representations <b>220</b>-<b>222</b> displayed on screen <b>208</b> of user A's computer system <b>202</b> match the permissions associated to users C, E and F (<b>300</b>, <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As discussed above, user A has determined that user B is likely to be an interesting person. This is evidenced by the interactive text exchange between user A and user B, shown in windows <b>224</b> and <b>228</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It is also evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, that user A could have accessed the directory <b>20</b> in order to access information about users C, E and F. Thus, user A determined that users C, E and F are also likely to be interesting. User A could have also determined that user D is likely to be an interesting person, even though user D is not displayed on screen <b>208</b>. Only users that are on-line are displayed on the screen <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method for performing collaborative conferencing in accordance with the present invention. In step <b>401</b> a first user determines which persons are likely to be interesting. As discussed previously, this determination can be done for a single person, and then the determination of additional persons likely to be interesting can be expanded by looking at the directory of the first persons determined to be likely interesting. In step <b>402</b>, the first user accesses the personal directory of one of the likely interesting persons. This step is not limited to the first person that was determined to be likely interesting. Once a list of likely interesting persons have been put together by the first user, he or she can go into the directory of any of the individuals in that list.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">After the first user has determined likely interesting persons and has accessed the directory of a first likely interesting person, the first user establishes communication with the persons who are determined to be likely interesting. This communication takes place in a virtual space room context.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention. The software running on the computer <b>202</b> allows persons in a virtual space room to be separated in subgroups. These subgroups are displayed <b>501</b>-<b>503</b> on the computer screen <b>208</b>. Persons in Group I <b>501</b>, cannot communicate with persons outside Group I <b>501</b> (Group II <b>502</b>, Group III <b>503</b>). Assuming that user A belongs to Group I <b>501</b>, user A can still see in the computer screen <b>208</b> who is in the other groups. If user A wants to communicate with individuals from the other groups, user A must change groups in order to accomplish the desired communication. For example, if user A is in Group I <b>501</b>, and notices that user B (a person that is likely to be interesting) is in Group II <b>502</b>, user A would have to enter Group II <b>502</b> in order to communicate with user B. Once user A transfers to Group II <b>502</b>, an image representation of user A would appear in the area of the computer screen that corresponds to Group II <b>502</b>.</p>
