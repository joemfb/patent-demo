Explosives disposal is necessary in many situations, such as for example with handling improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Over pressure disruption is a technique in which the fusing of an IED, such as electronic fusing, is disrupted by introducing pressure, such as into a compartment or interior of a vehicle. The aim of using an over pressure disrupter is to prohibit the IED from detonating. Existing over pressure disrupters such as Maxi-Candle&#xae;, Slim Jim&#xae; and Bottler disrupters have limitations, as described further herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It will be readily understood that the components of the embodiments, as generally described herein, may be arranged differently from the described example embodiments. Thus, the following more detailed description of the example embodiments is not intended to limit the scope of the claims, but is merely representative of those embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;embodiment(s)&#x201d; (or the like) means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;according to embodiments&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; (or the like) in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, to give a thorough understanding of example embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that aspects can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, et cetera. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obfuscation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An over pressure disrupter system to disrupt electronic fusing may be used for deactivating vehicle born improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). An over pressure disrupter system aims to increase the pressure, such as within a vehicle compartment, in order to disable a VBIED. However, existing systems have some drawbacks, including catching components (such as internal components of the vehicle, for example a seat or a dashboard) on fire when detonated. Existing overpressure disruption systems include Maxi-Candle&#xae;, Slim Jim&#xae; and Bottler.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Existing systems have a high probability of fire (such as in the compartment of the vehicle) if the over pressure disrupter charge (or particles heated thereby) comes in contact with the compartment interior. This hazard is likely because existing systems either use no fire retardant material or utilize water, which is unsuitable for operating/storage at various temperatures. Additionally, existing systems lack modularity (the charges can not be readily connected together and require separate blasting caps for each charge used). Moreover, existing systems do not provide ancillary devices or sub-components that make use more convenient, such as an incorporated window breaker or robotic gripper block, making deployment and use of existing systems difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Accordingly, an embodiment provides an overpressure disrupter. An embodiment may be implemented for example as a vehicle modular overpressure disrupter (VMOD) system providing overpressure to disrupt electronic fusing used with vehicle born improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). According to an embodiment, a VMOD system is modular, for example comprised of three explosive modules. The explosive modules may be used individually or connected together. The VMOD system may include other modules, ancillary devices such as detonators, incorporated window breaker, and/or robotic gripper block.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The description now turns to the figures. The illustrated example embodiments will be best understood by reference to the figures. The following description is intended only by way of example and simply illustrates certain example embodiments representative of the invention, as claimed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example VMOD system is illustrated. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, three explosive modules A, B, and C are shown. The explosive modules A, B, and C may be connected using a variety of connection techniques. For example, explosive module A may be connected to explosive module B, which is in turn connected to explosive module C, via threading such that the explosive modules A, B, and C form a modular system. Each interface or connection, such as between explosive module A and explosive module B, or between explosive module B and explosive module C, may include an appropriate material, such as an explosive to permit detonation of any explosive module selected form A, B, and/or C (provide detonation of any connected modules, whether connected directly to the initiated module or indirectly connected thereto). Connections may also be plugged, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with hexagonal bolts at the end of the plugs, and filled with another material, such as fire retardant material, as further described herein. In one example, booster/connector(s) (described further herein) may be used to connect the modules to facilitate detonation of each connected explosive module (here, explosive modules A, B, and C), to connect ancillary devices, and/or as plugs filled with fire retardant material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The example VMOD system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> may include ancillary device(s), such as ancillary devices D and E. An ancillary device may be one device or a plurality of integrated devices. Moreover, there may be more than one ancillary device included, as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ancillary device D is located atop explosive module B, and provides both a robotic gripper such that it can be handled and manipulated robotically, such as for placement within a vehicle's passenger compartment, and a window breaker such as to facilitate entry and placement of VMOD system within a compartment, such as a vehicle's passenger compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, another ancillary device, E, is illustrated as connected to one of the explosive modules (the center explosive module in this example&#x2014;corresponding to explosive module B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The ancillary device E provides an initiation charge to detonate the explosive module to which it is connected. For example, the ancillary device E may be a blasting cap modified to connect to the center explosive module, as for example by threads allowing it to be screwed into the center explosive module via an adapter, as further described herein. It should be noted that ancillary device(s) may be connected to other explosive modules or components of a VMOD system in addition to the illustrated, representative examples illustrated in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a cross section of an explosive module <b>300</b> is illustrated. The explosive module <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> may be any of explosive modules A-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated, the explosive module <b>300</b> has an outer cylinder wall <b>301</b> (which may be of another shape, according to the implementation chosen). In an exemplary embodiment referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the outer cylinder wall <b>301</b> may be a single, continuous structure. In another exemplary embodiment referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the outer cylinder wall <b>301</b> may be a structure formed from two, separate pieces of material that snap or lock together. The outer cylinder wall <b>301</b> may be made of polycarbonate plastic, such as LEXAN&#xae; 1414, or some other plastic. For use in military theater operations, the outer cylinder wall <b>301</b> may be made of a material that is highly resistant to extreme temperature changes, though in many situations this will not be a requirement. The explosive module <b>300</b> contains a main explosive charge <b>302</b>, which may be selected based on the particular implementation and characteristics desired, such as a main explosive charge of PBXN-11, PBXN-9, PBXN-114, or PBXW-115 for handling VBIEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A fire retardant material <b>303</b> may surround the main explosive charge <b>302</b>, for example ABC fire retardant powder (including ammonium phosphate). The module <b>300</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, may be sized as about 4 inches in length by about 4 inches in diameter. The fire retardant material <b>303</b> fills one or more cavities such that it surrounds the main explosive charge <b>302</b>. The fire retardant material <b>303</b> is selected and placed such that it functions to reduce the flame and heat damage, and minimizes the propagation of the flame of the main charge <b>302</b> to surrounding materials that will inevitably result from the detonation of the main charge <b>302</b>. Thus, the fire retardant material <b>303</b> functions to minimize heat and burn damage responsive to detonation of the main explosive charge <b>302</b>. In an exemplary embodiment referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the fire retardant material <b>303</b> is continuous throughout a length of the adjacent outer cylinder wall <b>301</b>. In another exemplary embodiment referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the fire retardant material <b>303</b> is composed of two separate sections separated by a membrane <b>310</b>, such as, a plastic membrane, while being adjacent a length of the adjacent outer cylinder wall <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An inner wall <b>304</b>, such as an inner cylindrical wall, may be utilized to enclose the main explosive charge <b>302</b> and keep it separate from the fire retardant material <b>303</b>. The inner wall <b>304</b> may be comprised of the same material as the outer cylindrical wall <b>301</b>. End cap(s) <b>305</b> may be placed into connection areas <b>306</b> of the module <b>300</b>. The end cap(s) <b>305</b> may be comprised of the same material as the outer cylindrical wall <b>301</b>. The end cap(s) <b>305</b> occupy a space, such as a ridge defined in the connection area <b>306</b> of the module such that a connection area <b>306</b> may be closed off. End cap(s) may be used to contain a filling material, such as a fire retardant material <b>303</b>, as further described herein, within the connection areas <b>306</b>. The connection areas <b>306</b>, when a module <b>300</b> is to be connected to another module or an ancillary device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, may not contain end cap(s) <b>305</b>. The connection area(s) <b>306</b> may be configured for convenient connection with another module or an ancillary device, such as by having threads therein, as described further herein. The connector area(s) may be formed to include booster well(s) <b>309</b> for accepting a separate connecting piece (described further herein) that forms a connection between modules and/or modules and ancillary device(s).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Module <b>300</b> may also contain one or more inner seals (one is indicated at <b>307</b>) that may be used to separate a main charge <b>302</b> from other components or areas of the module, such as a connection area <b>306</b> containing fire retardant material <b>303</b>. The seal(s) may be comprised of the same material chose for the outer cylinder wall <b>301</b>, and may be fixed in place, as for example with a two-part epoxy. Module <b>300</b> may also contain additional features to facilitate additional functionality. For example, module <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes indents <b>308</b> for attaching an ancillary device, such as attachment of ancillary device D via ring clamps.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The choice of shape for a module <b>300</b> may be dictated by the desired outcome. For example, where increased fire suppression is desirable, choice of a cylindrical shape for a module <b>300</b> affords a coating of fire retardant material <b>303</b> that coats surrounding structures, such as a car seat in a vehicle compartment, and helps extinguish the flame front, responsive to detonation of the main charge <b>302</b>. For example, with a cylindrical shape, the fireball duration from the main charge from a module may be reduced to about 7 ms, as compared with fireball duration of about 140 ms when no fire retardant is used in a similarly shaped module. Thus, cylindrical modules in combination with use of fire retardant material may be utilized to essential eliminate the flame front from the explosion and provide an explosion essentially free from fire/burning.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A cylindrical structure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, also provides for convenient connection of modules to one another, and of module(s) to ancillary devices, as further described herein. It should be noted however, that other shapes and configurations of a module may be chosen and/or modules having different shapes and configurations in the same system may be desirable in some circumstances, such as addition of different ancillary devices to different modules.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system may be modular in that the explosive modules may be linked together or connected in an appropriate number and configuration for a given circumstance. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a connection piece, such as a separate booster/connector <b>400</b>A, which may have a hollow cavity or interior and be filled with an explosive charge or fire retardant material, may be used to connect modules, such as explosive modules A-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or modules and ancillary devices together. The explosive charge may be the same as used in the main charge <b>302</b>, or another appropriate material such that detonation of one explosive module, for example explosive module B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, facilitates detonation of other explosive module(s), such as explosive modules A and C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A standard connection piece, such as booster/connector <b>401</b>A supplied with the VMODS may be designed to initiate and/or connect modules. For example a standard connection piece allows connection of either an explosive module to another explosive module, or to an ancillary device such as ancillary device E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which may be a blasting cap modified to connect to an explosive module via the connecting piece. A booster/connector <b>400</b>A alone can also be used to link one module to another. In this manner, the connector's <b>400</b>A explosive fill propagates the detonation wave to the subsequent modules. As an example, for a system having modules of the example size noted above, connectors <b>400</b>A connecting such modules may contain an explosive fill material of approximately 18 grams, which may consist of PBXN 11 or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A booster/connector <b>400</b>A may have a shape and function similar to that of a pipe nipple, and be threaded <b>401</b>A on both ends around a central portion <b>402</b>A such that it may interface with (for example, be screwed into) threaded connector area(s) <b>306</b> (or wells thereof <b>309</b>) of an explosive module (or corresponding connector area of an ancillary device). The threads may thus anchor the booster/connector <b>400</b>A into one of the booster wells <b>309</b> on the side or the end of the module. It should be noted that the example connector areas <b>306</b> and connection piece <b>400</b>A, as with other components of the module <b>300</b>, may take a variety of forms, including for example having male and female connector area(s) formed in modules/ancillary devices at some locations such that an additional connection piece is not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, an example cross section of a booster/connector <b>400</b>B is illustrated. Again threaded portions <b>401</b>B are illustrated along with center portion <b>402</b>B. Here, booster/connector <b>400</b>B acts as a container for fill material <b>403</b>B, which may be selected as desired. For example, fill material <b>403</b>B may be comprised of an explosive material, such as PBNX-11, when booster/connector <b>400</b>B acts to connect two explosive modules, such as modules A, B, and C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, fill material <b>403</b>B may be composed of a fire retardant material, such as ammonium phosphate, when booster/connector <b>403</b>B acts to plug a non-connected connection area of a module (such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> with hexagonal bolts at the end of the plugs, not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A-B</figref>). Booster/connector <b>400</b>B may also server as a connection point for an adapter, such as an adapter for connecting an ancillary device, such as ancillary device E, as further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example of an adapter <b>510</b> is illustrated. The adapter <b>510</b> may be configured to facilitate connection to a booster/connector <b>500</b>, as for example by including a portion <b>530</b> that interfaces with booster/connector <b>500</b> threads. The adapter <b>510</b> may have another portion <b>520</b> suitably configured for connecting with an ancillary device, such as ancillary devices D and/or E of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a threaded adapter <b>510</b> with a detonator retainer <b>520</b> (for example, for retaining a blasting cap) that may be screwed onto a booster/connector <b>500</b> and used as an initiation device to provide a means of inserting a blasting cap (as indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and initiating a module <b>300</b> or system. With an adapter <b>510</b> installed, the booster/connector <b>500</b> may be used as an initiation booster to initiate a module <b>300</b> from either the side or the end. It should be noted that the measurements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which are in inches, are approximate measurements and represent only one example embodiment. Other measurements are contemplated, such as for use with different sized/shaped booster/connectors, different sized/shaped modules, and the like.</p>
