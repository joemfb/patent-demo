<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from expired U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/787,985, filed Mar. 31, 2006.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Companies that work together typically want to protect their proprietary information. This is particularly so in integrated circuit design and fabrication in which one company designs an integrated circuit and a different company manufactures it. Companies that design chips will typically not give detailed chip design information to the fabricator company. The design itself is important intellectual property of the chip design company. All the fabricator typically knows of the design is embodied in the fabrication mask or masks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result, when a manufactured device failure occurs, the fabricator company would typically have very little information to determine whether the failure is the result of a design flaw or a fabrication error because the fabricator company might have no design information other than the manufacturing mask or masks. The error analysis situation is much worse at production test, because only the pattern and design information are known.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides encrypted chip information that allows a failure analysis lab (FA Lab) to determine the location on a chip where a fault occurred. The failure analysis lab can then look at that location, such as with an electron microscope, to determine the cause of the failure. The failure analysis lab can determine if there was a flaw in the production, such as a solder fabrication flaw or contamination or poor metallization, or if the failure was caused by the original mask or design.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention resolves the problem that arises when the fabricators or the production engineers find an error or failure but do not have enough information to correctly diagnose the cause the error or failure. This occurs more often when the fabricators and designers are at different companies than when the fabricators and designers are at the same company. Without more information, fabricators might be inclined to believe that problems arise from designs, while designers might be inclined to believe that a problem is caused by the fabricator. The present invention allows resolution such problems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention provides encrypted information that allows a failure analysis lab to locate the exact location where a chip failure has occurred. The failure analysis lab can then look at the specific location, such as under an electron microscope, to determine if the problem is due to a process flow problem or fabrication error (for example, a solder fabrication flaw, contamination, or poor metallization). If no manufacturing problem is identified, then a design problem could be the cause of failure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention provides a secure information exchange, so the fabricator can quickly discover a physical location where design or production flaws might be present. Scan logs provide logical information, which allows the physical location of the failure to be determined. Previously, the fabricator would have to go to the original designer to obtain information to locate the flaw, which could take many months or worst cases the designer would not release the information at all.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof, which proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram generally illustrating prior art data flow in chip failure analysis and diagnostics. Failure data <b>10</b> indicating defects or failures in each manufactured integrated circuit device <b>12</b> are obtained during production tests (e.g., with wafer probes) and stored in scan logs <b>14</b>. Devices <b>12</b> are manufactured in lots <b>16</b> of wafers <b>18</b>. The failure data are analyzed, such as by the electronic design automation (EDA) software <b>20</b> used to design devices <b>12</b>, to identify logical defects that correspond to the failure data <b>10</b> in a device <b>12</b>. Localization software <b>22</b>, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,185,707 for &#x201c;IC Test Software System for Mapping Logical Functional Test Data of Logic Integrated Circuits to Physical Representation,&#x201d; determines physical locations in devices that correspond to the failure data, thereby allowing localized viewing of the locations to diagnose the cause of the failures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The process of diagnosing a logical defect candidate is time-consuming and often requires disclosure of sensitive, proprietary design information. With design and production commonly handled by different entities (e.g., different companies), the design entity will typically avoid disclosing design information to the production entity. In these situations, failure analysis diagnostics typically require a cumbersome, iterative and time-consuming exchange of failure data and logical design information to minimize or avoid disclosure of proprietary design details.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Prior art ATE (automatic test equipment) systems and EDA (electronic design automation) systems are &#x201c;data limited&#x201d; to their respective solution spaces. ATE systems can only handle so much data accumulation and does not provide diagnosing (on- or off-line). EDA systems provide the technology to be more precise in their logical analysis of failures, but only address the precision or defect candidacy one test at a time. Thus the focus of EDA solutions is typically the time to process the logical defect candidate and not the volumes of data aspects. The EDA DFT (design-for-test) market targets its technology to analyze logical defect candidates.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating data flow to a Test-For-Yield (TFY) chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> that manages and archives integrated circuit test and failure information in accordance with the present invention. Chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> is capable of managing and archiving high volume and very complex test data relating to multiple lots, wafers and devices in the manufacture of integrated circuits to provide secure identification of failure locations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> provides archiving and recall of specific failure data from databases <b>102</b> in a computer aided design (CAD) environment. The analysis performed on this failure data exposes the trends of behavior in the failing device or die, which in turn provides an indication of issues in the manufacturing or design processes, or both. Chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> includes a first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b>, a second level diagnostic manager <b>106</b>, and a third level diagnostic manager <b>108</b>, as described below in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of multiple (e.g., three) levels of device information managed and archived for a single wafer <b>110</b>. In this example, device information of Level <b>1</b> corresponds to scan information on the devices for each of multiple dies <b>112</b>, device information of Level <b>2</b> corresponds to defect information on the devices for each of the multiple dies <b>112</b>, and device information of Level <b>3</b> corresponds to net/poly information on the devices for each of the multiple dies <b>112</b>. It will be appreciated that chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> could obtain such information for each of multiple wafers <b>110</b> in each of multiple production lots, thereby resulting in a large volume of data.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> allows design and test to merge on one platform to diagnose defects in integrated circuits or chips without revealing proprietary design information, thereby avoiding delays or even the complete failure to resolve chip defects. Chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> accelerates the &#x201c;time-to-yield&#x201d; through the handling of information, such as failure data, with a methodology that links logical defects with physical locations (e.g., XY coordinates on a wafer or die) based on large volumes of test data.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This resultant link between the logical and the physical aspects of the solution references a statistical analysis of information based on empirical (real) failure data. The result may encompass not only one die, but several dies, exhibiting common failures occurring in the same test or test suite. Failure data, compiled from a single die, can be compared against other dies from the same wafer or from different wafers. This type of comparison will reveal common &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; among several dies when the same failure behavior is diagnosed. As a result, chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> utilizes high volume failure data handling to provide a higher probability of quickly diagnosing a defect. Rather than the random &#x201c;one at time&#x201d; nature of the prior art EDA methods, chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> allows a better logical candidate to be isolated when viewing failure data of several &#x201c;like&#x201d; die from the same test.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> employs encrypted delivery of suspect failure locations or coordinates for diagnosing failures to maintain confidentiality of circuit design details. Chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b> offers diagnostic information in different levels to provide a secure &#x201c;hand-off&#x201d; or exchange of logical defect candidacy with enough physical information that a failure analysis laboratory can use failure analysis equipment, such as an electron microscope or focused ion beam system, to observe candidate failure locations</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of a Test-For-Yield (TFY) chip diagnostics management method <b>120</b> employed by chip diagnostics management system <b>100</b>. In step <b>122</b>, failure data are accumulated from production tests (e.g., wafer probes) and are stored in one or more databases, such as databases <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The failure data may be stored with some assortment of &#x201c;tagged&#x201d; information to further identify or mark the failure information for further distinction. The variations of the tagging done on test information can include the type of tester, prober, wafer, lot, environmental conditions (e.g., set-up, temperature), parameters (e.g., voltage, device configuration) and test type (functional, parametric, scan) to name a few. It will be appreciated that this information for each of a number of failed tests for a given device, for the number of failing devices in a wafer and/or the wafers in a lot results in a large volume of data beyond that employed by conventional EDA analysis systems.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step <b>124</b>, the one or more databases are queried to retrieve the failure information to begin analysis in one or more categories of testing (e.g., functional, parametric, scan, etc). Failures from scan testing are a main, but not the sole, emphasis for this method. For example, there can be a specific database dedicated to scan testing. The amount of data referenced to scan patterns, scan chains and scan cells on a per die basis is significant. A query to the database can call out scan failure information, &#x201c;tagged&#x201d; with additional test information in regards to conditions and environment, and then place this information in the formats required by EDA tool analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">This format, typically called a &#x201c;pattern-based&#x201d; format, configures failure information to report pattern number of a scan pattern mismatch, the scan chain name, the scan cell index, actual value of the results in the scan cell and the expect value of the scan cell. Some testers also have the ability to write out failure files in this format. However, updates to the EDA failure file format occur infrequently, but enough to challenge the upkeep of testers and databases. Testers without this ability result in a more traditional &#x201c;cycle-based&#x201d; format, which may become part of the database depending on the tester providing the failed information.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In step <b>126</b>, failures are correlated with physical locations to determine failure locations of highest frequency. For example, the failure files provide the information on scan cells reporting failures. The physical information is provided by importing one or more Design Exchange Format (DEF) files containing the design-specific information of a circuit and is a representation of the design layout. DEF files convey logical design data to, and physical design data from, place-and-route tools. Logical design data can include internal connectivity (represented by a netlist), grouping information, and physical constraints. Physical data includes placement locations and orientations, routing geometry data, and logical design changes for back annotation. Scan information detailing scan chains and scan cell instance names are found in various pattern program formats such as STIL or WGL. They can also be found in various EDA DFT tool reports or files.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The &#x201c;pattern-based&#x201d; format in failure files at this step and this level of reporting via scan cells with the correlation of physical location is associated with first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b>, which provides correlation of physical design information to the scan cell reporting failures to determine &#x201c;hot spots&#x201d; at the die level. For example, the analysis performed at this level tabulates the scan cell instances reporting the number of times scan cells report failures within a test and/or suite of tests. When multiple dies are taken into consideration, the frequencies of how many times a particular pattern across several die comes into account. This type of behavior demonstrates a higher probability that a trend is occurring and that a similar or the same defect is occurring. The scan cell analysis performed at this level can be archived with the other information originally stored in the database and linked back to tests of the original query. First level diagnostic manager <b>104</b> is illustrated as communicating with database <b>102</b> through an optional client-server arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>128</b>, a graphical representation of the die having proportional physical dimensions is provided, together with an ability to scan cells of the design to highlight reported failures, thereby enabling quick reference for failure &#x201c;hot spots.&#x201d; For example, all scan cells reporting repeated failures are shown with color intensity to represent a contrast against other scan cells with a test or suite of tests. The same view can be representative of multiple dies to again highlight the scan cells reporting failures. Further value in this instance is the analysis performed in relation to common pattern information (e.g., repeats of common pattern numbers) that is repeated over several dies.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step <b>130</b>, the reference failure file from the database is formatted to an EDA format (or a tester output with similar ability to report failure files in EDA formats) and is forwarded to an EDA DFT (design-for-test) tool for analysis. The analysis performed by such tools results in logical defect candidacy in the form of the gate level with an associated instance name of that gate or associated instance names of that group of gates.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>132</b>, the results of the analysis by the EDA tool is obtained as a file reporting any or all of the gate, instance name, patterns associated with the detection and a possible brief description of the potential fault (stuck-at, bridging, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating second level diagnostic manager <b>106</b>, which generally corresponds to steps <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> and enables the invocation of EDA tools and the failure file management for the EDA DFT tool analysis process. The failure file or files are the targets of scripts for the EDA DFT tools, which are set up by the user, with the results of the EDA tool analysis, the defect candidate instance name, correlated to an XY coordinate and archived back into the database. The output defect candidate file, as in the case of the failure file, is archived back into the database with the other related failure information that was queried.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The correlation of defect candidates with the failing test data (failure files with any associated analysis from first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b>) provides the source of the next set of analysis. With the ability to track the logical defect candidates, the information compiled from the amount of failure data will result similar trends and graphical views, with color intensity, but at the gate level. The value at this level highlights at the gate in terms of how often a common gate cell is reported across multiple die with consideration for the wafer and lot. Further &#x201c;tagging&#x201d; at the gate level is now available for further trends analysis. The trends will help provide a greater degree of probability which is dependent on the number of times a gate, i.e., the instance name of the gate, is reported. This instance name with the XY coordinate is the deliverable to the FA lab. The random &#x201c;one defect at a time&#x201d; is now eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Reference data of the cells in the design and their respective XY coordinates are generated out of first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b> and second level diagnostic manager <b>106</b>. The information is encrypted for future downstream use of a diagnostic manager viewer <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which has a subset of features of diagnostic managers <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. The diagnostic manager viewer <b>140</b> targets usage in a failure analysis laboratory environment where only views of the failing cell XY coordinates against a blank backdrop of a physical view of the die is shown. This defines a location of a cell with a physical dimension reported as a failing element in the design where diagnosis can be initiated. Only the cells reporting failure are displayed in this viewer and nothing else is revealed, thereby preserving confidentiality of proprietary design information.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The diagnostic manager viewer <b>140</b> will read in the encrypted cross reference data generated out of the diagnostic managers <b>104</b> or <b>106</b>. Only when an encrypted or unencrypted XY coordinate is read in by the diagnostic manager viewer <b>140</b> will such a view be seen. Other features or subset of features found diagnostic managers <b>104</b> or <b>106</b> may be selectively enabled in the diagnostic manager viewer <b>140</b> at the discretion of the designer or other entity controlling confidentiality of proprietary design information.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The highest number of defects is typically found to be within the layers of the die rather than the substrate. Thus far, diagnostic managers <b>104</b> or <b>106</b> refer to the substrate cell level. The interpretation of the EDA DFT tool, though highlighting gate instance names, is in actuality the basis for the design cell interconnect, or net, information of the layers in the device. The reference to the gate in an EDA DFT tool is without reference to any physical information.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">More failure information given to the EDA DFT tool will, in theory, provide a more accurate logical defect candidacy. The issue is that the nodal information (with instance name) triggers the entire net information associated with a reported node of the cell, which can be large. The actual net information is inferred based on nodal information reported by the analysis of the EDA DFT tool.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, in step <b>142</b>, this gate level logical defect information is correlated with physical net information in terms of polygons. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating third level diagnostic manager <b>108</b>, which generally corresponds to step <b>142</b> and provides this correlation through integration of an &#x201c;IC Test Software System for Mapping Logical Functional Test Data of Logic Integrated Circuits to Physical Representation,&#x201d; such as that the physical mapping tool suite available from Knights Technology, now a part of Magma Design Automation Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Third level diagnostic manager <b>108</b> furthers the data flow management of the EDA DFT tools in second level diagnostic manager <b>106</b> to now include the net polygon determination in the physical mapping tool suite. The trends from the performed analysis on the archived defect candidates are recalled out of the database. This set of information provides conversion tools in the physical mapping tool suite the defect candidates with the highest occurrence of failures determined, and may also provide user-specified selections.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The information within the logical defect candidate files is the source of conversion in the physical mapping tool suite. The design data reference associates the contents of these files to the physical polygons and their XY coordinates of the design. As in first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b> and second level diagnostic manager <b>106</b>, the archiving of the net polygons now becomes part of the database along with the other information accumulated specific to the queried test data. The data management of the net polygon as in the case of failure file and the defect candidate handling, in first level diagnostic manager <b>104</b> and second level diagnostic manager <b>106</b>, respectively, will be valuable in diagnosing in third level diagnostic manager <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Diagnostics management system <b>100</b> protects proprietary design information from users of the test data whilst providing the users of the test data information that aids and speeds the manufacture of silicon chips. Diagnostics management system <b>100</b> achieves this while consolidating information about the device-under-test (DUT) from many different sources. Physical information on the design is gathered from the physical descriptions (LEF, DEF, GDS2, etc) and test information is also displayed. In the past, physical information and logical information has not been correlated to the degree that is accomplished by diagnostics management system <b>100</b>. Finally, failure analysis has previously been limited to the analysis of a failure of a single chip or a group of chips of the same design. Diagnostics management system <b>100</b> extends the art by identifying failures among common subcomponents that are used in different designs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, diagnostics management system <b>100</b> provides layered access to the design information by allowing properly licensed users access to the full design information while preventing access to detailed design information by less-privileged users. In one implementation, access is controlled in two steps, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. First, all the stored design information is secured (<b>150</b>) so it cannot be accessed except through diagnostics management system <b>100</b>. This is more secure than using the normal security of the host operating system because a less-privileged user is in control of the host operating system. The vital information is instead secured within the context of the diagnostics management system files, without using OS file-based security.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Second, layered access is provided via the granting of user rights or privileges (<b>152</b>) (e.g., correlated with licensing to intellectual property), whereby less-privileged users are given access to only enough information to get a general physical fault location without exposing the design information needed to determine the precise fault location, dimensions of the failing components, or logical composition of the affected areas.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Second, layered access is provided via the granting of user rights or privileges (<b>152</b>)(e.g., correlated with licensing to intellectual property), whereby less-privileged users are given access to only enough information to get a general physical fault location without exposing the design information needed to determine the precise fault location, dimensions of the failing components, or logical composition of the affected areas.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one implementation, limited or restricted access to design information may employ a set of Template Libraries and Design Specifications to define a chip design. As is known in the art, a template library defines types of components to be used in a design (e.g. a Library Exchange Format, or, &#x201c;LEF&#x201d; file), as well as their bounds and the bounds of their compositional elements on a per-physical-layer basis, and a design specification is one or more sources that define the physical placement of named components (cells) and routing details comprising a set of designs and/or a composite design (e.g. a Design Exchange Format, or, &#x201c;DEF&#x201d; file). These are generally instances of templates defined in an associated set of one or more Template Libraries. A hierarchy is established comprising a &#x201c;master&#x201d; design and any number of sub-designs and sub-components.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The components defined in each Design Specification are placed individually according to the coordinates and orientation indicated in the Design Specification and the width and height indicated for the component template in its Template Library. Full &#x201c;sub-designs&#x201d; may be placed as components of the over-all (&#x201c;master&#x201d;) chip design following the same process as component placement.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once all components and designs have been placed in the &#x201c;master&#x201d; design, the diagnostics management system <b>100</b> is able to create a cross-reference that maps every component name (even those contained in &#x201c;sub-designs&#x201d;) to a set of coordinates on the physical &#x201c;master&#x201d; design. These coordinates are in a coordinate space where the range of the axes is defined in the Design Specifications and the point specified by the coordinates is a function of the placement coordinates and orientation specified in the Design Specification and the width and height of the component as defined in the Template Library.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">By indicating what information beyond the name-to-coordinate mapping is to be included in the exported cross-reference, users of the diagnostics management system <b>100</b> is able to control precisely how much of their sensitive design information is available to external consumers of the cross-reference (e.g. users of the diagnostics management viewer <b>140</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Diagnostics management system <b>100</b> stores the physical design information as well as logical design information for a chip design. The diagnostics management system <b>100</b> correlates this information. For users with sufficient rights or privileges, diagnostics management system <b>100</b> displays both representations together, combining and matching the physical to the logical, thus providing a better frame of reference to the engineer analyzing the design or particular DUT in a failure analysis. The information is presented to such a user as they view the entire physical design. Any component of the design can be viewed with it logical and physical information at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Current failure analysis tools in the microelectronics industry allow users to view failure information for a single device-under-test (DUT) or group of DUTs of a single type. This is the case even though many DUTs share designing information for common sub components. There is no correlation of a failure of a sub-component that is used across multiple DUT types. The diagnostics management system <b>100</b> has available to it the full compositional hierarchy of the &#x201c;master&#x201d; design in each project. This covers both all instances of component definitions (e.g. logic gates) and placed instances of discrete sub-designs. The diagnostics management system <b>100</b> can correlate failure information across projects with the particular component template (e.g. a distinct physical definition of a type of logic gate) and can also correlate failure information across DUTs of different designs with common sub-designs (e.g. a memory blocks). Tracking these data allows a user of diagnostics management system <b>100</b> to trace failures amongst product lines to particular faults in their shared sub-components.</p>
