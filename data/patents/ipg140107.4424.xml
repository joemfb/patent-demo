<p id="p-0005" num="0021">The IEEE 802.16 working group has established a task group, 802.16m, to provide an advanced air interface which amends IEEE 802.16-2004, Air Interface for Fixed Broadband Wireless Access Systems, and also IEEE 802.16e, Air Interface for Fixed Broadband Wireless Access Systems, Amendment 2: Physical and Medium Access Control Layers for Combined Fixed and Mobile Operation in Licensed Bands and Corrigendum 1 (2005), in order to meet the requirements of next generation mobile networks. Reference may be had, for example, to IEEE 802.16 Broadband Wireless Access Working Group, IEEE 802.16m System Requirements, 2007-10-19.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0022">The foregoing referenced IEEE 802.16 standards were designed to support fixed, nomadic and mobile clients in a BWA network. These standards provide different scheduling services to satisfy the demands for various multimedia services. Link adaptation is used to enhance spectrum efficiency. Since the LA is performed by the BS, for a DL transmission an UL fast-feedback channel is needed to transmit the CQI. The fast-feedback channel is a PHY channel that does not require MAC decoding. The goal is to provide a low latency CQI signaling technique.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0023">A &#x201c;semidynamic&#x201d; technique to achieve a fast-feedback channel allocation has been adopted in current IEEE 802.16 systems. First, the BS sends an index to each SS (e.g., in a CQICH_Alloc_IE). If plural SSs have the same index they share the corresponding CQI channel. Then the BS dynamically allocates a fast-feedback region for every frame. Using the region information the SS can locate its own fast-feedback channel by using its own index. The index allocation may be considered as being semi-dynamic since related messages are designed to be transmitted only occasionally, while the fast-feedback region is allocated dynamically.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0024">This type of semi-dynamic method is relatively simple to implement, and is a generally efficient way to allocate fast-feedback channels to SSs. However, it can be wasteful of the fast-feedback channels under certain conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0025">One condition of interest occurs when a particular SS stops using the fast-feedback channel. In the current method messages such as CQICH_alloc_IE are needed to adjust the index of other SSs accordingly to avoid generating gaps in the fast-feedback region (i.e., some feedback channels are not used). In some particular use cases, for example a Web browser that frequently starts or stops downlink transmission, such index allocations can be required frequently.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0026">Another condition of interest concerns those SSs that may not require feedback at every frame. To accommodate this condition the CQICH control IE also assigns an interval number to SSs (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8). However, this technique does not guarantee a full occupation of the fast-feedback region. For example, assume a case of five users with an interval of eight. In this case some feedback channels are not utilized, thereby wasting bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0027">In practice the semi-dynamic mechanism may at least partially address this second problem. For example, since the interval can only be 1, 2, 4, 8, the BS can ensure that the fast-feedback channel is not fully occupied. Then the dynamical fast-feedback region allocation can ensure that no channels are wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0028">However, when considering the first and second problems together this solution will result in large numbers of index adjust messages being sent, which in turn requires a large signaling overhead. For example, when a low index SS is present the BS needs to adjust a series of SSs indices.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0029">To summarize, in IEEE 802.16e the SS is allocated a &#x201c;CQICH channel allocation index&#x201d; in the fast-feedback region for reporting CQI feedback, and a CQICH-Allocation IE is used for allocation and de-allocation of the fast-feedback channel. When the CQICH channel is once allocated it is fixed, and the SS reports periodic CQI feedback. No further signaling is transmitted. When the CQICH channel for a particular SS is allocated/de-allocated &#x201c;holes&#x201d; (unused UL bandwidth) can be created in the fast-feedback channel structure. If the presence of these holes is not addressed then resources are wasted. Alternatively, if some of the SS CQICH channels are reconfigured, then additional signaling overhead is required.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0047">In U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/008,094, filed Dec. 18, 2007, the inventors describe the use of dynamic CQICH shifting of the CQICH index for a case where each MS has one fast-feedback channel of fixed size. Recently requirements have arisen in IEEE 802.16m to have a flexible size of the fast-feedback channel so that various feedback types may be transmitted together. One possible result is that each MS has more than one CQICH (where the CQICH has a fixed size).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0048">Reference is made first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for illustrating a simplified block diagram of various electronic devices and apparatus that are suitable for use in practicing the exemplary embodiments of this invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a wireless network <b>1</b> is adapted for communication with a device, which may be referred to as a SS <b>10</b>, via a BS <b>12</b> over a wireless link <b>11</b>. The network <b>1</b> may include a network control element (NCE) <b>14</b> that provides connectivity to another network <b>16</b> or networks, such as the Internet. The SS <b>10</b> includes at least one controller embodied as a computer or data processor (DP) <b>10</b>A, a computer-readable memory medium embodied as at least one memory (MEM) <b>10</b>B that stores program instructions (PROG) <b>10</b>C, and a suitable radio frequency (RF) transceiver <b>10</b>D for bidirectional wireless communications with the BS <b>12</b>, which also includes at least one controller embodied as a computer or data processor (DP) <b>12</b>A, a computer-readable memory medium embodied as at least one MEM <b>12</b>B that stores a PROG <b>12</b>C, and a suitable RF transceiver <b>12</b>D. At least one of the PROGs <b>10</b>C and <b>12</b>C is assumed to include program instructions that, when executed by the associated DP, enable the electronic device to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as will be discussed below in greater detail. That is, the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be implemented at least in part by computer software executable by the DP <b>10</b>A of the SS <b>10</b> and by the DP <b>12</b>A of the BS <b>12</b>, or by hardware, or by a combination of software and hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0049">The SS <b>10</b> and the BS <b>12</b> will typically include a MAC layer <b>10</b>E, <b>12</b>E, and the SS <b>10</b> may include a codec <b>10</b>F that is useful for conducting voice communications.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0050">In general, the various embodiments of the SS <b>10</b> can include, but are not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) having wireless communication capabilities, portable computers having wireless communication capabilities, image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities, gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities, music storage and playback appliances having wireless communication capabilities, Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing, as well as portable units or terminals that incorporate combinations of such functions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0051">The MEMs <b>10</b>B and <b>12</b>B may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology, such as semiconductor based memory devices, flash memory, magnetic memory devices and systems, optical memory devices and systems, fixed memory and removable memory. The DPs <b>10</b>A and <b>12</b>A may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment, and may include one or more of general purpose computers, special purpose computers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs) and processors based on a multi-core processor architecture, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of this invention a bitmap is transmitted as an extended UL_MAP_IE, in which each bit represents whether a corresponding SS <b>10</b> (bitmap index allocated by the BS <b>12</b>) should use a fast-feedback channel or should not use a fast-feedback channel. In that the bitmap is broadcast to every SS <b>10</b>, a compact fast-feedback occupation can be achieved. For example, if the bit map is four bits that have states of:1010, then the SS <b>10</b> (user<b>1</b>) with &#x201c;bitmap index=1&#x201d; should send fast-feedback, but the user<b>2</b> (index=2) should not. The user<b>3</b> (index=3) can determine that it should occupy fast-feedback channel <b>2</b>, since it can be readily seen from the broadcast bitmap that user<b>2</b> will not occupy fast-feedback channel <b>2</b>. In general, since the bitmap is broadcast to all of the SSs <b>10</b> that communicate with the BS <b>12</b>, each SS <b>10</b> can determine itself which fast-feedback channel it should occupy.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0053">Note in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that the fast-feedback region is divided into two parts, where the first part uses original (conventional) semi-dynamical CQI channel allocations, while the second part uses the bitmap of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with the dynamical allocation technique that is a non-limiting aspect of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0054">In general, if bitmap[index]==1 for a given SS <b>10</b>, then &#x201c;User actual occupied channel index&#x201d;=&#x201c;bitmap index&#x201d;&#x2212;&#x201c;number of zeroes before bitmap index&#x201d;; while if bitmap [index]=0, the SS <b>10</b> does not use the fast-feedback channel in the current frame.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0055">In order to reduce overhead it is desirable to limit the length of the bitmap. The BS <b>12</b> determines which SSs <b>10</b> are assigned a one in the bitmap index, and the BS <b>12</b> may send a message to assign or dismiss the bitmap index to/from any SS <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0056">By the use of these exemplary embodiments the SSs <b>10</b> occupy the fast-feedback channels compactly, and there is no wasted bandwidth due to gaps between actually used fast-feedback channels. In addition, the use of this technique provides a mechanism to flexibly turn on/off any fast-feedback channel in a dynamic manner. This is an important advantage due to the nature of the DL traffic, which in many cases is not constant (e.g., when the SS <b>10</b> is using a web browser).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0057">Considering backwards compatibility, the UL-MAP-IE with UIUC=0 to dynamically allocate the fast-feedback region is maintained. In every frame this UL-MAP-IE dynamically indicates the fast-feedback region.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0058">The BS <b>12</b> determines whether a given SS <b>10</b> should use the dynamic fast-feedback allocation or should not use it. If a given SS <b>10</b> should use the dynamic fast-feedback, the BS <b>12</b> sends the bitmap index to the SS <b>10</b>. There are at least two options for allocating the bitmap index for users. A first option defines a new message IE for the bitmap index. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a non-limiting example of a new message IE for indicating to the SS <b>10</b> the bitmap index. A second option reuses the CQICH_Alloc_IE to transmit the bitmap index. Reference in this regard can be made to the Table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. For example, if the 2-bit Period field of the CQICH_Alloc_IE is (p!=3), the CQI feedback is transmitted on the CQICH every 2<sup>p </sup>frames, else the bitmap technique is used where the allocation offset is the bitmap index. The remainder of the CQICH_Alloc_IE may be as specified in IEEE 802.16e (pages 468-471, Section 8.4.5.4.12, CQICH Allocation IE Format).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0059">For those SSs <b>10</b> with bitmap indexes, and as an example, the channel index begins from the end of the dynamically allocated feedback region towards the beginning. In this manner the semi-dynamic (conventional) method can be used together with the dynamical fast-feedback allocations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0060">A limited number of SSs <b>10</b> may use bitmap method due to a limited length of the bitmap. For those SSs <b>10</b> using the semi-dynamic method, the CQICH_Control_IE or CQICH_Alloc_IE may still be used for the allocation index (not the bitmap index). For example, for those SSs <b>10</b> needing to feedback in every frame, these users may have a constant interval of feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0061">The use of the bitmap in every frame enables the fast-feedback region to be fully occupied, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0062">Based on the foregoing it should be apparent that exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a method, apparatus and computer program(s) to enhance the provision of fast-feedback channel usage in a dynamic (e.g., frame-by-frame) manner.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a method comprises (Block <b>5</b>A) determining fast-feedback channel allocations for a plurality of mobile devices at a base station; and (Block <b>5</b>B) broadcasting in a point-to-multipoint manner a bitmap to the plurality of mobile devices, the bitmap defining dynamic fast-feedback uplink channel usage for individual ones of the plurality of mobile devices, the bit map informing each of the plurality of mobile devices of whether they are permitted to use a dynamic fast-feedback channel, and further enabling those mobile devices that are permitted to use to a dynamic fast-feedback channel to determine which one of a plurality of dynamic fast-feedback channel they are to use.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a further method comprises (Block <b>6</b>A) receiving a broadcast bitmap at a mobile device, the bitmap defining dynamic fast-feedback uplink channel usage for individual ones of a plurality of mobile devices and informing each of the plurality of mobile devices of whether they are permitted to use a dynamic fast-feedback channel, and (Block <b>6</b>B) if permitted by the bitmap, using a certain dynamic fast-feedback channel that is determined at least in part from the bitmap to transmit uplink feedback information to a base station.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0065">The methods of the preceding paragraphs, where the dynamic fast-feedback channels to be used begin at an end of a fast-feedback channel region, and are allocated sequentially and without gaps to the mobile devices in a direction towards a beginning of the fast-feedback channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0066">The method of the preceding paragraph, where a beginning part of the fast-feedback channel region is used for semi-static feedback channel allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0067">The method of the preceding paragraphs, where broadcasting occurs in a downlink sub-frame on a frame-by-frame basis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0068">The method of the preceding paragraphs, where the mobile device is instructed whether to use or not use the broadcast bitmap in Period field of a CQICH_Alloc_IE.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0069">Having thus described the exemplary embodiments of the invention in accordance with the disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/008,094, what follows is a description of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention that provide enhanced dynamical fast-feedback channel allocations.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0070">It can be noted with respect to the procedures in accordance with the disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/008,094 that the BS <b>12</b> may not transmit the bitmap in each frame and, in this case, the SS <b>10</b> may use the original CQICH to transmit the CQI.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0071">In accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, multiple bitmaps are broadcast from the BS <b>12</b> to the SSs <b>10</b>. The SSs <b>10</b> are assigned an index for each bitmap (the index in bitmap<b>1</b> may be the same as the conventionally-assigned CQICH index). Upon receiving the bitmaps (e.g., bitmap<b>1</b> and bitmap<b>2</b>) the SS <b>10</b> locates its corresponding bit (based on its index) in each received bitmap, and then concatenates all bits together as an indication of how many fast-feedback channels it should occupy. The BS <b>12</b> may use a virtual index for the SS <b>10</b> in some particular bitmap (not in bitmap<b>1</b>) if desired. In this case the bit indicated by the virtual index is always considered as a 0 (zero) by the corresponding SS <b>10</b> that has knowledge of the virtual index value.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0072">Note that a given SS <b>10</b> may be assigned the same index value for each bitmap, or it may be assigned a first index value for bitmap<b>1</b>, and a second, different, index value for bitmap<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0073">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which assumes the non-limiting case of two bitmaps, the SSs <b>10</b> associated with user indices <b>1</b> and <b>9</b> each receive a 1 bit in bitmap<b>1</b> and a 1 bit in bitmap<b>2</b>. Concatenating these two bits together yields 11=3 fast-feedback channels that are assigned to each of these SSs. The SSs <b>10</b> associated with user indices <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> each receive a 0 bit in bitmap<b>1</b> and a 0 bit in bitmap<b>2</b>. Concatenating these two bits together yields 00=0 fast-feedback channels that are assigned to each of these SSs. The SSs <b>10</b> associated with user indices <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> each receives a 1 bit in bitmap<b>1</b>, and a default 0 bit in the virtual index of bitmap<b>2</b>. Concatenating these two bits together yields 01=1 fast-feedback channel that is assigned to each of these SSs. Further by example, the SSs <b>10</b> associated with user indices <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> each receive a 0 bit in bitmap<b>1</b> and a 1 bit in bitmap<b>2</b>. Concatenating these two bits together yields 10=2 fast-feedback channels that are assigned to each of these SSs. The SS <b>10</b> associated with user index <b>8</b> receives a 0 bit in bitmap<b>1</b> and a default 0 bit in the virtual index of bitmap<b>2</b>. Concatenating these two bits together yields 00=0 fast-feedback channels. In general, the starting point is determined by the number of 1s before the index. In bitmap<b>2</b>, and considering user index <b>7</b>, there are 2 &#x201c;1&#x201d; bits ahead of the index, and 3 &#x201c;1&#x201d; bits in bitmap<b>1</b>. As a result, user <b>7</b> occupies two fast-feedback channels starting at fast-feedback channel <b>8</b> (2*2+3*1+1). Note that if three bitmaps are transmitted, then there is a possibility to assign up to 111=7 fast-feedback channels to a particular SS <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0074">This approach thus provides a compact technique to achieve fast-feedback channel assignments to a plurality of SSs <b>10</b>. Using this enhanced dynamic fast-feedback channel allocation procedure the BS <b>12</b> can allocate multiple fast-feedback channels to any particular SS <b>10</b> using little signaling overhead, enabling a particular SS <b>10</b> to have a variable number of bits of feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0075">Considering backwards compatibility, the UL-MAP-IE with UIUC=0 to dynamically allocate fast-feedback region may be retained, and in every frame the UL-MAP-IE dynamically indicates the fast-feedback region.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0076">Then BS <b>12</b> decides whether to send CQICH shifting indices at every frame or sub-frame. Upon receiving the bitmap(s) the SS <b>10</b> shifts its CQICH index accordingly and transmits corresponding feedback in this frame. The use of the bitmap in every frame enables full occupation on fast-feedback region to be accomplished, thereby efficiently using the UL resource, and the use of multiple bitmaps provides support for the case where a particular SS <b>10</b> has more than one CQICH.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0077">It should be noted that the BS <b>12</b> need not send the bitmap in every frame or subframe. It should be further noted that, as stated above, a particular SS <b>10</b> need not be assigned the same index value in each bitmap. For example, in the first bitmap a particular SS <b>10</b> may be assigned index p<b>1</b>, while in the second bitmap the same SS <b>10</b> may be assigned index value p<b>2</b>, where p<b>1</b> does not equal p<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0078">Further in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention the BS <b>12</b> may repack the fast feedback region by a permanent shifting of the CQICH channel allocations of all active SSs <b>10</b> in a particular frame. This procedure may be used to remove all the holes in the fast feedback region, and may be used by the BS <b>12</b> if it determines that more holes are created in fast feedback region because of allocation/de-allocation of some SSs <b>10</b>, and that the cost of the overhead associated with the permanent shifting of the CQICH channels of the SSs <b>10</b> is less than the benefit achieved by removing the holes. The decision as to when to apply the repacking of the fast feedback region (permanent shifting) may thus be considered to be implementation specific.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079">Note that in this particular embodiment the bitmap may be sent but once by the BS <b>12</b>. If the BS <b>12</b> desires to shift the CQICH index once more, then the bitmap is sent again.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">When shifting the CQICH allocation index permanently there are several considerations that may be taken into account by the BS <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0081">For example, as the BS <b>12</b> transmits the bitmap in the MAP (broadcast signaling), and one or more of the SSs <b>10</b> may not decode MAP correctly, there may be a possibility of collision.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0082">There are, however, proposals to handle the MAP decoding error if the bitmap is transmitted in that MAP.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0083">There are two methods defined in IEEE 802.16e for sending CQI feedback. The first uses the CQICH channel (a maximum of a 6-bit information payload can be transmitted). The second uses a feedback header (a maximum of a 30-bit information payload can be transmitted).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0084">While the following approaches are made with respect to the CQICH channel, these approaches are equally applicable to both the CQICH channel and the feedback header for the fast feedback channel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0085">Approach 1:</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0086">When the BS <b>12</b> transmits the CQICH bitmap to repack the fast-feedback region, it requests an acknowledgment (ACK) from the SSs <b>10</b>. If the BS <b>12</b> does not receive an ACK from one or more of the SSs <b>10</b>, it assumes that those SSs <b>10</b> are still using the previous CQICH channels. The BS <b>12</b> then reconfigures the CQICH channel of those SSs <b>10</b> using unicast signaling, or it may retransmit the bitmap.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0087">The SSs <b>10</b> thus have two possible actions, either they send the ACK to acknowledge successful receipt and decoding of the MAP, or they send nothing because of a failure to receive the MAP. The CQICH or ACK channel is thus preferably configured to allow the BS <b>12</b> to detect the absence of an ACK from a particular SS <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0088">The ACK may be sent via a separate (HARQ) ACK channel (when the SS <b>10</b> fails to decode the MAP, it sends nothing), or the ACK may be sent via the previous (old) CQICH channel (e.g., the SS <b>10</b> may send an independent codeword along with the CQI feedback).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0089">An optional shared NAK channel may be used in a case where the SS <b>10</b> fails to decode the MAP. The location of the shared NAK channel may be predefined by system broadcast information.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0090">The BS <b>12</b> may indicate within the bitmap IE the transaction ID and start offset of the usage of the new CQICH index. This allows sufficient time for re-transmission of the bitmap/configuration in the case where at least one SS <b>10</b> was unable to correctly decode the bitmap.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0091">If the SS <b>10</b> has already sent the ACK via the old CQICH channel, it need not send it again if it finds the repeated bitmap in a following MAP transmission from the BS <b>12</b>. If the BS <b>12</b> detects a NAK in the shared NAK channel, the BS <b>12</b> knows that at least one SS <b>10</b> has failed to decode the MAP, while if it receives an ACK from all SSs <b>10</b> of interest, it may ignore the received NAK indication.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0092">After the start offset period expires all SSs <b>10</b> begin to send feedback in the corresponding channels. Whenever the BS <b>12</b> detects that nothing has been sent out by a SS <b>10</b> on any CQICH or ACK channel, the BS <b>12</b> assumes a signaling error to the corresponding SS <b>10</b> (MAP decoding error), and the BS <b>12</b> may reassign the index to that particular SS <b>10</b> by using unicast signaling, or by re-transmitting the same bitmap. If the number of re-assignments that are needed is excessive, the BS <b>12</b> may select to trigger another permanent shift.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0093">Approach 2:</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0094">In this alternative approach the BS <b>12</b> repeats the bitmap in consecutive MAPs (e.g., in two or three consecutive MAPs). In this case the probability of consecutive MAP decoding is very low (e.g., 0.1%-0.01%). When bitmap is repeated the BS <b>12</b> provides the frame offset where the same bitmap was transmitted for the first time, and also a retransmission flag to indicate that the bitmap message is a repeated message. In this manner the SS <b>10</b> can determine whether it was able to decode that MAP, and if not it may then determine whether the SS <b>10</b> was to send feedback. If the SS <b>10</b> was to send feedback it adjusts its CQICH channel allocation index automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0095">If the SS <b>10</b> successfully decodes the bitmap the first time (or a subsequently re-transmitted bitmap), it ignores a further repeated bitmap that arrives with a higher offset.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0096">When the BS <b>12</b> detects a collision in a particular channel, or that nothing has been transmitted in a particular channel), it reconfigures the CQICH channel of the associated SSs <b>10</b> using unicast signaling, or by re-transmitting the bitmap again. If the BS <b>12</b> does not detect a collision it need not repeat the bitmap.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0097">The end result of the use of either of these two approaches is that the SSs <b>10</b> compactly occupy the feedback channels, thereby minimizing wasted bandwidth in the fast-feedback region.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0098">The end result of the use of either of these two approaches is that there is provided a simple and efficient way of repacking the fast feedback region by permanently shifting the CQICH channel (feedback channel).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0099">The BS <b>12</b> may implement this repacking of the fast-feedback region, and use it dynamically, when the benefit of using it is greater than the additional signaling overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a further logic flow diagram depicting a method, and the result of execution of computer program instructions, for the BS <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.
