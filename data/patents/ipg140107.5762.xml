<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, details and embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the inventive subject matter. The various embodiments disclosed herein are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some embodiments can be combined with one or more other embodiments to form new embodiments. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an architecture for operation of wireless entities to transfer informational content using wireless infrastructure. The example architecture includes a group coordinator <b>105</b> that provides a variety of services to a group <b>110</b> of mobile wireless devices. The mobile wireless devices may include, but are not limited to, mobile telephones, portable computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other devices that may be conveniently carried by a user and provide wireless communication. Mobile telephones include wireless communication devices that have generally been referred to as cell phones. Mobile telephones may include a wide range of communication devices from portable phones with limited functionality beyond voice communication to portable phones capable of providing the functionality of a personal computer. A personal computer (PC) herein refers to computing devices having an operating system (OS) such that use of the personal computer may be conducted by individuals having little or no knowledge of the basics of the underlying hardware and software that operate the PC and whose operation may be conducted without individuals typically authoring computer programs to operate the computer. Portable computers may include portable personal computers (PC)s. An example of a portable PC is a laptop computer or notebook computer that typically has a display screen, keyboard, underlying hardware and software, and a display pointing device that are all integrated in a housing that can easily be carried by an individual. Some PDAs may be viewed as a type of portable computer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Group coordinator <b>105</b> includes instrumentality to manage the operation of group <b>110</b> of mobile wireless devices under a common criterion or a common set of criteria. Group coordinator <b>105</b> controls dissemination of information among group <b>110</b>. In some instances, the information may be shared between one or more of the mobile wireless devices in group <b>110</b>. In some instances, the information may be shared to less than all the mobile wireless devices in group <b>110</b>. A privacy status may be used to maintain and regulate the privacy of the information relative to both members of group <b>110</b> and entities external to group <b>110</b>. The instrumentality can be realized in hardware implementations, software implementations, and combinations of hardware and software implementations. Some portions of the instrumentalities may be described in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a machine memory. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. The instrumentality may operate to process, compute, calculate, determine, display, and/or conduct other activities correlated to processes of a machine such as a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices. The instrumentality may provide personalized capabilities, provide a pathway to other content, or combinations thereof. The instrumentality may use distributed applications, different numbers and types of software based components that couple two or more applications to enable data transfer between the applications, hardware to provide services from a number of different sources, and may be realized on a variety of platforms such as servers and content management systems. The instrumentality may include or provide access to subroutine code, code libraries, application program interfaces such as interpreters utilizing Java EE&#x2122;, Simple DirectMedia Layer&#x2122; (SDL) and DirectX&#x2122;, combinations thereof, or other such electronic based functionalities.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Group Coordinator <b>105</b> may access information sources <b>115</b> using interconnection communication facilities <b>120</b>. Information sources <b>115</b> may include a wide variety of sources that provide informational content in various formats. Information sources <b>115</b> may include informational content in an open format without restrictions on what entities may access the informational content. Information sources <b>115</b> may include informational content in an open format requiring registration by the entities to the informational content without further restrictions. Information sources <b>115</b> may include informational content accessible based on a subscription to the informational content. Information sources <b>115</b> may include informational content accessible under a privacy condition administered by the corresponding information sources <b>115</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows features of an embodiment of method including a mobile wireless device accessing and controlling an application executable on a wireless server. In various embodiments, the application may be different from an application to maintain and control a wireless communication link between the mobile wireless device and the wireless server. At <b>810</b>, an application executable on a wireless server is accessed from a mobile wireless device. The mobile wireless device has an authorization to access the application as a member of the share group of the wireless server. The authorization may be correlated to the SRP key of the mobile wireless device that is also stored on the wireless server. Various types of applications in the wireless server may be accessed by the mobile wireless device. For example, a data manipulation application that performs complex computations (&#x201c;data crunching&#x201d;) that uses a large amount of memory may be accessed to run in a server rather than the mobile wireless device. The application may be reside in the wireless server. In an embodiment, the application is virtually resident on the wireless server. The virtual residency occurs with the application stored in another server that is accessible by the wireless server. In an embodiment, an application to control and/or monitor functions of a facility is accessed. The application may control and/or monitor, for a facility, one or more of a heating management, lighting management, water management, physical security, management of a web cam. An application to control and/or monitor functions of facilities different from the primary facility may be accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an embodiment, the mobile wireless device receives data regarding the application from the wireless service. The received data may be used to display a graphical user interface on the mobile wireless device, where the graphical user interface is operable to initiate commands for the application. Alternatively, data for a graphical user interface to control and/or manage an application may be stored in the mobile wireless device. The graphical user interface of the mobile wireless device may mirror the graphical user interface that the wireless server has to control and/or manage the application through user interaction. The graphical user interface of the mobile wireless device may have a reduced set of features in common with the graphical user interface of the wireless server to control and/or manage the application through user interaction. With the initiation of commands in the mobile wireless device, the underlying processing of the application, directed by the commands, is performed on the wireless server.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">At <b>820</b>, a command is sent from the mobile wireless device to the wireless server to execute a feature of the application. The feature may be different from features to maintain and control a wireless communication link between the mobile wireless device and the wireless server. The mobile wireless device may receive a result of the execution of the feature in the wireless server. A computational result may be provided with a complete analysis including various graphs and flow charts. A result from a monitoring application may be provided with an operational status of a facility including a current value of the status, a history of the status, and a trending analysis of the status. For an application of a video cam, the result received in the mobile wireless device may be a video of activity monitored by the video cam. For example, a video of a storage facility may be provided to monitor the security of the storage facility. A video of a child's living areas may allow a parent to monitor activity of the child and the care provider of the child.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In an embodiment, a privacy status may be generated in the mobile wireless device and operatively attached to the results from executing the application in the wireless server.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In various embodiments, the ability to run home control or home monitoring programs may be realized using the secure connection from a home wireless server to a UE. Various devices, such as but not limited to cameras, baby-sound-detection equipment, other baby monitors, personal devices, personal programs, and other personal monitoring devices can be coupled to a home-based wireless server that controls access to the UE through a network such as made available by a network provider. Similarly, this allows for the private monitoring of small businesses, including remote, secure access of inventory control figures, production figures, monitoring of stocking areas and warehouses for shrinkage control, making sure off-hours personnel at public counters are not being threatened, and similar situations amenable to monitoring solutions. The various devices may be configured to provide outputs that may be monitored by the UE through the home-based wireless server both securely as well as without use of a third party and/or without making the output publicly available such as being broadcast over an internet type facility. Such an arrangement allows an individual user of the UE and the wireless server to avoid being forced to use third party monitoring services to obtain such personal monitoring. In addition, such an arrangement allows an individual user to maintain privacy with respect to one's home, business, and personal life by not making the monitored output accessible over public internets. The secure monitoring of the home and/or business may be provided with the output from monitoring devices being providing as encrypted data.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an embodiment of an arrangement of a home-based wireless server <b>970</b> coupled to home personal monitoring equipment <b>980</b> with the home-based wireless server <b>970</b> communicatively coupled with a mobile wireless client <b>850</b>. The various components of home personal monitoring equipment <b>980</b> may be distributed throughout a home. Each component may be configured to perform a different personal monitoring function. The home personal monitoring equipment <b>980</b> may include, but is not limited to, cameras, baby-sound-detection equipment, other baby monitors, personal devices, personal programs, and other personal monitoring devices. The components of home personal monitoring equipment <b>980</b> may be coupled to home wireless server via a direct connection or on a local area network. The direct connection or the local area network may be a wired connection, a wireless connection, or a combination of wired and wireless connections. The local area network may be a home Wi-Fi network, either secure or unsecure. Home-based wireless server <b>970</b> may be operatively coupled to UE <b>850</b> over network <b>860</b>. Network <b>860</b> may be any operable connection, including the use of private local networks and/or commercial providers. Home-based wireless server <b>970</b> may also be operatively coupled to other UEs associated with members of the home in which home-based wireless server <b>970</b> is located, where these other UEs are wireless clients registered with home-based wireless server <b>970</b>. Home-based wireless server <b>970</b>, UE <b>850</b>, and the other wireless clients of home-based wireless server <b>970</b> may be configured according to the various embodiments for wireless servers and multiple-mode mobile wireless devices discussed herein.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, there is illustrated an example system and method for using a mobile wireless client with more than one wireless server. According to one example embodiment, there is provided a first wireless server <b>1002</b> communicatively operable with a plurality of mobile wireless clients such as mobile wireless client <b>1004</b>. The first wireless server includes for example, as described herein elsewhere, configuration data associated with at least one, such as client <b>1004</b>, of the plurality of mobile wireless clients supported by the wireless server <b>1002</b>, and a database operable on the server and configured to store information associated with users of the mobile wireless clients including a user identification for each mobile wireless client. Wireless server <b>1002</b> further includes a program configured to control dissemination of information from the first database to one or more of the plurality of mobile wireless clients.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Wireless server <b>1002</b> further stores or maintains at least one policy <b>1006</b> that is associated with one of the mobile wireless clients, for example client <b>1004</b>. Policy <b>1006</b> may be used to govern permissible modes of operation of the client <b>1004</b>, and to establish various operating parameters, such as what type of Internet access is permitted with the wireless client or the type or duration of telephone calls that may be placed using the client <b>1004</b>. Other uses for policy <b>1006</b> further include allowing or disallowing users to of the mobile wireless client to enable or disable certain features of the client <b>1004</b>, such as password protected operation.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, policy <b>1006</b> may include various policy information including but not limited to the author <b>1022</b> of the policy, an identification <b>1024</b> of any servers authorized to update or modify the policy <b>1006</b> or individual permissions or settings of the policy (such as settings <b>1026</b>, <b>1028</b> and <b>1030</b>). The policy <b>1006</b> may further, for example, authorize <b>1026</b> the wireless client <b>1004</b> to work with other wireless servers, such as server <b>1010</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, to support wireless e-mail or calendaring and other server functions provided by the other server <b>1010</b>, as described herein. Policy <b>1006</b> may further specify one or more other policy settings <b>1028</b> to <b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Wireless server <b>1002</b> further includes a policy service <b>1008</b> that allows a user of the wireless server <b>1002</b> to prescribe a policy <b>1006</b> for one or more mobile wireless clients, and in particular client <b>1004</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Service <b>1008</b> further provides that the policy <b>1006</b> may be downloaded to wireless client <b>1004</b>, if permitted. Such downloading may be directed or controlled by a policy download or modification program <b>1005</b> on the wireless client <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to one example embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, a mobile wireless client <b>1004</b> may be initially loaded <b>1032</b>, for example at the factory or after being initialized, with an &#x201c;initial&#x201d; policy, such as a policy set by the factory. That policy may allow, for example, for it to be replaced with a user-prescribed policy that is loaded <b>1034</b> on the mobile wireless client <b>1004</b> for example from the first wireless server <b>1002</b>. This would typically be handled by the UE's UEPA. The policy loaded by the server <b>1002</b> may specify, for example, that no other wireless server such as server <b>1010</b>, may replace or modify, in whole or in part, the policy loaded by the server <b>1002</b>, thereby precluding the policy from being changed by any server other than server <b>1002</b>. Thus, any attempt <b>1036</b> to load another policy causes the mobile wireless client <b>1004</b> (or alternatively the server attempting to modify the policy) to check the policy currently loaded on the wireless client to determine if <b>1038</b> the policy may be changed or replaced. If it may be, the new policy or changes to the policy, such as individual settings, may be made <b>1040</b>. If the policy may not be changed by the server requesting to do so, the policy is prevented <b>1042</b> from being replaced or modified. Accordingly, in this respect, the policy establishes that one of the servers such as server <b>1002</b> is a primary server that controls all policy permissions and changes, and the other server <b>1010</b> is a secondary server that may not override policies set by the primary server <b>1002</b> unless permitted to do so by the policy set by server <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In an embodiment, wireless server <b>1002</b> includes a flag or field, stored on wireless server <b>1002</b>, that indicates if the UEPA on a registered UE, such as UE <b>1004</b>, can modify the policies of wireless server <b>1002</b> at UE <b>1004</b>. This flag or field may be referred to as a policy modify flag, or, if the context is clear, simply as a modify flag. In some embodiments the modify flag can be a single bit, having the values T or F (1 or 0). Alternatively, the modify flag may be more complex and be enabled to indicate under what conditions polices may be modified. One embodiment of a more complex modify flag includes the identity of other servers that are allowed to override the policy of this server, while other servers are not. Any combination of policies is possible, as defined by the servers' SPAs and the UE's UEPA, but some are more probable than others. For example, the SPA of wireless server <b>1002</b> may have a policy of logical truth where &#x201c;T&#x201d;, or yes, defined to mean any UEPA configuration is allowed, which may be used in benign environments. Alternatively the SPA may have a policy of &#x201c;F&#x201d;, or no, defined to mean that no modification of a policy may be made by the UEPA. In an embodiment, &#x201c;F&#x201d;, or no, may also indicate that implementation of an arbitrary UEPA configuration is not allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Thus, according to one embodiment, a first wireless server <b>1002</b>, such as a corporate or enterprise server, may establish a policy to be loaded on a wireless client <b>1004</b>, wherein that policy may allow the client <b>1004</b> to work with other wireless servers such as server <b>1010</b> that may be established for the family members or other small group associated with the user of the client <b>1004</b>. The authorizations may include permission for the server <b>1004</b> to synchronize with other e-mail services and domains, such as the user's private or non-business e-mail address, or provide other services such as calendaring between the users of the server <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Each wireless server, such as wireless servers <b>1002</b> and <b>1010</b> that operate with UE <b>1004</b>, has its own SPA, where UE <b>1004</b> is in a multiple registered mode with wireless servers <b>1002</b> and <b>1010</b>. The SPA of each server may have different policies for different UEs registered with the server even though these different UEs share information. To facilitate different sets of policies for different UEs, the SPA may be realized as a group of SPAs within the server with each SPA assigned to direct subsets of the different UEs. The subsets may consist of one UE.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In one configuration of an SPA, the SPA may have a policy that places no controls on UE <b>1004</b> such that any activity on connected UE <b>1004</b> is allowable. In some embodiments, there may be one or more servers that have no SPA (typically, already existing servers) which will often mean there will be no modify flag. Servers can provide a modify flag without a SPA, but these are currently expected to be a minority embodiment. In some embodiments, the UEPA may be set to recognize a server's or provider's identity and apply a preprogrammed set of modification rules in the UE, so no flag is needed. The UEPA of a UE connected to a server/provider with no modify flag and no preprogrammed modification rules can be provided with a default. The default action may be set by the UE provider, or may be selectable by the user in some embodiments. In one embodiment, when there is no modify flag and no preprogrammed set of modify rules corresponding to a server or provider, the UEPA is set to interpret the no-modify-flag condition as one of either &#x201c;T&#x201d; or &#x201c;F&#x201d;. &#x201c;T&#x201d; means that the UEPA will either allow policy modifications to this server's/provider's policies, and, this server/provider will take lower precedence as compared to other servers/providers. &#x201c;F&#x201d; means that no policy modifications may be made to this server's/provider's policies, and, this server/provider takes higher precedence as compared to other servers/providers. In higher security environments, the default is expected to be &#x201c;T&#x201d;, since a server/provider with no modify flag or preprogrammed modify rules will be interpreted as a higher-risk connection. Any server in a setting where security is more than nominal, which does not have a modify flag (and therefore probably no SPA), may not the primary server for the UE. That is, in high security environments, the primary or dominant server should always be current in software settings, should have an SPA, and should have a modify flag. If the user connects to a server having no modify flag (and typically no SPA), it may be assumed that it is a secondary server of unknown security (not trusted). In such a case, the UEPA, which assigns modify values, should use a default value of &#x201c;T&#x201d; for the modify value for the untrusted server, meaning that policies of the untrusted server are presumed modifiable in accordance with other, more trusted servers' policies.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In an embodiment, a UE, such as UE <b>1004</b>, is registered among multiple wireless servers, such as wireless servers <b>1002</b> and <b>1010</b>, though UE <b>1004</b> is not limited to registering with two wireless servers, where the UEPA of UE <b>1004</b> receives policy information from each of the SPAs of wireless servers <b>1002</b> and <b>1010</b>. The SPAs of multiple wireless servers, such as wireless servers <b>1002</b> and <b>1010</b>, may have a hierarchical order in terms of which SPA provides policies fully implemented by the UEPA. A hierarchy may be implemented as simple dominance in which one SPA's policies are implemented and policies of other SPAs are not used at all. For example, if the user of the UE is a registered member of a corporate server and a home-based wireless server in which the corporate server is designated as dominant and has a policy of not sharing information outside the registered members of the corporate server, then a policy of assigning different sharing status for the UE with different members of the home-based server may not be implemented in the UE. Alternatively, the non-sharing information may be limited to information acquired through the corporation server such that a portion of the non-dominant servers policy to assign different sharing status may be implemented with respect to information acquired other than through the corporate server. Hierarchies may be implemented as subsets, that is, one SPA may be designated as dominant, and other SPA policies may be implemented or any portion of other SPA's policies may be implemented, where such polices or portions thereof are subsets of, or do not interfere with, the dominant SPA's policies. The implemented policies in a subset arrangement are logically consistent with each other. For example, if a dominant SPA limits international calls to a set of countries and a non-dominant SPA limits international calls to half of the same set of countries, the policy of the non-dominant SPA is a subset of the policy of the dominant SPA. Policies conflict if the policies are logically unresolvable. For example, unlimited minutes of use by the UE may be allowed by the SPA from a corporate server and limited minutes of use by the UE may be set by the SPA from a home-based server in which the policies are logically resolvable by associating two different accounts to the two different policies. For a situation in which members registered with a corporate server as a dominant server are not allowed to share any information through their UE, a policy that allows sharing from a non-dominant server would not be logically consistent with the policy of the dominant server.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In an embodiment, the UEPA may evaluate the policies provided by the SPAs of multiple servers by checking the modify flag controlled by each SPA of the multiple servers. Each SPA may send the status of its associated modify flag in response to a request from the UEPA, in establishing a connection with the UE, or during other policy establishing procedures with the UEPA. If the modify flag from a SPA is set to &#x201c;no&#x201d; or &#x201c;F&#x201d;, then the policy cannot be modified and the UEPA must determine if the policies associated with this SPA can be made consistent with the information the UEPA has from the other SPAs to which the UE is also connected. For example, if the UE is logged into two servers that both have their modify flags set to &#x201c;F&#x201d; for the UE with one server designated as the dominant server, then the policies of the non-dominant server that are not consistent with the policies of the dominant server are ignored. If all policies of the non-dominant server conflict with those of the dominant server, the UEPA may direct a process for the UE user that would allow the UE user to re-evaluate the user's choice of servers to which the UE is registered. If no policies are set as dominant and SPA policies are received at a UEPA that conflict (logically unresolvable) with existing SPA policies, the default action of the UEPA may be to not allow the received policies and/or to hangup the connection being made with the UE that contains SPA policies not consistent with existing connections and/or registrations. If one server has its modify flag set to &#x201c;T&#x201d; for the UE and the other server has its modify flag set to &#x201c;F&#x201d;, then the logical requirements of both servers can still be met, since the UEPA following the non-modifiable policies is allowed by both SPAs.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In an embodiment, a wireless server may be configured to have multiple groups of UEs registered as independent groups with the wireless server. In addition, a UE may register as a member of no group, one group, or a plurality of groups on the wireless server. The SPA may send multiple sets of policies to the UE, based on the groups to which the UE is registered with the server. The UEPA of the UE may resolve the different policies as discussed above. Alternatively, the SPA may resolve conflicts between policies of different groups and send a set of resolved policies to the UEPA for each group in which the UE is registered.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In an embodiment, a UEPA of a UE may be configured such that it presents a logical interface to each server to which the UE is connected such that the logical interface functions as if there is only one server connected. For such a configuration, the default status of the UEPA is to keep each connection independent such that there is no sharing of any information between servers and/or connection. However, the UEPA may direct the display of a split screen on the UE in which the multiple independent connections may be shown. Using the split screen, the UE user may manage the different connections. A UE registered and/or connected to a plurality of servers and/or providers may have a UEPA configured such that no sharing occurs between the servers. In an embodiment, the no sharing policy cannot be overridden by any SPA policy. For example, one server may be corporate server and another server may be a personal server, such as one located in a home, having a registered member that is a registered member of the corporate server. Information shared with members of the corporate server may not be allowed to be shared with members of the personal server. If a second member registered with the personal server is also registered with the corporate, information associated with the corporate server that is shared between the two members of both the corporate server and the personal server is provided through the logical interface associated with the corporate server. In an embodiment, a UEPA of a UE may have a policy that certain pre-defined groups or sets of servers and/or providers may provide SPA policies that will be used in operation between the designated groups, but no sharing will occur between that these groups and any other server and/or provider not in the pre-defined groups. Each of the pre-defined groups may be a group of one server.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, a method according to one example embodiment calls for an e-mail message to be sent <b>1122</b> from a first wireless client wherein the e-mail message is from a first user or entity associated with an external e-mail domain. The e-mail is addressed to a second user or entity also having an external e-mail domain the same as or different from the external e-mail domain of the first user or entity. The e-mail is received <b>1124</b> at the wireless server <b>1102</b>, for example into the e-mail agent <b>1110</b>, and the e-mail message is routed or sent directly <b>1126</b> to the second mobile wireless client <b>1104</b>-<b>2</b>, for example using the direct routing function <b>1112</b>, without first processing the e-mail message through the one or more external e-mail domains identified for the sender or recipient of the e-mail message. Accordingly, the e-mail message is likely more quickly delivered to the recipient as it is not required first to be sent to and routed through the external e-mail server(s) (for example <b>1108</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>1108</b>-<b>2</b>). In one alternate embodiment, the external e-mail servers are also updated <b>1128</b> so that the e-mail records in these servers appear to have sent or received the direct routed e-mail. Accordingly, the external e-mail servers stay synchronized with any e-mail routed directly by the wireless server <b>1102</b>. In one embodiment, the external e-mail servers are directed, for example by e-mail agent <b>1110</b>, to synchronize the e-mail after the e-mail is first routed. In another embodiment, the external servers may be instructed to synchronize the e-mail after or simultaneously with the direct routing of the message between mobile wireless clients.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">According to one example embodiment, e-mail domains external to the wireless server <b>1102</b> may include an e-mail domain based on a post office protocol (POP), an e-mail domain based on an internet message access protocol (IMAP), e-mail domains based on POP and IMAP, or e-mail based on other server architectures such as Microsoft Exchange&#xae;, IBM's Domino&#xae; or Novell's GroupWise&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">According to still another example embodiment, the direct routing of e-mails may be applied to other electronic communications such as instant messaging wherein instead of the external e-mail servers and domains there are instant messaging servers and the direct routing routes the instant message directly between the mobile wireless clients as opposed to through the external domain.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an embodiment of a method of administering mobile wireless clients. The wireless server provides a simplified user interface for administering mobile wireless clients. In one embodiment, the wireless server displays one or more administration scenarios for at least one of a plurality of mobile wireless clients. A user of the wireless server selects the administration scenario. The mobile wireless server automatically determines one or more administration parameters for a mobile wireless client in response to the selection of the one or more administration scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">At <b>1210</b>, the mobile wireless server may present, to a user, one or more administration scenarios for a mobile device. The wireless server then receives, from the user, a selection of at least one of the administration scenarios. At <b>1220</b>, without interaction from the user, the wireless server identifies one or more administration parameters to implement the selected administration scenarios. The administration parameters are operable to configure the mobile device for the particular administration scenario.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The administration scenario includes conditions or desired changes to the wireless device that involves a change to the configuration data on the wireless device in order to implement the change. For example, administration scenarios include, but are not limited to setting a password, forgetting a password, misplacing a mobile device, losing a mobile device and managing modes for operation for the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an alternate embodiment of a method of administering mobile wireless clients. At <b>1310</b>, a wireless server receives a desired mode of operation for a mobile wireless client. At <b>1320</b>, wireless server may use the desired mode of operation to determine one or more administration parameters to configure the mobile wireless client for the desired mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Modes of operation for the wireless device may include, but are not limited to, turning off a phone function, controlling web site access, restricting international phone calls, restricting phone calls to specified area codes, turning off Short Message Service (SMS) messages, turning off Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS), turning off Web browser use, blocking downloading of specified content (e.g. games), and logging or monitoring different types of usage on the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one embodiment, the wireless server may transmit administration parameters from the wireless server to the mobile wireless client and configure the mobile wireless client for the desired mode of operation using the administration parameters. The administration parameters may be determined without human intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In one embodiment, either the wireless server or the mobile wireless client may display administration scenarios or modes of operation on a simplified user interface. The simplified user interface displays less than all of the administration parameters available for configuration of the wireless device. Instead the simplified user interface may display one or more administration scenarios or modes of operation rather than displaying the administration parameters. For example, if the administration scenario for authentication of users on the system involves requiring a password, the administration parameters used to implement the administration scenario may include the following:</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Password required parameter (true/false)</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Maximum Password Age parameter (number of days)</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Maximum Password Length parameter (number of characters)</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Password Pattern Checks</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Prohibited Passwords.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Although in this example, five parameters are involved to implement an administration scenario of requiring a password, the simplified user interface may not display any of the administration parameters, or the user interface may display less than all of the administration parameters. Instead of displaying some or all of the administration parameters, the user interface may display high-level or abstract descriptions of the administration parameters used to implement a password policy. For example, the user interface may offer as a choice for a user the question &#x201c;Do you need to change your password?&#x201d; The question is an example of an administration scenario.</p>

At <b>3610</b>, the availability of media content that can be copied to a mobile wireless client from a wireless server is determined. Media includes, but is not limited to, images, sounds, text, and videos, and combinations thereof. A discovery process may be undertaken in a wireless server to obtain media content according to preferences of individual mobile wireless clients. The preferences may be correlated to a user of the mobile wireless client registered in the wireless server. For each user/mobile wireless client, different types of media made be associated with the mobile wireless client. Within each type of media, further preferences may be made. For example, for music media, different preferences may include classical music, big band music, oldies, country, rock, metal rock, opera, and other types of music that may have designations stored in electronic databases that are accessible by the wireless server using a communications network such as the Internet. The preferences may also include one or more rule sets to categorize acquired media as private to a specific wireless client, accessible among wireless clients in a share group with the wireless server, accessible by entities outside a share group of the wireless server.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Further categorizations of acquired media may be structured in a database of the wireless server. Accessibility to the acquired media content for each mobile wireless client may be regulated based on the nature of media content. For example, a video acquired in the wireless server from a source such as a server on the Internet may be categorized according to a standard audience rating. The wireless server may restrict a particular mobile wireless client from acquisition of or access to the acquired video based on the mobile wireless client corresponding to a registered user having age that makes viewing the acquired video inappropriate. Another example includes regulating the acquisition of or access to music based an attached designation representing the suitability of the lyrical content of the music. The preferences to acquire media content may also include a set of management rules directed to the costs of acquiring the media content from a source reachable by the wireless server.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">At <b>3620</b>, the media content is transcoded into a format correlated to the wireless client. Transcoding is a digital-to-digital conversion from one format to another format. It typically may include decoding/decompressing original data to an intermediate format followed by re-encoding the intermediate format into a target format. Transcoding may include a process to change assembled code to function on a different platform or operating system. Transcoding provides a process of converting a media file or object from one format to another. For example, transcoding may be used to convert among video formats such as Beta, VHS (Video Home System), QuickTime, Video for Windows, MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group), and other video formats. Other media conversions may include text and graphic files for use in mobile devices that may have small screen sizes, low memory, and low bandwidth rates. Transcoding may provide the encoding of files to a lower bit rate without changing video formats, a process that is also known as transrating. Transcoding provides a mechanism for a wireless server to provide a format to a specific mobile wireless client, according to the formats that the specific mobile wireless client is configured to support. Transcoding may be an optional procedure, since some media content may be provided without transcoding.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">In an embodiment, a wireless server may scale media content to generate a sample of the media content and send the sample to the mobile wireless client. The sample may be used by the mobile wireless client to preview the media content before the media content is downloaded to the mobile wireless client from the wireless server. The previewed sample may be marked for later download of the complete media content. For example, low resolution pictures may be provided to a mobile wireless client for browsing. A short clip of a video may be provided as a sample to a mobile wireless client at a low resolution. A short clip of an audio may be provided as a sample to a mobile wireless client at a low quality. Marking the previewed samples allows for the corresponding higher quality/higher resolution large media file to be downloaded to the mobile wireless client at a later time or downloaded on demand. The marking may be made in the wireless server, the mobile wireless client, or both the wireless server and the mobile wireless client.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">In an embodiment, the media content, which has been marked, may be automatically transferred in a complete high quality/higher resolution format when a local connection is established between the mobile wireless client and the wireless server. The local connection may be via a local wire connection such as by a USB cable or a local wireless connection such as Wi-Fi network. The local connection may use Bluetooth technology. The wireless server and mobile wireless client sense the local connection and may establish the appropriate communication channels using standard channel processes according to protocols supported in the wireless server and mobile wireless client.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">At <b>3630</b>, the media content is downloaded to the mobile wireless client based on one or more criteria for the wireless client. The criteria are identified in the wireless server. The criteria associated with a specified mobile wireless client may include availability of transport of the media content, a data plan associated with the wireless client, the file size of the media content, battery life of power sources in the wireless client, user settings for the wireless client, and/or other criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The download of the media content, which may be provided at any given time, may be related to the available transport medium between the wireless server and a specified mobile wireless client. A cost setting may be used to determine the time at which the media content may be downloaded. A cost threshold may be set in the wireless server for a specific mobile wireless client such that if a determination is made that downloading the media content would exceed the cost threshold for a specified transmission path, the wireless server will delay the download until transport is available at a cost below the threshold. For example, a cost threshold process may allow a media sample to be sent to a mobile wireless client over a wireless network, while restricting the transport of the complete media content over the same wireless network. The same cost threshold process may allow the transport of the complete media content over another network. In various embodiments, a transport cost criterion will allow transfer of media content on establishment of a local communication channel between the wireless server and a given mobile wireless client, such as communication via a USB cable or Wi-Fi network correlated to the wireless server.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">On assessing the identification of the mobile wireless client to receive the media content, the wireless server can access its database to determine the data plan to which the associated user of the mobile wireless client set subscribes. The mobile wireless client may have multiple data plans that are identified in the wireless server. The various data plans may be accessed in the wireless server to determine if the transfer to the mobile wireless client over a particular network is within the boundaries of the data plans. Upon determination of applicable data plans, the data plans may be compared for selection of a data plan to provide the rule set for data transfer within the selected data plan. Preference settings may be used to set limits on variable factors. For example, a data plan may allow a maximum amount of data to be sent or a maximum number of minutes of connect time without incurring cost but allow a user to exceed such maximums at some cost per unit time or unit of data bits above the maximum. The preference settings may allow each mobile wireless client of the wireless server to have a threshold level set at which the specific mobile wireless client may exceed its no additional cost maximum. The data plans may include other rule sets to regulate the use of the network corresponding to the data plan.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">The characteristics of the mobile wireless clients of a wireless server may differ among the mobile wireless clients as to the capabilities and capacities of each of the mobile wireless clients. Such characteristics affect the ability of the wireless server to transfer media content. In an embodiment, the wireless server may compare the file size of the media content to be transferred with respect to the available storage space on the mobile wireless client. This may be accomplished in an interchange of information regarding the storage capacity of the mobile wireless client without intervention by the user of the mobile wireless client. A capacity limit may be set in the wireless server such that, if the size of the information to be downloaded is larger than the capacity limit, the wireless server will not send the information on a wireless channel. For file content over the capacity limit, an automatic download can be performed when the wireless server determines that a physical connection, such as a USB connection, has been established or that the mobile wireless device has accessed a Wi-Fi network of the wireless server. If such USB or Wi-Fi transport is lost during a transmission transaction, the transaction can be halted and restarted once the transport is reestablished. In addition, transfer of the media content can be regulated according to other status in the wireless server correlated to the target mobile wireless device. In an embodiment, a capacity limit may be effectively bypassed by downloading the media content through operation of the wireless server to provide a streaming-like process to a mobile wireless client without storing large amounts of data on the mobile wireless client. The mobile wireless client may later store the media content under applicable capacity rules for data transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The download by the wireless server may be conducted based on the type of storage facilities on the target mobile wireless client. If the mobile wireless client does not have the appropriate storage medium, such as a SD card or other designated storage medium, the download is not conducted and the mobile wireless device is notified of the lack of capacity. The download may also be based other device parameters such as the battery life of power sources of the target mobile wireless client. For example, download of media content may be suspended if the battery capacity of the target mobile wireless client falls below a specified amount. In an embodiment, download of media content may be suspended if the battery life falls below 20% of the full amount and may be resumed if the battery life exceeds 25% of the full amount.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Criteria for controlling the download of media content to a mobile wireless client may include user settings for the specific mobile wireless client stored in the wireless server. The wireless server may store user settings for each of its mobile wireless clients. The user settings for each mobile wireless client may be uncorrelated among the mobile wireless clients of the wireless server. The user settings for each mobile wireless client may have one or more settings that are correlated among the mobile wireless clients of the wireless server. Correlated settings may correspond to a share group of the mobile wireless clients with the wireless server and may be based on the nature of the share group.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">In various embodiments, a wireless server provides a mechanism for intelligent transport of media content to each of its mobile wireless clients. The wireless server and a mobile wireless client may operate to provide 2-way synchronization of files of media content. The files may be queued in the wireless server and/or in a mobile wireless client. Operation on the files may depend on various factors such as, but not limited to, file size and type of file. A file transfer may be realized using a secure connection between the wireless server and a mobile wireless client that is unique between the wireless server and a mobile wireless client.
