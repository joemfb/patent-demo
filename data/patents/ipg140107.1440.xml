<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to particulate size reduction, and more particularly, to journal bearing assemblies for pulverizers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A variety of devices and methods are known in the art for reducing particulate size of raw materials. Of such devices, many are directed to pulverizing coal for use as a fuel. In coal-fired furnaces, for purposes of improved and more efficient ignition, it is preferred to pulverize the coal to a fine powder before introducing it into the furnace for combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In operations that use coal for fuel, finely-ground coal particles or &#x201c;fines&#x201d; are desirable for efficient operation, yielding higher combustion efficiency than stoker firing, as well as rapid response to load changes. Using coal fines for combustion also produces less nitrous oxide (NO<sub>X</sub>) emissions and keeps oversized loss-on-ignition (LOT) unburned coal particles from contaminating the marketable ash byproduct of the combustion chamber. Thus, it is common practice to supply raw coal to a device, such as a pulverizer, that will reduce the size of the coal to particles within a desirable range prior to being used for combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Coal pulverization involves systematically comminuting coal to a desired size, e.g., a fine powder, prior to introduction into a coal-fired furnace. Conventional coal pulverization systems include ball tube type mills, high-speed attrition type pulverizers, and vertical roller type mills.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Traditional bowl mill pulverizers are shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,465,971 to Dalenberg, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,299 to Skalka, which describe the construction and operation bowl mills suitable for use in coal fired power generation systems. As taught by the patents above, a typical bowl mill includes a body portion in which a grinding table is mounted for rotation, a plurality of grinding rollers that roll against the grinding table to grind coal therebetween, coal supply means for feeding raw coal to the interior of the bowl mill, and air supply means for supplying an air flow to the interior of the bowl mill, which entrains airborne pulverized coal particles for combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In such a bowl mill, the coal enters the bowl mill and is pulverized between the grinding rollers and the grinding table. After being pulverized, the coal particles are thrown outwardly by centrifugal force whereby the particles are fed into a stream of air that is entering the bowl mill. The stream of air, which now contains pulverized coal particles, flows through a tortuous path that is established in part by the positioning of a suitably supported deflector means within the bowl mill. As the stream of air and coal particles flows along the aforementioned tortuous path, the sharp turns effect the separation of the coarse coal particles from the air stream. These coarse coal particles are then returned to the grinding table for further pulverization, while the fine coal particles are carried out of the bowl mill in the air stream. The capacity of each bowl mill of the type described above can be on the order of 100 tons per hour of coal. As the industry has pressed for greater and greater capacity, the size of typical bowl mills has increased in an effort to meet the demand.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With increased size have come issues related to stress and wear. More specifically, prolonged operation of conventional of bowl mills can only last as long as the service life of the weakest components. The pulverizer journal systems typically employed in conventional bowl mills have suffered from one or more of the following undesirable features. It has been found that the upper bearing has been subjected to high radial loading. It has also been found that the lower bearing has been subjected to high thrust loading. Furthermore, it has often been found that the upper bearing does not have the capacity desirable for the loadings encountered during ordinary service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The result of these factors is that the bearings are often require replacement earlier than the other major components of a typical journal assembly. In order to replace the journal bearings, downtime is required. Thus it is often the case that downtime is incurred due to the bearings per se. The more frequently the need arises to replace the journal bearings, the more the resulting downtime adds up in the long run. Thus, there is a significant need for improvements in the service life of bearing support for journals on which pulverizer rolls are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The roller of a typical journal assembly is supported by a pair of spaced apart journal bearings. Each journal assembly has a loading point that is typically defined as the intersection point of the longitudinal axis of the journal assembly and the line on which the resulting load acts on the roller. The conventional assemblies were designed to accommodate a hypothetical loading point within the span between the upper and lower bearings. However, in practice, the loading point tends to actually lie outside the span between the two bearings, above the upper journal bearing. If the actual loading point were in fact located at the hypothetical loading point for which the system was designed, radial and thrust loading would have been ameliorated. The actual loading point location results in the undesirable loading factors described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The discrepancy between the hypothetical loading point and the loading point in practice is due at least in part to the assumptions made in determining the hypothetical loading point. Earlier assemblies were smaller than more recent assemblies. Assumptions used to determine the loading point that may have been reasonable for smaller assemblies may not be reasonable for determining the loading point of larger assemblies. Roller size, table velocity, and other factors that have increased over the years tend to undermine the original assumptions. Also, due to the smaller size in the earlier assemblies, some error in loading point position could be tolerated with less noticeable effects on service life.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One solution has been to essentially enlarge the upper bearing as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,768 to Paskowski, Jr. et al., which describes using a double tapered roller bearing for the upper journal bearing in place of single tapered roller bearing. Using a larger bearing, or double bearing, can increase the service life of the upper and lower bearings and thus the whole journal assembly. But the cost of the upper bearing is significantly increased. The loading point in this double tapered roller bearing design also falls outside the span between upper and lower journal bearings in practice, despite the hypothetical loading point shown in the Paskowski Patent.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">While the conventional methods and systems have generally been considered satisfactory for their intended purposes, there still remains an ongoing need in the art for improved support of journal assemblies that allow for longer service life and less down time. There also remains a need for such methods and apparatus that are easy to make and use. The present invention provides a solution for these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The subject invention is directed to a new and useful journal bearing assembly for a pulverizer. The journal bearing assembly includes a journal shaft defining a longitudinal axis and being configured and adapted to be mounted in a pulverizer. The journal shaft has a lower bearing receiving surface proximate a lower end thereof, and an upper bearing receiving surface spaced apart from the lower bearing receiving surface axially. A lower journal bearing is mounted on the lower bearing receiving surface of the journal shaft. An upper journal bearing is mounted on the upper bearing receiving surface of the journal shaft. An upper journal housing is mounted on the upper journal bearing for rotational movement relative to the journal shaft. A lower journal housing is mounted on the lower journal bearing for rotational movement relative to the journal shaft. The lower journal housing is mounted to the upper journal housing for common rotation about the journal shaft. The journal bearing assembly has a loading point defined between the upper and lower journal bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with certain embodiments, the upper journal bearing is a single bearing tapered roller bearing. The journal shaft can include a bearing spacer receiving surface between the upper and lower bearing receiving surfaces, and a bearing spacer can be mounted on the bearing spacer receiving surface of the journal shaft to maintain a minimum spacing between the upper and lower journal bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention also provides a journal assembly upgrade kit. The kit includes an annular upper journal housing defining a longitudinal axis and having a radially inner wall and a radially outer wall.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference will now be made to the drawings wherein like reference numerals identify similar structural features or aspects of the subject invention. For purposes of explanation and illustration, and not limitation, a partial view of an exemplary embodiment of a journal assembly in accordance with the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and is designated generally by reference character <b>100</b>. Other embodiments of journal assemblies in accordance with the invention, or aspects thereof, are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-15</figref>, as will be described. The systems of the invention can be used to enhance particulate size reduction processes, and for example, to increase service life of journal assemblies in pulverizers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a bowl mill pulverizer <b>1</b> is shown, including a prior art journal bearing assembly <b>10</b> for allowing rotation of roller <b>24</b> against bowl <b>25</b> such as when pulverizing coal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shaft <b>12</b> of bearing assembly <b>10</b> defines the longitudinal axis of assembly <b>10</b>, and is a stationary component with respect to pulverizer <b>1</b> in which assembly <b>10</b> is installed. A lower bearing <b>14</b> is mounted on shaft <b>12</b> at one end, and an upper bearing <b>16</b> is mounted on shaft <b>12</b> spaced axially inward from lower bearing <b>14</b>. A spacer <b>18</b> is mounted on shaft <b>12</b> and maintains the spacing between lower and upper bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. A lower journal housing <b>20</b> is mounted on lower bearing <b>14</b>, and an upper journal housing <b>22</b> is mounted on upper bearing <b>16</b>. Lower and upper journal housings <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are bolted together for common rotation about shaft <b>12</b> on bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. Roller <b>24</b> is mounted to lower journal housing <b>20</b>, and is used for grinding material such as coal by rolling over the material on bowl <b>25</b>. A stationary journal head skirt <b>26</b> is in close engagement with upper journal housing <b>22</b> to reduce or prevent dust and particles entering the interior of upper journal housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a first order approximation, the hypothetical loading point A for the design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> lies just inside the span of the longitudinal axis between the lower and upper bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. Loading point A is the intersection point between the longitudinal axis of shaft <b>12</b> and a line drawn perpendicular to the center of the crushing surface of roller <b>24</b>. The placement of upper bearing <b>16</b> just to the right of loading point A suggests the design in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> was intended to include loading point A between the upper and lower bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. However, in practice the actual loading point is at or near loading point B, which is located outside the span between bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. As a result, it has been found that upper bearing <b>16</b> is subjected to high radial loading and lower bearing <b>14</b> is subjected to high thrust loading. These undesirable radial and thrust loads result in premature wear of upper and lower bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, leading to frequent need for replacement in order to keep journal assemblies such as assembly <b>10</b> operating.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, a journal bearing assembly <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention is shown, which addresses the short comings of the design shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Journal bearing assembly <b>100</b> is configured for use in a pulverizer, such as in a coal pulverizer, or any other suitable application. Assembly <b>100</b> includes a journal shaft <b>112</b> defining a longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. Journal shaft <b>112</b> has a lower bearing receiving surface <b>128</b> proximate a lower end thereof, and an upper bearing receiving surface <b>130</b> spaced apart from lower bearing receiving surface <b>128</b> along axis <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A lower journal bearing <b>114</b> is mounted on lower bearing receiving surface <b>128</b> of journal shaft <b>112</b>. An upper journal bearing <b>116</b> is mounted on upper bearing receiving surface <b>130</b> of journal shaft <b>112</b>. An upper journal housing <b>122</b> is mounted on upper journal bearing <b>116</b> for rotational movement relative to journal shaft <b>112</b>. A lower journal housing <b>120</b> is mounted on lower journal bearing <b>114</b> for rotational movement relative to journal shaft <b>112</b>. Lower journal housing <b>120</b> is mounted to upper journal housing <b>122</b> for common rotation about journal shaft <b>112</b>, which is mounted to remain stationary relative to the rotation of bearings <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. A roller <b>124</b> is mounted to lower journal housing <b>120</b> and can be used for pulverizing material, as described above. Journal head skirt <b>126</b> is mounted to remain stationary with respect to shaft <b>112</b> and is closely engaged with the exterior of upper journal housing <b>122</b>. Journal bearing assembly <b>100</b> has a loading point B, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, located on axis <b>110</b> in the span between lower and upper journal bearings <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, which corresponds to the actual loading point B in the design of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, Upper journal bearing <b>116</b> is a single, tapered roller bearing and can advantageously be of the same general size and configuration as upper bearing <b>16</b> in assembly <b>10</b>. Journal shaft <b>112</b> includes a bearing spacer receiving surface <b>132</b> between the lower and upper bearing receiving surfaces <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>. Bearing spacer <b>118</b> is mounted on bearing spacer receiving surface <b>132</b> of journal shaft <b>112</b> to maintain a minimum spacing between the lower and upper journal bearings <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Lower bearing <b>114</b> is single, tapered roller bearing, however any other suitable bearing type can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, cylindrical journal bearing spacer <b>118</b> is shown. Spacer <b>118</b> is coaxial with shaft <b>112</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and has a radially inner surface <b>142</b> and a radially outer surface <b>144</b>. Spacer <b>118</b> also has first and second end surfaces, <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>, respectively, opposed to one another along longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, first and second end surfaces <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> are spaced apart so that when spacer <b>118</b> is assembled onto spacer receiving surface <b>132</b> of shaft <b>112</b>, with lower journal bearing <b>114</b> adjacent end surface <b>146</b> and with upper journal bearing <b>116</b> adjacent end surface <b>148</b>, spacer <b>118</b> spans across loading point B of journal assembly <b>100</b>. Spacer <b>118</b> also includes a side bore <b>147</b> for accommodating passage of lubricant from shaft <b>112</b> into the interior of lower journal housing <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref>, upper journal housing <b>122</b> is annular and is mounted coaxial with shaft <b>112</b> as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Upper journal housing <b>122</b> has a radially inner wall <b>132</b> and a radially outer wall <b>134</b>. The radially outer wall <b>134</b> includes a mounting flange <b>136</b> configured and adapted for mounting engagement of upper journal housing <b>122</b> to lower journal housing <b>120</b>. Radially inner wall <b>132</b> includes a journal shaft approximating surface <b>138</b> configured and adapted to accommodate journal shaft <b>112</b> therethrough in close proximity therewith. Inner wall <b>132</b> also includes a bearing seating surface <b>140</b> configured to receive upper journal bearing <b>116</b> therein with at least a portion of upper journal bearing <b>116</b> located axially between mounting flange <b>136</b> and journal shaft approximating surface <b>138</b> with respect to longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. Upper journal housing <b>122</b>, by comparison with upper journal housing <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, accommodates upper bearing <b>116</b> farther up shaft <b>112</b> and is reinforced to provide additional loading capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, journal head skirt <b>126</b> includes an air seal surface <b>156</b> that forms a gas seal with radially outer surface <b>134</b> of upper journal housing <b>122</b> that is oblique to longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. Flange <b>158</b> is used to mount skirt <b>126</b> to be stationary with respect to shaft <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 15</figref>, an original journal assembly <b>10</b>, with an actual loading point B outside the span between lower and upper bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, can be upgraded into a journal assembly <b>100</b> with loading point B inside the span between lower and upper bearings <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Original journal head skirt <b>26</b>, original upper journal housing <b>22</b>, original bearing spacer <b>18</b>, and original journal shaft <b>12</b> are disassembled from an original journal assembly <b>10</b>. An upgrade journal head skirt <b>126</b>, an upgrade upper journal housing <b>122</b>, an upgrade bearing spacer <b>118</b>, a lower journal bearing <b>114</b>, an upper journal bearing <b>116</b> that is a single bearing tapered roller bearing, and an upgrade journal shaft <b>112</b> are assembled onto the journal assembly to make upgraded journal assembly <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, original journal shaft <b>12</b> can be modified into an upgrade journal shaft <b>112</b>. The modification involves removing material from an original journal shaft <b>12</b> to elongate its spacer receiving surface <b>13</b> to the full length of bearing receiving surface <b>132</b> and to relocate its original upper bearing receiving surface <b>15</b> to the location of upper bearing receiving surface <b>130</b>. The material removed from original shaft <b>12</b> to make shaft <b>112</b> can be seen by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The original length &#x201c;1&#x201d; from lower bearing receiving surface <b>128</b> to the far side of upper bearing receiving surface <b>15</b> on original shaft <b>12</b> is elongated to length &#x201c;L&#x201d; on shaft <b>112</b>. The material can be removed from the shaft using standard techniques, such as a lathing process. The bearing receiving surface <b>132</b> and spacer <b>118</b> shift the position of upper bearing <b>116</b> about 7 inches up shaft <b>112</b> compared to the bearing position in assembly <b>10</b>, for example if used on an Raymond&#xae; Pressurized Bowl Mills Model Nos. 963, 983, or 1003 model, available from Alstom Engineering of Washington D.C. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, original journal shaft <b>12</b> includes an internal axial oil bore <b>150</b> extending therethrough. Original branching bores <b>152</b> branch off from axial bore <b>150</b> for delivering oil or other suitable lubricants through axial bore <b>150</b> to the inside of the journal bearing assembly. Three original branching bores <b>152</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, due to the length of spacer <b>118</b>, the bottom most branching bore <b>152</b> is blocked in assembly <b>100</b>. An additional branching bore <b>154</b> is included in shaft <b>112</b> to replace the blocked bore <b>152</b>. During an upgrade from shaft <b>12</b> to shaft <b>112</b>, bore <b>154</b> can be formed by any suitable process. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that it is not necessary to modify an original shaft into an upgrade shaft, but rather the upgrade shaft can be a new part that replaces an original shaft <b>12</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Moreover, any suitable bore configuration can be used in a journal shaft without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, journal skirt <b>126</b> can also be a modified version of an original part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the material <b>127</b> that can be removed from an original skirt <b>26</b> to form skirt <b>126</b>. The material can be removed by any suitable process, including for example lathing. As with shaft <b>112</b> above, it is not required that an original skirt <b>26</b> be modified into skirt <b>126</b>. It is possible to use a new skirt <b>126</b> that is not a modified original skirt <b>26</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">During an upgrade as described above, it is possible to reuse certain original parts and/or to replace certain original parts in a modified or refurbished condition, and/or to replace certain original parts with new parts to create an upgraded journal assembly <b>100</b>. One exemplary upgrade procedure is to replace original spacer <b>18</b> and original upper journal housing <b>22</b> with a new spacer <b>118</b> and a new upper journal housing <b>122</b>, respectively, while modifying shaft <b>12</b> and skirt <b>26</b> for reuse as shaft <b>112</b> and skirt <b>126</b>, respectively. Since assembly <b>100</b> uses lower and upper journal bearings <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of the same type as original bearings <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, it is possible to either replace the original bearings with new bearings of similar size and configuration, or to simply refurbish the original bearings for continued use.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Upgrade parts for use in upgrading or retrofitting an original journal assembly <b>10</b> into an upgraded journal assembly <b>100</b> can be provided in a kit. An exemplary kit for such purpose includes an annular upper journal housing, e.g., upper journal housing <b>122</b> described above, and a cylindrical journal bearing spacer, e.g., spacer <b>118</b> described above. If it is desired to replace rather than modify original shaft <b>12</b> and/or original skirt <b>26</b>, an exemplary upgrade kit can also include a journal shaft, e.g., shaft <b>112</b>, and/or an annular journal head skirt, e.g., skirt <b>26</b>, as applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While described above in the exemplary context of bowl mill pulverizers, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the systems and methods of the invention can be readily applied to use with other suitable particulate size reduction processes, or any other suitable devices. The methods and systems of the present invention, as described above and shown in the drawings provide for journal bearing assemblies with improved load distribution for longer bearing service life without the need for oversized bearings. Calculations show that bearing life in both upper and lower bearings can be increased by a factor of 3+.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the apparatus and methods of the subject invention have been shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that changes and/or modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject invention.</p>
