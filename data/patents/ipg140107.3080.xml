<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a circuit-breaking device for low-voltage systems with a control mechanism that has improved characteristics of compact size and reliability. The circuit-breaking device according to the invention comprises an outer housing containing, for each pole, at least one fixed contact and at least one moving contact suitable for being mutually coupled and uncoupled. The device also comprises a control mechanism comprising a supporting frame that supports a kinematic chain operatively connected to the moving contact so as to enable the latter to be coupled to or uncoupled from the fixed contact. The supporting frame comprises a pair of sides connected by means of a first transverse connecting portion and by further connection means that define a further transverse connecting portion in a different position from that of the first transverse connecting portion.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Phase filing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT/EP2009/067995 filed on Dec. 29, 2009; and this application claims priority to Application No. MI2009A000010 filed in Italy on Jan. 8, 2009 under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119; the entire contents of all are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a circuit-breaking device for low-voltage systems with a control mechanism with improved characteristics of compact size and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common knowledge that low-voltage circuit-breaking devices (i.e. for applications with working voltages up to 1000V AC/1500V DC), such as automatic circuit breakers, isolators and contactors, generally called &#x201c;switching devices&#x201d;, and hereinafter called circuit breakers for the sake of simplicity, are devices designed to enable the proper operation of specific parts of electric systems and the installed loads. Automatic circuit breakers, for instance, ensure that the required rated current can flow towards the various users, enabling the loads to be reliably connected to and disconnected from the circuit, and also enabling the circuit being protected to be automatically isolated from the electrical energy source.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is also well known that circuit breakers comprise a housing and one or more electric poles, each of which is associated with at least one pair of contacts that can be mutually coupled and uncoupled, and a control mechanism that induces a relative movement between the pairs of contacts. The action of the control mechanism on the moving contacts is conventionally achieved by means of a main shaft operatively connected to the moving contacts, or by means of a moving part operatively supporting the contacts. The control mechanism conventionally comprises a supporting frame that supports a kinematic chain that consists of at least one element operatively connected to the moving part and enabling its displacement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The control mechanisms usually comprise at least one tripping element that is generally operated by a protection device in the event of an anomaly, such as a short circuit, occurring in the circuit in which the circuit breaker is installed. The protection device may be of the thermal, thermomagnetic or electronic type, for instance, and it directly or indirectly activates the kinematic chain of the control mechanism to induce a rapid separation of the contacts and a consequent automatic opening of the circuit breaker.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The kinematic chains in conventional control mechanisms consist of a plurality of operative members, at least one of which is connected to the frame by means of a hinged joint consisting of a through pin that connects the sides of the frame together. In almost all cases, the mutual connection between the other elements in the kinematic chain is also achieved in a like manner by means of hinged joints complete with pins.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the known solutions, one of the most crucial aspects from the point of view of the manufacturing costs concerns the procedure for assembling the circuit breaker. In the majority of cases, the components are assembled &#x201c;in-line&#x201d;, i.e. one after the other, according to a logic that obviously depends on the structure of the circuit breaker. The assembly times are determined particularly by the structure of the control mechanism, which comprises a large number of components of relatively small dimensions. Hence the need to develop new technical solutions that enable an evident reduction in the current assembly times by substantially simplifying said procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Based on these considerations, the main aim of the present invention is to produce a circuit-breaking device for low-voltage systems that enables the above-mentioned drawbacks to be overcome, and particularly that gives rise to shorter assembly times than those of the known solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This aim is achieved by a circuit-breaking device according to the content of claim <b>1</b> and of the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The description below refers, exclusively for descriptive purposes, to a single-switching multipolar circuit-breaking device for low-voltage systems. This is obviously on the understanding that the principles and technical solutions expounded in the description of the inventive concept are also applicable to other types of circuit-breaking device, such as double-switching circuit breakers with a different number of poles.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to the above-mentioned figures, the circuit-breaking device <b>1</b> according to the present invention comprises an outer housing <b>2</b> containing, for each pole, at least one fixed contact <b>10</b> and at least one moving contact <b>20</b>, suitable for being mutually coupled or uncoupled. The circuit-breaking device <b>1</b> comprises a control mechanism <b>30</b> that is operatively connected to said at least one moving contact <b>20</b> to enable the latter's displacement between a coupled position and an uncoupled position with respect to the corresponding fixed contact <b>10</b>. The control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises a supporting frame <b>31</b> that supports a kinematic chain operatively connected to the moving contact <b>20</b> by means of a moving part <b>50</b> that enables it to be coupled to or uncoupled from said fixed contact <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The circuit-breaking device <b>1</b> comprises a tripping device provided with a trip shaft <b>40</b> that interacts with said control mechanism <b>30</b> to enable the kinematic chain and thereby trigger the uncoupling of the moving contact <b>20</b> from the fixed contact <b>10</b>. The control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises a plurality of elements <b>31</b>,<b>32</b>,<b>33</b>,<b>34</b>,<b>35</b>,<b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for instance) that are operatively connected to define at least one kinematic chain, which takes effect on the moving contacts <b>20</b> by means of the moving part <b>50</b>. For the purposes of the present invention, the term kinematic chain is used to indicate a set of elements in the control mechanism that are coupled together to perform one of the functions (e.g. a manual or automatic circuit opening) for which the mechanism was conceived. This means that there may be several kinematic chains in the control mechanism, each designed for instance to perform one of these functions.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The supporting frame <b>31</b> advantageously comprises a pair of facing sides <b>134</b> mutually connected by means of a first transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>. According to the invention, the sides <b>134</b> are mutually connected by means of further connection means that define a further transverse connecting portion in a different position from the one occupied by the first transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>. In this embodiment, in other words, the sides <b>134</b> of the frame are mutually attached in two places so that they maintain a stable position in relation to one another. This means that the elements of the kinematic chain also permanently maintain their operative positions between the sides <b>134</b> of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, these transverse connecting means connect the two sides <b>134</b> together so that the additional connecting portion extends in a position substantially in front of that of the first transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>. This solution ensures a stable and reliable connection between the sides <b>134</b>, guaranteeing the structural stability of the supporting frame <b>31</b> needed for the proper operation of the control mechanism <b>30</b>. Moreover, the solution described has also proved particularly advantageous from the point of view of the assembly of the circuit-breaking device <b>1</b>, since the control mechanism <b>30</b> can be assembled separately from the rest of the circuit breaker <b>1</b>, and inserted therein only at the end of the procedure. In practice, the opportunity to assemble the control mechanism <b>30</b> before assembling the circuit breaker <b>1</b> enables savings in terms of the device's manufacturing times and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, these connection means consist of the trip shaft <b>40</b> of the tripping device of the circuit breaker <b>1</b>. More precisely, the sides of the supporting frame <b>31</b> are pivotally connected to the trip shaft <b>40</b>. As a consequence, the unit consisting of the trip shaft <b>40</b> and the control mechanism <b>30</b> can be assembled simultaneously inside the circuit-breaking device <b>1</b>, since the positioning of the former determines that of the other. Said unit can also be assembled on a different line from that of the circuit-breaking device <b>1</b>, prior to the assembly of the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Using the trip shaft <b>40</b> as a means of connection between the sides proves particularly advantageous because the structure of a member conventionally designed to serve a precise purpose (that of tripping the kinematic chain) is used to serve a further structural purpose for the frame <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a first embodiment of a circuit-breaking device according to the present invention. More precisely, the circuit-breaking device <b>1</b> shown in the figure is an automatic circuit breaker, to which reference will be made hereinafter solely for descriptive purposes. This is on the understanding, however, that the technical solutions and the principles expounded below are also applicable to other types of circuit-breaking device. The circuit breaker <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises an outer housing <b>2</b> consisting of a box <b>2</b>A and a cover <b>2</b>B, which are coupled together by removable connection means <b>76</b>, such as screws. The box <b>2</b>A is configured so as to contain a plurality of first electric terminals <b>100</b>, each relating to one pole of the circuit breaker <b>1</b>. Each electric terminal <b>100</b> is electrically connected to the fixed contact <b>10</b> on the corresponding pole. The cover <b>2</b>B is also configured so as to contain second electric terminals (not shown in the figures), each of which corresponds to a pole of the circuit breaker <b>1</b> and is electrically connected to a moving contact <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded view relating to the circuit breaker in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the cover <b>2</b>B removed, showing the unit consisting of the trip shaft <b>40</b> and the control mechanism <b>30</b> separated from the rest of the circuit breaker <b>1</b>. As shown, the box <b>2</b>A preferably supports a moving part <b>50</b>, which serves the purpose of containing the moving contacts <b>20</b> of the circuit breaker <b>1</b>. More precisely, the moving part <b>50</b> comprises a shaped body that, for each pole in the circuit breaker <b>1</b>, contains a seat for a moving contact <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the box <b>2</b>A contains a protection device that, for each pole, comprises a protection unit <b>16</b>, which interacts with an operative portion <b>144</b> of the trip shaft <b>40</b>. More precisely, said protection units <b>16</b> interact with the trip shaft <b>40</b> following the occurrence of a malfunction, such as a short circuit, on the line where the circuit breaker is installed. According to known embodiments, the protection units <b>16</b> may be of the thermal, magnetic, thermomagnetic or electronic type, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the assembly consisting of the control mechanism <b>30</b> and the trip shaft <b>40</b>. The control mechanism <b>30</b> is operatively connected to the moving contacts <b>20</b> by means of the moving part <b>50</b>. More precisely, the control mechanism <b>30</b> can acquire a first operative configuration (hereinafter called the closed configuration) as a result of which each moving contact <b>20</b> is coupled with the corresponding fixed contact <b>10</b>. The control mechanism <b>30</b> can also acquire a second configuration determined by a manual action brought to bear on one of the elements in the kinematic chain (the manual opening configuration) as a result of which each moving contact <b>20</b> is separated from the corresponding fixed contact <b>10</b>. The control mechanism <b>30</b> can also acquire a third configuration determined by the enabling of the tripping device: this takes place as a result of an action of one of the protection units <b>16</b> on one of the operative portions <b>144</b> of the trip shaft <b>40</b>. Said action induces the rotation of the trip shaft <b>40</b>, which determines the displacement of a tripping element <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) in the control mechanism <b>30</b>. The movement of the tripping element <b>36</b> causes a &#x201c;tripping&#x201d; of the kinematic chain as a result of which the control mechanism <b>30</b> switches from the &#x201c;closed&#x201d; configuration to the &#x201c;tripped&#x201d; configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the kinematic chain of the control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises at least one operative element pivotally connected to the supporting frame <b>31</b> by means of the pin-shaped connection means. The operative element comprises a pair of facing lateral portions, which are connected by a transverse connecting portion. The pin-shaped connection means comprise a pair of pin-shaped ends, each of which emerges from one side of a lateral portion of the operative element, or of the supporting frame <b>31</b>. The pin-shaped connection means also comprise a pair of seats, each of which is defined in the supporting frame in the operative element to contain a corresponding pin-shaped end. Once the pin-shaped ends have been inserted in the seats, an axis of mutual rotation is configured between the supporting frame <b>31</b> and said operative element connected thereto. The pin-shaped ends preferably have only one degree of freedom to rotate in relation to the corresponding seat during the operation of the control mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing, for the sake of simplicity, the supporting frame <b>31</b> of the control mechanism <b>30</b> and the trip shaft <b>40</b>. The sides <b>134</b> of the frame <b>31</b> each comprise an end portion <b>134</b>B, from which a pin-shaped portion <b>51</b> emerges. Each end portion <b>134</b>B is inserted in a corresponding shaped cavity <b>52</b>, of which at least one recessed portion <b>53</b> has surfaces geometrically conjugated with those of the pin-shaped portion <b>51</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b>, so as to enable a relative displacement of the trip shaft <b>40</b> with respect to the sides <b>134</b> of the frame <b>31</b>. More precisely, the recessed portion <b>53</b> is defined so as to be coaxial with the axis of rotation <b>200</b> of the trip shaft <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view of the set of components in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, showing the conformation of the sides <b>134</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b>. In particular, said figure shows the seats <b>61</b>,<b>65</b> in which the pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>,<b>75</b> of the elements <b>32</b>,<b>36</b> (described in more detail below) of the control mechanism <b>30</b> are inserted, supported directly by the two sides <b>134</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows the operative position of the trip shaft <b>40</b> facing that of the transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>. The longitudinal stretch of the trip shaft <b>40</b> coming in between the two shaped cavities clearly defines the above-described additional connecting portion between the sides <b>134</b> of the frame. As explained above, this solution advantageously enables an increase in the global stiffness of the frame <b>31</b> with obvious advantages in terms of the device's reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a view along VI-VI in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which shows a cross-sectional view of the portion of the trip shaft <b>40</b> containing the cavities <b>52</b> in which the pin-shaped ends <b>51</b> of the sides <b>134</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b> are inserted. Clearly, each cavity <b>52</b> defines an abutment surface <b>66</b> for one of the sides <b>134</b> of the frame <b>31</b>, effectively preventing any axial movement of said sides.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises a main hook <b>32</b> which is operatively connected to the supporting frame <b>31</b> by means of first pin-shaped connection means. The structure of the main hook <b>32</b> is shaped by a second pair of lateral portions <b>42</b> connected together by a second transverse connecting portion <b>22</b>. The main hook <b>32</b> is connected to the supporting frame <b>31</b> by means of first pin-shaped connection means according to the invention, which define a first axis of mutual rotation <b>101</b>. More precisely, the supporting frame <b>31</b> occupies a fixed position during the operation of the control mechanism <b>30</b>. As a result, the main hook <b>32</b> rotates with respect to the supporting frame <b>31</b> around the above-defined first axis of mutual rotation <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first pin-shaped connection means comprise a first pair of pin-shaped ends <b>71</b> (hereinafter also indicated using the expression first pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>), which emerge each from one of the lateral portions <b>42</b> of the main hook <b>32</b>. More precisely, the first pin-shaped ends <b>71</b> are made in one piece with a corresponding lateral portion <b>42</b> emerging on an outer side of the external portion. The first pin-shaped connection means also comprise a first pair of seats <b>61</b> (hereinafter also indicated using the expression first seats <b>61</b>), in each of which one of the first pin-shaped ends <b>71</b> of the main hook <b>32</b> is inserted. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first seats <b>61</b> are configured substantially in a U shape so as to enable the insertion of the first pin-shaped ends <b>71</b> in a precisely defined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first seats <b>61</b> are defined in a position in the vicinity of the first transverse portion <b>21</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b>, while the first pin-shaped ends <b>71</b> are obtained in a position substantially remote from the second transverse portion <b>22</b> of the main hook <b>32</b>. The first transverse portion <b>21</b> is thus located opposite the second transverse portion <b>22</b> of the main hook <b>32</b> once the two elements have been connected. Moreover, the lateral portions <b>42</b> of the main hook <b>32</b> come to occupy a position in between the lateral portions <b>42</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b>, so that the main hook <b>32</b> can rotate in relation to the frame <b>31</b>, within said frame.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The control mechanism <b>30</b> shown in the figures comprises a third element <b>33</b>, hereinafter indicated using the term &#x201c;fork <b>33</b>&#x201d;. The structure of the fork <b>33</b> comprises a third pair of facing lateral portions <b>43</b> that are connected together by means of a third connecting portion <b>23</b>. The fork <b>33</b> is operatively connected to the main hook <b>32</b> by means of second pin-shaped connection means that configure a second axis of mutual rotation <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>) substantially parallel to the first axis of rotation <b>101</b>. The second pin-shaped connection means comprise a second pair of pin-shaped ends <b>72</b> (hereinafter indicated using the term second pin-shaped ends <b>72</b>) and a second pair of seats <b>62</b> (hereinafter indicated using the expression second seats <b>62</b>), each of which is suitable for containing one of the second pin-shaped ends <b>72</b>. The latter are made in one piece with the main hook <b>32</b>. The second pin-shaped ends <b>72</b> emerge, facing one another, from each of the internal sides of the lateral portions <b>42</b> of the main hook <b>32</b>, while the second seats <b>62</b> are defined by the lateral portions <b>43</b> of the fork <b>33</b>. More precisely, the second seats <b>62</b> have a substantially C-shaped configuration and are located in line with first facing terminal parts <b>43</b>A of the lateral portions <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The fork <b>33</b> is connected to a fourth operative element <b>34</b> in the control mechanism <b>30</b>, hereinafter indicated using the term &#x201c;control rod&#x201d; <b>34</b>, which comprises a fourth pair of lateral portions <b>44</b> connected by a fourth transverse portion <b>24</b>. The control rod <b>34</b> is operatively connected to the fork <b>33</b> by means of third pin-shaped connection means that configure a third axis of mutual rotation <b>103</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>) substantially parallel to the above-described first and second axes <b>101</b>,<b>102</b>. More precisely, the third pin-shaped connection means comprise a third pair of pin-shaped ends <b>73</b> (hereinafter indicated using the expression third pin-shaped ends <b>73</b>) and a third pair of seats <b>63</b> (hereinafter indicated using the expression third pin-shaped seats <b>63</b>), each of which is suitable for containing one of the third pin-shaped ends <b>73</b>. The latter are made in one piece with the control rod <b>34</b> and they emerge on facing sides of the fourth transverse portion <b>24</b>.

More precisely, the third seats <b>63</b> are defined in line with second facing terminal parts <b>43</b>B of the lateral portions <b>43</b>. Said second facing terminal parts <b>43</b>B are substantially opposite the first terminal parts <b>43</b>&#xb0;, in line with which there are the second seats <b>62</b> for the second pin-shaped connection means.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The control rod <b>34</b> also comprises a second pair of connecting ends <b>82</b> made in one piece with the fourth lateral portions <b>44</b> so as to occupy mutually opposing positions. Each of these second connecting ends <b>82</b> emerges from the internal side of a lateral portion so that it can be inserted in corresponding centring seats (not shown) defined on the body of the moving part. More precisely, once said second connecting ends <b>82</b> have been inserted in the corresponding centring seats, they define an axis of mutual rotation for the control rod <b>34</b> in relation to the moving part <b>50</b> and vice versa. Said axis is in a position that is off-centre with respect to the axis of rotation of the moving part <b>50</b>. As a result, a displacement of the control rod <b>34</b> determines a rotation of the moving part <b>50</b> and consequently of the moving contacts <b>20</b> contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises a fifth operative element <b>35</b>, hereinafter indicated using the term &#x201c;lever-holder element&#x201d; <b>35</b>, which comprises a fifth pair of lateral portions <b>45</b> connected by a fifth transverse portion <b>25</b> that is at least partially folded over into a U shape. Said folding has the purpose of supporting a lever <b>35</b>B, which extends from the housing <b>2</b> of the circuit breaker <b>1</b> once it has been assembled. In practice, the lever <b>35</b>B serves as the interface between the circuit breaker <b>1</b> and an operator. As explained in more detail later on, the lever <b>35</b>B occupies a particular position depending on the operative configuration of the control mechanism <b>30</b> (i.e. the closed, open or tripped configurations). As a result, an operator can ascertain the operative status of the circuit breaker <b>1</b> by observing the position of the lever <b>35</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The lever-holder element <b>35</b> is operatively connected to the supporting frame <b>31</b> by means of fourth connection means comprising a fourth pair of pin-shaped ends <b>74</b> (hereinafter indicated using the term fourth pin-shaped ends <b>74</b>) that are obtained in one piece with the supporting frame <b>31</b>. The fourth connection means also comprise a fourth pair of seats <b>64</b> (hereinafter also indicated using the expression fourth seats <b>64</b>), each of which is defined on one of the fifth lateral portions <b>45</b> of the lever <b>35</b>. Once the fourth ends <b>74</b> have been inserted in the corresponding fourth seats <b>64</b>, they define a fourth fixed axis of rotation <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) parallel to the axes of rotation described so far. Each of the fourth pin-shaped ends <b>74</b> emerges from a corresponding external side of a side <b>134</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b> and slots into a corresponding fourth seat <b>64</b> configured substantially in a C shape.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As already mentioned above, the control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises a tripping element <b>36</b> operatively connected to the supporting frame <b>31</b> by means of fifth pin-shaped connection means. More precisely, the tripping element <b>36</b> structurally consists of a sixth pair of facing lateral connecting portions <b>46</b>, which are connected by a fifth transverse portion <b>26</b>. The latter comprises a first hooked end <b>85</b> that serves the purpose of intercepting a second hooked end (not shown) of the main hook <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The fifth pin-shaped connection means comprise a fifth pair of pin-shaped ends <b>75</b> made in one piece with the sixth lateral portions <b>46</b> of the tripping element <b>36</b>. More precisely, each of these fifth pin-shaped ends <b>75</b> emerges from an external side of one of the lateral portions <b>46</b>. The fifth connection means also comprise a facing fifth pair of seats <b>65</b>, each on one side <b>134</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b>. Each of the fifth pin-shaped ends <b>75</b> is inserted in a corresponding fifth seat <b>65</b> so as to configure a fifth fixed axis of rotation <b>105</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) for the rotation of the tripping element <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to the perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, at least one of the lateral portions <b>46</b> of the tripping element <b>36</b> comprises a first activating end <b>91</b> that is operatively connected to a second activating end <b>92</b> emerging from the trip shaft <b>40</b>. Any rotation of the trip shaft <b>40</b>, following the tripping of a protection device, is thus translated into a displacement of the first end <b>92</b> that withdraws the support for the element <b>85</b>, inducing a rotation of the tripping element <b>36</b> around the fifth axis of rotation <b>105</b>. The tripping element <b>36</b> can consequently pass from the hooked position to the released position, at which point the main hook <b>32</b> becomes free to rotate around the first axis of rotation <b>101</b>. The two activating ends <b>91</b>,<b>92</b> are mutually connected by a return spring <b>87</b> that enables the device to be suitably reset from the tripped position to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The control mechanism <b>30</b> comprises at least one control spring <b>37</b>, and preferably two. Each control spring <b>37</b> is operatively connected at one end to the fourth transverse portion <b>24</b> of the control rod <b>34</b>, and at the other end to the fifth transverse portion <b>25</b> of the lever-holder element <b>35</b>, by means of suitable hooks <b>37</b>B. Inside the control mechanism <b>30</b>, each control spring <b>37</b> serves more than one purpose. Its first purpose is to provide the mechanism with the elastic force needed to accelerate the rotation of the moving part <b>50</b>, i.e. the opening or closing of the contact, by means of the control rod <b>34</b>. Each control spring <b>37</b> also serves the purpose of exerting an elastic force on the pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>,<b>72</b>,<b>73</b>,<b>74</b>,<b>75</b> of the coupled elements so that they maintain a stable position inside the corresponding seat <b>61</b>,<b>62</b>,<b>63</b>,<b>64</b>,<b>65</b> in which they are inserted. In other words, each control spring <b>37</b> takes effect on the various elements of the control mechanism <b>30</b> so as to keep each element constantly connected to the others. In practice, each control spring <b>37</b> exerts a force on the various pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>,<b>72</b>,<b>73</b>,<b>74</b>,<b>75</b> that is oriented in a direction concordant with the direction in which they are inserted in the corresponding seats <b>61</b>,<b>62</b>,<b>63</b>,<b>64</b>,<b>65</b>. Moreover, each control spring <b>37</b> exerts said force on the various pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>,<b>72</b>,<b>73</b>,<b>74</b>,<b>75</b> whatever the configuration of the control mechanism <b>30</b> so that the functionality of the device is always guaranteed. A further function of the springs <b>37</b> consists in ensuring a suitable pressure on the electric contacts when the circuit breaker is in the closed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">This embodiment is particularly advantageous in that it exploits the action of the kinematic thrust elements (i.e. the control springs <b>37</b>) to keep the control mechanism <b>30</b> stably assembled. This makes it possible to broaden the range of the dimensional tolerance for the pin-shaped ends and the related seats, with obvious advantages in terms of the overall manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the control mechanism <b>30</b> shown in a closed configuration, wherein the moving contacts <b>20</b> are coupled with the corresponding fixed contacts <b>10</b>. In this configuration, the control springs <b>37</b> are under a tensile stress and exert an elastic force that develops along a line <b>7</b>. In practice, said line <b>7</b> is defined by the points where the control springs <b>37</b> engage respectively with the control rod <b>34</b> and the lever-holder element <b>35</b>. The tripping element <b>36</b> of the control mechanism thus comes to be in the hooked position, withholding the main hook <b>32</b>, i.e. prevent it from rotating around the first axis <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The passage from the closed configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to the open configuration (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is achieved as a result of a manual action (indicated by the arrow F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) exerted by an operator on the lever <b>36</b>. This manual action F induces the rotation of the lever-holder element <b>35</b> around the fourth axis of mutual rotation <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). During a first phase of rotation of the lever-holder element <b>35</b>, the moving contacts <b>20</b> remain coupled, while the control springs <b>37</b> connected between the lever-holder element <b>35</b> and the control rod <b>34</b> come under a progressively increasing tensile stress. This condition persists up until the line <b>7</b> intersects the second axis of mutual rotation <b>102</b> defined by the second pin-shaped connection means that connect the main hook <b>32</b> to the fork <b>33</b>. When this happens, the control springs <b>37</b> reach their maximum extension, i.e. their maximum allowable tensile stress. As soon as the line <b>7</b> drops beyond the second axis of rotation <b>102</b>, the control springs <b>37</b> release the elastic energy accumulated during the first opening phase. This determines a rapid entrainment of the control rod <b>34</b> downwards, i.e. in the direction of the hook <b>36</b>, which induces the rotation of the moving part <b>50</b> around its axis of rotation, and this is translated into a rapid separation of the contacts <b>10</b>,<b>20</b>. At the end of the opening phase, the control mechanism <b>30</b> reaches the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Clearly, the tripping element <b>36</b> remains in its hooked position during a manual opening manoeuvre.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the control mechanism <b>30</b> in its &#x201c;tripped&#x201d; configuration. The passage from the closed configuration (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to this tripped configuration takes place due to an action of a protection device in the circuit breaker <b>1</b>, which causes a rotation of the trip shaft <b>40</b>. Said rotation is translated into a rotation of the tripping element <b>36</b> around the fifth axis of rotation <b>105</b> that brings it into a released position, as a result of which the main hook <b>32</b> is free to rotate in relation to the supporting frame <b>31</b> around the first axis of mutual rotation <b>101</b>. More precisely, when the main hook <b>32</b> is released, the control springs <b>37</b> exert a tensile stress on the control rod <b>34</b> in the direction of the lever <b>35</b>B. Said tensile stress comes to bear on the main hook <b>32</b> through the fork <b>33</b>, causing the rotation of said hook <b>32</b> around the first axis of rotation <b>101</b>. The entrainment of the control rod <b>34</b> in turn prompts the rotation of the moving part <b>50</b> and the consequent sudden separation of the contacts <b>10</b>,<b>20</b>. The control mechanism <b>30</b> thus acquires the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is clearly different from the one in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which shows a manual opening configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to a preferred embodiment, the supporting frame <b>31</b> shown in the figures from <b>1</b> to <b>12</b> is made of a metallic material, such as sheet metal. More precisely, the sides <b>134</b> of the frame <b>31</b> are made in a single piece with the transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Figures from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 29</figref> refer to a second embodiment of a circuit-breaking device according to the invention. In particular, the figures again relate to an automatic circuit breaker <b>3</b> preferably for use for lower currents than in the case of the circuit breaker <b>1</b> shown in figures from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the structure of the housing for the circuit breaker <b>3</b> is substantially similar to that of the previously-described circuit breaker <b>1</b>, being complete with a box <b>2</b>A and an associated cover <b>2</b>B and a protective front plate <b>2</b>C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the automatic circuit breaker <b>3</b> ready for installation, i.e. after completing its assembly, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the same circuit breaker <b>3</b> with the protective front plate <b>2</b>C detached from the cover <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a first exploded view of the circuit breaker <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, showing the breaker without the protective front plate <b>2</b> C. More precisely, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the details of the cover <b>2</b>B of the circuit breaker <b>3</b>, in which a supporting structure <b>81</b> is defined that serves the purpose of supporting the control mechanism <b>30</b>. The structure comprises a pair of supporting walls <b>131</b> that are usually facing and geometrically conjugated to the sides <b>134</b> of the supporting frame <b>31</b> of the control mechanism <b>30</b> in order to keep the latter correctly positioned during the normal operation of the circuit breaker. Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, between the lateral supporting walls <b>31</b> there is an opening <b>82</b> through which the control lever <b>35</b>B of the control mechanism <b>30</b> emerges once the automatic circuit breaker <b>3</b> has been assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a second exploded view of the circuit breaker <b>3</b> showing the unit comprising the control mechanism <b>30</b> and the trip shaft <b>40</b> separated from the rest of the circuit breaker <b>3</b>. As shown in this second embodiment, the shapes of the trip shaft <b>40</b> and of the control mechanism <b>30</b> differ from those of the same elements in figures from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 12</figref>. As explained in more detail later on, the supporting frame <b>31</b> and the trip shaft <b>40</b> are connected differently, i.e. by means of a substantially &#x201c;keyed&#x201d; type of connection. This connection basically involves the insertion of a pair of shaped portions <b>121</b> of the trip shaft <b>40</b> inside suitable connecting seats <b>122</b> each defined on an end portion of one side <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C of the frame <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 21</figref>, each of said seats <b>122</b> comprises a tapered portion <b>123</b> that extends from the edge <b>140</b> of the corresponding side <b>134</b> of the frame <b>31</b>. More precisely, the portion <b>123</b> is tapered towards the internal side of the side <b>134</b>. The seat <b>122</b> also comprises a circular portion <b>141</b> that extends from the innermost section of the tapered portion <b>123</b>. Said circular portion <b>141</b> has a diameter D<b>1</b> that is greater than the dimension S of the innermost cross-section of the tapered part <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> show the conformation of the shaped portions <b>121</b> designed to be contained in the connecting seat <b>122</b>. Each shaped portion <b>121</b> comprises a stretch of axial cross-section, identified as L<b>1</b>, on which two plane surfaces <b>125</b> are defined in a position facing the axis of rotation of the shaft <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the distance H between the two plane surfaces is narrower than the diameter of the cylindrical stretch L<b>1</b>. Said diameter is chosen so that it preferably coincides with the diameter D<b>1</b> of the circular portion <b>141</b> of the connecting seat <b>122</b>, while the distance H<b>1</b> between the plane surfaces <b>125</b> is narrower than the dimension S relating to the innermost cross-section of the tapered portion <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The shaped portions <b>121</b> are inserted in the corresponding connecting seats <b>122</b> keeping the shaft <b>40</b> oriented so that the shaped portions each face towards a surface <b>145</b> of the tapered portion <b>123</b>. Once the shaped portions <b>121</b> have reached the circular portion <b>141</b>, the shaft is rotated approximately 90&#xb0; around its axis of rotation <b>200</b>. In this condition, the shaped portions <b>121</b> remained engaged to the inside of the circular portion <b>141</b> and the trip shaft <b>40</b> remains free to rotate, supported in said rotation by the surfaces of said circular portions <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the trip shaft <b>40</b> comprises an abutment ring <b>161</b> that emerges in a position adjacent to a corresponding shaped portion <b>121</b>. The abutment ring <b>161</b> defines an abutment surface <b>166</b> for a portion of the side <b>134</b>&#xb0; of the frame <b>31</b> that surrounds the corresponding connecting seat <b>122</b>. This embodiment advantageously increases the stiffness of the structure of the supporting frame <b>31</b> because it hinders any lateral sagging of the sides <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C. The above-described technical solutions may also be replaced by other, functionally equivalent solutions that shall consequently be considered as a part of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is an exploded view showing the control mechanism illustrated in figures from <b>13</b> to <b>16</b>. The kinematic chain comprising the mechanism is conceptually equivalent to the one described in detail for the embodiment illustrated in figures from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 12</figref>. It should be noted, in particular, that the elements comprising the kinematic chain are mutually connected by pin-shaped connection means in much the same way as explained previously. As in the previous solution, a main hook <b>32</b>, with a tripping element <b>36</b>, is hinged to the supporting frame <b>31</b>. The sides of the hook <b>32</b> and of the tripping element <b>36</b> comprise pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>,<b>75</b> for inserting in corresponding seats <b>61</b>,<b>65</b>, each of which is defined on the internal side <b>134</b>E of one of the sides <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C of the frame <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref> are two projections of the supporting frame <b>31</b>, which is manufactured preferably by moulding a plastic material. More precisely, the sides <b>134</b>A, <b>134</b>C of the frame <b>31</b> are moulded in one piece with the transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>. This solution proves extremely advantageous in that it enables the supporting frame <b>31</b> to be shaped in a single technological step i.e. in only one process. In fact, such a moulding also enables the definition of the seats <b>61</b>,<b>65</b> for containing the pin-shaped ends <b>71</b>,<b>75</b> of the main hook <b>32</b> and of the tripping element <b>36</b> in the control mechanism <b>30</b>, and also the connecting seat <b>122</b> for containing the shaped portions <b>121</b> of the trip shaft <b>40</b>. From a practical standpoint, the moulding also makes it possible to define new forms of connection between the sides <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C of the frame <b>31</b> and the elements in the kinematic chain. In the embodiment illustrated, for instance, the internal sides <b>134</b>E of the sides <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C comprise a shaped ribbing <b>145</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>) that forms a seat <b>146</b> for the rotation of the pin-shaped end <b>35</b>C of the lever-holder element <b>35</b>. It is self-evident that, among the other advantages, this solution simplifies the design and manufacture particularly of the lever-holder element <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With reference in particular to the detailed view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, the frame <b>31</b> is moulded from a plastic material so as to create &#x201c;pinched areas&#x201d; <b>155</b> coming between each side <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C of the frame <b>31</b> and the connecting portion <b>21</b> that provides the transverse connection between the two sides <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C. The term &#x201c;pinched area&#x201d; is used here to mean a local thinning of the material so as to enable one side <b>134</b> to be folded over in relation to the transverse connecting portion <b>21</b>, or vice versa, as shown clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>. In other words, the pinched area <b>155</b> serves as a structural hinge enabling the frame <b>31</b> to be folded after moulding, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>, to shape it into the operative condition shown, for instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 19</figref>. The pinched areas <b>155</b> are naturally designed so as to assure a certain mechanical resistance, sufficient to counter any stresses tending to separate the sides <b>134</b>A,<b>134</b>C of the frame <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> show the control mechanism <b>30</b> respectively during its assembly and after the completion of the assembly. Clearly, moulding the supporting frame <b>31</b> in one piece also simplifies the procedure for assembling the unit comprising the control mechanism <b>30</b> and the trip shaft <b>40</b>. With reference in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the elements comprising the kinematic chain in the mechanism <b>30</b> can be installed first on an internal side <b>134</b>E of the first side <b>134</b>A of the frame <b>31</b>. Thus, for instance, one of the pin-shaped ends <b>71</b> of the main hook <b>32</b> can be inserted in one of the moulded seats <b>61</b> on the first side <b>134</b>A. Then the second side <b>134</b>C can be folded over in relation to the first <b>134</b>A, thanks to the pinched areas <b>155</b>, so as to block the elements of the kinematic chain on the other side too. As illustrated, the other pin-shaped end <b>71</b> of the main hook <b>32</b> can be inserted in the corresponding seat <b>61</b> so as to stably hold the hook on both sides and consequently all the elements connected thereto. Once the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> has been obtained, the structure of the control mechanism <b>30</b> can be stiffened by connecting the trip shaft <b>40</b> according to the above-explained principles.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The technical solutions adopted for the circuit-breaking device according to the invention fully enable the previously-stated technical aim to be satisfied. In particular, the internal structure of the device is such that it enables a marked reduction in the assembly times by comparison with the conventional solutions. At the same time, the circuit-breaking device is reliable and easy to manufacture at extremely competitive costs.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The circuit-breaking device thus conceived may undergo numerous modifications and variants, all coming within the scope of the inventive concept. Moreover, all the details may be replaced by others that are technically equivalent and, in practical terms, any materials may be used of any suitable shape and size, according to need and the state of the art.</p>
