<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a turbocharger for an internal combustion engine having a turbine housing with spiral inlet passages coupled to different exhaust gas lines of an exhaust train of the internal combustion engine and to an internal combustion engine, in particular a gasoline and/or diesel engine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result of the continuous tightening of emission limits, such as NO<sub>x </sub>and particulate emission limits, turbochargers and supercharged engines are subject to increasingly strict requirements as well. Requirements are for example increasingly stringent with respect to boost pressure provision at high exhaust gas recirculation rates over medium to high load demand ranges of the internal combustion engine, whereby, the turbines of turbochargers are increasingly made smaller geometrically. The high turbine power output demanded of turbochargers is achieved by increasing the banking capability or reducing the absorption capability of the turbines in combination with the respective internal combustion engine. The power output of turbochargers can further be influenced by installing exhaust treatment systems such as particulate filters, catalytic converters or SCR systems into the exhaust train downstream of the turbine. These exhaust treatment system increase the pressure at an exhaust gas outlet of the turbocharger. This in turn reduces a turbine pressure gradient which characterizes the performance of the turbocharger, wherein the turbine pressure gradient can be determined as a quotient of a pressure upstream of the turbine wheel or an exhaust gas inlet of the turbine housing and a pressure downstream of the turbine wheel or an exhaust gas outlet of the turbine housing. For this reason, the size of the turbine has to be further reduced, thereby reducing its efficiency, in order to meet the power demand of the compressor of the turbocharger. Some improvement is provided by turbochargers known from prior art, the turbine housing of which comprise two independently passable spiral passages which are usually asymmetrical, and each of which is coupled to different exhaust gas lines of an exhaust train of the internal combustion engine. The exhaust gas lines themselves are assigned to different cylinders or cylinder groups of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the design of turbochargers, which are usually defined on the basis of the nominal operating point, the charge exchange side and the consumption side of the internal combustion engine, the lower load and speed range of internal combustion engines in particular can however not be optimized even when using turbochargers with two asymmetrical spiral passages. For this purpose, the cross-section of one spiral passage generally has to be relatively small in order to generate the required exhaust gas flow speeds. The economical sand casting process commonly used for producing the turbine housing is however subject to limits in terms of production engineering, so that only spiral passages with a width of more than 4.5 mm can be produced reliably. In addition, casting is often subject to relatively major variances of 10% or more, which leads to further efficiency losses of the turbocharger.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is the object of the present invention to provide a turbocharger for an internal combustion engine, or an internal combustion engine fitted with a turbocharger which allows for improved efficiency in a larger operating range while involving production costs which are as low as possible.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a turbocharger for an internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle, comprising a turbine housing having first and second spiral passages, each of which is connected to at least one exhaust gas line of an exhaust train of the internal combustion engine and a turbine wheel disposed within a rotor chamber of the turbine housing and connected to a compressor impeller via a drive shaft for rotation with the impeller, the exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine can be routed through the spiral passages for admission to the turbine wheel via the first and second spiral passages which have different wrap angles.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wrap angles define the areas in degrees in which the spiral passages enclose the locating chamber of the turbine housing. This reduces manufacturing tolerance requirements while improving the efficiency of the internal combustion engine, in particular in the intermediate and lower load and speed ranges. The spiral passage with the smaller wrap angle significantly contributes to an increase in efficiency, in particular in cases of partial admission. In contrast to prior art, the sonic transition of the exhaust gas flow can be generated immediately upstream of the turbine wheel. This reliably prevents the generation of the exhaust gas flow sonic transition in the spiral cross-section of the spiral passage and the occurrence of high flow losses in the downstream outlet region. In addition, the turbocharger according to the invention allows the continued use of low-cost and established sand casting processes, because the production engineering limits of these processes can be observed easily without affecting the efficiency or mechanical stability of the turbocharger housing. In view of the low manufacturing tolerance requirements, alternative low-cost production methods can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the first spiral passage has a wrap angle of less than 300&#xb0;, in particular less than 200&#xb0; and preferably less than 150&#xb0;. In other words, the first spiral passage is a partial volute, so that the power requirements of the compressor can be met optimally even in the lower load and speed range of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further advantages are offered by a design wherein the second spiral passage has a wrap angle of at least 280&#xb0;, in particular at least 320&#xb0; and preferably of at least 350&#xb0;. In other words, the second spiral passage is at least approximately designed as a full volute, with the result that the turbocharger can be operated in the high load and speed ranges of the internal combustion engine and can be subjected to correspondingly large exhaust gas volumes, allowing full admission. In this way, the first spiral passage can further be designed as a so-called lambda flood in order to achieve, by means of its banking capability, the required air/fuel ratio at optimum efficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the first spiral passage is located in the region of the shaft bearing and the second spiral passage is located in the region of an exhaust gas outlet in the turbine housing. In other words, it is provided that the second spiral passage, which is at least approximately designed as a full volute, is located at the outlet side of the turbine housing, while the first spiral passage designed as a partial volute is located on its bearing side, whereby the efficiency of the turbocharger is further optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the first and/or the second spiral passage(s) include(s) a nozzle in the region leading to the locating chamber. Using this nozzle, the narrowest flow cross-section of the respective spiral passage can be placed at a defined position, so that the sonic transition of the exhaust gas flow is generated directly ahead of the turbine wheel. In this way, undesirable flow losses and a related decrease in efficiency can be reliably avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A cross-sectional width of the nozzle preferably is preferably designed in dependence on a limit width set by considerations of production engineering. It may for example be provided that the cross-sectional width of the nozzle is chosen to exceed the limit width achievable in terms of production engineering by such an amount that the manufacturing tolerances of the process used to produce the turbine housing have a minimum effect on the subsequent performance of the turbine side of the turbo charger. It may for example be provided that the cross-sectional width of the nozzle is at least approximately 4.5 mm when using an economical sand casting process, in order to achieve, at the commonly used manufacturing tolerances of &#xb1;10%, both an economical and accurate production of the turbine housing and a reliable subsequent operation of the turbocharger.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further advantages are obtained by providing that an effective cross-section of the nozzle is chosen in dependence on the wrap angle of the spiral passage and/or the cross-sectional width of the nozzle and/or a radius of the nozzle and/or an efficiency of the turbocharger. An effective cross-section defined in this way, wherein flow losses within the spiral passage are already taken into account, facilitates the simple and variable adaptation to different application profiles of the turbocharger while taking account of the desired efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It has been found to be advantageous if the effective cross-section of the nozzle is determined in accordance with the formula
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>A</i><sub>D</sub><i>=r</i><sub>D</sub>*2<i>*&#x3c0;*b</i><sub>D</sub>*sin(&#x3b1;<sub>D</sub>)*(&#x3c6;<sub>S</sub>/360),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein A<sub>D </sub>denotes the effective cross-section of the nozzle, r<sub>D </sub>a radius of the nozzle with respect to an axis of rotation of the turbine wheel, b<sub>D </sub>the cross-sectional width of the nozzle, &#x3b1;<sub>D </sub>an angle between a circumferential speed vector and a radial speed vector of the exhaust gas flow in the cross-section of the nozzle and &#x3c6;<sub>S </sub>the wrap angle of the respective spiral passage. Such an effective cross-section of the nozzle ensures an optimum geometrical design and thus an optimum efficiency by simply taking relevant factors and operating parameters into account.
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a particular embodiment of the turbocharger according to the invention, a first inlet region of the first spiral passage corresponds to a second inlet region of the second spiral passage. In this way, a small-sized double-flow turbocharger which can be used in internal combustion engines for cars can be obtained. In car applications of the internal combustion engine, this design achieves improved unsteady-state behavior. If the internal combustion engine is used in commercial vehicles, the setting of an exhaust gas recirculation volume can be adjusted by simple means to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, a third spiral passage is provided adjacent to the first and second spiral passages, the third spiral passage having a wrap angle corresponding to a full volute. In this way, a very high turbine efficiency combined with an optimum swirl effect and a tailor-made banking pressure in an exhaust gas recirculation line can advantageously be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To improve efficiency in a wider operating range of the turbocharger, the invention proposes that a guide grid element comprising guide vanes be provided in the region of the first and/or second spiral passage leading into the locating chamber. Such a guide grid element permits the establishment of a pressure increase upstream of the turbine wheel of the turbocharger, whereby the efficiency of the turbocharger is increased even at a low exhaust gas flow rate in the respective spiral passage.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another advantage is offered by providing that the guide grid element is mounted movably, in particular translationally and/or rotationally, in the turbine housing. Owing to the movable mounting of the guide grid element, the effective flow cross-section of the first or second spiral passage becomes particularly adaptable. It may further be provided that the guide grid element is moved into the respective spiral passage during an engine braking phase of the internal combustion engine, enabling the turbocharger to be used as a so-called &#x201c;turbo brake&#x201d;. As an alternative or in addition, it may be provided that the guide grid element is moved into or out of the spiral passage in a firing phase of the internal combustion engine, further improving the adaptability of the power output of the turbocharger to the current operating state of the internal combustion engine. For this purpose, an actuator assigned to the guide grid element may for example be coupled to an engine controller, in order to move the guide grid element in response to corresponding control signals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further advantages result from the provision of a matrix mounted movably, in particular translationally and/or rotationally, in the turbine housing for the adjustment of a blade height of the guide grid element. With the aid of a matrix of this type, the banking behavior of the respective spiral passage and thus of the turbine as a whole can be varied particularly easily by adjusting the blade height of the guide grid element, thus adapting it to the current operating state of the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A blow-off device, in particular a blow-off valve, may be provided upstream of the turbine wheel, by means of which exhaust gas can be guided past the turbine wheel. This allows a fine adjustment of the exhaust gas throughput of the turbocharger turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A further aspect of the invention relates to an internal combustion engine, in particular a gasoline and/or diesel engine, for a motor vehicle, which comprises at least two cylinders or cylinder groups to which are assigned at least two exhaust gas lines, and a turbocharger with a compressor located in an intake train of the internal combustion engine and a turbine located in an exhaust train of the internal combustion engine, wherein the turbine comprises a turbine housing with at least one first and one second spiral passage, each of which is coupled to at least one of the two exhaust gas lines of the exhaust train and through each of which exhaust gas flows independently, and which further comprises a turbine wheel mounted in a locating chamber of the turbine housing, to which exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine routed through the first and second spiral passages can be applied to drive an impeller of the compressor which is coupled thereto for rotation therewith via a bearing shaft. According to the invention, efficiency is improved in a larger operating range of the internal combustion engine while involving minimum manufacturing costs by providing that the first and second spiral passages have different wrap angles. This permits both partial and full circle admission to the turbine, enabling the internal combustion engine to operate more efficiently in the low, intermediate and high operating ranges. Owing to the simple re-arrangement of the design, well-established economical production processes can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The emissions of the internal combustion engine are improved by arranging an exhaust gas recirculation system is upstream of the turbine in the exhaust train, by means of which at least part of the exhaust gas from at least one of the exhaust gas lines can be recirculated into the intake train. The exhaust gas recirculation system in particular allows a reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) in the combustion of the fuel of the internal combustion engine. Owing to the improved banking capability of the turbocharger, this opens up operating ranges with a positive charge exchange between the exhaust and intake trains of the internal combustion engine irrespective of the high exhaust gas recirculation capability of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The emission values of the internal combustion engine are improved further by providing that an exhaust treatment system, in particular a particulate filter, catalytic converter or SCR system, is provided in the exhaust train downstream of an exhaust gas outlet of the turbine housing. Any back pressure increase of the turbine wheel caused by such an exhaust treatment system can be compensated for advantageously by means of the turbocharger even in the lower or intermediate operating range of the internal combustion engine.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a turbocharger for an internal combustion engine <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of a motor vehicle according to a first embodiment. The turbocharger comprises a turbine housing <b>12</b> with a first and a second spiral passage <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, each of which can be coupled to one of several exhaust gas lines <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of an exhaust train <b>18</b> of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> and through each of which exhaust gas can flow independently. The turbine housing <b>12</b> further comprises a turbine wheel <b>22</b> in a rotor chamber <b>20</b>, to which the exhaust gas of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b>, which can be guided through the two spiral passages <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, can be admitted for driving a compressor impeller <b>25</b> of a compressor <b>27</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) coupled to the turbine wheel <b>22</b> for rotation therewith via a drive shaft <b>24</b>. In order to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine <b>10</b> in a wider operating range while keeping manufacturing costs as low as possible, the first and second spiral passages <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>have different wrap angles &#x3c6;<sub>S</sub>. While the second spiral passage <b>14</b><i>b</i>, which is located in the region of an exhaust gas outlet <b>26</b> of the turbine housing <b>12</b>, has a wrap angle &#x3c6;<sub>S </sub>of more than 320&#xb0;, the first spiral passage <b>14</b><i>a</i>, which is located in the region of the drive shaft <b>24</b>, has a smaller wrap angle &#x3c6;<sub>S </sub>of approximately 135&#xb0; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In other words, the turbocharger comprises a double-flow turbine <b>23</b> with a first spiral passage <b>14</b><i>a </i>forming a partial volute and a second spiral passage <b>14</b><i>b </i>forming an at least approximately full volute for guiding the exhaust gas flow. In this way, the narrowest flow cross-section of the turbine <b>23</b> can is in the area of a nozzle <b>28</b><i>a </i>or <b>28</b><i>b</i>, so that the sonic transition of the exhaust gas flow is formed directly upstream of the turbine wheel <b>22</b> and not in the cross-section A<sub>S </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the respective spiral passage <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The nozzles <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, which have the smallest cross-sectional widths by of the two spiral passages <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, are located in the region leading to the rotor chamber <b>20</b>. The cross-sectional width b<sub>D </sub>of the smaller nozzle <b>28</b><i>a </i>is chosen in dependence on a production engineering limit width of an economical sand casting process used to produce the turbine housing <b>12</b> and is at least 4.5 mm, in order to achieve, at the commonly used manufacturing tolerances of &#xb1;10%, both an economical and secure production of the turbine housing <b>12</b> and a reliable subsequent operation of the turbocharger. An effective cross-section A<sub>D </sub>of the nozzle <b>28</b><i>a </i>is defined by the formula

<br/>
wherein r<sub>D </sub>denotes a radius of the nozzle <b>28</b><i>a </i>with respect to an axis of rotation I of the turbine wheel <b>22</b> and &#x3b1;<sub>D </sub>denotes an angle between a circumferential speed vector and a radial speed vector of an exhaust gas flow in the cross-section of the nozzle <b>28</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In other words, the effective flow cross-section of the nozzle <b>28</b><i>a </i>is chosen while taking into account the wrap angle &#x3c6;<sub>S</sub>, the cross-sectional width by of the nozzle <b>28</b><i>a</i>, which is determined by the achievable manufacturing tolerances, and the desired turbine efficiency. The turbocharger further comprises a known guide grid element <b>30</b> with a plurality of guide vanes, which can be axially pushed into or out of the nozzle <b>28</b><i>b </i>of the second spiral passage <b>14</b><i>b</i>, among other considerations to represent a turbo braking functionality (&#x201c;turbo brake&#x201d;) of the turbocharger.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagrammatic part section of the turbocharger according to a further embodiment. The basic structure can be derived from the above descriptions. In contrast to the first embodiment, however, the guide grid element <b>30</b> is stationary.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic representation of an internal combustion engine <b>10</b> fitted with the turbocharger according to the first embodiment. In principle, the internal combustion engine may be a diesel, an SI or a diesel/SI engine; in the illustrated embodiment, it has six cylinders <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, of which cylinders <b>11</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are combined to form a first cylinder group <b>34</b><i>a </i>and cylinders <b>11</b><i>d</i>-<i>f </i>are combined to form a second cylinder group <b>34</b><i>b</i>. The two exhaust gas lines <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are assigned to the cylinder groups <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b</i>, the first exhaust gas line <b>16</b><i>a </i>being coupled to the first spiral passage <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the turbocharger, which is designed as a partial volute, via suitable manifolds, while the second exhaust gas line <b>16</b><i>b </i>is coupled to the second spiral passage <b>14</b><i>b </i>designed as a full volute. Upstream of the first spiral passage <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the exhaust train <b>18</b> is provided with an exhaust gas recirculation system <b>38</b>, by means of which at least a part of the exhaust gas is conveyed from the exhaust gas line <b>16</b><i>a </i>into an intake train <b>40</b>.

The second spiral passage <b>14</b><i>b </i>designed as a full volute, which is also referred to as a lambda guide duct structures, provides, by means of its banking capability, for the required air/fuel ratio with the aim of achieving optimum turbine efficiency.
