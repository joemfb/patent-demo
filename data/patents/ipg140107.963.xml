<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national stage application of International Application No. PCTNO2009/000397, filed Nov. 19, 2009, which International application was published on May 27, 2010 as International Publication No. WO 2010/059063 A1 in the English language and which application is incorporated herein by reference. The International application claims priority of Norwegian Patent Application No. 20084905, filed Nov. 21, 2008, which application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">AREA OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns, among other things, a device, a method and a use for transfer of equipment for a wireline operation in a well connected to a drilling derrick via a top drive. The well may be a subsea well or a land-based well. Typically, such wireline operation equipment is used in connection with various intervention operations in the well. During well intervention operations of this type, wireline (cable) or coiled tubing is used to carry miscellaneous downhole equipment down into or out of a pressurized well.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, this wireline operation equipment includes a wireline blowout preventer or WL BOP, a lubricator, a grease head and miscellaneous downhole equipment, for example measuring probes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Normally, said drilling derrick and top drive are disposed on a drilling rig, which also comprises a drill floor, drawworks and miscellaneous other, associated equipment types known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">If such wireline operations are to be carried out from a land-based structure or from a seabed-affixed structure offshore, for example from a seabed-affixed platform or a jack-up platform/rig, said wireline operation equipment is connected to a wellhead on surface. In this type of situation, a full well pressure will exist up to the wellhead. It is therefore necessary to connect said blowout preventer, lubricator, etc. to the wellhead before allowing downhole equipment to be introduced in the well.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such wireline operations may also be carried out from floating vessels. Such a floating vessel may be comprised of a drilling vessel, for example a floating drilling rig or a drilling ship, provided with a drilling derrick, drill floor, drawworks, top drive, heave-compensation equipment for the top drive as well as equipment connected thereto, moon pool, etc. In this context, a riser is used to connect the floating vessel to a subsea well. This riser is assembled into a pipe string from several individual pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At its upper end on surface, such a riser will typically be connected to a so-called surface flow tree disposed on, for example, a drilling vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">At its lower end, the riser is typically connected to a wellhead on a sea floor. Via this wellhead, the riser may be connected to, for example, a production tubing extending down to a subterranean reservoir formation, for example an oil production formation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this type of situation, full well pressure will exist up through the riser and possibly onwards to a surface flow tree (if mounted at the upper end of the riser). It is therefore necessary to connect said blowout preventer, lubricator, etc. to the riser, possibly to the surface flow tree, before allowing downhole equipment to be introduced in the riser and carried down into the well.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The background of the invention is related to various problems associated with the prior art with respect to the rigging up and rigging down of wireline operation equipment for carrying out various well intervention operations in a well, including from floating vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These problems relate both to aspects concerning the operation, time, cost and safety of such rigging of wireline operation equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART AND DISADVANTAGES THEREOF</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">During the rigging up for a wireline operation in a well, it has been customary to use various winches and cables, including wires and chains, to lift and steer wireline operation equipment in place above a wellhead or a riser, possibly a flow tree mounted thereon, for connection or insertion therein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During said rigging up, said blowout preventer is first lifted and steered in place on the wellhead or the riser, possibly on the flow tree, and is fixed thereto. Then the lubricator and the downhole equipment is lifted and steered in place on and within, respectively, the blowout preventer, after which the wireline operation may be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Initially, derrick-mounted and air-driven winches may be used together with associated lifting wires and steering wires for lifting and steering, respectively, the equipment in place under the top drive. A chain hoist, which is mounted under the top drive, is then used to lower the equipment on a chain and vertically down towards the wellhead or the riser, possibly the flow tree, and along a centre line thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The rigging down of such wireline operation equipment takes place in the same manner, except in the opposite order.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If the wireline operation is to be carried out from a floating vessel, the wireline operation equipment must be compensated with respect to wave-related, vertical movements (heave) of the vessel. It is therefore customary to connect the riser, possibly an associated flow tree, to a heave-compensated top drive via intermediate tension elements. Typically, such tension elements are comprised of so-called lifting bails. The riser, possibly an associated flow tree as well as downhole equipment inserted therein, will thus be heave-compensated. Given that heave-compensation equipment for the top drive and the system associated with the heave-compensation equipment represents prior art, this will not be described in further detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Due to heave-movements of the vessel, the lubricator may be suspended temporarily in the top drive, for example by means of a sling connection, while the downhole equipment is lifted and inserted into the blowout preventer. At the same time, the downhole equipment is connected to a wireline (cable) for wireline operation, and the wireline extends through the lubricator, then via a disc wheel/sheave mounted underneath the top drive, and further down to a drum with associated driving gear mounted on the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above-mentioned, vertical and horizontal movements of such wireline operation equipment are nevertheless burdened with a number of disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Among other things, such movements require a relatively extensive operation of said lifting- and steering equipment. The movements also require many disconnections and connections of the wireline operation equipment to allow for the transfer thereof, as described above. Many of these disconnections and connections are carried out manually by virtue of drilling personnel being lifted, by means of so-called riding belts, up to the particular connection site in the drilling derrick. However, the latter work tasks are associated with significant danger in terms of safety for the drilling personnel located within the drilling derrick. Moreover, said movements as well as the disconnections and connections are relatively time-consuming, which results in increased rig time and thus increased rig costs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to increase the personal safety and efficiency with respect to the rigging up and down of equipment for well intervention operations, some alternative solutions for achieving this have emerged in the last few years. Therefore, the following patent publications are mentioned in this context:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0021">US 2006/0102356 (corresponding to NO 322006);</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0022">US 2003/0098150;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0023">US 2003/0079883;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0024">US 2007/0119035; and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0025">GB 2.418.684.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">Each of these publications show a frame structure for the rigging up and down of well intervention equipment, especially equipment for carrying out well intervention operations by means of coiled tubing. When in position of use, each such frame structure extends vertically, or close to vertical, above an upper end of a well. This is required for being able to connect or disconnect a blowout preventer or an injector for coiled tubing to or from a well.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">Except for the frame structure shown in US 2003/0079883, all the other frame structures comprise one or more devices structured so as to allow such equipment to be moved vertically and/or horizontally within the frame structure in context of connecting or disconnecting the equipment to or from the well.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">US 2006/0102356, US 2007/0119035 and GB 2.418.684 thus concern frame structures arranged for use on a drilling rig offshore.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">On the other hand, US 2003/0098150 shows a collapsible frame structure for use onshore. One end of this frame structure is pivotally attached to a flatbed platform of a semi-trailer. By so doing, the structure is transportable and simultaneously allows its free end to be lifted up or down relative to the flatbed platform so as to allow easy rigging up or down during coiled tubing based intervention operations in a land-based well.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">US 2003/0079883 also concerns a collapsible and transportable frame structure for use during coiled tubing based intervention operations in a land-based well. One end of the frame structure is pivotally attached to a flatbed platform of a semi-trailer, whereby its free end may be easily rigged up or down in context of such operations. However, the frame structure is telescopic in its longitudinal direction. Lifting and positioning of a blowout preventer or injector for coiled tubing therefore is carried out via telescoping of the frame structure and/or change of the frame structure's angle relative to its base.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">All of the above-mentioned frame structures include an upper cross beam that joins two parallel and longitudinal elements of the structure. None of these cross beams are provided with one or more hoisting devices structured in a manner allowing them to single-handed, i.e. by virtue of its own means, and by means of remote control, carry out a complete transfer of intervention equipment from a storage place thereof and onwards to a connection point to a well, or in the opposite direction. Most of the above-mentioned publications show cross beams provided with lifting devices for partial transfer of such equipment, but not for complete transfer of the equipment. The most important part of the transfer is carried out by means of one or more other moving devices that the frame structure is provided with.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">However, such frame structures are relatively bulky and heavy. This may prove problematic both in connection with a land-based well or a subsea well, but especially when such a frame structure is to be used on a floating vessel. Normally, clearly defined limitations with respect to weight and storage space for miscellaneous equipment will exist on such a vessel. For this reason it is customary to transport bulky and/or heavy equipment to/from the vessel as required. Use of such frame structures on floating vessels therefore cause a number of practical, economic and safety-related disadvantages that advantageously could be done away with.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">The object of the invention is to provide a technical solution that at least reduces one or more of the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, particularly in connection with transfer of intervention equipment for wireline operation in a well.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">A more specific object is to provide a technical solution which, relative to known solutions, is relatively simple, flexible, compact and cheap, and which is space-saving, light and safe in use.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">The object is achieved by virtue of features disclosed in the following description and in the subsequent claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE OBJECTIVE IS ACHIEVED</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">In a first aspect of the present invention, a device for transfer of equipment for a wireline operation in a well connected to a drilling derrick via a top drive is provided. The distinctive characteristic of the device is that it comprises a beam structured for releasable connection to said top drive;
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0037">wherein the beam is structured in a manner allowing it to extend, when in its position of use, transversely relative to a centre line between the top drive and the well;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0038">wherein the beam is provided with at least one hoisting device with a lifting line for vertical movement of said equipment;</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0039">wherein a support point the lifting line is connected to the beam and is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam, whereby said equipment may be moved horizontally relative to said centre line; and</li>
    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0040">wherein said hoisting device and support point are structured for remote-controlled operation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">Relative to the above-mentioned, known frame structures, such a beam is a simple, compact, flexible and cheap structure. Insofar as the beam weighs little and occupies little space relative to said frame structures, the beam may be easily disconnected from the top drive and then be stored as a singular element at an appropriate place in vicinity of the well. This is considerably simpler and cheaper than having to transport away a large and heavy frame structure of said type. Thereby, the beam is always available when needed and may be quickly connected to the top drive.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">Use of such a remote-controlled beam implies a simple and safe rigging up and rigging down of wireline operation equipment in context of well intervention operations. Having to lift drilling personnel up into the drilling derrick for disconnection and connection of such equipment, which further increases the work safety of the drilling personnel during such work tasks, is also avoided to a large extent.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0043">Relative to the above-mentioned, known methods for rigging up and rigging down of well intervention equipment, significant rig time and thus rig costs are also saved by using the present beam.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">The present beam device will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">Said hoisting device may be comprised of an ordinary winch of a hydraulically driven, electrically driven or air-driven type.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">The motive power, possibly also the manoeuvring force, and also control signals for the lifting device may be supplied by means of corresponding devices, connections and systems of types known per se. Such equipment may comprise motive power outlets and connections disposed in the drilling derrick and/or on the drill floor, possibly on the top drive and/or in/on a separate power unit. This equipment, however, will not be described in further detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">Moreover, the beam may be structured for emergency operation of the at least one hoisting device should its ordinary motive power unexpectedly cease. As such, the beam may be provided with, or be structured to allow connection to, one or more mechanical jacking devices, ratchets or similar for manual operation, for example by means of a handle or similar. The beam may also be provided with, or be structured to allow connection to, one or more lifting winches of a hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically operated type, for example air-driven winches or chain hoists.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">Typically, said lifting line is comprised of a wire or a chain.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">In one embodiment, the at least one hoisting device is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Thereby, a part or a portion of the hoisting device also forms said support point for the lifting line.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">Thus, the hoisting device may be connected to a trolley structured so as to be movable along at least one running track in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Typically, such a trolley will comprise at least one wheel or pulley for movement along said running track.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">For example, the trolley of the hoisting device may be provided with at least one toothed gear motor for cog wheel engagement with at least one cog railway disposed in or on the beam and in the longitudinal direction thereof. Such toothed gear motors and cog railways form ordinary components in a number of mechanical constructions. The toothed gear motor may be a hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically driven motor; cf. previous comments with respect to motive power outlets, connections, etc. for such equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">Alternatively, the trolley of the hoisting device may be structured for cooperation with a motorized pitch rack guide disposed in or on the beam and in the longitudinal direction thereof. Such a pitch rack guide comprises a pitch rack with an associated pinion/toothed gear and form ordinary components in a number of mechanical constructions. Rotation of the guide's pitch rack may be carried out by means of a hydraulically, pneumatically or electrically driven motor; cf. previous comments with respect to motive power outlets, connections, etc. for such equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">As a further alternative, the trolley of the hoisting device may be connected to at least one piston disposed in or on the beam and in the longitudinal direction thereof. Such a piston also forms an ordinary component in a number of mechanical constructions. Typically, the piston is comprised of a hydraulically driven piston in a hydraulic cylinder, but the piston may also be driven electrically or pneumatically; cf. previous comments with respect to motive power outlets, connections, etc. for such equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">In another embodiment, the at least one hoisting device may be fixed to the beam, whereas said support point for the lifting line is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Thereby, the hoisting device and the support point form separate elements.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">Thus, the support point may be connected to a trolley structured so as to be movable along at least one running track in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Typically, also this trolley will comprise at least one wheel or pulley for movement along said running track.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">For example, the trolley may be connected to at least one toothed gear motor for cog wheel engagement with at least one cog railway disposed in or on the beam and in the longitudinal direction thereof; cf. previous comments in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">Alternatively, the trolley may be structured for cooperation with a motorized pitch rack guide disposed in or on the beam and in the longitudinal direction thereof; cf. previous comments in this respect. Advantageously, the trolley, the pitch rack and the pitch rack motor may be assembled in a replaceable module, for example a replaceable cassette, which may be connected to/disconnected from the present beam.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">Thereby, the module may easily be replaced upon experiencing wear or failure of components therein, or when such components must be adapted dimension-wise for transfer of other wireline operation equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">As a further alternative, the trolley may be connected to at least one hydraulically driven piston disposed in or on the beam and in the longitudinal direction thereof; cf. previous comments in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">Furthermore, the movable support point may be comprised of a rotatable wheel or pulley to which the lifting line is movably connected. When in its position of use, the lifting line will thus extend out from the hoisting device and along a portion of the circumference of the wheel or the pulley and extend from this portion in a vertical direction downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">In a further embodiment, the beam may be provided with two separate hoisting devices having each a lifting line for vertical movement of said equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">For example, one hoisting device may be disposed for each longitudinal half of the beam for individual transfer of said equipment. As such, the two hoisting device may be structured so as to be movable along a joint path of motion in the longitudinal direction of the beam, and this joint path of motion may comprise at least one joint running track.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">Alternatively, one hoisting device may be disposed for each width half of the beam for individual transfer of said equipment. As such, the two hoisting device may be structured so as to be movable along their own path of motion in the longitudinal direction of the beam, and each path of motion may comprise at least one running track. The two paths of motion will thus be parallel to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">The latter two embodiments, in which two hoisting devices are used, may be suitable and time-consuming when, for example, the first hoisting device is used for temporarily suspending a lubricator, which contains a cable for wireline operation, in a laterally offset position, whereas the second hoisting device is used to place a downhole tool in an associated blowout preventer. Afterwards, the first hoisting device may lower the lubricator and the cable for connection to the blowout preventer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065">Said hoisting device and support point may also be structured for remote-controlled operation via at least one cabled connection. Such a cabled connection may, for example, be comprised of a hydraulic line or an electric cable.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">Alternatively, said hoisting device and support point may also be structured for remote-controlled operation via at least one wireless connection, for example a radio frequency connection.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067">Moreover, the beam may be structured for releasable connection to and between (a) a heave-compensated top drive on a floating vessel, and (b) at least one tension member connected to an upper end of a riser connected to a subsea well. Typically, the at least one tension member is comprised of so-called lifting bails.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">Due to the beam weighing little and occupying little space relative to said frame structures, the beam may easily be disconnected from the top drive and said at least one tension element, for example two parallel lifting bails. Then the beam may be stored as a singular element on board the vessel instead of having to be transported away, which is the case for said frame structures. Thereby, the beam is always available when needed and may be quickly connected between the top drive and the at least one tension element.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">In a second aspect of the present invention, a system for transfer of equipment for a wireline operation in a well connected to a drilling derrick via a top drive is provided. The distinctive characteristic of the system is that it also comprises a singular beam structured for releasable connection to said top drive;
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0070">wherein the beam is structured in a manner allowing it to extend, when in its position of use, transversely relative to a centre line between the top drive and the well;</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0071">wherein the beam is provided with at least one hoisting device with a lifting line for vertical movement of said equipment;</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0072">wherein a support point for the lifting line is connected to the beam and is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam, whereby said equipment may be moved horizontally relative to said centre line; and</li>
    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0073">wherein said hoisting device and support point are structured for remote-controlled operation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0074">In one embodiment, the at least one hoisting device may be structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Thereby, a part or a portion of the hoisting device also forms said support point for the lifting line.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0075">In another embodiment, the at least one hoisting device may be fixed to the beam, whereas said support point for the lifting line is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0076">Further, said hoisting device and support point may be structured for remote-controlled operation via at least one cabled connection, for example a hydraulic line or an electric cable.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0077">Alternatively, said hoisting device and support point may be structured for remote-controlled operation via at least one wireless connection, for example a radio frequency connection.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0078">Moreover, the beam of the system may be structured for releasable connection to and between (a) a heave-compensated top drive on a floating vessel, and (b) at least one tension member, for example lifting bails, connected to an upper end of a riser connected to a subsea well.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0079">The other features and advantages, which are described in context of the device according to the first aspect of the invention, also apply to the system according to this second aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0080">In a third aspect of the invention, a method for transfer of equipment for a wireline operation in a well connected to a drilling derrick via a top drive is provided. The distinctive characteristic of the method is that it comprises the following steps:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0081">providing a singular beam with at least one hoisting device with a lifting line for vertical movement of said equipment;</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0082">structuring a support point for the lifting line so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam, the support point being connected to the beam, whereby said equipment also may be moved horizontally relative to a centre line between the top drive and the well;</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0083">structuring the beam in a manner allowing it to extend transversely relative to said centre line;</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0084">connecting the beam in a releasable manner to the top drive; and</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0085">structuring said hoisting device and support point for remote-controlled operation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0086">In one embodiment, the at least one hoisting device is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Thereby, a part or a portion of the hoisting device also forms said support point for the lifting line.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0087">In another embodiment, the at least one hoisting device may be fixed to the beam, whereas said support point for the lifting line is structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0088">Further, said hoisting device and support point may be structured for remote-controlled operation via at least one cabled connection.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0089">Alternatively, said hoisting device and support point may be structured for remote-controlled operation via at least one wireless connection.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0090">Moreover, the beam may be structured for releasable connection to and between (a) a heave-compensated top drive on a floating vessel, and (b) at least one tension member, for example lifting bails, connected to an upper end of a riser connected to a subsea well.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0091">The other features and advantages, which are described in context of the first and second aspect of the invention, also apply to the method according to this third aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0092">A fourth aspect of the invention concerns the use of a beam, which includes at least one vertically extending and horizontally extending lifting line with an associated hoisting device, for releasable connection to a top drive connected to a drilling derrick.

<p id="p-0086" num="0103">In order to facilitate the understanding of the invention, some of the figures are depicted in a simplified manner and show only the most essential elements of the present beam and associated equipment. The shape, relative dimensions and mutual positions of the elements may be somewhat distorted. Hereinafter, identical, equivalent or corresponding details in the figures will be given substantially the same reference numerals.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> show an assembly of miscellaneous equipment disposed within a drilling derrick (not shown) and above a drill floor <b>2</b> on a floating vessel (not shown). In this context, this equipment is used for wireline operation in a subsea well (not shown) connected to the vessel via a riser <b>4</b> extending partway above the drill floor <b>2</b>. The riser <b>4</b> extends from the vessel and down to a wellhead (not shown) placed on a sea floor.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0105">Said equipment comprises, among other things, a top drive <b>6</b> which is fixed to a heave-compensated support frame <b>8</b>, and which may be raised or lowered by means of a heave-compensated drawworks comprising, among other things, a travelling block <b>10</b> and associated wires <b>12</b>. Heave-compensation of this type constitutes prior art and will not be described in further detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0106">The figures also show a first embodiment of a beam <b>14</b>A according to the invention disposed in a releasable manner, and in its position of use, between the top drive <b>6</b> and the drill floor <b>2</b>. At its upper side, the beam <b>14</b>A is provided with two first lifting lugs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, each of which is releasably connected to a lifting bail <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. These lifting bails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> extend in a parallel manner up to the top drive <b>6</b> and are releasably connected to lifting lugs thereon. Midway on each of its longitudinal sides, the beam <b>14</b>A is also provided with a second lifting lug <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, which is releasably connected to a respective lifting bail <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. These bails <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> extend in a parallel manner down towards the drill floor <b>2</b> and are releasably connected to a connection sleeve <b>32</b> attached around an upper end <b>33</b> of the riser <b>4</b>. In this manner, the beam <b>14</b>A is structured for releasable connection to and between the top drive <b>6</b> and the lifting bails <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. By so doing, the beam <b>14</b>A is also structured in a manner allowing it to extend transversely relative to a centre line for the upper end <b>33</b> of the riser <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0107">The weight of the riser <b>4</b> and the associated equipment is transferred to the heave-compensated top drive <b>6</b> and drawworks via said connection sleeve <b>32</b>, whereby the riser <b>4</b> is held in constant tension.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> also show the beam <b>14</b>A provided with two separate, remote-controlled, hydraulic winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> having each a respective lifting wire <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> with a lifting hook <b>38</b>&#x2032;, <b>40</b>&#x2032; for vertical movement of miscellaneous equipment for wireline operation in the subsea well. In this embodiment, each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is also structured so as to be movable along a respective longitudinal half of the beam <b>14</b>A for individual, remote-controlled transfer along a joint path of motion <b>42</b> in the longitudinal direction of the beam. By so doing, each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be moved horizontally relative to said centre line when the beam <b>14</b>A is in its position of use. In order to be able to carry out such an individual transfer, each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is connected to a manoeuvring device in the form of a hydraulically driven piston in a hydraulic cylinder (not shown) incorporated into the beam <b>14</b>A. Hydraulic motive power and control signals for the winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and their pistons is supplied from corresponding devices, connections and systems of types known per se, and which will not be described in further detail herein. The figures only show the respective hydraulic couplings emerging from the winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. Moreover, each movable winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> forms a support point for the respective lifting wire <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0109">Further, the figures show a disc wheel <b>48</b> connected to the lower side of the beam <b>14</b> via a wire <b>50</b>. A wireline <b>52</b> for insertion of equipment in the well is carried over the disc wheel <b>48</b> and onwards down to a drum with associated driving gear (not shown) on the drilling rig.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> also depict a certain transfer sequence of miscellaneous equipment for wireline operation. As such, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a blowout preventer <b>54</b> for wireline operations placed on the drill floor <b>2</b> and beside the upper end of the riser <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> show various perspectives of the blowout preventer <b>54</b> after having been lifted, steered in place and rigidly mounted on top of the upper end of the riser <b>4</b> by means of the beam <b>14</b>A and one of its winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b> also show the winch <b>34</b> moved to one end of the beam <b>14</b>A whilst the lifting wire <b>38</b> thereof, via suitable connection equipment, is being releasably connected to a lengthy lubricator <b>56</b> lying on the drill floor <b>2</b> with said wireline <b>52</b> inserted through it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, however, shows the lubricator <b>56</b> with the wireline <b>52</b> upon having lifted, by means of the movable winch <b>34</b> and the lifting wire <b>38</b>, this equipment up underneath the beam <b>14</b>A and steered it in towards the centre line of the riser <b>4</b>. The next step (not shown) is to lower the equipment down onto the blowout preventer <b>54</b> for rigid mounting thereto. Via suitable connection equipment, the other, movable winch <b>36</b> with its lifting wire <b>40</b> may, for example, be used to lift and move a three-part downhole tool <b>57</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) into the blowout preventer <b>54</b> whilst the lubricator <b>56</b> is temporarily suspended in the lifting wire <b>38</b> of the other winch <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>, a second embodiment of a beam <b>14</b>B according to the invention will now be shown.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0112">Also in this second embodiment, the beam <b>14</b>B is provided with two separate, remote-controlled, hydraulic winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, each having a respective lifting wire <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> and a respective lifting hook <b>38</b>&#x2032;, <b>40</b>&#x2032;. Each lifting wire <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> emerges from its winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> via a support point which, in this embodiment, assumes the form of a respective wire pulley <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, which forms a part or a portion of each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. Such a wire pulley <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>, however, is not a prerequisite. In other embodiments, the lifting wire <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> may emerge directly from the wire drum of the winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, whereby the wire drum forms said support point for the lifting wire <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0113">Each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is structured so as to be movable along a respective longitudinal half of the beam <b>14</b>B for individual, remote-controlled transfer along a joint path of motion in the longitudinal direction of the beam. Each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may thus be moved horizontally when the beam <b>14</b>B is in its position of use. For such individual transfer, each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is connected to a respective trolley <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> comprising parallel sets of wheels <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> for movement along parallel running tracks <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. These running tracks <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> form said joint path of motion for the winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. For remote-controlled propulsion along this path of motion, each winch <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> is provided with a toothed gear motor (not shown) for cog wheel engagement with a corresponding cog railway (not shown) disposed underneath the beam <b>14</b>B in the longitudinal direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0114">The beam <b>14</b>B, including the winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> etc., are incorporated in a protective beam housing <b>74</b>. At the upper side thereof, the beam housing <b>74</b> is provided with a cross-shaped connector <b>76</b> with a centred, female thread portion <b>78</b> for releasable connection to a mail thread portion at the end of a connecting pipe (not shown). This connecting pipe may be connected to a pipe coupling <b>79</b> at the lower side of said top drive <b>6</b>. Such a connecting pipe and connector <b>76</b> replace the connecting bails <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> and the two first lifting lugs <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, respectively, shown in the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0115">Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the two winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> disposed each at a respective end of the beam <b>14</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, however, shows the winch <b>34</b> after having been moved along the beam <b>14</b>B to a position in which the lifting wire <b>38</b> is located approximately midway on the beam <b>14</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> also show fasteners in the form of eye bolts <b>81</b> releasably attached within corresponding holes on the lower side of the beam <b>14</b>B. Such eye bolts <b>81</b> may, for example, be used to connect a wireline disc wheel <b>48</b> to the lower side of the beam <b>14</b>B via a wire <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. If potentially needed, the eye bolts <b>81</b> may also be used for suspension of, for example, an air-driven winch or a chain hoist.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-15</figref>, a third embodiment of a beam <b>14</b>C according to the invention will now be shown. The figures are of principal nature and show only the most essential elements of the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0117">In this third embodiment, the beam <b>14</b>C is provided with one remote-controlled, hydraulic winch <b>34</b> fixed at one end of the beam <b>14</b>C. A lifting wire <b>38</b> emerges from the winch <b>34</b> and is first carried around half the circumference of a non-movable disc wheel <b>80</b> which, via a mounting bracket <b>82</b>, is fixed at the opposite side of the beam <b>14</b>C. The lifting wire <b>38</b> then extends in the direction of the winch <b>34</b> and around half the circumference of a movable hook-height adjustment disc wheel <b>84</b> and further around a quarter of the circumference of a movable support disc wheel <b>86</b> disposed closer to the non-movable disc wheel <b>80</b>. By so doing, the lifting wire <b>38</b> will extend vertically from the support disc wheel <b>86</b> when the beam <b>14</b> is in its position of use. Thus, the support disc wheel <b>86</b> forms a movable support point for the lifting wire <b>38</b>. Furthermore, the path of the lifting wire <b>38</b> from the non-movable disc wheel <b>80</b> and onwards to the movable support disc wheel <b>86</b> is indicated with a dotted line in FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>-<b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0118">Both the hook-height adjustment disc wheel <b>84</b> and the support disc wheel <b>86</b> are structured so as to be movable in the longitudinal direction of the beam <b>14</b>C and along a joint path of motion comprising two parallel U-rails <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> having openings facing each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0119">Further, the hook-height adjustment disc wheel <b>84</b> and the support disc wheel <b>86</b> are connected to a respective trolley <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> comprising parallel sets of wheels <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> for movement within and along respective U-rails <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0120">The trolleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are structured for cooperation with a motorized pitch rack guide connected to the beam <b>14</b>C. Each trolley <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> is fixedly connected to a corresponding nut device <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, for example a ball nut, disposed around a corresponding thread portion <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of a pitch rack <b>108</b>. This pitch rack <b>108</b> is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the beam <b>14</b>C and is rotatably connected to two support bearings <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> attached to the beam <b>14</b>C. For rotation the pitch rack <b>108</b> is connected to a remote-controlled, hydraulic motor <b>114</b> disposed at the one end of the beam <b>14</b>C. Such a motorized pitch rack guide <b>102</b>, <b>108</b> may also be used for propulsion of the winches <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> used in context of the beams <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B according to the first and second embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0121">The thread portions <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are threaded in the same direction, whereby the trolleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> will move in the same direction upon rotation of the pitch rack <b>108</b>. The thread portion <b>104</b>, however, is finely threaded, whereas the thread portion <b>106</b> is coarsely threaded having twice the thread pitch relative to that of the finely threaded portion <b>104</b>. When the pitch rack <b>108</b> is rotated, this construction brings about the advantageous result that the trolley <b>92</b> (and thus the hook-height adjustment disc wheel <b>84</b>) will move at half the speed along the pitch rack <b>108</b> as compared to the speed of the trolley <b>94</b> (and thus the support disc wheel <b>86</b> and its vertically extending lifting wire <b>38</b>) along the pitch rack <b>108</b>. This causes the lifting hook <b>38</b>&#x2032; to be held at a constant distance from the beam <b>14</b>C when the trolleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are being moved horizontally, and without simultaneously carrying out any feeding of lifting wire <b>38</b> from or to the winch <b>34</b>. Such movement of the trolleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> at a constant hook-height is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0122">In this context, it is obviously possible to omit the hook-height adjustment disc wheel <b>84</b> and associated components and to use a pitch rack having only one uniformly threaded thread portion. This, however, will bring about the effect that the lifting hook <b>38</b>&#x2032; will change its distance from the beam <b>14</b>C when the trolleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are being moved horizontally without simultaneously carrying out feeding of lifting wire <b>38</b> from or to the winch <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0123">Furthermore, the U-rails <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, the trolleys <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, the hook-height adjustment disc wheel <b>84</b>, the support disc wheel <b>86</b>, the pitch rack <b>108</b>, the nut devices <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, the support bearings <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and the hydraulic motor <b>114</b> may advantageously be assembled in a joint module, for example a replaceable cassette, for simple and quick replacement, if required.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>, a fourth embodiment of a beam <b>14</b>D according to the invention will now be shown.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0125">In this fourth embodiment, two beams <b>14</b>C and <b>14</b>C&#x2032; according to the preceding, third embodiment are assembled in parallel, but oppositely directed, within a joint beam <b>14</b>D. Each of the two beams <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>C&#x2032; contains the same components and have the same mode of operation as described in context of the third embodiment according to the invention. As such, each beam <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>C&#x2032; will include, among other things, a respective, remote-controlled, hydraulic winch <b>34</b><i>a, </i><b>34</b><i>b </i>with an associated lifting wire <b>38</b><i>a, </i><b>38</b><i>b </i>and lifting hook <b>38</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>38</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;, a movable hook-height adjustment disc wheel, a support disc wheel as well as associated components (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>). The winches <b>34</b><i>a, </i><b>34</b><i>b </i>are disposed diagonally opposite each other at their own end of the combined beam <b>14</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0126">The beams <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>C&#x2032; with associated components are incorporated in a protective beam housing <b>116</b>; this in resemblance to the beam <b>14</b>B according to the above-mentioned, second embodiment of the invention. Correspondingly, the upper side of the beam housing <b>116</b> is provided with a cross-shaped connector <b>76</b> with a centred, female thread portion <b>78</b> for releasable connection to a connecting pipe (not shown), which may be connected to the lower side of said top drive <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0127">Also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> show eye bolts <b>81</b> releasably attached to the lower side of the beam <b>14</b>D for possible suspension of, for example, a wireline disc wheel <b>48</b>, an air-driven winch or a chain hoist, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
