<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to data storage systems, and more particularly, this invention relates to protective coating systems for magnetic head components.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In magnetic storage systems, data is read from and written onto magnetic recording media utilizing magnetic transducers commonly. Data is written on the magnetic recording media by moving a magnetic recording transducer to a position over the media where the data is to be stored. The magnetic recording transducer then generates a magnetic field, which encodes the data into the magnetic media. Data is read from the media by similarly positioning the magnetic read transducer and then sensing the magnetic field of the magnetic media. Read and write operations may be independently synchronized with the movement of the media to ensure that the data can be read from and written to the desired location on the media.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An important and continuing goal in the data storage industry is that of increasing the density of data stored on a medium. For tape storage systems, that goal has led to increasing the track density on recording tape, and decreasing the thickness of the magnetic tape medium. However, the development of small footprint, higher performance tape drive systems has created various problems in the design of a tape head assembly for use in such systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a tape drive system, magnetic tape is moved over the surface of the tape head at high speed. This movement generally entrains a film of air between the head and tape. Usually the tape head is designed to minimize the spacing between the head and the tape. The spacing between the magnetic head and the magnetic tape is crucial so that the recording gaps of the transducers, which are the source of the magnetic recording flux, are in near contact with the tape to effect efficient signal transfer, and so that the read element is in near contact with the tape to provide effective coupling of the magnetic field from the tape to the read element.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In hard disk and tape magnetic heads, a protective coating is often employed to protect the read and/or write sensors from corrosion, shorting, and excessive wear. The coating may be composed of any hard substance, but generally diamond-like carbon (DLC), silicon nitride, alumina, and other hard materials are used. The thickness of the coating is usually on the order of a few nanometers to tens of nanometers. Currently, there is no quick and easy method of determining the actual thickness of the coating. During the fabrication of the head, the thickness of the coating on the air bearing surface (ABS) is one factor to be considered in the placement of other components of the hard disk or tape system. Also, during drive or tape operation, it would be beneficial to known the thickness of the coating remaining on the head and therefore, evaluate the life of the coating.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current methods such as Focused Ion Beam/Transmission Electron Microscopy (FIB/TEM) analysis suffer significant drawbacks of being tedious, time consuming, and destructive. Elipsometry is another method to determine thickness of head coatings, but it requires modeling and can sometimes be inaccurate. Accordingly, a better thickness determination method and wear gauge is desirable that overcomes the drawbacks of current methods of determining coating thicknesses on magnetic heads.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a system comprises a magnetic head, a protective coating on a media-facing side of the head, and an indentation in the protective coating having a dimension that, when the protective coating wears, is indicative of an amount of wear of the protective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method, in another embodiment, comprises creating an indentation in a protective coating of a magnetic head, the indentation having a dimension that, when the protective coating wears, is indicative of an amount of wear of the protective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a method comprises visually inspecting indentations in a protective coating of a magnetic head, wherein at least two of the indentations have differing dimensions that, when the protective coating wears, are indicative of the amount of wear of the protective coating. The method also includes estimating an amount of wear of the protective coating based on the visual inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Any of these embodiments may be implemented in a magnetic data storage system (e.g., tape drive system, hard disk drive system, etc.) which may include a magnetic head, a drive mechanism for passing a magnetic medium (e.g., recording tape, hard disk, etc) over the magnetic head, and a controller electrically coupled to the magnetic head.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other aspects and embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, which, when taken in conjunction with the drawings, illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the present invention and is not meant to limit the inventive concepts claimed herein. Further, particular features described herein can be used in combination with other described features in each of the various possible combinations and permutations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Unless otherwise specifically defined herein, all terms are to be given their broadest possible interpretation including meanings implied from the specification as well as meanings understood by those skilled in the art and/or as defined in dictionaries, treatises, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It must also be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following description discloses several preferred embodiments of tape-based storage systems, as well as operation and/or component parts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one general embodiment, a system comprises a magnetic head; a protective coating on a media-facing side of the head; an indentation in the protective coating having a dimension that, when the protective coating wears, is indicative of an amount of wear of the protective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another general embodiment, a method comprises creating an indentation in a protective coating of a magnetic head, the indentation having a dimension that, when the protective coating wears, is indicative of an amount of wear of the protective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another general embodiment, a method comprises visually inspecting indentations in a protective coating of a magnetic head, wherein at least two of the indentations have differing dimensions that, when the protective coating wears, are indicative of the amount of wear of the protective coating; and estimating an amount of wear of the protective coating based on the visual inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a simplified tape drive <b>100</b> of a tape-based data storage system, which may be employed in the context of the present invention. While one specific implementation of a tape drive is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be noted that the embodiments described herein may be implemented in the context of any type of tape drive system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown, a tape supply cartridge <b>120</b> and a take-up reel <b>121</b> are provided to support a tape <b>122</b>. One or more of the reels may form part of a removable cassette and are not necessarily part of the system <b>100</b>. The tape drive, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may further include drive motor(s) to drive the tape supply cartridge <b>120</b> and the take-up reel <b>121</b> to move the tape <b>122</b> over a tape head <b>126</b> of any type.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Guides <b>125</b> guide the tape <b>122</b> across the tape head <b>126</b>. Such tape head <b>126</b> is in turn coupled to a controller assembly <b>128</b> via a cable <b>130</b>. The controller <b>128</b> typically controls head functions such as servo following, writing, reading, etc. The cable <b>130</b> may include read/write circuits to transmit data to the head <b>126</b> to be recorded on the tape <b>122</b> and to receive data read by the head <b>126</b> from the tape <b>122</b>. An actuator <b>132</b> controls position of the head <b>126</b> relative to the tape <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An interface <b>134</b> may also be provided for communication between the tape drive and a host (integral or external) to send and receive the data and for controlling the operation of the tape drive and communicating the status of the tape drive to the host, all as will be understood by those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a side view of a flat-lapped, bi-directional, two-module magnetic tape head <b>200</b> which may be implemented in the context of the present invention. As shown, the head includes a pair of bases <b>202</b>, each equipped with a module <b>204</b>, and fixed at a small angle &#x3b1; with respect to each other. The bases are typically &#x201c;U-beams&#x201d; that are adhesively coupled together. Each module <b>204</b> includes a substrate <b>204</b>A and a closure <b>204</b>B with a gap comprising elements <b>206</b> such as readers and/or writers situated therebetween. In use, a tape <b>208</b> is moved over the modules <b>204</b> along a media (tape) bearing surface <b>209</b> in the manner shown for reading and writing data on the tape <b>208</b> using the readers and writers. The wrap angle &#x3b8; of the tape <b>208</b> at edges going onto and exiting the flat media support surfaces <b>209</b> are usually between &#x215b; degree and 4&#xbd; degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The substrates <b>204</b>A are typically constructed of a wear resistant material, such as a ceramic. The closures <b>204</b>B made of the same or similar ceramic as the substrates <b>204</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The readers and writers may be arranged in a piggyback configuration. The readers and writers may also be arranged in an interleaved configuration. Alternatively, each array of channels may be readers or writers only. Any of these arrays may contain one or more servo readers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the tape bearing surface <b>209</b> of one of the modules <b>204</b> taken from Line <b>2</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A representative tape <b>208</b> is shown in dashed lines. The module <b>204</b> is preferably long enough to be able to support the tape as the head steps between data bands.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this example, the tape <b>208</b> includes 4-22 data bands, e.g., with 16 data bands and 17 servo tracks <b>210</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> on a one-half inch wide tape <b>208</b>. The data bands are defined between servo tracks <b>210</b>. Each data band may include a number of data tracks, for example 96 data tracks (not shown). During read/write operations, the elements <b>206</b> are positioned within one of the data bands. Outer readers, sometimes called servo readers, read the servo tracks <b>210</b>. The servo signals are in turn used to keep the elements <b>206</b> aligned with a particular track during the read/write operations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> depicts a plurality of read and/or write elements <b>206</b> formed in a gap <b>218</b> on the module <b>204</b> in Circle <b>2</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As shown, the array of elements <b>206</b> includes, for example, 16 writers <b>214</b>, 16 readers <b>216</b> and two servo readers <b>212</b>, though the number of elements may vary. Illustrative embodiments include 8, 16, 32, and 64 elements <b>206</b> per array. A preferred embodiment includes 32 readers per array and/or <b>32</b> writers per array. This allows the tape to travel more slowly, thereby reducing speed-induced tracking and mechanical difficulties. While the readers and writers may be arranged in a piggyback configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the readers <b>216</b> and writers <b>214</b> may also be arranged in an interleaved configuration. Alternatively, each array of elements <b>266</b> may be readers or writers only, and the arrays may contain one or more servo readers <b>212</b>. As noted by considering FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>2</b>A-B together, each module <b>204</b> may include a complementary set of elements <b>206</b> for such things as bi-directional reading and writing, read-while-write capability, backward compatibility, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows a partial tape bearing surface view of complimentary modules of a magnetic tape head <b>200</b> according to one embodiment. In this embodiment, each module has a plurality of read/write (R/W) pairs in a piggyback configuration formed on a common substrate <b>204</b>A and an optional electrically insulative layer <b>236</b>. The writers, exemplified by the write head <b>214</b> and the readers, exemplified by the read head <b>216</b>, are aligned parallel to a direction of travel of a tape medium thereacross to form an R/W pair, exemplified by the R/W pair <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Several R/W pairs <b>222</b> may be present, such as 8, 16, 32 pairs, etc. The R/W pairs <b>222</b> as shown are linearly aligned in a direction generally perpendicular to a direction of tape travel thereacross. However, the pairs may also be aligned diagonally, etc. Servo readers <b>212</b> are positioned on the outside of the array of R/W pairs, the function of which is well known.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, the magnetic tape medium moves in either a forward or reverse direction as indicated by arrow <b>220</b>. The magnetic tape medium and head assembly <b>200</b> operate in a transducing relationship in the manner well-known in the art. The piggybacked MR head assembly <b>200</b> includes two thin-film modules <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> of generally identical construction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Modules <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> are joined together with a space present between closures <b>204</b>B thereof (partially shown) to form a single physical unit to provide read-while-write capability by activating the writer of the leading module and reader of the trailing module aligned with the writer of the leading module parallel to the direction of tape travel relative thereto. When a module <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> of a piggyback head <b>200</b> is constructed, layers are formed in the gap <b>218</b> created above an electrically conductive substrate <b>204</b>A (partially shown), e.g., of AlTiC, in generally the following order for the R/W pairs <b>222</b>: an insulating layer <b>236</b>, a first shield <b>232</b> typically of an iron alloy such as NiFe (permalloy), CZT or Al&#x2014;Fe&#x2014;Si (Sendust), a sensor <b>234</b> for sensing a data track on a magnetic medium, a second shield <b>238</b> typically of a nickel-iron alloy (e.g., 80/20 Permalloy), first and second writer pole tips <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, and a coil (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first and second writer poles <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> may be fabricated from high magnetic moment materials such as 45/55 NiFe. Note that these materials are provided by way of example only, and other materials may be used. Additional layers such as insulation between the shields and/or pole tips and an insulation layer surrounding the sensor may be present. Illustrative materials for the insulation include alumina and other oxides, insulative polymers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the invention provides a fast, easy, and accurate method and/or system of determining the thickness and wear rate of a coating material. An array of indentations may be created on the surface of the coating. These indentations may be of increasing depth and/or size created by a very fine instrument point, such as a diamond tip, which may be pushed into the coating with increasing force to form the indentations. The indentations may be equally spaced apart and easily identifiable by interferometry and/or profiling. Multiple rows of indentations can be created either of varying size indentations or duplicates of previous rows so that there is less chance of the measurement being affected by an indentation getting filled in with debris.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Indentations can also be made across multiple shields, poles, and other layers to evaluate whether the coating is depleted more quickly on one layer than another. Additionally, the indentations across multiple layers may give an indication of the material properties of that layer. As a wear gauge, the method may be used to evaluate the coating after a certain amount of runtime of the drive. Wear rates can be estimated based on the physical size of the indentations, remaining depth of the grooves, and even the number of indentations left.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, if an array of 5 indentations of increasing depth from 10 nm to 50 nm was created on a coating of 50 nm thickness, it is possible to tell the approximate remaining thickness of the coating just by counting the number of indentations left. After a certain amount of time, if 20 nm of the coating has been worn away, the indentations made at 10 and 20 nm depth will have been worn away also. At a later point in time, if no indentations are left, one can conclude that all the coating in that area has been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, in one embodiment, a system <b>300</b> for determining the thickness of coatings on a magnetic head includes a magnetic head <b>302</b> which may have a protective coating <b>304</b> on a media-facing side of the head <b>302</b>, such as the ABS side of the head (the ABS side is designated by arrows <b>306</b>) above a media-facing side of the at least one of a reader <b>307</b> and a writer of the magnetic head <b>302</b>. Also, the system <b>300</b> may include an indentation <b>308</b> of any shape in the protective coating <b>304</b> having a dimension a that, when the protective coating <b>304</b> wears, is indicative of an amount of wear of the protective coating <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the system <b>300</b> may include several indentations <b>308</b> of any shape (e.g., triangular, square, rectangular, elliptical, etc.) that may be present in the protective coating <b>304</b>, wherein at least two of the indentations <b>308</b> have differing dimensions &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>that, when the protective coating <b>304</b> wears, are indicative of the amount of wear of the protective coating <b>304</b>. For example, shallower indentations will disappear faster than deeper indentations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some approaches, the indentations may include channels or depressions having different depths or channels which start out at one depth on one end and increase in depth towards the other end. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the indentations may include channels running in a direction greater than 0&#xb0;, preferably greater than about 2&#xb0;, more preferably greater than about 5&#xb0; from a direction of media travel thereover. The direction of media travel is indicated by arrow <b>310</b>. In some further approaches, the channels may run in a direction less than about 90&#xb0; from the direction of media travel thereover, as indicated by arrow <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, system <b>300</b> may further comprise an indentation <b>308</b> on a second portion of the head <b>302</b> having a different composition than the protective coating <b>304</b>, such as a substrate, a closure, a second area of protective coating, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some more embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, a fill material <b>312</b> may be present in one or more indentations <b>308</b>. This fill material <b>312</b> may have special characteristics or properties, such that it may be detected with a sensing device, visually different from the protective coating <b>304</b>, able to reflect certain wavelengths of light differently from the protective coating <b>304</b>, etc. For example, a fill material may be of a type that can emit small amounts of detectable radioactive energy, such as cesium, uranium, etc., such that as the fill material is worn away, less and less detectable radioactive energy is emitted from the fill material left in the indentation. In this manner, the height of the remaining indentation can be determined without examining the indentation itself. Any other type of fill material may also be used, and this example is not limiting in any manner.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, in some approaches, one or more of the indentations <b>308</b> may include a channel <b>318</b> having a varying depth along a length thereof. For example, the indentation <b>308</b> may be V-shaped in profile, and the lower point of the V may descend deeper into the protective coating <b>304</b> as the profile is examined along the length of the channel <b>318</b>. In some of these approaches, the channel <b>318</b> may rise to the surface of the protective coating <b>304</b> and descend to the surface of the magnetic head <b>302</b>, but any depth including and between these values is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">System <b>300</b>, according to some embodiments, may further comprise a drive mechanism <b>314</b> for passing a magnetic recording tape <b>316</b> over the head <b>302</b>. In addition, the system <b>300</b> may include a controller in communication with the head <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a method <b>400</b> according to one embodiment may be described. Of course, the method may be used in any desired environment, and is not limited in any way by being described in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. The method <b>400</b> comprises creating an indentation of any shape in a protective coating of a magnetic head, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, e.g., covering at least one of a reader and a writer of the magnetic head, the indentation having a dimension that, when the protective coating wears, is indicative of an amount of wear of the protective coating. Note operation <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the method may further comprise filling the indentation with a fill material. The fill material may have properties and/or characteristics which make it more easily detectable against the background of the protective coating.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some approaches, several indentations of any shape may be created in the protective coating, wherein at least two of the indentations may have differing dimensions that, when the protective coating wears, are indicative of the amount of wear of the protective coating. In further approaches, the indentations may include channels or depressions having different depths. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the indentations may include channels running in a direction greater than 0&#xb0;, preferably greater than about 2&#xb0;, more preferably greater than about 5&#xb0; from a direction of media travel thereover, as indicated by arrow <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some more embodiments, the method may further comprise creating an indentation on a second portion of the head having a different composition than the protective coating. In this manner, the thickness and wear rate of two different materials or compositions may be detected, so that comparisons may be made between the two materials, wear rates may be detected across different surfaces of the magnetic head, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some more embodiments, one or more of the indentations may include a channel having a varying depth along a length thereof, such that the level of wear may be detected from a single indentation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In even more embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a method <b>500</b> for determining wear on a magnetic head may comprise, in operation <b>502</b>, visually inspecting indentations in a protective coating of a magnetic head, e.g., covering at least one of a reader and a writer of the magnetic head, wherein at least two of the indentations have differing dimensions that, when the protective coating wears, are indicative of the amount of wear of the protective coating. Also, the method may include, in operation <b>504</b>, estimating an amount of wear of the protective coating based on the visual inspection. In addition, in some embodiments, the method may further comprise generating an electronic report indicative of the estimated amount of wear of the protective coating. For example, after the indentations have been visually inspected, possibly by an optical device coupled with a computing device, a graph, plot, spreadsheet, etc., may be produced which includes depths, times, dates, materials, different head designations, etc., so that wear rates and material wear resistance may be determined and/or compared.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It will be clear that the various features of the foregoing methodologies may be combined in any way, creating a plurality of combinations from the descriptions presented above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of an embodiment of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
