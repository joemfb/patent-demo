<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Data storage devices, such as hard disk drives, are usually fixed in a frame of an electronic device, such as a server. Sandwiched between the hard disks is a plurality of partitioning plates. However, when one of the partitioning plates is unqualified or broken, the partitioning plate cannot be easily removed from the frame, thereby causing the frame to be discarded, which is wasteful and adds to cost.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, in assembly, the partitioning members <b>60</b> are perpendicularly attached between the supporting member <b>22</b> and the connecting plate <b>42</b>. The hooks <b>622</b> are engaged in the corresponding first and second latching holes <b>228</b> and <b>428</b>. The locating tabs <b>624</b> are engaged in the corresponding first and second locating holes <b>226</b> and <b>426</b>. The partitioning members <b>60</b> are moved forward. The hooks <b>622</b> slide in the corresponding first latching holes <b>228</b> and the corresponding second latching holes <b>428</b>, and the locating tabs <b>624</b> slide in the corresponding first locating holes <b>226</b> and the corresponding second locating holes <b>426</b>, until the latching blocks <b>6224</b> latch to the front walls bounding the first and second latching holes <b>228</b> and <b>428</b>. The extending pieces <b>6226</b> are sandwiched between the engaging blocks <b>2282</b> of the first latching holes <b>228</b> or second latching holes <b>428</b>. The locating tabs <b>624</b> slide along inner surfaces of the corresponding protrusions <b>2263</b> or <b>4263</b> face the corresponding engaging blocks <b>2262</b> or <b>4262</b>, and the engaging portions <b>646</b> slidably abut against the inner surfaces of the protrusion <b>2263</b> or <b>4263</b>, thereby deforming the connecting portions <b>644</b> toward the partitioning plate <b>62</b>. After the engaging portions <b>646</b> pass through the protrusions <b>2263</b> or <b>4263</b>, the connecting portions <b>644</b> are restored to make the engaging portions <b>646</b> be blocked by the latching surfaces <b>2264</b> or <b>4264</b>. The latching tabs <b>624</b> are sandwiched between the engaging blocks <b>2262</b> or <b>4262</b> and the protrusions <b>2263</b> or <b>4263</b>. Therefore, the partitioning members <b>60</b> are detachably connected between the supporting member <b>22</b> and the connecting plate <b>42</b>. A data storage device <b>80</b> can be accommodated between every two adjacent partitioning members <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The end plates <b>446</b> are abutted against inner surfaces of the corresponding end plates <b>246</b>. Screws extend through the connecting holes <b>248</b>, to be screwed into the corresponding connecting holes <b>448</b>. The first and second pads <b>26</b> and <b>46</b> can absorb vibrations, to protect the data storage device <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When disassembling each partitioning member <b>60</b>, the connecting portion <b>644</b> of each engaging piece <b>64</b> is deformed toward the corresponding partitioning plate <b>62</b>, to disengage the engaging portions <b>646</b> from the latching surfaces <b>2264</b> and <b>4264</b>. The partitioning member <b>60</b> is moved away from the flanges <b>224</b> and <b>424</b>, to allow the hooks <b>622</b> to disengage from the supporting plate <b>222</b> and the connecting plate <b>42</b>. Therefore, the partitioning member <b>60</b> may be easily separated from the base <b>20</b> and the cover <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is believed that the present embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and they will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the description or sacrificing all of their material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being exemplary embodiment.</p>
