<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">After hydrocarbons have been removed from the ground, the fluid stream (e.g., crude oil, natural gas) is transported from place-to-place via pipelines. It is desirable to know with accuracy the amount of fluid flowing in the stream, and particular accuracy is demanded when the fluid is changing hands, or &#x201c;custody transfer.&#x201d; Even where custody transfer is not taking place, however, measurement accuracy is desirable, and in these situations flow meters may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ultrasonic flow meters are one type of flow meter that may be used to measure the amount of fluid flowing in a pipeline. In an ultrasonic flow meter, ultrasonic signals are sent back and forth across the fluid stream to be measured, and based on various characteristics of the ultrasonic signals, a fluid flow may be calculated. The accuracy of an ultrasonic flow meter is subject various conditions that affect the calibration and/or operation of the meter. For example, accumulation of contaminants in the pipeline, flow restrictions, and/or differences in calibration versus operation environment may affect flow meter accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, effective techniques for monitoring conditions related to flow meter accuracy are desirable.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">NOTATION AND NOMENCLATURE</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain terms are used throughout the following description and claims to refer to particular system components. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, companies may refer to a component by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function. In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms &#x201c;including&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; are used in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to mean &#x201c;including, but not limited to . . . . &#x201d; In addition, the term &#x201c;couple&#x201d; or &#x201c;couples&#x201d; is intended to mean either an indirect or a direct electrical connection. Thus, if a first device couples to a second device, that connection may be through a direct electrical connection, or through an indirect electrical connection via other devices and connections. Further, the term &#x201c;software&#x201d; includes any executable code capable of running on a processor, regardless of the media used to store the software. Thus, code stored in memory (e.g., non-volatile memory), and sometimes referred to as &#x201c;embedded firmware,&#x201d; is included within the definition of software.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the invention. Although one or more of these embodiments may be preferred, the embodiments disclosed should not be interpreted, or otherwise used, as limiting the scope of the disclosure, including the claims. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following description has broad application, and the discussion of any embodiment is meant only to be exemplary of that embodiment, and not intended to intimate that the scope of the disclosure, including the claims, is limited to that embodiment. Further, the various embodiments were developed in the context of measuring hydrocarbon flows (e.g., crude oil, natural gas), and the description follows from the developmental context; however, the systems and methods described are equally applicable to measurement of any fluid flow (e.g., cryogenic substances, water).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A flow meter is used to measure the quantity of fluid flowing through a pipeline. The flow meter may be calibrated in a laboratory and thereafter considered to measure flow accurately under lab conditions. When the meter is installed for use in the pipeline, it is desirable to know whether the calibration has shifted. Shifts in calibration may be due to, for example, installation effects or gradual changes in the flow environment such as accumulation of dirt or other contaminants in the pipeline. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to identify a shift in calibration based on historical meter data. Embodiments of the present disclosure allow a user to quickly and effectively validate flow meter performance based on a comparison of current meter performance parameters to predetermined desired parameter limits.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an acoustic flow meter <b>100</b> in accordance with various embodiments. A meter body or spool piece <b>104</b>, suitable for placement between sections of a pipeline, has a predetermined size and defines a central passage <b>102</b> through which a measured fluid (e.g., natural gas) flows. An illustrative pair of transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, and their respective housings <b>125</b> and <b>135</b>, are located along the length of spool piece <b>104</b>. Transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are acoustic transceivers, and more particularly ultrasonic transceivers, meaning that they both generate and receive acoustic energy having frequencies of above about 20 kilohertz. The acoustic energy may be generated and received by a piezoelectric element in each transducer. To generate an acoustic signal, the piezoelectric element is stimulated electrically by way of a sinusoidal signal, and the element responds by vibrating. The vibration of the piezoelectric element generates the acoustic signal that travels through the measured fluid to the corresponding transducer of the transducer pair. Similarly, upon being struck by acoustic energy (i.e., the acoustic signal and other noise signals), the receiving piezoelectric element vibrates and generates an electrical signal that is detected, digitized, and analyzed by electronics associated with the meter <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A path <b>110</b>, sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;chord&#x201d; or a &#x201c;chordal pathway&#x201d;, exists between illustrative transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> at an angle &#x3b8; to a centerline <b>106</b>. The length of chord <b>110</b> is the distance between the face of transducer <b>120</b> and the face of transducer <b>130</b>. Points <b>140</b> and <b>145</b> define the locations where acoustic signals generated by transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> enter and leave fluid flowing through the spool piece <b>104</b> (i.e., the entrance to the spool piece bore). The position of transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> may be defined by the angle &#x3b8;, by a first length L measured between transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, a second length X corresponding to the axial distance between points <b>140</b> and <b>145</b>, and a third length &#x201c;d&#x201d; corresponding to the pipe inside diameter. In most cases distances d, X and L are precisely determined during meter <b>100</b> fabrication. Further, transducers such as <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are placed a specific distance from points <b>140</b> and <b>145</b>, respectively, regardless of meter size (i.e., spool piece size). A fluid, (e.g., natural gas) flows in a direction <b>150</b> with a flow velocity profile <b>152</b>. Velocity vectors <b>153</b>-<b>158</b> illustrate that in some cases the fluid velocity through spool piece <b>104</b> increases toward the centerline <b>106</b> of the spool piece <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Initially, downstream transducer <b>120</b> generates an acoustic signal that propagates across the fluid in the spool piece <b>104</b>, and is then incident upon and detected by upstream transducer <b>130</b>. A short time later (e.g., within a few milliseconds), the upstream transducer <b>130</b> generates a return acoustic signal that propagates back across the fluid in the spool piece <b>104</b>, and is then incident upon and detected by the downstream transducer <b>120</b>. Thus, the transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> play &#x201c;pitch and catch&#x201d; with acoustic signals <b>108</b> along chordal path <b>110</b>. During operation, this sequence may occur thousands of times per minute.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The transit time of the acoustic signal <b>108</b> between transducers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> depends in part upon whether the acoustic signal <b>108</b> is traveling upstream or downstream with respect to the fluid flow. The transit time for an acoustic signal traveling downstream (i.e., in the same direction as the fluid flow) is less than its transit time when traveling upstream (i.e., against the fluid flow). The upstream and downstream transit times can be used to calculate the average flow velocity of the fluid along and/or proximate to the chord, and the transit times can be used to calculate speed of sound in the measured fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Acoustic flow meters can have one or more chords. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an elevational end view of one end of a multi-path acoustic flow meter in accordance with various embodiments. The flow meter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> comprises four chordal pathways A, B, C and D at varying levels within the spool piece <b>104</b>. In particular, chord A is an upper-most chord, chord B is an upper-middle chord, chord C is the lower-middle chord, and chord D is the lower-most chord. Each chordal path A-D corresponds to a transducer pair behaving alternately as a transmitter and receiver. Control electronics enclosure <b>160</b> is also shown, within which control electronics reside that acquire and process the data from the illustrative four chordal pathways A-D. Hidden from view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, because of the flange, are the four pairs of transducers and transducer ports that correspond to chordal pathways A-D.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows an overhead view of the flow meter <b>100</b> to illustrate another aspect of the relationship of the chordal pathways. A first pair of transducer ports <b>125</b> and <b>135</b> (which may correspond to the upper-most chord, chord A) comprises transducers which define a chordal pathway at a non-perpendicular angle &#x3b8; to centerline <b>106</b> of spool piece <b>104</b>. Another pair of transducer ports <b>165</b> and <b>175</b> (which may correspond to upper-middle chord, chord B) comprises transducers which define a chordal pathway that loosely forms the shape of an &#x201c;X&#x201d; with respect to the chordal pathway of transducer ports <b>125</b> and <b>135</b>. Similarly, a third pair of transducer ports <b>185</b> and <b>195</b> (which may correspond to the lower-middle chord, chord C) likewise comprises transducers which define a chordal pathway parallel to the chordal pathway for transducer ports <b>125</b> and <b>135</b>, but lower in the central passage than the chordal pathway for either transducer ports <b>125</b> and <b>135</b> or transducer ports <b>165</b> and <b>175</b>. Not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, because of the curvature of the illustrative spool piece <b>104</b>, is a fourth pair of transducer ports (which may correspond to the lower-most chord, chord D) that comprises transducers which define a chordal pathway parallel to the chordal pathway for transducer ports <b>165</b> and <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Taking <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> together, the pairs of transducers are arranged such that the upper two pairs of transducers corresponding to chords A and B form the shape of an &#x201c;X&#x201d;, and the lower two pairs of transducers corresponding to chords C and D also form the shape of an &#x201c;X&#x201d;. The flow meter <b>100</b> determines the velocity of the gas proximate to each chord A-D to obtain chordal flow velocities, and the chordal flow velocities are combined to determine an average flow velocity across the entire central passage. From the average flow velocity and the cross-sectional area of the central passage, the amount of gas flowing in the spool piece, and thus the pipeline, may be determined. Changes in the post-calibration flow environment can affect flow meter <b>100</b> performance. Therefore, embodiments of the present disclosure include flow meter <b>100</b> validation that allows for efficient verification of flow meter performance.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block a diagram of a system including flow meter validation in accordance with various embodiments.

Alternatively, the electronics enclosure <b>160</b> may be equivalently mounted proximate (e.g., within a few feet) of the spool piece. The control electronics <b>200</b> include a processor <b>202</b>, a data and program storage module <b>204</b>, a transducer driver/receiver <b>206</b>, and a communication interface <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The processor <b>202</b> is the device within which programs execute to perform meter <b>100</b> operations. The processor <b>202</b> may be, for example, a general-purpose processor, a digital signal processor, a microcontroller, etc. Processor architectures generally include execution units (e.g., fixed point, floating point, integer, etc.), storage (e.g., registers, memory, etc.), instruction decoding, peripherals (e.g., interrupt controllers, timers, direct memory access controllers, etc.), input/output systems (e.g., serial ports, parallel ports, etc.) and various other components and sub-systems.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data and program storage module <b>204</b> provides storage for software programming and/or data values related to the various operations of the meter <b>100</b> (e.g., performing flow measurements), and is coupled to and accessible by the processor <b>202</b>.

Baseline values <b>214</b> that define preferred ranges for various flow parameters may be stored in the storage module <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Processor <b>202</b> also couples to and controls the transducer driver/receiver module <b>206</b> in order to send and receive acoustic signals through the measured fluid. In some embodiments, the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> includes an oscillator circuit and an amplifier circuit. In embodiments in which the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> has an internal oscillator, the driver portion of the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> creates an initial signal, amplifies the signal to sufficient signal strength to drive a transducer, and provides impedance matching with respect to the transducers. In other embodiments, the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> receives an alternating current (AC) signal of the desired frequency from the processor <b>202</b>, amplifies the signal and provides impedance matching with respect to the transducers. The receiver portion of the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> likewise may take many forms. In some embodiments, the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> includes an analog-to-digital converter that takes the analog waveform created by a transducer representative of the received acoustic energy, and converts the signal to digital form. In some cases, the driver/receiver module <b>206</b> may filter and/or amplify the signals prior to or after digitization. The digitized version of the received signal may then pass to the processor <b>202</b> for purposes of determining fluid flow and ascertaining meter <b>100</b> operational parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The processor <b>202</b>, executing a program retrieved from storage <b>204</b>, controls the transducer driver/receiver <b>206</b> to drive the each transducer <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> of each transducer pair <b>222</b> to create an acoustic signal and to receive the electrical signal created by the transducer in response to the acoustic energy. In some embodiments, the processor <b>202</b>, within the span of an illustrative one-second measurement period, directs each transducer pair to send approximately 30 upstream acoustic signals and 30 downstream acoustic signals. Greater or fewer sets of upstream and downstream acoustic signals for each transducer pair, and longer or shorter measurement periods, may be equivalently used.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, transducer pair <b>222</b>A is representative of all the transducer pairs <b>222</b>. For purposes of this discussion, transducer <b>224</b> is the sending transducer, and transducer <b>226</b> is the receiving transducer; however, in actual operation these roles change alternately. Under control of the processor <b>202</b>, an electrical signal generated and/or amplified by the transducer driver/receiver <b>206</b> propagates to and excites a piezoelectric element in transducer <b>224</b>, and in turn transducer <b>224</b> generates an acoustic signal. The acoustic signal traverses the distance between transducer <b>224</b> and transducer <b>226</b> in the measured fluid. The transducers <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> are substantially coaxial, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (see transducers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>). Transducer <b>226</b> receives the acoustic energy (i.e., acoustic signal and noise signals), and an electrical signal corresponding to the received acoustic energy propagates to the transducer driver/receiver <b>206</b>, and thereafter to the processor <b>202</b>.</p>

The user interface <b>210</b> may receive the baseline offset values via user entry through the input device <b>310</b> and transfer the values to the meter <b>100</b> via the network <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">In block <b>504</b>, the processor <b>302</b> executes the baseline viewer software <b>314</b> and a baseline viewer display <b>400</b> is generated on the display device <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">In block <b>506</b>, the user interface <b>210</b> receives fluid flow parameter information from the flow meter <b>100</b>. The information received includes the baseline limit values <b>214</b> previously programmed into the meter <b>100</b>, and values of parameters associated with the baseline limits <b>214</b> measured by the meter <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the parameters received for display by the baseline viewer include at least some of average flow velocity, profile factor, swirl angle, symmetry, cross-flow, and chord turbulence.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">In block <b>508</b>, either of average or current/instantaneous parameter values is selected for presentation on the baseline viewer display <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">In block <b>510</b>, for at least some meter <b>100</b> parameters displayed on the baseline viewer display <b>400</b>, the processor <b>302</b> renders an indication <b>408</b> of a range of values the parameter may possibly take. Within the range of possible parameter values, the processor <b>302</b> overlays a display <b>410</b> of the baseline limits <b>214</b> for the parameter. The baseline limits indicate a preferred range of values for the parameter. For example, when the parameter value falls within the baseline limits the meter <b>100</b> may be considered to be operating normally. The processor <b>302</b> also renders an indicator <b>412</b>, for example a pointer, at a position signifying the value of the parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">Inclusion of the baseline viewer in the user interface <b>210</b> allows a user to quickly and effectively determine whether the meter <b>100</b> is operating within acceptable limits. The flow parameters selected for display in the baseline viewer allow a user to easily identify undesirable flow conditions affecting measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention. Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications.</p>
