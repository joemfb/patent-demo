<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention provides polypeptides, peptide dimers, and multimeric complexes comprising at least one binding moiety for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex, which have a variety of uses wherever treating, detecting, isolating or localizing angiogenesis is advantageous. Particularly disclosed are synthetic, isolated polypeptides capable of binding KDR or VEGF/KDR complex with high affinity (e.g., having a K<sub>D</sub>&#x3c;1 &#x3bc;M), and dimer and multimeric constructs comprising these polypeptides, particularly contrast agents. Also provided are methods for monitoring and evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness of treatment protocols for diseases associated with angiogenesis or endothelial cell hyperproliferation, such as cancer, using contrast agents of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to polypeptides and compositions useful for detecting and targeting primary receptors on endothelial cells for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as kinase domain region (KDR) and fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1)), and for imaging and targeting complexes formed by VEGF and KDR. The involvement of VEGF and KDR in angiogenesis makes the VEGF/KDR and KDR binding polypeptides of the present invention particularly useful for imaging important sites of angiogenesis, e.g., neoplastic tumors, for targeting substances, e.g., therapeutics, including radiotherapeutics, to such sites, and for treating certain disease states, including those associated with inappropriate angiogenesis. The present invention also relates to targeting vector-phospholipid conjugates and particularly targeting peptide-phospholipid conjugates, which target KDR and are useful in therapeutic and diagnostic compositions and methods of preparation of the same. The invention includes targeted ultrasound contrast agents, and particularly targeted microbubbles which include such targeting vector-phospholipid conjugates.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the developing embryo, the primary vascular network is established by in situ differentiation of meso-dermal cells in a process called vasculogenesis. After embryonic vasculogenesis however, it is believed that all subsequent generation of new blood vessels, in the embryo or in adults, is governed by the sprouting or splitting of new capillaries from the pre-existing vasculature in a process called angiogenesis (Pepper, M. et al., 1996. <i>Enzyme Protein, </i>49:138-162; Risau, W., 1997. <i>Nature, </i>386:671-674). Angiogenesis is not only involved in embryonic development and normal tissue growth and repair, it is also involved in the female reproductive cycle, establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, and in repair of wounds and fractures. In addition to angiogenesis that takes place in the normal individual, angiogenic events are involved in a number of pathological processes, notably tumor growth and metastasis, and other conditions in which blood vessel proliferation is increased, such as diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis and arthropathies. Angiogenesis is so important in the transition of a tumor from hyperplastic to neoplastic growth, that inhibition of angiogenesis has shown promise as a cancer therapy (Kim, K. et al., 1993. <i>Nature, </i>362:841-844).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Tumor-induced angiogenesis is thought to depend on the production of pro-angiogenic growth factors by the tumor cells, which overcome other forces that tend to keep existing vessels quiescent and stable. The best characterized of these pro-angiogenic agents or growth factors is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Cohen et al., FASEB J., 13: 9-22 (1999)). VEGF is produced naturally by a variety of cell types in response to hypoxia and some other stimuli. Many tumors also produce large amounts of VEGF, and/or induce nearby stromal cells to make VEGF (Fukumura et al., Cell, 94: 715-725 (1998)). VEGF, also referred to as VEGF-A, is synthesized as five different splice isoforms of 121, 145, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids. VEGF121 and VEGF165 are the main forms produced, particularly in tumors (see Cohen et al. 1999, supra). VEGF121 lacks a basic domain encoded by exons 6 and 7 of the VEGF gene and does not bind to heparin or extracellular matrix, unlike VEGF165. Each of the references cited in this paragraph is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">VEGF family members act primarily by binding to receptor tyrosine kinases. In general, receptor tyrosine kinases are glycoproteins having an extracellular domain capable of binding one or more specific growth factors, a transmembrane domain (usually an alpha helix), a juxtamembrane domain (where the receptor may be regulated, e.g., by phosphorylation), a tyrosine kinase domain (the catalytic component of the receptor), and a carboxy-terminal tail, which in many receptors is involved in recognition and binding of the substrates for the tyrosine kinase. There are three endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinases known to bind VEGF:VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR or Flk-1), and VEGFR-3 (Flt4). Flt-1 and KDR (also known as VEGFR-2 or Flk-1, which are used interchangeably herein) have been identified as the primary high affinity VEGF receptors. While Flt-1 has higher affinity for VEGF, KDR displays more abundant endothelial cell expression (Bikfalvi et al., J. Cell. Physiol., 149: 50-59 (1991)). Moreover, KDR is thought to dominate the angiogenic response and is therefore of greater therapeutic and diagnostic interest (see Cohen et al. 1999, supra). Expression of KDR is highly upregulated in angiogenic vessels, especially in tumors that induce a strong angiogenic response (Veikkola et al., Cancer Res., 60: 203-212 (2000)). The critical role of KDR in angiogenesis is highlighted by the complete lack of vascular development in homozygous KDR knockout mouse embryos (Folkman et al., Cancer Medicine, 5th Edition (B.C. Decker Inc.; Ontario, Canada, 2000) pp. 132-152).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">KDR (kinase domain region) is made up of 1336 amino acids in its mature form. The glycosylated form of KDR migrates on an SDS-PAGE gel with an apparent molecular weight of about 205 kDa. KDR contains seven immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular domain, of which the first three are the most important in VEGF binding (Cohen et al. 1999, supra). VEGF itself is a homodimer capable of binding to two KDR molecules simultaneously. The result is that two KDR molecules become dimerized upon binding and autophosphorylate, becoming much more active. The increased kinase activity in turn initiates a signaling pathway that mediates the KDR-specific biological effects of VEGF.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, not only is the VEGF binding activity of KDR in vivo critical to angiogenesis, but the ability to detect KDR upregulation on endothelial cells or to detect VEGF/KDR binding complexes would be extremely beneficial in detecting or monitoring angiogenesis with particular diagnostic applications such as detecting malignant tumor growth. It would also be beneficial in therapeutic applications such as targeting tumorcidal agents or angiogenesis inhibitors to a tumor site or targeting agonists of KDR, VEGF/KDR, or angiogenesis to a desired site.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is well known that gas filled ultrasound contrast agents are exceptionally efficient ultrasound reflectors for echography. Such ultrasound contrast agents include, for example, gas-filled microvesicles such as gas-filled microbubbles and gas filled microballoons. Gas filled microbubbles are particularly preferred ultrasound contrast agents. (In this disclosure the term of &#x201c;microbubble&#x201d; specifically designates a gaseous bubble surrounded or stabilized by phospholipids). For instance injecting into the bloodstream of living bodies suspensions of air- or gas-filled microbubbles in a carrier liquid will strongly reinforce ultrasonic echography imaging, thus aiding in the visualization of internal anatomical structures. Imaging of vessels and internal organs can strongly help in medical diagnosis, for instance for the detection of neoplastic, cardiovascular and other diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes it would be particularly beneficial to incorporate into gas filled ultrasound contrast agents, targeting vector compositions which exhibit high binding affinity for a desired target (such as, for example, KDR or the VEGF/KDR complex). For example, targeting vector-phospholipid conjugates and particularly targeting peptide-phospholipid conjugates may be used to prepare targeted, gas filled ultrasound contrast agents. In addition, it would be particularly beneficial to have methods for large scale production of highly purified forms of such targeting vector-phospholipid conjugates. Such compositions and methods would allow for production of compositions for use in diagnostic or therapeutic applications such as, for example, precise targeting of reporter moieties, tumoricidal agents or angiogenesis inhibitors to the target site.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates to polypeptides and compositions useful for detecting and targeting primary receptors on endothelial cells for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as kinase domain region (KDR) and fetal liver kinase-1 (Flk-1)), and for imaging and targeting complexes formed by VEGF and KDR. The involvement of VEGF and KDR in angiogenesis makes the VEGF/KDR and KDR binding polypeptides of the present invention particularly useful for imaging important sites of angiogenesis, e.g., neoplastic tumors, for targeting substances, e.g., therapeutics, including radiotherapeutics, to such sites, and for treating certain disease states, including those associated with inappropriate angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A group of polypeptides has been discovered that bind to KDR or VEGF/KDR complex (referred to herein as &#x201c;KDR binding polypeptides&#x201d; or &#x201c;KDR binding moieties&#x201d; and homologues thereof). Such KDR and VEGF/KDR binding polypeptides will concentrate at the sites of angiogenesis, thus providing a means for detecting and imaging sites of active angiogenesis, which can include sites of neoplastic tumor growth. Such KDR and VEGF/KDR binding polypeptides provide novel therapeutics to inhibit or promote, e.g., angiogenesis. The preparation, use and screening of such polypeptides, for example as imaging agents or as fusion partners for KDR or VEGF/KDR-homing therapeutics, is described in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In answer to the need for improved materials and methods for detecting, localizing, measuring and possibly affecting (inhibiting or enhancing), e.g., angiogenesis, it has been surprisingly discovered that seven families of non-naturally occurring polypeptides bind specifically to KDR or VEGF/KDR complex. Appropriate labeling of such polypeptides provides detectable imaging agents that can bind, e.g., at high concentration, to KDR-expressing endothelial cells or cells exhibiting VEGF/KDR complexes, providing angiogenesis-specific imaging agents. The KDR and VEGF/KDR binding polypeptides of the instant invention can thus be used in the detection and diagnosis of such angiogenesis-related disorders. Conjugation or fusion of such polypeptides with effective agents such as VEGF inhibitors or tumorcidal agents can also be used to treat pathogenic tumors, e.g., by causing the conjugate or fusion to &#x201c;home&#x201d; to the site of active angiogenesis, thereby providing an effective means for treating pathogenic conditions associated with angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This invention pertains to KDR and VEGF/KDR binding polypeptides, and includes use of a single binding polypeptide as a monomer or in a multimeric or polymeric construct as well as use of more than one binding polypeptide of the invention in multimeric or polymeric constructs. Binding polypeptides according to this invention are useful in any application where binding, detecting or isolating KDR or VEGF/KDR complex, or fragments thereof retaining the polypeptide binding site, is advantageous. A particularly advantageous use of the binding polypeptides disclosed herein is in a method of imaging angiogenesis in vivo. The method entails the use of specific binding polypeptides according to the invention for detecting a site of angiogenesis, where the binding polypeptides have been detectably labeled for use as imaging agents, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, x-ray imaging agents, radiopharmaceutical imaging agents, ultrasound imaging agents, and optical imaging agents.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another advantageous use of the KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides disclosed herein is to target therapeutic agents (including compounds capable of providing a therapeutic, radiotherapeutic or cytotoxic effect), or delivery vehicles for therapeutics (including drugs, genetic material, etc.) to sites of angiogenesis or other tissue expressing KDR.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Constructs comprising two or more KDR or KDR/VEGF binding polypeptides show improved ability to bind the target molecule compared to the corresponding monomeric binding polypeptides. For example, as shown in Experiment D of Example 5, tetrameric constructs of KDR binding polypeptides provided herein showed improved ability to bind KDR-transfected 293H cells. Combining two or more binding polypeptides in a single molecular construct appears to improve the avidity of the construct over the monomeric binding polypeptides as shown by a decrease in K<sub>D</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, as demonstrated herein, constructs comprising two or more binding polypeptides specific for different epitopes of KDR and/or KDR/VEGF (e.g., &#x201c;heteromeric&#x201d; or &#x201c;heteromultimeric&#x201d; constructs, see U.S. Application No. 60/440,201, U.S. application Ser. No. 10/379,287, filed Mar. 3, 2003, and U.S. application Ser. No. 10/661,032 by Christophe Arbogast et al., filed Sep. 11, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein) were made. Constructs comprising two or more binding polypeptides provided herein are expected to bind to multiple sites on KDR or VEGF/KDR. The heteromeric constructs show superior binding ability over both the corresponding monomers and multimeric constructs comprising multiple copies of the same binding polypeptide. Furthermore, heteromeric constructs comprising two or more binding peptides specific for different epitopes, together with a control peptide, were also able to efficiently bind KDR-transfected 293H cells. Thus, inclusion of two or more binding polypeptides that recognize different epitopes further improves the avidity of the construct for the target molecule, as demonstrated by a decrease in K<sub>D</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Heteromeric constructs of the binding polypeptides provided herein show improved ability to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase function. Based on experiments described herein, dimeric and other multimeric constructs of the present invention comprising at least two binding polypeptides specific for different epitopes of KDR and/or KDR/VEGF complex are expected to inhibit the function of receptor tyrosine kinases. In particular, such constructs are expected to inhibit the function of VEGFR-2/KDR, VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-3/Flt-4.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For the purposes of the present invention, receptor tyrosine kinase function can include any one of: oligomerization of the receptor, receptor phosphorylation, kinase activity of the receptor, recruitment of downstream signaling molecules, induction of genes, induction of cell proliferation, induction of cell migration, or combination thereof. For example, heteromeric constructs of binding polypeptides provided herein inhibit VEGF-induced KDR receptor activation in human endothelial cells, demonstrated by the inhibition of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of the KDR receptor. In addition, heteromeric constructs of binding peptides provided herein inhibit VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration. As shown herein, targeting two or more distinct epitopes on KDR with a single binding construct greatly improves the ability of the construct to inhibit receptor function. Even binding peptides with weak ability to block receptor activity can be used to generate heteromeric constructs having improved ability to block VEGF-induced receptor function.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, the present invention also is drawn to constructs comprising two or more binding polypeptides. In one embodiment, the multimeric constructs comprise two or more copies of a single binding polypeptide. In another embodiment, the multimeric constructs of the present invention comprise two or more binding polypeptides, such that at least two of the binding polypeptides in the construct are specific for different epitopes of KDR and/or KDR/VEGF. These constructs are also referred to herein as &#x201c;heteromeric constructs,&#x201d; &#x201c;heteromultimers,&#x201d; etc. The constructs of the present invention can also include unrelated, or control peptide(s). The constructs can include two or more, three or more, or four or more binding polypeptides. Based on the teachings provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art is able to assemble the binding polypeptides provided herein into multimeric constructs and to select multimeric constructs having improved properties, such as improved ability to bind the target molecule, or improved ability to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinase function. Such multimeric constructs having improved properties are included in the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0216" num="0215">A description of preferred embodiments of the invention follows.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0300" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In the following sections, the term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; is used to describe non-naturally altered or manipulated nucleic acids, host cells transfected with exogenous nucleic acids, or polypeptides expressed non-naturally, through manipulation of isolated DNA and transformation of host cells. Recombinant is a term that specifically encompasses DNA molecules that have been constructed in vitro using genetic engineering techniques, and use of the term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; as an adjective to describe a molecule, construct, vector, cell, polypeptide or polynucleotide specifically excludes naturally occurring such molecules, constructs, vectors, cells, polypeptides or polynucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The term &#x201c;bacteriophage&#x201d; is defined as a bacterial virus containing a DNA core and a protective shell built up by the aggregation of a number of different protein molecules. The terms &#x201c;bacteriophage&#x201d; and &#x201c;phage&#x201d; are used herein interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; is used to refer to a compound of two or more amino acids joined through the main chain (as opposed to side chain) by a peptide amide bond (&#x2014;C(:O)NH&#x2014;). The term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; is used interchangeably herein with &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; but is generally used to refer to polypeptides having fewer than 40, and preferably fewer than 25 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The term &#x201c;binding polypeptide&#x201d; as used herein refers to any polypeptide capable of forming a binding complex with another molecule. An equivalent term sometimes used herein is &#x201c;binding moiety&#x201d;. &#x201c;KDR binding polypeptide&#x201d; is a polypeptide that forms a complex in vitro or in vivo with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (or KDR, Flk-1); &#x201c;VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide&#x201d; is a polypeptide that forms a complex in vitro or in vivo with a binding complex formed between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and KDR, in particular the complex of homodimeric VEGF and one or two KDR molecules that is believed to form at the surface of endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Specific examples of KDR and VEGF/KDR binding polypeptides include but are not limited to the peptides presented in Tables 1-7, infra, and include hybrid and chimeric polypeptides incorporating such peptides. Also included within the definition of KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides are polypeptides that are modified or optimized as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Specific examples of such modifications are discussed in detail infra, but include substitution of amino acids for those in the parent polypeptide sequence to optimize properties, obliterate an enzyme cleavage site, etc.; C- or N-terminal amino acid substitutions or elongations, e.g., for the purpose of linking the binding polypeptide to a detectable imaging label or other substrate, examples of which include, e.g., addition of a polyhistidine &#x201c;tail&#x201d; in order to assist in purification; truncations; amide bond changes; translocations; retroinverso peptides; peptoids; retroinversopeptoids; the use of N-terminal or C-terminal modifications or linkers, such as polyglycine or polylysine segments; alterations to include functional groups, notably hydrazide (&#x2014;NH&#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>) functionalities or the C-terminal linker -Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys (SEQ ID NO: 18), to assist in immobilization of binding peptides according to this invention on solid supports or for attachment of fluorescent dyes; pharmacokinetic modifications, structural modifications to retain structural features, formation of salts to increase water solubility or ease of formulation, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">In addition to the detectable labels described further herein, other suitable substrates for the binding polypeptides include a tumorcidal agent or enzyme, a liposome (e.g., loaded with a therapeutic agent, an ultrasound appropriate gas, or both), or a solid support, well, plate, bead, tube, slide, filter or dish. Moreover, dimers or multimers of one or more KDR or VEGF/KDR binding polypeptides can be formed. Such constructs may, for example, exhibit increased ability to bind to KDR. All such modified binding polypeptides are also considered KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides so long as they retain the ability to bind the KDR or VEGF/KDR targets.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">&#x201c;Homologues&#x201d; of the binding polypeptides described herein can be produced using any of the modification or optimization techniques described herein or known to those skilled in the art. Such homologous polypeptides will be understood to fall within the scope of the present invention and the definition of KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides so long as the substitution, addition, or deletion of amino acids or other such modification does not eliminate its ability to bind either KDR or VEGF/KDR complex. The term &#x201c;homologous&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the degree of sequence similarity between two polymers (i.e., polypeptide molecules or nucleic acid molecules). Where the same nucleotide or amino acid residue or one with substantially similar properties (i.e., a conservative substitution) occupies a sequence position in the two polymers under comparison, then the polymers are homologous at that position. For example, if the amino acid residues at 60 of 100 amino acid positions in two polypeptide sequences match or are homologous then the two sequences are 60% homologous.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The homology percentage figures referred to herein reflect the maximal homology possible between the two polymers, i.e., the percent homology when the two polymers are so aligned as to have the greatest number of matched (homologous) positions. Polypeptide homologues within the scope of the present invention will be at least 70% and preferably greater than 80% homologous to at least one of the KDR or VEGF/KDR binding sequences disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The term &#x201c;binding&#x201d; refers to the determination by standard assays, including those described herein, that a binding polypeptide recognizes and binds reversibly to a given target. Such standard assays include, but are not limited to equilibrium dialysis, gel filtration, and the monitoring of spectroscopic changes that result from binding.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The term &#x201c;specificity&#x201d; refers to a binding polypeptide having a higher binding affinity for one target over another. The term &#x201c;KDR specificity&#x201d; refers to a KDR binding moiety having a higher affinity for KDR than for an irrelevant target. The term &#x201c;VEGF/KDR specificity&#x201d; refers to a VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety having a higher affinity for a VEGF/KDR complex than for another given target. Binding specificity can be characterized by a dissociation equilibrium constant (K<sub>D</sub>) or an association equilibrium constant (K<sub>a</sub>) for the two tested target materials, or can be any measure of relative binding strength. The binding polypeptides according to the present invention are specific for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex and preferably have a K<sub>D </sub>for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex that is lower than 10 &#x3bc;M, more preferably less than 1.0 &#x3bc;M, most preferably less than 0.5 &#x3bc;M or even lower.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d; as used herein refers to any mammal, especially humans.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; carrier or excipient refers to a non-toxic carrier or excipient that can be administered to a patient, together with a compound of this invention, such that it does not destroy the biological or pharmacological activity thereof. The following common abbreviations are used throughout this specification: 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (fmoc or Fmoc), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N,N&#x2032;-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), acetic anhydride (Ac<sub>2</sub>O), (4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl (ivDde), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), Reagent B (TFA:H<sub>2</sub>O:phenol:triisopropylsilane, 88:5:5:2), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), O-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorphosphate (HATU), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP).</p>
<heading id="h-0301" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The present invention provides novel binding moieties that bind KDR or a complex of VEGF and KDR. Such binding moieties make possible the efficient detection, imaging and localization of activated endothelial cells exhibiting upregulated KDR expression and binding to VEGF. Such endothelial cells are characteristic of active angiogenesis, and therefore the polypeptides described herein provide a means of detecting, monitoring and localizing sites of angiogenesis. In particular, the binding polypeptides of this invention, when appropriately labeled, are useful for detecting, imaging and localizing tumor-induced angiogenesis. Thus, the binding polypeptides can be used to form a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic agents for diagnosing and treating neoplastic tumor growth or other pathogenic instances of angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">In addition, the binding polypeptides can themselves be used as therapeutic agents. Specific KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides according to the present invention were isolated initially by screening of phage display libraries, that is, populations of recombinant bacteriophage transformed to express an exogenous peptide on their surface. In order to isolate new polypeptide binding moieties for a particular target, such as KDR or VEGF/KDR, screening of large peptide libraries, for example using phage display techniques, is especially advantageous, in that very large numbers (e.g., 5&#xd7;10<sup>9</sup>) of potential binders can be tested and successful binders isolated in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">In order to prepare a phage library of displaying polypeptides to screen for binding polypeptides such as KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides, a candidate binding domain is selected to serve as a structural template for the peptides to be displayed in the library. The phage library is made up of a multiplicity of analogues of the parental domain or template. The binding domain template may be a naturally occurring or synthetic protein, or a region or domain of a protein. The binding domain template may be selected based on knowledge of a known interaction between the binding domain template and the binding target, but this is not critical. In fact, it is not essential that the domain selected to act as a template for the library have any affinity for the target at all: Its purpose is to provide a structure from which a multiplicity (library) of similarly structured polypeptides (analogues) can be generated, which multiplicity of analogues will hopefully include one or more analogues that exhibit the desired binding properties (and any other properties screened for).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">In selecting the parental binding domain or template on which to base the variegated amino acid sequences of the library, the most important consideration is how the variegated peptide domains will be presented to the target, i.e., in what conformation the peptide analogues will come into contact with the target. In phage display methodologies, for example, the analogues will be generated by insertion of synthetic DNA encoding the analogues into phage, resulting in display of the analogue on the surfaces of the phage. Such libraries of phage, such as M13 phage, displaying a wide variety of different polypeptides, can be prepared using techniques as described, e.g., in Kay et al., <i>Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual </i>(Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, 1996) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409 (Ladner et al.), incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In isolating the specific polypeptides according to this invention, seven cyclic peptide (or &#x201c;loop&#x201d;) libraries, designated TN6/VI, TN7/IV, TN8/IX, TN9/IV, TN10/IX, TN12/I, and MTN13/I, and a linear library, designated Lin20, were used. Each library was constructed for expression of diversified polypeptides on M13 phage. The seven libraries having a &#x201c;TN&#x201d; designation were designed to display a short, variegated exogenous peptide loop of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 or 13 amino acids, respectively, on the surface of M13 phage, at the amino terminus of protein III. The libraries are designated TN6/VI (having a potential 3.3&#xd7;10<sup>12 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity), TN7/IV (having a potential 1.2&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity), TN8/IX (having a potential 2.2&#xd7;10<sup>15 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity), TN9/IV (having a potential 4.2&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity), TN10/IX (having a potential 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity), TN12/I (having a sequence diversity of 4.6&#xd7;10<sup>19</sup>), MTN13/I (having a potential 8.0&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity), and Lin20 (having a potential 3.8&#xd7;10<sup>25 </sup>amino acid sequence diversity).</p>

The amino acids at positions 1, 2, 15, and 16 in the template were varied to permit any amino acid selected from a group of 10 amino acids: D, F, H, L, N, P, R, S, W, or Y). The amino acids at positions 3 and 14 in the template were varied to permit any amino acid selected from a group of 14 amino acids: A, D, F, G, H, L, N, P, Q, R, S, V, W, or Y).

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The TN12/I library was constructed to display a single microprotein binding loop contained in an 18-amino acid template. The TN12/I library utilized a template sequence Xaa<sub>1</sub>-Xaa<sub>2</sub>-Xaa<sub>3</sub>-Cys-Xaa<sub>5</sub>-Xaa<sub>6</sub>-Xaa<sub>7</sub>-Xaa<sub>8</sub>-Xaa<sub>9</sub>-Xaa<sub>10</sub>-Xaa<sub>11</sub>-Xaa<sub>12</sub>-Xaa<sub>13</sub>-Xaa<sub>14</sub>-Cys-Xaa<sub>16</sub>-Xaa<sub>17</sub>-Xaa<sub>18</sub>.

The MTN13/I library utilized a template sequence Xaa<sub>1</sub>-Xaa<sub>2</sub>-Xaa<sub>3</sub>-Cys-Xaa<sub>5</sub>-Xaa<sub>6</sub>-Xaa<sub>7</sub>-Xaa<sub>8</sub>-Ser-Gly-Pro-Xaa<sub>12</sub>-Xaa<sub>13</sub>-Xaa<sub>14</sub>-Xaa<sub>15</sub>-Cys-Xaa<sub>17</sub>-Xaa<sub>18</sub>-Xaa<sub>19 </sub>(SEQ ID NO: 19).

<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The Lin20 library was constructed to display a single linear peptide in a 20-amino acid template. The amino acids at each position in the template were varied to permit any amino acid except cysteine (Cys).</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The binding polypeptides provided herein can include additions or truncations in the N- and/or C-termini. Such modified binding polypeptides are expected to bind KDR or VEGF/KDR complex. For example, the -GGGK linker present at the N-terminus of some of the binding polypeptides provided herein is an optional linker. Therefore, polypeptides having the same sequence, except without the terminal -GGGK sequence, are also encompassed by the present invention. In addition, binding polypeptides comprising the loop portion of the templates and sequences provided herein are expected to bind KDR and/or VEGF/KDR complex and are also encompassed by the present invention. The loop portion of the templates and sequences includes the sequences between and including the two cysteine residues that are expected to form a disulfide bond, thereby generating a peptide loop structure. Furthermore, the binding polypeptides of the present invention can include additional amino acid residues at the N- and/or C-termini.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The phage display libraries were created by making a designed series of mutations or variations within a coding sequence for the polypeptide template, each mutant sequence encoding a peptide analogue corresponding in overall structure to the template except having one or more amino acid variations in the sequence of the template. The novel variegated (mutated) DNA provides sequence diversity, and each transformant phage displays one variant of the initial template amino acid sequence encoded by the DNA, leading to a phage population (library) displaying a vast number of different but structurally related amino acid sequences. The amino acid variations are expected to alter the binding properties of the binding peptide or domain without significantly altering its structure, at least for most substitutions. It is preferred that the amino acid positions that are selected for variation (variable amino acid positions) will be surface amino acid positions, that is, positions in the amino acid sequence of the domains that, when the domain is in its most stable conformation, appear on the outer surface of the domain (i.e., the surface exposed to solution). Most preferably the amino acid positions to be varied will be adjacent or close together, so as to maximize the effect of substitutions.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">As indicated previously, the techniques discussed in Kay et al., <i>Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual </i>(Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, 1996) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409 are particularly useful in preparing a library of potential binders corresponding to the selected parental template. The seven libraries discussed above were prepared according to such techniques, and they were screened for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides against an immobilized target, as explained in the examples to follow.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">In a typical screen, a phage library is contacted with and allowed to bind the target, or a particular subcomponent thereof. To facilitate separation of binders and non-binders, it is convenient to immobilize the target on a solid support. Phage bearing a target-binding moiety form a complex with the target on the solid support whereas non-binding phage remain in solution and may be washed away with excess buffer. Bound phage are then liberated from the target by changing the buffer to an extreme pH (pH 2 or pH 10), changing the ionic strength of the buffer, adding denaturants, or other known means. To isolate the binding phage exhibiting the polypeptides of the present invention, a protein elution was performed, i.e., some phage were eluted from target using VEGF in solution (competitive elution); and also, very high affinity binding phage that could not be competed off incubating with VEGF overnight were captured by using the phage still bound to substrate for infection of <i>E. coli </i>cells.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The recovered phage may then be amplified through infection of bacterial cells and the screening process repeated with the new pool that is now depleted in non-binders and enriched in binders. The recovery of even a few binding phage is sufficient to carry the process to completion. After a few rounds of selection, the gene sequences encoding the binding moieties derived from selected phage clones in the binding pool are determined by conventional methods, described below, revealing the peptide sequence that imparts binding affinity of the phage to the target. When the selection process works, the sequence diversity of the population falls with each round of selection until desirable binders remain. The sequences converge on a small number of related binders, typically 10-50 out of the more than 10 million original candidates from each library. An increase in the number of phage recovered at each round of selection, and of course, the recovery of closely related sequences are good indications that convergence of the library has occurred in a screen. After a set of binding polypeptides is identified, the sequence information may be used to design other secondary phage libraries, biased for members having additional desired properties.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Formation of the disulfide binding loop is advantageous because it leads to increased affinity and specificity for such peptides. However, in serum, the disulfide bond might be opened by free cysteines or other thiol-containing molecules. Thus, it may be useful to modify the cysteine residues to replace the disulfide cross-link with another less reactive linkage. The &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>-cross-link has a preferred geometry in which the dihedral bond between sulfurs is close to 90 degrees, but the exact geometry is determined by the context of other side groups and the binding state of the molecule. Preferred modifications of the closing cross-link of the binding loop will preserve the overall bond lengths and angles as much as possible. Suitable such alternative cross-links include thioether linkages such as &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;; lactam linkages such as &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CO&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014; and &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CO&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;; ether linkages such as &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;; alkylene bridges such as &#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014; (where n=4, 5, or 6); the linkage &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CO&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, and similar groups known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Although polypeptides containing a stable disulfide-linked binding loop are most preferred, linear polypeptides derived from the foregoing sequences may be readily prepared, e.g., by substitution of one or both cysteine residues, which may retain at least some of the KDR or VEGF/KDR binding activity of the original polypeptide containing the disulfide linkage. In making such substitutions for Cys, the amino acids Gly, Ser, and Ala are preferred, and it is also preferred to substitute both Cys residues, so as not to leave a single Cys that may cause the polypeptide to dimerize or react with other free thiol groups in a solution. All such linearized derivatives that retain KDR or VEGF/KDR binding properties are within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Direct synthesis of the polypeptides of the invention may be accomplished using conventional techniques, including solid-phase peptide synthesis, solution-phase synthesis, etc. Solid-phase synthesis is preferred. See Stewart et al., <i>Solid</i>-<i>Phase Peptide Synthesis </i>(W. H. Freeman Co., San Francisco, 1989); Merrifield, <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>85:2149-2154 (1963); Bodanszky and Bodanszky, <i>The Practice of Peptide Synthesis </i>(Springer-Verlag, New York, 1984), incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Polypeptides according to the invention may also be prepared commercially by companies providing peptide synthesis as a service (e.g., BACHEM Bioscience, Inc., King of Prussia, Pa.; Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc., Hopkinton, Mass.).</p>
<p id="h-0302" num="0000">Automated peptide synthesis machines, such as manufactured by Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, also are available.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The polypeptide compound is preferably purified once it has been isolated or synthesized by either chemical or recombinant techniques. For purification purposes, there are many standard methods that may be employed, including reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using an alkylated silica column such as C<sub>4</sub>-, C<sub>8</sub>- or C<sub>18</sub>-silica. A gradient mobile phase of increasing organic content is generally used to achieve purification, for example, acetonitrile in an aqueous buffer, usually containing a small amount of trifluoroacetic acid. Ion-exchange chromatography can also be used to separate peptides based on their charge. The degree of purity of the polypeptide may be determined by various methods, including identification of a major large peak on HPLC. A polypeptide that produces a single peak that is at least 95% of the input material on an HPLC column is preferred. Even more preferable is a polypeptide that produces a single peak that is at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or even 99.5% or more of the input material on an HPLC column.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">In order to ensure that the peptide obtained using any of the techniques described above is the desired peptide for use in compositions of the present invention, analysis of the peptide composition may be carried out. Such composition analysis may be conducted using high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the molecular weight of the peptide. Alternatively, the amino acid content of the peptide can be confirmed by hydrolyzing the peptide in aqueous acid, and separating, identifying and quantifying the components of the mixture using HPLC, or an amino acid analyzer. Protein sequenators, which sequentially degrade the peptide and identify the amino acids in order, may also be used to determine the sequence of the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides according to the present invention also may be produced using recombinant DNA techniques, utilizing nucleic acids (polynucleotides) encoding the polypeptides according to this invention and then expressing them recombinantly, i.e., by manipulating host cells by introduction of exogenous nucleic acid molecules in known ways to cause such host cells to produce the desired KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides. Such procedures are within the capability of those skilled in the art (see Davis et al., <i>Basic Methods in Molecular Biology</i>, (1986)), incorporated by reference. Recombinant production of short peptides such as those described herein may not be practical in comparison to direct synthesis, however recombinant means of production may be very advantageous where a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety of this invention is incorporated in a hybrid polypeptide or fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">In the practice of the present invention, a determination of the affinity of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex relative to another protein or target is a useful measure, and is referred to as specificity for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex. Standard assays for quantitating binding and determining affinity include equilibrium dialysis, equilibrium binding, gel filtration, or the monitoring of numerous spectroscopic changes (such as a change in fluorescence polarization) that may result from the interaction of the binding moiety and its target. These techniques measure the concentration of bound and free ligand as a function of ligand (or protein) concentration. The concentration of bound polypeptide ([Bound]) is related to the concentration of free polypeptide ([Free]) and the concentration of binding sites for the polypeptide, i.e., on KDR or VEGF/KDR complex, (N), as described in the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>[Bound]=N&#xd7;[Free]/((1/K<sub>a</sub>)+[Free]).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">A solution of the data to this equation yields the association constant, K<sub>a</sub>, a quantitative measure of the binding affinity. The association constant, K<sub>a </sub>is the reciprocal of the dissociation constant, K<sub>D</sub>. The K<sub>D </sub>is more frequently reported in measurements of affinity. Preferred KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides have a K<sub>D </sub>for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in the range of 1 nanomolar (nM) to 100 micromolar (&#x3bc;M), which includes K<sub>D </sub>values of less than 10 nM, less than 20 nM, less than 40 nM, less than 60 nM, less than 80 nM, less than 1 &#x3bc;M, less than 5 &#x3bc;M, less than 10 &#x3bc;M, less than 20 &#x3bc;M, less than 40 &#x3bc;M, less than 60 &#x3bc;M, and less than 80 &#x3bc;M.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Where KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties are employed as imaging agents, other aspects of binding specificity may become more important. Imaging agents operate in a dynamic system in that binding of the imaging agent to the target (KDR or VEGF/KDR complex, e.g., on activated endothelium) may not be in a stable equilibrium state throughout the imaging procedure. For example, when the imaging agent is initially injected, the concentration of imaging agent and of agent-target complex rapidly increases. Shortly after injection, however, the circulating (free) imaging agent starts to clear through the kidneys or liver, and the plasma concentration of imaging agent begins to drop. This drop in the concentration of free imaging agent in the plasma eventually causes the agent-target complex to dissociate. The usefulness of an imaging agent depends on the difference in rate of agent-target dissociation relative to the clearing rate of the agent. Ideally, the dissociation rate will be slow compared to the clearing rate, resulting in a long imaging time during which there is a high concentration of agent-target complex and a low concentration of free imaging agent (background signal) in the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">Quantitative measurement of dissociation rates may be easily performed using several methods known in the art, such as fiber optic fluorimetry (see, e.g., Anderson &#x26; Miller, <i>Clin. Chem., </i>34(7):1417-21 (1988)), surface plasmon resonance (see, Malmborg et al., <i>J. Immunol. Methods, </i>198(1):51-7 (1996) and Schuck, <i>Current Opinion in Biotechnology, </i>8:498-502 (1997)), resonant mirror, and grating coupled planar waveguiding (see, e.g., Hutchinson, <i>Molec. Biotechnology, </i>3:47-54 (1995)). Automated biosensors are commercially available for measuring binding kinetics: BIAcore surface plasmon resonance sensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala SE), IAsys resonant mirror sensor (Fisons Applied Sensor Technology, Cambridge GB), BIOS-1 grated coupled planar waveguiding sensor (Artificial Sensor Instruments, Zurich CH).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Methods of Screening Polypeptides Identified by Phage Display for their Ability to Bind to Cells Expressing the Target:</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In another aspect of the invention, methods of screening binding polypeptides identified by phage display for their ability to bind to cells expressing the target (and not to cells that do not express the target) are provided. These methods address a significant problem associated with screening peptides identified by phage display: frequently the peptides so identified do not have sufficient affinity for the target to be screened against target-expressing cells in conventional assays. However, ascertaining that a particular phage-identified peptide binds to cells that express the target (and does not bind to cells that do not) is a critical piece of information in identifying binding peptides that are potential in vivo targeting moieties. The method takes advantage of the increase in affinity and avidity associated with multivalent binding and permits screening of polypeptides with low affinities against target-expressing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The method generally consists of preparation and screening of multimeric constructs including one or more binding polypeptides. For example, polypeptides identified by phage display as binding to a target are biotinylated and complexed with avidin, streptavidin or neutravidin to form tetrameric constructs. These tetrameric constructs are then incubated with cells that express the desired target and cells that do not, and binding of the tetrameric construct is detected. Binding may be detected using any method of detection known in the art. For example, to detect binding the avidin, streptavidin, or neutravidin may be conjugated to a detectable marker (e.g., a radioactive label, a fluorescent label, or an enzymatic label that undergoes a color change, such as HRP (horse radish peroxidase), TMB (tetramethyl benzidine) or alkaline phosphatase).</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The biotinylated peptides are preferably complexed with neutravidin-HRP. Neutravidin exhibits lower non-specific binding to molecules than the other alternatives due to the absence of lectin binding carbohydrate moieties and cell adhesion receptor-binding RYD domain in neutravidin. See, Hiller et al., <i>Biochem. J., </i>248:167-171 (1987); Alon et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., </i>170:1236-41 (1990).</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">The tetrameric constructs can be screened against cells that naturally express the target or cells that have been engineered via recombinant DNA technologies to express the target (e.g., transfectants, transformants, etc.). If cells that have been transfected to express the target are used, mock-transfected cells (i.e., cells transfected without the genetic material encoding the target) may be used as a control.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The tetrameric complexes may optionally be screened in the presence of serum. Thus, the assay may also be used to rapidly evaluate the effect of serum on the binding of peptides to the target.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The methods disclosed herein are particularly useful in preparing and evaluating combinations of distinct binding polypeptides for use in dimeric or multimeric targeting contructs that contain two or more binding polypeptides. Use of biotin/avidin complexes allows for relatively easy preparation of tetrameric constructs containing one to four different binding peptides. Furthermore, it has now been found that affinity and avidity of a targeting construct may be increased by inclusion of two or more targeting moieties that bind to different epitopes on the same target. The screening methods described herein are useful in identifying combinations of binding polypeptides that may have increased affinity when included in such multimeric constructs.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In a preferred embodiment, the screening methods described herein may be used to screen KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides identified by phage display, such as those described herein. As described in more detail in Example 5 infra, these methods may be used to assess the specific binding of KDR binding polypeptides to cells that express KDR or have been engineered to express KDR. Tetrameric complexes of biotinylated KDR binding polypeptides of the invention and neutravidin-HRP may be prepared and screened against cells transfected to express KDR as well as mock transfected cells (without any KDR).</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">As shown in Example 5, the assay can be used to identify KDR binding polypeptides that bind specifically to KDR-expressing cells (and do not bind to cells that do not express KDR) even when the monodentate K<sub>D </sub>of the polypeptide is on the order of 200 nM-300 nM. The assay may be used to screen homotetrameric constructs containing four copies of a single KDR binding polypeptide of the invention as well as heterotetrameric constructs (e.g., constructs containing two or more different KDR binding polypeptides). The methods described herein are particularly useful for assessing combinations of KDR binding polypeptides for use in multimeric constructs, particularly constructs containing two or more KDR binding polypeptides that bind to different epitopes of KDR.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The assay may also be used to assess the effect of serum on the KDR binding polypeptides. Indeed, using the screening methods disclosed herein, KDR binding polypeptides, such as SEQ ID NOS: 264, 294, and 356, were identified whose binding is not significantly affected by serum.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Modification or Optimization of KDR and VEGF/KDR Complex Binding Polypeptides</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">As discussed, modification or optimization of KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides is within the scope of the invention and the modified or optimized polypeptides are included within the definition of &#x201c;KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides&#x201d;. Specifically, a polypeptide sequence identified by phage display can be modified to optimize its potency, pharmacokinetic behavior, stability and/or other biological, physical and chemical properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0303" level="1">Substitution of Amino Acid Residues</heading>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">For example, one can make the following isosteric and/or conservative amino acid changes in the parent polypeptide sequence with the expectation that the resulting polypeptides would have a similar or improved profile of the properties described above:</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Substitution of alkyl-substituted hydrophobic amino acids: Including alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, norleucine, S-2-aminobutyric acid, S-cyclohexylalanine or other simple alpha-amino acids substituted by an aliphatic side chain from C<sub>1-10 </sub>carbons including branched, cyclic and straight chain alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl substitutions.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Substitution of aromatic-substituted hydrophobic amino acids: Including phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, biphenylalanine, 1-naphthylalanine, 2-naphthylalanine, 2-benzothienylalanine, 3-benzothienylalanine, histidine, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, aza, halogenated (fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo) or alkoxy (from C1-C4)-substituted forms of the previous listed aromatic amino acids, illustrative examples of which are: 2-, 3- or 4-aminophenylalanine, 2-, 3- or 4-chlorophenylalanine, 2-, 3- or 4-methylphenylalanine, 2-, 3- or 4-methoxyphenylalanine, 5-amino-, 5-chloro-, 5-methyl- or 5-methoxytryptophan, 2&#x2032;-, 3&#x2032;-, or 4&#x2032;-amino-, 2&#x2032;-, 3&#x2032;-, or 4&#x2032;-chloro-, 2, 3, or 4-biphenylalanine, 2&#x2032;, -3&#x2032;, -or 4&#x2032;-methyl-2, 3 or 4-biphenylalanine, and 2- or 3-pyridylalanine</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Substitution of amino acids containing basic functions: Including arginine, lysine, histidine, ornithine, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, homoarginine, alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl-substituted (from C1-C10 branched, linear, or cyclic) derivatives of the previous amino acids, whether the substituent is on the heteroatoms (such as the alpha nitrogen, or the distal nitrogen or nitrogens, or on the alpha carbon, in the pro-R position for example. Compounds that serve as illustrative examples include: N-epsilon-isopropyl-lysine, 3-(4-tetrahydropyridyl)-glycine, 3-(4-tetrahydropyridyl)-alanine, N,N-gamma, gamma&#x2032;-diethyl-homoarginine. Included also are compounds such as alpha methyl arginine, alpha methyl 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, alpha methyl histidine, alpha methyl ornithine where alkyl group occupies the pro-R position of the alpha carbon. Also included are the amides formed from alkyl, aromatic, heteroaromatic (where the heteroaromatic group has one or more nitrogens, oxygens or sulfur atoms singly or in combination) carboxylic acids or any of the many well-known activated derivatives such as acid chlorides, active esters, active azolides and related derivatives) and lysine, ornithine, or 2,3-diaminopropionic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Substitution of acidic amino acids: Including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, tyrosine, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, and heteroaryl sulfonamides of 2,4-diaminopriopionic acid, ornithine or lysine and tetrazole-substituted alkyl amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Substitution of side chain amide residues: Including asparagine, glutamine, and alkyl or aromatic substituted derivatives of asparagine or glutamine.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Substitution of hydroxyl containing amino acids: Including serine, threonine, homoserine, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, and alkyl or aromatic substituted derivatives of serine or threonine. It is also understood that the amino acids within each of the categories listed above may be substituted for another of the same group.</p>
<heading id="h-0304" level="1">Substitution of Amide Bonds</heading>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Another type of modification within the scope of the patent is to substitute the amide bonds within the backbone of the polypeptide. For example, to reduce or eliminate undesired proteolysis, or other degradation pathways that diminish serum stability, resulting in reduced or abolished bioactivity, or to restrict or increase conformational flexibility, it is common to substitute amide bonds within the backbone of the peptides with functionality that mimics the existing conformation or alters the conformation in the manner desired. Such modifications may produce increased binding affinity or improved pharmacokinetic behavior. It is understood that those knowledgeable in the art of peptide synthesis can make the following amide bond-changes for any amide bond connecting two amino acids with the expectation that the resulting peptides could have the same or improved activity: insertion of alpha-N-methylamides or peptide amide backbone thioamides, removal of the carbonyl to produce the cognate secondary amines, replacement of one amino acid with an aza-aminoacid to produce semicarbazone derivatives, and use of E-olefins and substituted E-olefins as amide bond surrogates.</p>
<heading id="h-0305" level="1">Introduction of D-Amino Acids</heading>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Another approach within the scope of the patent is the introduction of D-alanine, or another D-amino acid, distal or proximal to the labile peptide bond. In this case it is also understood to those skilled in the art that such D-amino acid substitutions can, and at times, must be made, with D-amino acids whose side chains are not conservative replacements for those of the L-amino acid being replaced. This is because of the difference in chirality and hence side-chain orientation, which may result in the accessing of a previously unexplored region of the binding site of the target that has moieties of different charge, hydrophobicity, steric requirements etc. than that serviced by the side chain of the replaced L-amino acid.</p>
<heading id="h-0306" level="1">Modifications to Improve Pharmacokinetic or Pharmacodynamic Properties</heading>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">It is also understood that use of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide in a particular application may necessitate modifications of the peptide or formulations of the peptide to improve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior. It is expected that the properties of the peptide may be changed by attachment of moieties anticipated to bring about the desired physical or chemical properties. Such moieties may be appended to the peptide using acids or amines, via amide bonds or urea bonds, respectively, to the N- or C-terminus of the peptide, or to the pendant amino group of a suitably located lysine or lysine derivative, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, ornithine, or other amino acid in the peptide that possesses a pendant amine group or a pendant alkoxyamine or hydrazine group. The moieties introduced may be groups that are hydrophilic, basic, or nonpolar alkyl or aromatic groups depending on the peptide of interest and the extant requirements for modification of its properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0307" level="1">Glycosylation of Amino Acid Residues</heading>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Yet another modification within the scope of the invention is to employ glycosylated amino acid residues (e.g., serine, threonine or asparagine residues), singly or in combination in the either the binding moiety (or moieties) or the linker moiety or both. Glycosylation, which may be carried out using standard conditions, can be used to enhance solubility, alter pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics or to enhance binding via a specific or non-specific interaction involving the glycosidic moiety. In another approach glycosylated amino acids such as O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl) serine or the analogous threonine derivative (either the D- or L-amino acids) can be incorporated into the peptide during manual or automated solid phase peptide synthesis, or in manual or automated solution phase peptide synthesis. Similarly D- or L-N<sup>&#x3b3;</sup>-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-&#x3b2;-D-glucopyranosyl)-asparagine can be employed. The use of amino acids glycosylated on a pendant oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur function by the agency of suitably functionalized and activated carbohydrate moieties that can be employed in glycosylation is anticipated. Such carbohydrate functions could be monosaccharides, disaccharides or even larger assemblies of oligosaccharides (Kihlberg, January (2000) Glycopeptide synthesis. In: Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis&#x2014;A Practical Approach (Chan, W. C. and White, P. D. Eds) Oxford University Press, New York, N.Y. Chap. 8, pp 195-213).</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Also anticipated is the appendage of carbohydrate functions to amino acids by means other than glycosylation via activation of a leaving group at the anomeric carbon. Linkage of the amino acid to the glycoside is not limited to the formation of a bond to the anomeric carbon of the carbohydrate function. Instead, linkage of the carbohydrate moiety to the amino acid could be through any suitable, sufficiently reactive oxygen atom, nitrogen atom, carbon atom or other pendant atom of the carbohydrate function via methods employed for formation of C-heteroatom, C&#x2014;C or heteroatom-heteroatom (examples are S&#x2014;S, O&#x2014;N, N&#x2014;N, P&#x2014;O, P&#x2014;N) bonds known in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0308" level="1">Formation of Salts</heading>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">It is also within the scope of the invention to form different salts that may increase the water solubility or the ease of formulation of these peptides. These may include, but are not restricted to, N-methylglucamine (meglumine), acetate, oxalates, ascorbates, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0309" level="1">Structural Modifications that Retain Structural Features</heading>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Yet another modification within the scope of the invention is truncation of cyclic polypeptides. The cyclic nature of many polypeptides of the invention limits the conformational space available to the peptide sequence, particularly within the cycle. Therefore truncation of the peptide by one or more residues distal or even proximal to the cycle, at either the N-terminal or C-terminal region may provide truncated peptides with similar or improved biological activity. A unique sequence of amino acids, even as small as three amino acids, which is responsible for the binding activity, may be identified, as noted for RGD peptides (see, e.g., Plow et al., <i>Blood, </i>70(1): 110-5 (1987); Oldberg et al., <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry, </i>263(36):19433-19436 (1988); Taub et al., <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry, </i>264(1):259-65 (1989); Andrieux et al., <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry, </i>264(16):9258-65 (1989); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,412 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,996, each of which is incorporated herein by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">It has also been shown in the literature that large peptide cycles can be substantially shortened, eliminating extraneous amino acids, but substantially including the critical binding residues. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,939, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">The shortened cyclic peptides can be formed using disulfide bonds or amide bonds of suitably located carboxylic acid groups and amino groups.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Furthermore, D-amino acids can be added to the peptide sequence to stabilize turn features (especially in the case of glycine). In another approach alpha, beta, gamma or delta dipeptide or turn mimics (such as &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;, or &#x3b4; turn mimics), some of which are shown in schematics 1, 2 and 3 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, can be employed to mimic structural motifs and turn features in a peptide and simultaneously provide stability from proteolysis and enhance other properties such as, for example, conformational stability and solubility (structure 1: Hart et al., <i>J.

<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Also within the scope of the invention is the substitution of disulfide mimetics for disulfide bonds within the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptides of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">When disulfide-containing peptides are employed in generating <sup>99m</sup>Tc-based radiopharmaceuticals, a significant problem is the presence of the disulfide bond. The integrity of the disulfide bond is difficult to maintain during procedures designed to incorporate <sup>99m</sup>Tc via routes that are reliant upon the reduction of pertechnetate ion and subsequent incorporation of the reduced Tc species into substances bearing Tc-specific chelating groups. This is because the disulfide bond is rather easily reduced by the reducing agents commonly used in kits devised for one-step preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. Therefore, the ease with which the disulfide bond can be reduced during Tc chelation may require substitution with mimetics of the disulfide bonds. Accordingly, another modification within the scope of the invention is to substitute the disulfide moiety with mimetics utilizing the methods disclosed herein or known to those skilled in the art, while retaining the activity and other desired properties of the KDR-binding polypeptides of the invention:</p>
<p id="h-0311" num="0000">1) Oxime Linker</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The oxime moiety has been employed as a linker by investigators in a number of contexts. Of the most interest is the work by Mutter et al. (Wahl and Mutter, <i>Tetrahedron Lett., </i>37:6861-6864 (1996)). The amino acids 4, containing an aminoalcohol function, and 5, containing an alkoxyamino function, are incorporated into the peptide chain, not necessarily at the end of the peptide chain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). After formation of the peptide the sidechain protecting groups are removed. The aldehyde group is unmasked and an oxime linkage is formed.</p>
<p id="h-0312" num="0000">2) Lanthionine Linker</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Lanthionines are cyclic sulfides, wherein the disulfide linkage (S&#x2014;S) is replaced by a carbon-sulfur (C&#x2014;S) linkage. Thus, the lability to reduction is far lower. Lanthionines have been prepared by a number of methods since 1971.</p>
<heading id="h-0313" level="1">Preparation of Lanthionines Using Bromoacetylated Peptides</heading>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Lanthionines are readily prepared using known methods. See, for example, Robey et al., <i>Anal. Biochem., </i>177:373-377 (1989); Inman et al., <i>Bioconjugate Chem., </i>2:458-463 (1991); Ploinsky et al., <i>Med. Chem., </i>35:4185-4194 (1992); Mayer et al., &#x201c;Peptides, Frontiers of Peptide Science&#x201d;, in Proceedings of the 15<sup>th </sup>American Peptide Symposium, Tam &#x26; Kaumaya (Eds.), Jun. 14-19, 1995, Nashville, Tenn. (Klumer Academic Pub., Boston), pp. 291-292; Wakao et al., Jpn. Kokai Tokyo Koho, JP 07300452 A2 (1995). Preparation of peptides using Boc automated peptide synthesis followed by coupling the peptide terminus with bromoacetic acid gives bromoacetylated peptides in good yield. Cleavage and deprotection of the peptides is accomplished using HF/anisole. If the peptide contains a cysteine group its reactivity can be controlled with low pH. If the pH of the medium is raised to 6-7 then either polymerization or cyclization of the peptide takes place. Polymerization is favored at high (100 mg/mL) concentration whereas cyclization is favored at lower concentrations (1 mg/mL), e.g., 6 cyclizes to 7 (Scheme 1; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Inman et al. demonstrated the use of N<sup>&#x3b1;</sup>-(Boc)-N<sup>&#x3b5;</sup>-[N-(bromoacetyl)-&#x3b2;-alanyl]-L-lysine as a carrier of the bromoacetyl group that could be employed in Boc peptide synthesis thus allowing placement of a bromoacetyl bearing moiety anywhere in a sequence. In preliminary experiments they found that peptides with 4-6 amino acids separating the bromoacetyl-lysine derivative from a cysteine tend to cyclize, indicating the potential utility of this strategy.</p>
<heading id="h-0314" level="1">Preparation of Lanthionines Via Cysteine Thiol Addition to Acrylamides</heading>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Several variants of this strategy may be implemented. Resin-bound serine can be employed to prepare the lanthionine ring on resin either using a bromination-dehydrobromination-thiol addition sequence or by dehydration with disuccinimidyl carbonate followed by thiol addition (Ploinsky et al., <i>M. J. Med. Chem., </i>35:4185-4194 (1992); Mayer et al., &#x201c;Peptides, Frontiers of Peptide Science&#x201d;, in Proceedings of the 15<sup>th </sup>American Peptide Symposium, Tam &#x26; Kaumaya (Eds.), Jun. 14-19, 1995, Nashville, Tenn. (Klumer Academic Pub., Boston), pp. 291-292). Conjugate addition of thiols to acrylamides has also been amply demonstrated and a reference to the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to acrylamide is provided (Wakao et al., Jpn. Kokai Tokyo Koho, JP 07300452 A2 (1995)).</p>
<p id="h-0315" num="0000">3) Diaryl Ether or Diarylamine Linkage: Diaryl Ether Linkage from Intramolecular Cyclization of Aryl Boronic Acids and Tyrosine</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Recently the reaction of arylboronic acids with phenols, amines and heterocyclic amines in the presence of cupric acetate, in air, at ambient temperature, in dichloromethane using either pyridine or triethylamine as a base to provide unsymmetrical diaryl ethers and the related amines in good yields (as high as 98%) has been reported. See, Evans et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett., </i>39:2937-2940 (1998); Chan et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett., </i>39:2933-2936 (1998); Lam et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett., </i>39:2941-2944 (1998). In the case of N-protected tyrosine derivatives as the phenol component the yields were also as high as 98%. This demonstrates that amino acid amides (peptides) are expected to be stable to the transformation and that yields are high. Precedent for an intramolecular reaction exists in view of the facile intramolecular cyclizations of peptides to lactams, intramolecular biaryl ether formation based on the S<sub>N</sub>Ar reaction and the generality of intramolecular cyclization reactions under high dilution conditions or on resin, wherein the pseudo-dilution effect mimics high dilution conditions.</p>
<p id="h-0316" num="0000">4) Formation of Cyclic Peptides with a Thiazolidine Linkage via Intramolecular Reaction of Peptide Aldehydes with Cysteine Moieties</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Another approach that may be employed involves intramolecular cyclization of suitably located vicinal amino mercaptan functions (usually derived from placement of a cysteine at a terminus of the linear sequence or tethered to the sequence via a side-chain nitrogen of a lysine, for example) and aldehyde functions to provide thiazolidines that result in the formation of a bicyclic peptide, one ring of which is that formed by the residues in the main chain, and the second ring being the thiazolidine ring. Scheme 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) provides an example. The required aldehyde function can be generated by sodium metaperiodate cleavage of a suitably located vicinal aminoalcohol function, which can be present as an unprotected serine tethered to the chain by appendage to a side chain amino group of a lysine moiety. In some cases the required aldehyde function is generated by unmasking of a protected aldehyde derivative at the C-terminus or the N-terminus of the chain. An example of this strategy is found in: Botti et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>118:10018-10034 (1996).</p>
<p id="h-0317" num="0000">5) Lactams Based on Intramolecular Cyclization of Pendant Amino Groups with Carboxyl Groups on Resin.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Macrocyclic peptides have been prepared by lactam formation by either head to tail or by pendant group cyclization. The basic strategy is to prepare a fully protected peptide wherein it is possible to remove selectively an amine protecting group and a carboxy protecting group. Orthogonal protecting schemes have been developed. Of those that have been developed the allyl, trityl and Dde methods have been employed most. See, Mellor et al., &#x201c;Synthesis of Modified Peptides&#x201d;, in Fmoc Solid Phase Synthesis: A Practical Approach, White and Chan (eds) (Oxford University Press, New York, 2000), Chapt. 6, pp. 169-178. The Dde approach is of interest because it utilizes similar protecting groups for both the carboxylic acid function (Dmab ester) and the amino group (Dde group). Both are removed with 2-10% hydrazine in DMF at ambient temperature. Alternatively, the Dde can be used for the amino group and the allyl group can be used for the carboxyl.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">A lactam function, available by intramolecular coupling via standard peptide coupling reagents (such as HATU, PyBOP etc), could act as a surrogate for the disulfide bond. The Dde/Dmab approach is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Thus, a linear sequence containing, for example, the Dde-protected lysine and Dmab ester can be prepared on a Tentagel-based Rink amide resin at low load (&#x2dc;0.1-0.2 mmol/g). Deprotection of both functions with hydrazine is then followed by on-resin cyclization to give the desired products.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">In the allyl approach, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the pendant carboxyl that is to undergo cyclization is protected as an allyl ester and the pendant amino group is protected as an alloc group. On resin, both are selectively unmasked by treatment with palladium tris-triphenylphosphine in the presence of N-methylmorpholine and acetic acid in DMF. Residual palladium salts are removed using sodium diethyldithiocarbamate in the presence of DIEA in DMF, followed by subsequent washings with DMF. The lactam ring is then formed employing HATU/HOAt in the presence of N-methylmorpholine. Other coupling agents can be employed as described above. The processing of the peptide is then carried out as described above to provide the desired peptide lactam.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Subsequently cleavage from resin and purification can also be carried out. For functionalization of the N-terminus of the peptide, it is understood that amino acids, such as trans-4-(iV-Dde)methylaminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, trans-4-(iV-Dde)methylaminobenzoic acid, or their alloc congeners can be employed. Yet another approach is to employ the safety catch method to intramolecular lactam formation during cleavage from the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Thus, a linear sequence containing, for example, the Dde-protected lysine and Dmab ester may be prepared on a Tentagel-based Rink amide resin at low load (&#x2dc;0.1-0.2 mmol/g). Deprotection of both functions with hydrazine is then followed by on-resin cyclization to give the desired products. Subsequently cleavage from resin and purification may also be carried out. For functionalization of the N-terminus of the peptide it is understood that diamino acids such as trans-4-(iv-Dde)methylaminocyclohexane carboxylic acid or trans-4-(iv-Dde)methylamino benzoic acid would be required. An alternative scenario is to employ the safety catch method to intramolecular lactam formation during cleavage from the resin.</p>
<p id="h-0318" num="0000">6) Cyclic Peptides Based on Olefin Metathesis</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The Grubbs reaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) involves the metathesis/cyclization of olefin bonds and is illustrated as shown below. See, Schuster et al., <i>Angewandte. Chem. Int. Edn Engl., </i>36:2036-2056 (1997); Miller et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>118:9606-9614 (1996).</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">It is readily seen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) that if the starting material is a diolefin (16) that the resulting product will be cyclic compound 17. The reaction has in fact been applied to creation of cycles from olefin-functionalized peptides. See, e.g., Pernerstorfer et al., <i>Chem. Commun., </i>20:1949-50 (1997); see, also, Covalent capture and stabilization of cylindrical &#x3b2;-sheet peptide assemblies, Clark et al., <i>Chem. Eur. J., </i>5(2):782-792 (1999); Highly efficient synthesis of covalently cross-linked peptide helices by ring-closing metathesis, Blackwell et al., <i>Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., </i>37(23):3281-3284 (1998); Synthesis of novel cyclic protease inhibitors using Grubbs olefin metathesis, Ripka et al., <i>Med. Chem. Lett., </i>8(4):357-360 (1998); Application of Ring-Closing Metathesis to the Synthesis of Rigidified Amino Acids and Peptides, Miller et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>118(40):9606-9614 (1996); Supramolecular Design by Covalent Capture, Design of a Peptide Cylinder via Hydrogen-Bond-Promoted Intermolecular Olefin Metathesis, Clark et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>117(49):12364-12365 (1995); Synthesis of Conformationally Restricted Amino Acids and Peptides Employing Olefin Metathesis, Miller et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>117(21):5855-5856 (1995). One can prepare either C-allylated amino acids or possibly N-allylated amino acids and employ them in this reaction in order to prepare carba-bridged cyclic peptides as surrogates for disulfide bond containing peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">One may also prepare novel compounds with olefinic groups. Functionalization of the tyrosine hydroxyl with an olefin-containing tether is one option. The lysine &#x3b5;-amino group is another option with appendage of the olefin-containing unit as part of an acylating moiety, for example. If instead the lysine side chain amino group is alkylated with an olefin containing tether, it can still function as a point of attachment for a reporter as well. The use of 5-pentenoic acid as an acylating agent for the lysine, ornithine, or diaminopropionic side chain amino groups is another possibility. The length of the olefin-containing tether can also be varied in order to explore structure activity relationships.</p>
<heading id="h-0319" level="1">Manipulation of Peptide Sequences</heading>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Other modifications within the scope of the invention include common manipulations of peptide sequences, which can be expected to yield peptides with similar or improved biological properties. These include amino acid translocations (swapping amino acids in the sequence), use of retroinverso peptides in place of the original sequence or a modified original sequence, peptoids and retro-inverso peptoid sequences. Structures wherein specific residues are peptoid instead of peptidic, which result in hybrid molecules, neither completely peptidic nor completely peptoid, are anticipated as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0320" level="1">Linkers</heading>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Additional modifications within the scope of the invention include introduction of linkers or spacers between the targeting sequence of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide and the detectable label or therapeutic agent. Use of such linkers/spacers may improve the relevant properties of the binding peptide (e.g., increase serum stability, etc.). These linkers may include, but are not restricted to, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl chains, polyethylene glycol derivatives, amino acid spacers, sugars, or aliphatic or aromatic spacers common in the art. Furthermore, linkers that are combinations of the moieties described above, can also be employed to confer special advantage to the properties of the peptide. Lipid molecules with linkers may be attached to allow formulation of ultrasound bubbles, liposomes or other aggregation based constructs. Such constructs could be employed as agents for targeting and delivery of a diagnostic reporter, a therapeutic agent (e.g., a chemical &#x201c;warhead&#x201d; for therapy) or a combination of these.</p>
<heading id="h-0321" level="1">Multimeric Constructs of KDR and VEGF/KDR Complex Binding Polypeptides</heading>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Constructs employing dimers, multimers or polymers of one or more VEGF or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides of the invention are also contemplated. Indeed, there is ample literature evidence that the binding of low potency peptides or small molecules can be substantially increased by the formation of dimers and multimers. Thus, dimeric and multimeric constructs (both homogeneous and heterogeneous) are within the scope of the instant invention. Indeed, as discussed in more detail in the Examples, it is within the scope of the present invention to include multiple KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide sequences in a dimeric or multimeric construct. Moreover, as shown in Example 4 infra, these constructs can exhibit improved binding compared to a monomeric construct. The polypeptide sequences in the dimeric constructs may be attached at their N- or C-terminus or the N-epsilon nitrogen of a suitably placed lysine moiety (or another function bearing a selectively derivatizable group such as a pendant oxyamino or other nucleophilic group), or may be joined together via one or more linkers employing the appropriate attachment chemistry. This coupling chemistry may include amide, urea, thiourea, oxime, or aminoacetylamide (from chloro- or bromoacetamide derivatives, but is not so limited. For example, any of the following methods may be utilized to prepare dimeric or multimeric constructs of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides of the invention. Modified polypeptides and peptide-derived molecules are shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 79A-79G</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0322" num="0000">Method A</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Fully protected KDR-binding peptides can be built up on Ellman-type safety catch resin using automated or manual Fmoc peptide synthesis protocols. Backes et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>118(12):3055-56 (1996). Separately, using standard methods known in the art of peptide synthesis, a di-lysine derivative can be constructed on 2-chlorotrityl resin. See, for example, Fields et al, &#x201c;Principles and Practice of Solid Phase Synthesis&#x201d; in <i>Synthetic Peptides, A Users Guide</i>, Grant, Ed. (W.H. Freeman Co., New York, 1992), Chapt. 3, pp. 77-183; Barlos et al., &#x201c;Convergent Peptide Synthesis&#x201d; in <i>Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis</i>, Chan, W. C. and White, P. D., Eds. (Oxford University Press, New York, 2000), Chapt. 9, pp. 215-228. Liberation of this from the 2-chlorotrityl resin without removal of the side-chain protecting groups, activation of the carboxyl group and coupling to any amine-functionalized labeling group provides a di-lysine derivative whose protected pendant nitrogen atoms may be unmasked to give two free amino groups. The prior-mentioned safety-catch resin is activated and the desired N-deprotected labeling group-functionalized di-lysine derivative is added to the activated safety-catch resin. The pendant amino groups are acylated by the carboxy-terminus of the safety-catch resin-bound peptide, which is now detached from the resin and an integral part of the di-lysine structure. An excess of the safety-catch resin-bound peptide can be employed to insure complete reaction of the amino groups of the di-lysine construct. Optimization of the ratio of the reacting partners in this scheme optimizes the yield. The protecting groups on the KDR-binding peptides are removed employing trifluoroacetic acid based cleavage protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The synthesis of dimeric and multimeric constructs wherein two or more KDR-binding peptides are present in one construct is easily accomplished. Orthogonal protection schemes (such as an allyloxycarbonyl group on one nitrogen and an Fmoc group on the other, or employing the Fmoc group in conjunction with the iV-Dde protecting group on the other, for example) can be employed to distinguish the pendant nitrogen atoms of the di-lysine derivatives described above. Unmasking of one of the amino groups, followed by reaction of the resulting product with an activated safety-catch resin-bound KDR-binding peptide as described above, provides a di-lysine construct having a single KDR-binding peptide attached. Removal of the second protecting group unmasks the remaining nitrogen. See, also, Mellor et al., &#x201c;Synthesis of Modified Peptides&#x201d; in <i>Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis</i>, Chan, W. C. and White, P. D., Eds. (Oxford University Press, New York, 2000), Chapt. 6, pp. 169-176. The resulting product may be reacted with a second safety-catch resin bearing another KDR-binding peptide to provide a fully-protected homodimeric construct, which after removal of protecting groups with trifluoroacetic acid, provides the desired material.</p>
<p id="h-0323" num="0000">Method B</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">A KDR-binding peptide is assembled on a Rink-amide resin by automated or manual peptide coupling methods, usually employing Fmoc peptide synthesis protocols. The peptide may possess a C-terminus or N-terminus functionalized with a linker or a linker-labeling group construct that may possess an additional nucleophilic group such as the &#x3b5;-amino group of a lysine moiety, for example. Cleavage of the protecting groups is accomplished employing trifluoroacetic acid with appropriate modifiers depending on the nature of the peptide. The fully deprotected peptide is then reacted with a large excess of a bifunctional electrophile such as the commercially available glutaric acid bis-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Tyger Scientific, Inc.). The resulting monoamidated, mono-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester of glutaric acid is then treated with an additional equivalent of the same peptide, or an equivalent of a different KDR-binding peptide. Purification of the resulting material by HPLC affords the desired homodimeric construct bearing a suitable labeling group.</p>
<p id="h-0324" num="0000">Method C</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">A modular scheme can be employed to prepare dimeric or higher multimeric constructs bearing suitable labeling groups as defined above. In a simple illustration, fmoc-lysine(iV-Dde) Rink amide resin is treated with piperidine to remove the fmoc moiety. Then a labeling function, such as biotin, 5-carboxyfluorescein or N,N-Dimethyl-Gly-Ser(O-t-Bu)-Cys(Acm)-Gly-OH is coupled to the nitrogen atom. The resin is next treated with hydrazine to remove the iV-Dde group. After thorough washing, the resin is treated with cyanuric chloride and a hindered base such as diisopropylethylamine in a suitable solvent such as DMF, NMP or dichloromethane to provide a monofunctionalized dichlorotriazine bound to the resin. Subsequent successive displacement of the remaining chlorine atoms by two equivalents of a KDR-binding peptide provides a resin-bound homo-dimeric labeling group-functionalized construct. Falorni et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett., </i>39(41):7607-7610 (1998); Johnson et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett., </i>54(16):4097-4106 (1998); Stankova et al., <i>Mol. Diversity, </i>2(1/2):75-80 (1996). The incoming peptides may be protected or unprotected as the situation warrants. Cleavage of protecting groups is accomplished employing trifluoroacetic acid-based deprotection reagents as described above, and the desired materials are purified by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">It is understood that in each of these methods lysine derivatives may be serially employed to increase the multiplicity of the multimers. The use of related, more rigid molecules bearing the requisite number of masked, or orthogonally protected nitrogen atoms to act as scaffolds to vary the distance between the KDR-binding peptides, to increase the rigidity of the construct (by constraining the motion and relative positions of the KDR-binding peptides relative to each other and the reporter) is entirely within the scope of methods A-C and all other methods described herein. The references cited above are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<p id="h-0325" num="0000">Uses for KDR or VEGF/KDR Complex Binding Polypeptides:</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties according to this invention will be extremely useful for detection and/or imaging of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in vitro or in vivo, and particularly for detection and/or imaging of sites of angiogenesis, in which VEGF and KDR are intimately involved, as explained above. Any suitable method of assaying or imaging KDR or VEGF/KDR complex may be employed. The KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties of the invention also have utility in the treatment of a variety of disease states, including those associated with angiogenesis or those associated with a number of pathogens. The KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties of the invention may themselves be used as therapeutics or may be used to localize one or more therapeutic agents (e.g., a chemotherapeutic, a radiotherapeutic, genetic material, etc.) to KDR expressing cells, including sites of angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="h-0326" num="0000">In Vitro:</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">For detection of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in solution, a binding polypeptide according to the invention can be detectably labeled, e.g., fluorescently labeled, enzymatically labeled, or labeled with a radioactive or paramagnetic metal, then contacted with the solution, and thereafter formation of a complex between the binding polypeptide and the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex target can be detected. As an example, a fluorescently labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide may be used for in vitro KDR or VEGF/KDR complex detection assays, wherein the peptide is added to a solution to be tested for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex under conditions allowing binding to occur. The complex between the fluorescently labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide and KDR or VEGF/KDR complex target can be detected and quantified by measuring the increased fluorescence polarization arising from the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex-bound peptide relative to that of the free peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Alternatively, a sandwich-type &#x201c;ELISA&#x201d; assay may be used, wherein a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide is immobilized on a solid support such as a plastic tube or well, then the solution suspected of containing KDR or VEGF/KDR complex target is contacted with the immobilized binding moiety, non-binding materials are washed away, and complexed polypeptide is detected using a suitable detection reagent, such as a monoclonal antibody recognizing KDR or VEGF/KDR complex. The monoclonal antibody is detectable by conventional means known in the art, including being detectably labeled, e.g., radiolabeled, conjugated with an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase and the like, or fluorescently labeled, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">For detection or purification of soluble KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in or from a solution, binding polypeptides of the invention can be immobilized on a solid substrate such as a chromatographic support or other matrix material, then the immobilized binder can be loaded or contacted with the solution under conditions suitable for formation of a binding polypeptide: KDR complex or binding polypeptide:VEGF/KDR complex. The non-binding portion of the solution can be removed and the complex may be detected, e.g., using an anti-KDR or anti-VEGF/KDR complex antibody, or an anti-binding polypeptide antibody, or the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex target may be released from the binding moiety at appropriate elution conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">The biology of angiogenesis and the roles of VEGF and KDR in initiating and maintaining it have been investigated by many researchers and continues to be an active field for research and development. In furtherance of such research and development, a method of purifying bulk amounts of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in pure form is desirable, and the binding polypeptides according to this invention are especially useful for that purpose, using the general purification methodology described above.</p>

<heading id="h-0328" level="1">Diagnostic Imaging</heading>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">A particularly preferred use for the polypeptides according to the present invention is for creating visually readable images of KDR expressing tissue, such as, for example, neoplastic tumors, which require angiogenesis for survival and metastasis, or other sites of angiogenic activity. The KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides disclosed herein may be converted to imaging reagents by conjugating the polypeptides with a label appropriate for diagnostic detection, optionally via a linker. Preferably, a peptide exhibiting much greater specificity for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex than for other serum proteins is conjugated or linked to a label appropriate for the detection methodology to be employed. For example, the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide may be conjugated with or without a linker to a paramagnetic chelate suitable for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with a radiolabel suitable for x-ray, PET or scintigrapic imaging (including a chelator for a radioactive metal), with an ultrasound contrast agent (e.g., a stabilized microbubble, a ultrasound contrast agent, a microsphere or what has been referred to as a gas filled &#x201c;liposome&#x201d;) suitable for ultrasound detection, or with an optical imaging dye.</p>

<p id="p-0321" num="0320">In general, the technique of using a detectably labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety is based on the premise that the label generates a signal that is detectable outside the patient's body. For example, when the detectably labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety is administered to the patient in which it is desirable to detect, e.g., angiogenesis, the high affinity of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex causes the binding moiety to bind to the site of angiogenesis and accumulate label at the site of angiogenesis. Sufficient time is allowed for the labeled binding moiety to localize at the site of angiogenesis. The signal generated by the labeled peptide is detected by a scanning device that will vary according to the type of label used, and the signal is then converted to an image of the site of angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In another embodiment, rather than directly labeling a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide with a detectable label or radiotherapeutic construct, the peptide(s) of the invention can be conjugated with, for example, avidin, biotin, or an antibody or antibody fragment that will bind the detectable label or radiotherapeutic. For example, one or more KDR-binding peptides can be conjugated to streptavidin (potentially generating multivalent binding) for in vivo binding to KDR-expressing cells. After the unbound targeting construct has cleared from the body, a biotinylated detectable label or radiotherapeutic construct (e.g., a chelate molecule complexed with a radioactive metal) can be infused and will rapidly concentrate at the site where the targeting construct is bound. This approach in some situations can reduce the time required after administering the detectable label until imaging can take place. It can also increase signal to noise ratio in the target site, and decrease the dose of the detectable label or radiotherapeutic construct required. This is particularly useful when a radioactive label or radiotherapeutic is used as the dose of radiation that is delivered to normal but radiation-sensitive sites in the body, such as bone-marrow, kidneys, and liver is decreased. This approach, sometimes referred to as pre-targeting or two-step, or three-step approaches was reviewed by S. F. Rosebrough in <i>Q. J. Nucl. Med., </i>40:234-251 (1996), which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">The present invention also includes methods for detecting, monitoring and/or evaluating therapeutic responses by imaging following administration of one or more KDR binding moieties described herein conjugated to a detectable label. Such methods are especially useful for monitoring the therapeutic response of disorders related to angiogenesis and/or hyperproliferative diseases, especially diseases associated with endothelial cell hyperproliferation, such as cancer, particularly prostate cancer, mammary cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, renal cancer, bone cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, uterine cancer and testicular cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Such methods may include the steps of (a) administering a contrast agent comprising one or more KDR-binding moieties conjugated to a detectable label to a subject with cancer or another disease related to angiogenesis or cell (particularly endothelial cell) hyperproliferation; (b) obtaining an initial image of the disease; (c) administering a therapeutic agent appropriate for the treatment of the disease; (d) obtaining a subsequent image of the hyperproliferative disease; and (e) comparing the initial and the subsequent images to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">In certain embodiments the subject is a mammal. In certain embodiments the subject is a human, and the disease is cancer. The therapeutic agent is an agent appropriate to treat a disorder associated with angiogesis or cell hyperproliferation. In one embodiment the therapeutic agent is an anti-cancer agent. Such agents are known to those skilled in the art and are discussed infra. In another embodiment, the anti-cancer treatment may include treatment of the patient with radiotherapy, RF ablation or focused ultrasound.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">The therapeutic response may be any type of therapeutic response known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic response is reduction in tumor size and/or vascularity. Thus, the present invention provides medical personnel with the ability to adjust treatment strategies based on the adequacy of the therapeutic response. If the therapeutic response is insufficient, a different therapeutic agent or a higher dose of the same therapeutic agent may be warranted.</p>
<p id="h-0329" num="0000">A. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties of the present invention can advantageously be conjugated with one or more paramagnetic metal chelates in order to form a contrast agent for use in MRI. Preferred paramagnetic metal ions have atomic numbers 21-29, 42, 44, or 57-83. This includes ions of the transition metal or lanthanide series that have one, and more preferably five or more, unpaired electrons and a magnetic moment of at least 1.7 Bohr magneton. Preferred paramagnetic metals include, but are not limited to, chromium (III), manganese (II), manganese (III), iron (II), iron (III), cobalt (II), nickel (II), copper (II), praseodymium (III), neodymium (III), samarium (III), gadolinium (III), terbium (III), dysprosium (III), holmium (III), erbium (III), europium (III) and ytterbium (III), chromium (III), iron (III), and gadolinium (III). The trivalent cation, Gd<sup>3+</sup>, is particularly preferred for MRI contrast agents, due to its high relaxivity and low toxicity, with the further advantage that it exists in only one biologically accessible oxidation state, which minimizes undesired metabolysis of the metal by a patient. Another useful metal is Cr<sup>3+</sup>, which is relatively inexpensive. Gd(III) chelates have been used for clinical and radiologic MR applications since 1988, and approximately 30% of MR exams currently employ a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Additionally, heteromultimers of the present invention also can be conjugated with one or more superparamagnetic particles.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">The practitioner will select a metal according to dose required to detect angiogenesis and considering other factors such as toxicity of the metal to the subject (Tweedle et al., <i>Magnetic Resonance Imaging </i>(2<i>nd ed</i>.), vol. 1, Partain et al., Eds. (W.B. Saunders Co. 1988), pp. 796-797). Generally, the desired dose for an individual metal will be proportional to its relaxivity, modified by the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the metal.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">The paramagnetic metal chelator(s) is a molecule having one or more polar groups that act as a ligand for, and complex with, a paramagnetic metal. Suitable chelators are known in the art and include acids with methylene phosphonic acid groups, methylene carbohydroxamine acid groups, carboxyethylidene groups, or carboxymethylene groups. Examples of chelators include, but are not limited to, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-tetradecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 1-substituted 1,4,7-tricarboxymethyl-1,4,7,10-teraazacyclododecane (DO3A), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid (TETA). Additional chelating ligands are ethylene bis-(2-hydroxy-phenylglycine) (EHPG), and derivatives thereof, including 5-Cl-EHPG, 5Br-EHPG, 5-Me-EHPG, 5t-Bu-EHPG, and 5sec-Bu-EHPG; benzodiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (benzo-DTPA) and derivatives thereof, including dibenzo-DTPA, phenyl-DTPA, diphenyl-DTPA, benzyl-DTPA, and dibenzyl DTPA; bis-2(hydroxybenzyl)-ethylene-diaminediacetic acid (HBED) and derivatives thereof; the class of macrocyclic compounds, which contain at least 3 carbon atoms, more preferably at least 6, and at least two heteroatoms (O and/or N), which macrocyclic compounds can consist of one ring, or two or three rings joined together at the hetero ring elements, e.g., benzo-DOTA, dibenzo-DOTA, and benzo-NOTA, where NOTA is 1,4,7-triazacyclononane N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2033;-triacetic acid, benzo-TETA, benzo-DOTMA, where DOTMA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,7,10-tetra(methyl tetraacetic acid), and benzo-TETMA, where TETMA is 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,8,11-(methyl tetraacetic acid); derivatives of 1,3-propylene-diaminetetraacetic acid (PDTA) and triethylenetetraaminehexaacetic acid (TTHA); derivatives of 1,5,10-N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2033;-tris(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-tricatecholate (LICAM); and 1,3,5-N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2033;-tris(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl) aminomethylbenzene (MECAM). A preferred chelator for use in the present invention is DTPA, and the use of DO3A is particularly preferred. Examples of representative chelators and chelating groups contemplated by the present invention are described in WO 98/18496, WO 86/06605, WO 91/03200, WO 95/28179, WO 96/23526, WO 97/36619, PCT/US98/01473, PCT/US98/20182, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,899,755, U.S. Pat. No. 5,474,756, U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,519 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,274, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">In accordance with the present invention, the chelator of the MRI contrast agent is coupled to the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide. The positioning of the chelate(s) should be selected so as not to interfere with the binding affinity or specificity of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide. Preferably, the chelate(s) will be appended either to the N-terminus or the C-terminus, however the chelate(s) may also be attached anywhere within the sequence. In preferred embodiments, a chelator having a free central carboxylic acid group (e.g., DTPA-Asp(&#x3b2;-COOH)&#x2014;)OtBu) makes it easy to attach at the N-terminus of the peptide by formation of an amide bond. The chelate(s) can also be attached at the C-terminus with the aid of a linker. Alternatively, isothiocyanate conjugation chemistry can be employed as a way of linking the appropriate isothiocyanate group bearing DTPA to a free amino group anywhere within the peptide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">In general, the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety can be bound directly or covalently to the metal chelator (or other detectable label), or it may be coupled or conjugated to the metal chelator using a linker, which may be, without limitation, amide, urea, acetal, ketal, double ester, carbonyl, carbamate, thiourea, sulfone, thioester, ester, ether, disulfide, lactone, imine, phosphoryl, or phosphodiester linkages; substituted or unsubstituted saturated or unsaturated alkyl chains; linear, branched, or cyclic amino acid chains of a single amino acid or different amino acids (e.g., extensions of the N- or C-terminus of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety); derivatized or underivatized polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, or polyvinylpyridine chains; substituted or unsubstituted polyamide chains; derivatized or underivatized polyamine, polyester, polyethylenimine, polyacrylate, poly(vinyl alcohol), polyglycerol, or oligosaccharide (e.g., dextran) chains; alternating block copolymers; malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic and pimelic acids; caproic acid; simple diamines and dialcohols; any of the other linkers disclosed herein; or any other simple polymeric linkers known in the art (see, e.g., WO 98/18497, WO 98/18496). Preferably the molecular weight of the linker can be tightly controlled. The molecular weights can range in size from less than 100 to greater than 1000. Preferably the molecular weight of the linker is less than 100. In addition, it may be desirable to utilize a linker that is biodegradable in vivo to provide efficient routes of excretion for the imaging reagents of the present invention. Depending on their location within the linker, such biodegradable functionalities can include ester, double ester, amide, phosphoester, ether, acetal, and ketal functionalities.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">In general, known methods can be used to couple the metal chelate(s) and the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety using linkers. See, e.g., WO 95/28967, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18497 and discussion therein. The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety can be linked through its N- or C-terminus via an amide bond, for example, to a metal coordinating backbone nitrogen of a metal chelate or to an acetate arm of the metal chelate itself. The present invention contemplates linking of the chelate on any position, provided the metal chelate retains the ability to bind the metal tightly in order to minimize toxicity. Similarly, the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety may be modified or elongated in order to generate a locus for attachment to a metal chelate, provided such modification or elongation does not eliminate its ability to bind KDR or VEGF/KDR complex.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">MRI contrast reagents prepared according to the disclosures herein may be used in the same manner as conventional MRI contrast reagents. When imaging a site of angiogenesis, certain MR techniques and pulse sequences may be preferred to enhance the contrast of the site to the background blood and tissues. These techniques include (but are not limited to), for example, black blood angiography sequences that seek to make blood dark, such as fast spin echo sequences (see, e.g., Alexander et al., <i>Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, </i>40(2): 298-310 (1998)) and flow-spoiled gradient echo sequences (see, e.g., Edelman et al., <i>Radiology, </i>177(1): 45-50 (1990)). These methods also include flow independent techniques that enhance the difference in contrast, such as inversion-recovery prepared or saturation-recovery prepared sequences that will increase the contrast between angiogenic tumor and background tissues. Finally, magnetization transfer preparations may also improve contrast with these agents (see, e.g., Goodrich et al., <i>Investigative Radiology, </i>31(6): 323-32 (1996)).</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">The labeled reagent is administered to the patient in the form of an injectable composition. The method of administering the MRI contrast agent is preferably parenterally, meaning intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, interstitially, or intracavitarilly. For imaging active angiogenesis, intravenous or intraarterial administration is preferred. For MRI, it is contemplated that the subject will receive a dosage of contrast agent sufficient to enhance the MR signal at the site of angiogenesis at least 10%. After injection with the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety-containing MRI reagent, the patient is scanned in the MRI machine to determine the location of any sites of angiogenesis. In therapeutic settings, upon angiogenesis (e.g., tumor) localization, a tumorcidal agent or anti-angiogenic agent (e.g., inhibitors of VEGF) can be immediately administered, if necessary, and the patient can be subsequently scanned to visualize tumor regression or arrest of angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="h-0330" num="0000">B. Ultrasound Imaging</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">When ultrasound is transmitted through a substance, the acoustic properties of the substance will depend upon the velocity of the transmissions and the density of the substance. Changes in the acoustic properties will be most prominent at the interface of different substances (solids, liquids, gases). Ultrasound contrast agents are intense sound wave reflectors because of the acoustic differences between the agent and the surrounding tissue. Gas containing or gas generating ultrasound contrast agents are particularly useful because of the acoustic difference between liquid (e.g., blood) and the gas-containing or gas generating ultrasound contrast agent. Because of their size, ultrasound contrast agents comprising microbubbles, ultrasound contrast agents, and the like may remain for a longer time in the blood stream after injection than other detectable moieties; a targeted KDR or VEGF/KDR complex-specific ultrasound agent therefore may demonstrate superior imaging of sites of angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">In this aspect of the invention, the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety may be linked to a material that is useful for ultrasound imaging. For example, the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides may be linked to materials employed to form vesicles (e.g., microbubbles, ultrasound contrast agents, microspheres, etc.), or emulsions containing a liquid or gas that functions as the detectable label (e.g., an echogenic gas or material capable of generating an echogenic gas). Materials for the preparation of such vesicles include surfactants, lipids, sphingolipids, oligolipids, phospholipids, proteins, polypeptides, carbohydrates, and synthetic or natural polymeric materials. See, e.g., WO 98/53857, WO 98/18498, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18497, WO 98/18496, and WO 98/18501, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>

<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Examples of suitable phospholipids include esters of glycerol with one or two molecules of fatty acids (the same or different) and phosphoric acid, wherein the phosphoric acid residue is in turn bonded to a hydrophilic group, such as choline, serine, inositol, glycerol, ethanolamine, and the like groups. Fatty acids present in the phospholipids are in general long chain aliphatic acids, typically containing from 12 to 24 carbon atoms, preferably from 14 to 22, that may be saturated or may contain one or more unsaturations. Examples of suitable fatty acids are lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid.

<p id="p-0343" num="0342">The preferred microbubble suspensions of the present invention may be prepared from phospholipids using known processes such as a freeze-drying or spray-drying solutions of the crude phospholipids in a suitable solvent or using the processes set forth in EP 554213; U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,774; U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,292; EP 744962; EP 682530; U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,610; U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,518; U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,725; EP 474833; U.S. Pat. No. 5,271,928; U.S. Pat.

No. 5,908,610, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Most preferably, the phospholipids are dissolved in an organic solvent and the solution is dried without going through a liposome formation stage. This can be done by dissolving the phospholipids in a suitable organic solvent together with a hydrophilic stabilizer substance or a compound soluble both in the organic solvent and water and freeze-drying or spray-drying the solution. In this embodiment the criteria used for selection of the hydrophilic stabilizer is its solubility in the organic solvent of choice. Examples of hydrophilic stabilizer compounds soluble in water and the organic solvent are, e.g., a polymer, like polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), etc., malic acid, glycolic acid, maltol, and the like. Such hydrophilic compounds also aid in homogenizing the microbubbles size distribution and enhance stability under storage. Any suitable organic solvent may be used as long as its boiling point is sufficiently low and its melting point is sufficiently high to facilitate subsequent drying. Typical organic solvents include, for example, dioxane, cyclohexanol, tertiary butanol, tetrachlorodifluoro ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) or 2-methyl-2-butanol. 2-methyl-2-butanol and C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>F<sub>2 </sub>are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Prior to formation of the suspension of microbubbles by dispersion in an aqueous carrier, the freeze dried or spray dried phospholipid powders are contacted with air or another gas. When contacted with the aqueous carrier the powdered phospholipids whose structure has been disrupted will form lamellarized or laminarized segments that will stabilize the microbubbles of the gas dispersed therein. This method permits production of suspensions of microbubbles that are stable even when stored for prolonged periods and are obtained by simple dissolution of the dried laminarized phospholipids (which have been stored under a desired gas) without shaking or any violent agitation.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">Alternatively, microbubbles can be prepared by suspending a gas into an aqueous solution at high agitation speed, as disclosed e.g. in WO 97/29783. A further process for preparing microbubbles is disclosed in co-pending European patent application no. 03002373, herein incorporated by reference, which comprises preparing an emulsion of an organic solvent in an aqueous medium in the presence of a phospholipid and subsequently lyophilizing said emulsion, after optional washing and/or filtration steps.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">Additives known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be included in the suspensions of stabilized microbubbles. For instance, non-film forming surfactants, including polyoxypropylene glycol and polyoxyethylene glycol and similar compounds, as well as various copolymers thereof; fatty acids such as myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid or their derivatives, ergosterol, phytosterol, sitosterol, lanosterol, tocopherol, propyl gallate, ascorbyl palmitate and butylated hydroxytoluene may be added. The amount of these non-film forming surfactants is usually up to 50% by weight of the total amount of surfactants but preferably between 0 and 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Other gas containing suspensions include those disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,091, WO 97/29783, also EP 881 915, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These agents may be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,091 or WO97/29783.</p>

Preferred lipids are di- or tri-glycerides, e.g., di- or tri-myristin, -palmityn or -stearin, in particular tripalmitin or tristearin. The microballoons may employ any of the gases disclosed herein of known to the skilled artisan; however, inert gases such as fluorinated gases are preferred. The microballoons may be suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier with optional additives known to those of ordinary skill in the art and stabilizers.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Other gas-containing contrast agent formulations include microparticles (especially aggregates of microparticles) having gas contained therein or otherwise associated therewith (for example being adsorbed on the surface thereof and/or contained within voids, cavities or pores therein).

<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Any of these ultrasound compositions should also be, as far as possible, isotonic with blood. Hence, before injection, small amounts of isotonic agents may be added to any of above ultrasound contrast agent suspensions. The isotonic agents are physiological solutions commonly used in medicine and they comprise aqueous saline solution (0.9% NaCl), 2.6% glycerol solution, 5% dextrose solution, etc. Additionally, the ultrasound compositions may include standard pharmaceutically acceptable additives, including, for example, emulsifying agents, viscosity modifiers, cryoprotectants, lyoprotectants, bulking agents etc.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Any biocompatible gas may be used in the ultrasound contrast agents useful in the invention. The term &#x201c;gas&#x201d; as used herein includes any substances (including mixtures) substantially in gaseous form at the normal human body temperature. The gas may thus include, for example, air, nitrogen, oxygen, CO<sub>2</sub>, argon, xenon or krypton, fluorinated gases (including for example, perfluorocarbons, SF<sub>6</sub>, SeF<sub>6</sub>) a low molecular weight hydrocarbon (e.g., containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms), for example, an alkane such as methane, ethane, a propane, a butane or a pentane, a cycloalkane such as cyclopropane, cyclobutane or cyclopentene, an alkene such as ethylene, propene, propadiene or a butene, or an alkyne such as acetylene or propyne and/or mixtures thereof. However, fluorinated gases are preferred. Fluorinated gases include materials that contain at least one fluorine atom such as SF<sub>6</sub>, freons (organic compounds containing one or more carbon atoms and fluorine, i.e., CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, CBrF<sub>3</sub>, CCI<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>CIF<sub>5</sub>, and CBrClF<sub>2</sub>) and perfluorocarbons. The term perfluorocarbon refers to compounds containing only carbon and fluorine atoms and includes, in particular, saturated, unsaturated, and cyclic perfluorocarbons. The saturated perfluorocarbons, which are usually preferred, have the formula C<sub>n</sub>F<sub>n+2</sub>, where n is from 1 to 12, preferably from 2 to 10, most preferably from 3 to 8 and even more preferably from 3 to 6. Suitable perfluorocarbons include, for example, CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>18</sub>, and C<sub>9</sub>F<sub>20</sub>. Most preferably the gas or gas mixture comprises SF<sub>6 </sub>or a perfluorocarbon selected from the group consisting of C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>18</sub>, with C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10 </sub>being particularly preferred. See also WO 97/29783, WO 98/53857, WO 98/18498, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18497, WO 98/18501, WO 98/05364, WO 98/17324.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">In certain circumstances it may be desirable to include a precursor to a gaseous substance (e.g., a material that is capable of being converted to a gas in vivo, often referred to as a &#x201c;gas precursor&#x201d;). Preferably the gas precursor and the gas it produces are physiologically acceptable. The gas precursor may be pH-activated, photo-activated, temperature activated, etc. For example, certain perfluorocarbons may be used as temperature activated gas precursors. These perfluorocarbons, such as perfluoropentane, have a liquid/gas phase transition temperature above room temperature (or the temperature at which the agents are produced and/or stored) but below body temperature; thus they undergo a phase shift and are converted to a gas within the human body.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">As discussed, the gas can comprise a mixture of gases. The following combinations are particularly preferred gas mixtures: a mixture of gases (A) and (B) in which, at least one of the gases (B), present in an amount of between 0.5-41% by vol., has a molecular weight greater than 80 daltons and is a fluorinated gas and (A) is selected from the group consisting of air, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and mixtures thereof, the balance of the mixture being gas A.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Since ultrasound vesicles may be larger than the other detectable labels described herein, they may be linked or conjugated to a plurality of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides in order to increase the targeting efficiency of the agent. Attachment to the ultrasound contrast agents described above (or known to those skilled in the art) may be via direct covalent bond between the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide and the material used to make the vesicle or via a linker, as described previously. For example, see WO 98/53857 generally for a description of the attachment of a peptide to a bifunctional PEG linker, which is then reacted with a liposome composition. See also, Lanza et al., <i>Ultrasound in Med</i>. &#x26; <i>Bio., </i>23(6):863-870 (1997).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">A number of methods may be used to prepare suspensions of microbubbles conjugated to KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides. For example, one may prepare maleimide-derivatized microbubbles by incorporating 5% (w/w) of N-MPB-PE (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-4-(p-maleimido-phenyl butyramide), (Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc) in the phospholipid formulation. Then, solutions of mercaptoacetylated KDR-binding peptides (10 mg/mL in DMF), which have been incubated in deacetylation solution (50 mM sodium phosphate, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5 M hydroxylamine.HCl, pH 7.5) are added to the maleimide-activated microbubble suspension. After incubation in the dark, under gentle agitation, the peptide conjugated microbubbles may be purified by centrifugation.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">Compounds that can be used for derivatization of microbubbles typically include the following components: (a) a hydrophobic portion, compatible with the material forming the envelope of the microbubble or of the microballoon, in order to allow an effective incorporation of the compound in the envelope of the vesicel; said portion is represented typically by a lipid moiety (dipalmitin, distearoyl); and (b) a spacer (typically PEGs of different molecular weights), which may be optional in some cases (for example, microbubbles may for instance present difficulties to be freeze dried if the spacer is too long) or preferred in some others (e.g., peptides may be less active when conjugated to a microballoon with short spacers); and (c) a reactive group capable of reacting with a corresponding reacting moiety on the peptide to be conjugated (e.g., maleimido with the &#x2014;SH group of cysteine).</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">Alternatively, KDR-binding polypeptide conjugated microbubbles may be prepared using biotin/avidin. For example, avidin-conjugated microbubbles may be prepared using a maleimide-activated phospholipid microbubble suspension, prepared as described above, which is added to mercaptoacetylated-avidin (which has been incubated with deacetylation solution). Biotinylated KDR or VEGF/KDR complex-binding peptides (prepared as described herein) are then added to the suspension of avidin-conjugated microbubbles, yielding a suspension of microbubbles conjugated to KDR or VEGF/KDR complex-binding peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">Unless it contains a hyperpolarized gas, known to require special storage conditions, the lyophilized residue may be stored and transported without need of temperature control of its environment and in particular it may be supplied to hospitals and physicians for on site formulation into a ready-to-use administrable suspension without requiring such users to have special storage facilities. Preferably in such a case it can be supplied in the form of a two-component kit, which can include two separate containers or a dual-chamber container. In the former case preferably the container is a conventional septum-sealed vial, wherein the vial containing the lyophilized residue of step b) is sealed with a septum through which the carrier liquid may be injected using an optionally prefilled syringe. In such a case the syringe used as the container of the second component is also used then for injecting the contrast agent. In the latter case, preferably the dual-chamber container is a dual-chamber syringe and once the lyophilizate has been reconstituted and then suitably mixed or gently shaken, the container can be used directly for injecting the contrast agent. In both cases means for directing or permitting application of sufficient bubble forming energy into the contents of the container are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">However, as noted above, in the stabilised contrast agents according to the invention the size of the gas microbubbles is substantially independent of the amount of agitation energy applied to the reconstituted dried product. Accordingly, no more than gentle hand shaking is generally required to give reproducible products with consistent microbubble size.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">It can be appreciated by one of ordinary skilled in the art that other two-chamber reconstitution systems capable of combining the dried powder with the aqueous solution in a sterile manner are also within the scope of the present invention. In such systems, it is particularly advantageous if the aqueous phase can be interposed between the water-insoluble gas and the environment, to increase shelf life of the product. Where a material necessary for forming the contrast agent is not already present in the container (e.g. a targeting ligand to be linked to the phospholipid during reconstitution), it can be packaged with the other components of the kit, preferably in a form or container adapted to facilitate ready combination with the other components of the kit.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361">No specific containers, vial or connection systems are required; the present invention may use conventional containers, vials and adapters. The only requirement is a good seal between the stopper and the container. The quality of the seal, therefore, becomes a matter of primary concern; any degradation of seal integrity could allow undesirable substances to enter the vial. In addition to assuring sterility, vacuum retention is essential for products stoppered at ambient or reduced pressures to assure safe and proper reconstitution. As to the stopper, it may be a compound or multicomponent formulation based on an elastomer, such as poly(isobutylene) or butyl rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362">Ultrasound imaging techniques that can be used in accordance with the present invention include known techniques, such as color Doppler, power Doppler, Doppler amplitude, stimulated acoustic imaging, and two- or three-dimensional imaging techniques. Preferably, the ultrasound imaging is effected in a contrast-specific imaging mode so as to substantially remove, or at least reduce, the dominant (linear) contribution of tissue in the echo signals, with respect to the (non-linear) contribution of the contrast agent; examples of contrast-specific imaging modes include harmonic imaging (HI), pulse inversion (PI), power modulation (PM) and contrast pulse sequencing (CPS) techniques, as described, for example, in &#x201c;Rafter et al., Imaging technologies and techniques, Cardiology Clinics 22 (2004), pp. 181-197&#x201d; (the entire disclosure of which is herewith incorporated by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">In ultrasound applications the contrast agents formed by phospholipid stabilized microbubbles may, for example, be administered in doses such that the amount of phospholipid injected is in the range 0.1 to 200 &#x3bc;g/kg body weight, preferably from about 0.1 to 30 &#x3bc;g/kg. Microballoons-containing contrast agents are typically administered in doses such that the amount of wall-forming polymer or lipid is from about 10 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">As shown in the Examples, ultrasound contrast agents conjugated to KDR binding moieties of the invention, such as, for example, those comprising SEQ ID NOS: 356, 294 and 480 and the dimer D23, are able to bind to KDR-expressing tissue and thus are useful in providing an image of such tissue. Indeed, compounds of the invention, such as phospholipid stabilized microbubbles conjugated to the heterodimer D23, can be used to image angiogenic tissue in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">The present invention also includes methods for detecting, monitoring and/or evaluating therapeutic responses following administration of an ultrasound contrast agent conjugated to KDR binding moieties described herein. Such methods are especially useful for monitoring the therapeutic response of disorders related angiogenesis and/or hyperproliferative diseases, especially diseases associated with endothelial cell hyperproliferation. The disease may include inflammatory diseases, such as, for instance, rheumatoid diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases, and cancers such as prostate cancer, mammary cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, colon cancer, renal cancer, bone cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, uterine cancer and testicular cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">Such methods may include the steps of (a) administering an ultrasound contrast agent described above to a subject with cancer or another disease related to angiogesis or endothelial cell hyper proliferation; (b) obtaining an initial image of the disease; (c) administering a therapeutic agent appropriate for the treatment of the disease; (d) obtaining a subsequent image of the hyperproliferative disease; and (e) comparing the initial and the subsequent images to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">In certain embodiments the ultrasound contrast agent comprises a dimer, such as D5. In certain embodiments the subject is a mammal. In certain embodiments the subject is a human, and the disease is cancer. In a preferred embodiment the disease is prostate cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">The therapeutic agent is an agent appropriate to treat the disorder. For disorders associated with angiogesis or (endothelial) cell hyperproliferation, the therapeutic agent is an anti-angiogenesis agent or an anti-hyperproliferation agent. In one embodiment the therapeutic agent is an anti-cancer agent. Such agents are known to those skilled in the art and include, for example, sunitinib, the therapeutic agents discussed infra, imatinib, sorafenib and bevacizumab.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">The therapeutic response may be any type of therapeutic response known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic response is reduction (or increase) in tumor size and/or vascularity. Tumor size is typically assessed by visual observation of the image (or sequence of images) obtained by subjecting the patient to a suitable imaging technique, in particular ultrasound imaging (e.g. fundamental B-mode ultrasound imaging). Vascularity can be assessed by, for example, analyzing the time-intensity curves of ultrasound signal, to determine suitable quantification parameters (in particular indicative of the vascularization) such as Imax (maximal peak enhancement), AUC (area under the curve), WIR (Wash-in-rate) or TTP (Time-to Peak); KDR expression can instead be assessed by LPO (late phase opacification). Thus, the present invention provides medical personnel with the ability to assess and if necessary adjust treatment strategies based on the adequacy of the therapeutic response. If the therapeutic response is insufficient, a different therapeutic agent or a higher dose of the same therapeutic agent may be warranted. If the therapeutic response is sufficient the current protocol will proceed unadjusted. Evaluation of the therapeutic response following adjustments to the treatment protocol would proceed in the same manner.</p>
<p id="h-0331" num="0000">C. Optical Imaging, Sonoluminescence or Photoacoustic Imaging</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0370">In accordance with the present invention, a number of optical parameters may be employed to determine the location of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex with in vivo light imaging after injection of the subject with an optically-labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide. Optical parameters to be detected in the preparation of an image may include transmitted radiation, absorption, fluorescent or phosphorescent emission, light reflection, changes in absorbance amplitude or maxima, and elastically scattered radiation. For example, biological tissue is relatively translucent to light in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range of 650-1000 nm. NIR radiation can penetrate tissue up to several centimeters, permitting the use of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides of the present invention for optical imaging of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0371">The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides may be conjugated with photolabels, such as optical dyes, including organic chromophores or fluorophores, having extensive delocalized ring systems and having absorption or emission maxima in the range of 400-1500 nm. The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide may alternatively be derivatized with a bioluminescent molecule. The preferred range of absorption maxima for photolabels is between 600 and 1000 nm to minimize interference with the signal from hemoglobin. Preferably, photoabsorption labels have large molar absorptivities, e.g., &#x3e;10<sup>5 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, while fluorescent optical dyes will have high quantum yields. Examples of optical dyes include, but are not limited to those described in WO 98/18497, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18498, WO 98/53857, WO 96/17628, WO 97/18841, WO 96/23524, WO 98/47538, and references cited therein. The photolabels may be covalently linked directly to the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide or linked to the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide via a linker, as described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">After injection of the optically-labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moiety, the patient is scanned with one or more light sources (e.g., a laser) in the wavelength range appropriate for the photolabel employed in the agent. The light used may be monochromatic or polychromatic and continuous or pulsed. Transmitted, scattered, or reflected light is detected via a photodetector tuned to one or multiple wavelengths to determine the location of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex in the subject. Changes in the optical parameter may be monitored over time to detect accumulation of the optically-labeled reagent at the site of angiogenesis. Standard image processing and detecting devices may be used in conjunction with the optical imaging reagents of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">The optical imaging reagents described above may also be used for acousto-optical or sonoluminescent imaging performed with optically-labeled imaging agents (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,298, WO 98/57666, and references cited therein). In acousto-optical imaging, ultrasound radiation is applied to the subject and affects the optical parameters of the transmitted, emitted, or reflected light. In sonoluminescent imaging, the applied ultrasound actually generates the light detected. Suitable imaging methods using such techniques are described in WO 98/57666.</p>

<p id="p-0383" num="0382">Complexes of radioactive technetium are particularly useful for diagnostic imaging and complexes of radioactive rhenium are particularly useful for radiotherapy. In forming a complex of radioactive technetium with the reagents of this invention, the technetium complex, preferably a salt of Tc-99m pertechnetate, is reacted with the reagent in the presence of a reducing agent. Preferred reducing agents are dithionite, stannous and ferrous ions; the most preferred reducing agent is stannous chloride. Means for preparing such complexes are conveniently provided in a kit form comprising a sealed vial containing a predetermined quantity of a reagent of the invention to be labeled and a sufficient amount of reducing agent to label the reagent with Tc-99m. Alternatively, the complex may be formed by reacting a peptide of this invention conjugated with an appropriate chelator with a pre-formed labile complex of technetium and another compound known as a transfer ligand. This process is known as ligand exchange and is well known to those skilled in the art. The labile complex may be formed using such transfer ligands as tartrate, citrate, gluconate or mannitol, for example. Among the Tc-99m pertechnetate salts useful with the present invention are included the alkali metal salts such as the sodium salt, or ammonium salts or lower alkyl ammonium salts.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">Preparation of the complexes of the present invention where the metal is radioactive rhenium may be accomplished using rhenium starting materials in the +5 or +7 oxidation state. Examples of compounds in which rhenium is in the Re(VII) state are NH<sub>4</sub>ReO<sub>4 </sub>or KReO<sub>4</sub>. Re(V) is available as, for example, [ReOCl<sub>4</sub>](NBu<sub>4</sub>), [ReOCl<sub>4</sub>](AsPh<sub>4</sub>), ReOCl<sub>3</sub>(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>and as ReO<sub>2</sub>(pyridine)<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, where Ph is phenyl and Bu is n-butyl. Other rhenium reagents capable of forming a rhenium complex may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">Radioactively-labeled scintigraphic imaging agents provided by the present invention are provided having a suitable amount of radioactivity. In forming Tc-99m radioactive complexes, it is generally preferred to form radioactive complexes in solutions containing radioactivity at concentrations of from about 0.01 mCi to 100 mCi per mL.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Generally, the unit dose to be administered has a radioactivity of about 0.01 mCi to about 100 mCi, preferably 1 mCi to 20 mCi. The solution to be injected at unit dosage is from about 0.01 mL to about 10 mL.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">Typical doses of a radionuclide-labeled KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding imaging agents according to the invention provide 10-20 mCi. After injection of the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex-specific radionuclide imaging agent into the patient, a gamma camera calibrated for the gamma ray energy of the nuclide incorporated in the imaging agent is used to image areas of uptake of the agent and quantify the amount of radioactivity present in the site.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Imaging of the site in vivo can take place in a matter of a few minutes. However, imaging can take place, if desired, hours or even longer, after the radiolabeled peptide is injected into a patient. In most instances, a sufficient amount of the administered dose will accumulate in the area to be imaged within about 0.1 of an hour to permit the taking of scintiphotos.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">Proper dose schedules for the radiotherapeutic compounds of the present invention are known to those skilled in the art. The compounds can be administered using many methods that include, but are not limited to, a single or multiple IV or IP injections, using a quantity of radioactivity that is sufficient to cause damage or ablation of the targeted KDR-expressing tissue, but not so much that substantive damage is caused to non-target (normal tissue). The quantity and dose required is different for different constructs, depending on the energy and half-life of the isotope used, the degree of uptake and clearance of the agent from the body and the mass of the tumor. In general, doses can range from a single dose of about 30-50 mCi to a cumulative dose of up to about 3 Curies.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">The radiotherapeutic compositions of the invention can include physiologically acceptable buffers, and can require radiation stabilizers to prevent radiolytic damage to the compound prior to injection. Radiation stabilizers are known to those skilled in the art, and may include, for example, para-aminobenzoic acid, ascorbic acid, gentistic acid and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390">A single or multi-vial kit that contains all of the components needed to prepare the complexes of this invention, other than the radionuclide, is an integral part of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">A single-vial kit preferably contains a chelating ligand, a source of stannous salt, or other pharmaceutically acceptable reducing agent, and is appropriately buffered with pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to adjust the pH to a value of about 3 to about 9. The quantity and type of reducing agent used would depend highly on the nature of the exchange complex to be formed. The proper conditions are well known to those that are skilled in the art. It is preferred that the kit contents be in lyophilized form. Such a single vial kit may optionally contain labile or exchange ligands such as glucoheptonate, gluconate, mannitol, malate, citric or tartaric acid and can also contain reaction modifiers such as diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DPTA), ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), or &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, or &#x3b3; cyclodextrin that serve to improve the radiochemical purity and stability of the final product. The kit may also contain stabilizers, bulking agents such as mannitol, that are designed to aid in the freeze-drying process, and other additives known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">A multi-vial kit preferably contains the same general components but employs more than one vial in reconstituting the radiopharmaceutical. For example, one vial may contain all of the ingredients that are required to form a labile Tc(V) complex on addition of pertechnetate (e.g., the stannous source or other reducing agent). Pertechnetate is added to this vial, and after waiting an appropriate period of time, the contents of this vial are added to a second vial that contains the ligand, as well as buffers appropriate to adjust the pH to its optimal value. After a reaction time of about 5 to 60 minutes, the complexes of the present invention are formed. It is advantageous that the contents of both vials of this multi-vial kit be lyophilized. As above, reaction modifiers, exchange ligands, stabilizers, bulking agents, etc. may be present in either or both vials.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">As shown in the Examples, compounds of the invention comprising a radionuclide, particularly heteromultimers such as D10 conjugated to a radionuclide (optionally via a chelator), are useful in imaging KDR or VEGF/KDR complex expressing tissue (such as angiogenic tissue).</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Additionally, the Examples establish that compounds of the invention conjugated to a therapeutic radionuclide, particularly heteromultimers such as D13 conjugated to a chelator and complexed with a therapeutic radionuclide, are useful in radiotherapy of tumors expressing KDR.</p>
<heading id="h-0333" level="1">Other Therapeutic Applications</heading>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides of the present invention can be used to improve the activity of therapeutic agents such as anti-angiogenic or tumorcidal agents against undesired angiogenesis such as occurs in neoplastic tumors, by providing or improving their affinity for KDR or VEGF/KDR complex and their residence time at a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex on endothelium undergoing angiogenesis. In this aspect of the invention, hybrid agents are provided by conjugating a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide according to the invention with a therapeutic agent. The therapeutic agent may be a radiotherapeutic, discussed above, a drug, chemotherapeutic or tumorcidal agent, genetic material or a gene delivery vehicle, etc. The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide portion of the conjugate causes the therapeutic to &#x201c;home&#x201d; to the sites of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex (i.e., activated endothelium), and to improve the affinity of the conjugate for the endothelium, so that the therapeutic activity of the conjugate is more localized and concentrated at the sites of angiogenesis. Such conjugates will be useful in treating angiogenesis-associated diseases, especially neoplastic tumor growth and metastasis, in mammals, including humans, which method comprises administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide according to the invention conjugated with a therapeutic agent. The invention also provides the use of such conjugates in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of angiogenesis associated diseases in mammals, including humans.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">Suitable therapeutic agents for use in this aspect of the invention include, but are not limited to: antineoplastic agents, such as platinum compounds (e.g., spiroplatin, cisplatin, and carboplatin), methotrexate, adriamycin, mitomycin, ansamitocin, bleomycin, cytosine, arabinoside, arabinosyl adenine, mercaptopolylysine, vincristine, busulfan, chlorambucil, melphalan (e.g., PAM, L-PAM, or phenylalanine mustard), mercaptopurine, mitotane, procarbazine hydrochloride, dactinomycin (actinomycin D), daunorubcin hydrochloride, doxorubicin hydrochloride, taxol, mitomycin, plicamycin (mithramycin), aminoglutethimide, estramustine phosphate sodium, flutamide, leuprolide acetate, megestrol acetate, tamoxifen citrate, testoiactone, trilostane, amsacrine (m-AMSA), aparaginase (L-aparaginase), Erwina aparaginase, etoposide (VP-16), interferon cx-2a, Interferon cx-2b, teniposide (VM-26, vinblastine sulfate (VLB), vincristine sulfate, bleomycin sulfate, adriamycin, and arabinosyl; anti-angiogenic agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors with activity toward signaling molecules important in angiogenesis and/or tumor growth such as SU5416 and SU6668 (Sugen/Pharmacia &#x26; Upjohn), endostatin (EntreMed), angiostatin (EntreMed), Combrestatin (Oxigene), cyclosporine, 5-fluorouracil, vinblastine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, daunorubcin, immunotoxins; coagulation factors; antivirals such as acyclovir, amantadine azidothymidine (AZT or Zidovudine), ribavirin and vidarabine monohydrate (adenine arahinoside, ara-A); antibiotics, antimalarials, antiprotozoans such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, metroidazole, quinine and meglumine antimonate; anti-inflammatories such as diflunisal, ibuprofen, indomethacin, meclofenamate, mefenamic acid, naproxen, oxyphenbutazone, phenylbutazone, piroxicam, sulindac, tolmetin, aspirin and salicylates.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides of the present invention may also be used to target genetic material to KDR-expressing cells. Thus, they may be useful in gene therapy, particularly for treatment of diseases associated with angiogenesis. In this embodiment, genetic material or one or more delivery vehicles containing genetic material useful in treating an angiogenesis-related disease may be conjugated to one or more KDR binding moieties of the invention and administered to a patient. The genetic material may include nucleic acids, such as RNA or DNA, of either natural or synthetic origin, including recombinant RNA and DNA and antisense RNA and DNA. Types of genetic material that may be used include, for example, genes carried on expression vectors such as plasmids, phagemids, cosmids, yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC's) and defective or &#x201c;helper&#x201d; viruses, antigene nucleic acids, both single and double stranded RNA and DNA and analogs thereof, such as phosphorothioate and phosphorodithioate oligodeoxynucleotides. Additionally, the genetic material may be combined, for example, with lipids, proteins or other polymers. Delivery vehicles for genetic material may include, for example, a virus particle, a retroviral or other gene therapy vector, a liposome, a complex of lipids (especially cationic lipids) and genetic material, a complex of dextran derivatives and genetic material, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">In a preferred embodiment the constructs of the invention are utilized in gene therapy for treatment of diseases associated with angiogenesis. In this embodiment, genetic material, or one or more delivery vehicles containing genetic material, e.g., useful in treating an angiogenesis-related disease, can be conjugated to one or more KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides or multimers (e.g., homomultimers or heteromultimers) of the invention and administered to a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">Constructs including genetic material and the KDR-binding polypeptides of the invention may be used, in particular, to selectively introduce genes into angiogenic endothelial cells, which may be useful not only to treat cancer, but also after angioplasty, where inhibition of angiogenesis may inhibit restenosis.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">Therapeutic agents and the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties of the invention can be linked or fused in known ways, using the same type of linkers discussed elsewhere in this application. Preferred linkers will be substituted or unsubstituted alkyl chains, amino acid chains, polyethylene glycol chains, and other simple polymeric linkers known in the art. More preferably, if the therapeutic agent is itself a protein, for which the encoding DNA sequence is known, the therapeutic protein and KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide may be coexpressed from the same synthetic gene, created using recombinant DNA techniques, as described above. The coding sequence for the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide may be fused in frame with that of the therapeutic protein, such that the peptide is expressed at the amino- or carboxy-terminus of the therapeutic protein, or at a place between the termini, if it is determined that such placement would not destroy the required biological function of either the therapeutic protein or the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide. A particular advantage of this general approach is that concatamerization of multiple, tandemly arranged KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides is possible, thereby increasing the number and concentration of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding sites associated with each therapeutic protein. In this manner KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding avidity is increased, which would be expected to improve the efficacy of the recombinant therapeutic fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">Similar recombinant proteins containing one or more coding sequences for a KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide may be useful in imaging or therapeutic applications. For example, in a variation of the pre-targeting applications discussed infra, the coding sequence for a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide can be fused in frame to a sequence encoding an antibody (or an antibody fragment or recombinant DNA construct including an antibody, etc.) that, for example, binds to a chelator for a radionuclide (or another detectable label). The antibody expressing the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide is then administered to a patient and allowed to localize and bind to KDR-expressing tissue. After the non-binding antibodies have been allowed to clear, the chelator-radionuclide complex (or other detectable label), which the antibody recognizes is administered, permitting imaging of or radiotherapy to the KDR-expressing tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">Additionally, the coding sequence for a KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptide may be fused in frame to a sequence encoding, for example, serum proteins or other proteins that produce biological effects (such as apoptosis, coagulation, internalization, differentiation, cellular stasis, immune system stimulation or suppression, or combinations thereof). The resulting recombinant proteins are useful in imaging, radiotherapy, and therapies directed against cancer and other diseases that involve angiogenesis or diseases associated with the pathogens discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">Additionally, constructs including KDR or KDR/VEGF complex binding polypeptides of the present invention can themselves be used as therapeutics to treat a number of diseases. For example, where binding of a protein or other molecule (e.g., a growth factor, hormone etc.) is necessary for or contributes to a disease process and a binding moiety inhibits such binding, constructs including such binding moieties could be useful as therapeutics. Similarly, where binding of a binding moiety itself inhibits a disease process, constructs containing such binding moieties could also be useful as therapeutics.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">As binding of VEGF and activation of KDR is necessary for angiogenic activity, in one embodiment constructs including KDR complex binding polypeptides that inhibit the binding of VEGF to KDR (or otherwise inhibit activation of KDR) may be used as anti-angiogenic agents. Some peptides of the invention that inhibit activation of KDR are discussed in Example 9 infra. Certain constructs of the invention including multimers and heteromultimers that inhibit activation of KDR are also discussed in the Examples. A particularly preferred heteromultimer is the heterodimer-containing construct D1 (structures provided by the examples). Other preferred heterodimer constructs include D4, D5, D6, D10, D13, D17, D23, D27, D30 and D31 (structures provided in the Examples below). The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof of the present invention are useful as therapeutic agents for treating conditions that involve endothelial cells. Because an important function of endothelial cells is angiogenesis, or the formation of blood vessels, the polypeptides and constructs thereof are particularly useful for treating conditions that involve angiogenesis. Conditions that involve angiogenesis include, for example, solid tumors, tumor metastases and benign tumors. Such tumors and related disorders are well known in the art and include, for example, melanoma, central nervous system tumors, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcoma, multiple myeloma as wells as cancer of the breast, lung, prostate, colon, head &#x26; neck, and ovaries. Additional tumors and related disorders are listed in Table I of U.S. Pat. No. 6,025,331, issued Feb. 15, 2000 to Moses, et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Benign tumors include, for example, hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, neurofibromas, trachomas, and pyogenic granulomas. As shown in Example 15, compounds of the invention, including heteromultimers such as D6, are useful in treating and/or slowing the growth of certain tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Other relevant diseases that involve angiogenesis include for example, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, retrolental fibroplasia, rebeosis, Osler-Webber Syndrome, myocardial angiogenesis, plaque neovascularization, telangiectasia, hemophiliac joints, angiofibroma and wound granulation. Other relevant diseases or conditions that involve blood vessel growth include intestinal adhesions, atherosclerosis, scleroderma, and hypertropic scars, and ulcers. Furthermore, the binding polypeptides and constructs thereof of the present invention can be used to reduce or prevent uterine neovascularization required for embryo implantation, for example, as a birth control agent. Heteromultimers of this invention can also be useful for treating vascular permeability events that can result when VEGF binds KDR. In renal failure, for example, it has been shown that anti-VEGF antibodies can reverse damage. In a similar way, the compounds of the present invention can reverse renal permeability pathogenesis in, for example, diabetes.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">Furthermore, the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides of the present invention may be useful in treating diseases associated with certain pathogens, including, for example, malaria, HIV, SIV, Simian hemorrhagic fever virus, etc. Sequence homology searches of KDR-binding peptides identified by phage display using the BLAST program at NCBI has identified a number of homologous proteins known or expected to be present on the surface of pathogenic organisms. Homologies were noted between the polypeptides of the invention and proteins from various malaria strains, HIV, SIV, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and an enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli </i>strain. Some of the homologous proteins, such as PfEMP1 and EBL-1, are hypermutable adhesion proteins known to play roles in virulence. These proteins possess multiple binding sites that are capable of binding to more than one target molecule on the host's surface. Their high mutation and recombination rates allow them to quickly develop new binding sites to promote survival and/or invasion. Similarly, proteins such as gp120 of HIV (which also has homology to some of the KDR-binding peptides disclosed herein) play critical roles in the adhesion of pathogens to their hosts. Although not reported previously, it is possible that many of the pathogen proteins with homology to the KDR-binding peptides disclosed herein also bind to KDR. Comparison of the pathogen protein sequences with the corresponding peptide sequences may suggest changes in the peptide sequence or other modifications that will enhance its binding properties. Additionally, the KDR-binding peptide sequences disclosed herein may have usefulness in blocking infection with the pathogen species that possesses the homology. Indeed, a similar strategy is being employed to block HIV infection by trying to prevent virus envelope proteins from binding to their known cellular surface targets such as CD4. See, Howie et al., &#x201c;Synthetic peptides representing discontinuous CD4 binding epitopes of HIV-1 gp120 that induce T cell apoptosis and block cell death induced by gp120&#x201d;, <i>FASEB J, </i>12(11):991-998 (1998). Thus, KDR may represent a previously unknown target for a number of pathogens, and the KDR binding peptides of the invention may be useful in treating the diseases associated with those pathogens.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof can be administered to an individual over a suitable time course depending on the nature of the condition and the desired outcome. The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof can be administered prophylactically, e.g., before the condition is diagnosed or to an individual predisposed to a condition. The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof can be administered while the individual exhibits symptoms of the condition or after the symptoms have passed or otherwise been relieved (such as after removal of a tumor). In addition, the binding polypeptides and constructs thereof of the present invention can be administered a part of a maintenance regimen, for example to prevent or lessen the recurrence or the symptoms or condition. As described below, the binding polypeptides and constructs thereof of the present invention can be administered systemically or locally.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">The quantity of material administered will depend on the seriousness of the condition. For example, for treatment of an angiogenic condition, e.g., in the case of neoplastic tumor growth, the position and size of the tumor will affect the quantity of material to be administered. The precise dose to be employed and mode of administration must per force in view of the nature of the complaint be decided according to the circumstances by the physician supervising treatment. In general, dosages of the agent conjugate of the present invention will follow the dosages that are routine for the therapeutic agent alone, although the improved affinity of a binding polypeptide or heteromultimer of the invention for its target may allow a decrease in the standard dosage.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">Such conjugate pharmaceutical compositions are preferably formulated for parenteral administration, and most preferably for intravenous or intra-arterial administration. Generally, and particularly when administration is intravenous or intra-arterial, pharmaceutical compositions may be given as a bolus, as two or more doses separated in time, or as a constant or non-linear flow infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">As used herein the term &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; includes at least partial alleviation of symptoms of a given condition. The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof of the present invention do not have to produce a complete alleviation of symptoms to be useful. For example, treatment of an individual can result in a decrease in the size of a tumor or diseased area, or prevention of an increase in size of the tumor or diseased area. Treatment can result in reduction in the number of blood vessels in an area of interest or can prevent an increase in the number of blood vessels in an area of interest. Treatment can also prevent or lessen the number or size of metastatic outgrowths of the main tumor(s).</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">Symptoms that can be alleviated include physiological characteristics such as VEGF receptor activity and migration ability of endothelial cells. The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof of the present invention can inhibit activity of VEGF receptors, including VEGFR-2/KDR, VEGFR-1/Flt-1 and VEGFR-3/Flt-4. Such inhibition can be detected, for example, by measuring the phosphorylation state of the receptor in the presence of or after treatment with the binding polypeptides or constructs thereof. Such inhibition can also be detected by measuring the ability of endothelial cells to migrate in the presence of or after treatment with the binding polypeptides or constructs thereof. Based on the teachings provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art would know how and be able to administer a suitable dose of binding polypeptide or construct thereof as provided herein, and measure the effect of treatment on the parameter of interest. For example, the size of the area of interest (e.g., the tumor or lesion) can be measured before and after treatment. In another embodiment, the phosphorylation state of the relevant receptor, or the migration ability of endothelial in an area of interest can be measured in samples taken from the individual. The VEGF receptors or endothelial cells can be isolated from the sample and used in assays described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">The dosage of the polypeptides and constructs thereof may depend on the age, sex, health, and weight of the individual, as well as the nature of the condition and overall treatment regimen. The biological effects of the polypeptides and constructs thereof are described herein. Therefore, based on the biological effects of the binding polypeptides and constructs provided herein, and the desired outcome of treatment, the preferred dosage is determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine optimization procedures. Typically, the daily regimen is in the range of about 0.1 &#x3bc;g/kg to about 1 mg/kg.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof provided herein can be administered as the sole active ingredient together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, or can be administered together with other binding polypeptides and constructs thereof, other therapeutic agents, or combination thereof. In addition, the binding polypeptides and constructs thereof can be conjugated to therapeutic agents, for example, to improve specificity, residence time in the body, or therapeutic effect. Such other therapeutic agents include, for example, other anti-angiogenic compounds, and tumoricidal compounds. The therapeutic agent can also include antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">Furthermore, the binding polypeptide or constructs thereof of the present invention can be used as an endothelial cell homing device. Therefore, the binding polypeptide or constructs thereof can be conjugated to nucleic acid encoding, for example, a therapeutic polypeptide, in order to target the nucleic acid to endothelial cells. Once exposed to the nucleic acid conjugated binding polypeptide, the endothelial cell can internalize and express the conjugated nucleic acid, thereby delivering the therapeutic peptide to the target cells.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0415">In another embodiment of the invention, the therapeutic agent can be associated with an ultrasound contrast agent composition, said ultrasound contrast agent including the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptides of the invention linked to the material employed to form the vesicles (particularly microbubbles or microballoons) comprising the contrast agent. For example, the therapeutic agent can be associated with the contrast agent and delivered as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,378, herein incorporated by reference. Thus, after administration of the ultrasound contrast agent and the optional imaging of the contrast agent bound to the pathogenic site expressing the KDR or VEGF/KDR complex, the pathogenic site can be irradiated with an energy beam (preferably ultrasonic, e.g., with a frequency of from 0.3 to 3 MHz), to rupture or burst of microvesicles. The therapeutic effect of the therapeutic agent can thus be advantageously enhanced by the energy released by the rupture of the microvesicles, in particular causing an effective deliver of the therapeutic agent to the targeted pathogenic site.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0416">The binding polypeptides and constructs thereof can be administered by any suitable route. Suitable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, topical application, transdermal, parenteral, gastrointestinal, intravaginal, and transalveolar. Compositions for the desired route of administration can be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical arts, for example, as described in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, </i>20<sup>th </sup>ed., Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 2000.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">For topical application, the binding polypeptides can be suspended, for example, in a cream, gel or rinse that allows the polypeptides or constructs to penetrate the skin and enter the blood stream, for systemic delivery, or contact the area of interest, for localized delivery. Compositions suitable for topical application include any pharmaceutically acceptable base in which the polypeptides are at least minimally soluble.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">For transdermal administration, the polypeptides can be applied in pharmaceutically acceptable suspension together with a suitable transdermal device or &#x201c;patch.&#x201d; Examples of suitable transdermal devices for administration of the polypeptides of the present invention are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,165,458, issued Dec. 26, 2000 to Foldvari, et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,166B1, issued Aug. 4, 2001 to Sintov, et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">For parenteral administration, the polypeptides can be injected intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sterile water, saline solution, and buffered saline (including buffers like phosphate or acetate), alcohol, vegetable oils, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, paraffin, etc. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anaesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts, lubricants, etc. as long as they do not react deleteriously with the active compounds. Similarly, the composition may comprise conventional excipients, i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral, enteral or intranasal application that do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Generally, the ingredients will be supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent in activity units. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade &#x201c;water for injection&#x201d; or saline. Where the composition is to be administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline may be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">For gastrointestinal and intravaginal administration, the polypeptides can be incorporated into pharmaceutically acceptable powders, pills or liquids for ingestion, and suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">For transalveolar, buccal or pulmonary administration, the polypeptides can be suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient suitable for aerosolization and inhalation or as a mouthwash. Devices suitable for transalveolar administration such as atomizers and vaporizers are also included within the scope of the invention. Suitable formulations for aerosol delivery of polypeptides using buccal or pulmonary routes can be found, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,312,665B1, issued Nov. 6, 2001 to Pankaj Modi, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">In addition, the polypeptides of the present invention can be administered nasally or ocularly, where the polypeptide is suspended in a liquid pharmaceutically acceptable agent suitable for dropwise dosing.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0423">The polypeptides of the present invention can be administered such that the polypeptide is released in the individual over an extended period of time (sustained or controlled release). For example, the polypeptide can be formulated into a composition such that a single administration provides delivery of the polypeptide for at least one week, or over the period of a year or more. Controlled release systems include monolithic or reservoir-type microcapsules, depot implants, osmotic pumps, vesicles, micelles, liposomes, transdermal patches and iontophoretic devices. In one embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention are encapsulated or admixed in a slowly degrading, non-toxic polymer. Additional formulations suitable for controlled release of the polypeptides provided herein are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,797, issued Jul. 5, 1983, to Folkman, et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">Another suitable method for delivering the polypeptides of the present to an individual is via in vivo production of the polypeptide. A gene encoding the polypeptide can be administered to the individual such that the encoded polypeptide is expressed. The gene can be transiently expressed. In a particular embodiment, the gene encoding the polypeptide is transfected into cells that have been obtained from the patient, a method referred to as ex vivo gene therapy. Cells expressing the polypeptide are then returned to the patient's body. Methods of ex vivo gene therapy are well known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,797, issued Mar. 21, 1998 to Anderson, et al., the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">Isolation, formulation and use of KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding moieties in accordance with this invention will be further illustrated in the following Examples to follow.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">As previously mentioned, the present invention also provides monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates having a linear peptide monomer which binds with high affinity to KDR and dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugates having two distinct monomer subunits, each binding to KDR. In addition, highly efficient methods for large scale production of purified forms of these conjugates and precursor materials are provided. Such methods include the production of dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugates having minimal levels of TFA.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">The phospholipid may be selected from the group consisting of: phosphatidylethanolamines and modified phosphatidylethanolamines. Particularly preferred phospholipids include phosphatidylethanolamines modified by linking a hydrophilic polymer thereto. Examples of modified phosphatidylethanolamines are phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) modified with polyethylenglycol (PEG), in brief &#x201c;PE-PEGs&#x201d;, i.e. phosphatidylethanolamines where the hydrophilic ethanolamine moiety is linked to a PEG molecule of variable molecular weight (e.g. from 300 to 5000 daltons), such as DPPE-PEG, DSPE-PEG, DMPE-PEG or DAPE-PEG. DSPE-PEG2000, DSPE-PEG3400, DPPE-PEG2000 and DPPE-PEG3400 are preferred, with DSPE-PEG2000 particularly preferred. Note that a salt form of the phospholipid may be used, such as, for example, the trimethyl ammonium salt, the tetramethylammonium salt, the triethylammonium salt, sodium salt, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">These compounds may be incorporated into gas-filled ultrasound contrast agents, such as, for example, gas filled microbubbles to form contrast agents that provide excellent imaging of target-bearing tissue. In a preferred embodiment, targeting vector-phospholipid conjugates which include targeting peptides which bind with high affinity to KDR are incorporated into targeted microbubbles. As shown herein, such targeted microbubbles selectively localize at KDR-bearing tissue, permitting imaging of such tissue, and, in particular imaging of tumors and angiogenic processes, including those processes associated with neoplastic development.</p>

<p id="p-0433" num="0432">As shown if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 105 and 106</figref> the monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (1) N-acetyl-L-arginyl-L-alanyl-L-glutaminyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophyl-L-tryptophyl-L-aspartyl-L-isoleucyl-L-glutamyl-L-leucyl-L-serinyl-L-methionyl-L-alanyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutaminyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-L-histidyl-L-alanyl-Ll-phenylalanyl-L-leucyl-L-serinyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycl-glycyl-glycyl-{N6-[1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolaminocarbonyloxy-(PEG2000)-aminoglutaryl]}-L-lysinamide, is a phospholipid conjugate. This conjugate is also referred to as Ac-RAQDWYYDEILSMADQLRHAFLSGGGGGK(DSPE-PEG2000-NH-Glut)-NH2 (SEQ ID NO. 618) and Ac-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr-Asp-Glu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Met-Ala-Asp-Gln-Leu-Arg-His-Ala-Phe-Leu-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(DSPE-PEG2000-NH-Glut)-NH2.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 113</figref>, the conjugate comprises a 28 amino acid linear peptide monomer (32), N-acetyl-L-alanyl-L-glutaminyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophyl-L-tyrosyl-L-tyrosyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-isoleucyl-L-leucyl-L-seryl-L-methionyl-L-alanyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-L-histidyl-L-alanyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-leucyl-L-seryl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-L-lysinamide, which is also referred to as Ac-AQDWYYDEILSMADQLRHAFLSGGGGGK-NH2 (SEQ ID NO.622) and Ac-Ala-Gln-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr-Asp-Glu-Ile-Leu-Ser-Met-Ala-Asp-Gln-Leu-Arg-His-Ala-Phe-Leu-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-NH2. This peptide monomer has been shown to bind with high affinity to KDR (See U.S. application Ser. No. 10/661,156). It should be understood that analogs and derivatives of the monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugate and the linear peptide monomer are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">Additional monomeric peptide phospholip conjugates according to the present invention include Ac-RAQDWYYDEILSMADQLRHAFLSGAGSGK-NH2 (SEQ.

It should be understood that analogs and derivatives of these monomeric peptide monomers and peptide phospholipids conjugates comprising these monomers are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">As shown in the Examples, ultrasound contrast agents such as gas filled microbubbles formulated with the monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates (1) and (31) displayed high KDR binding which was confirmed using echographic examination of VX2 tumors in rabbits.</p>
<heading id="h-0335" level="1">Methods of Preparation of Monomer Peptide-Phospholipid Conjugates</heading>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436">Ideally, to facilitate production of a monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugate, the linear peptide monomer should be prepared in bulk. Then conjugation of the purified linear peptide monomer to the phospholipid, such as, for example, a pegylated phospholipid in salt form, e.g., DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt via the linker disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG), may be used to provide monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0437">In preparing monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates, methods according to the present invention provide at least the following advantages: increased yield of peptide synthesis; reduced extent of racemization; avoidance of previously observed piperidine amide formation during synthesis, efficient purification of peptide monomers, development of a procedure for conjugation of peptide monomers on larger scale; and development of purification protocols that would allow the ready separation of the monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates from the starting DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0438">With respect to the methods described below (including the Examples section of this specification), it should be understood that while such methods may specifically reference the use of linear peptide monomers (2) and (32) to form monomeric peptide phospholipids conjugates (1) and (31), these methods also may be used with peptide monomers Ac-RAQDWYYDEILSMADQLRHAFLSGAGSGK-NH2 (SEQ. ID NO. 623) and Ac-RAQDWYYDEILSMADQLRHAFLSGSAGSK-NH2 (SEQ. ID NO. 624), as well as analogs and derivatives of any of the above. It also should be understood that the numerical values referred to in the synthesis of monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates are representative.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0439">Linear peptide monomers may be prepared by SPPS. The sequence of the linear peptide monomers may be constructed as a C-terminal carboxamide on Pal-Peg-PS-resin (substitution level: 0.2 mmol/g). Peptide synthesis may be accomplished using Fmoc chemistry on a SONATA&#xae;/Pilot Peptide Synthesizer. Problems previously observed with this process have been racemization, incomplete couplings and piperidine amide formation, each of which contribute to suboptimal yield and purity. A dramatic decrease in the formation of the piperidine amide may be attained by the use of 25% piperidine in DMF containing HOBt (0.1M) as the reagent for Fmoc removal. Racemization may be considerably reduced by using DIC/HOBt as the activator for most couplings; a 3 h coupling time using a four-fold excess of pre-activated Fmoc-amino acid with an intervening wash with anhydrous DMF (6&#xd7;). N<sup>&#x3b1;</sup>-Fmoc amino acids may be dissolved just before their coupling turn and pre-activated with DIC/HOBt in DMF for 4 min and transferred to the reaction vessel. This may be accomplished on the Sonata instrument by loading the solid Fmoc-amino acids into the amino acid vessels of the instrument and then programming the instrument to add DMF, HOBt/DMF and DIC/DMF sequentially with bubbling of the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">To optimize the yield, the problem of aggregation of the resin during the synthesis of longer peptides, which can be devastating even when optimal coupling reagents are employed, may be addressed. To reduce aggregation during peptide assembly the strategy of using pseudoproline dipeptides to incorporate X-Thr or X-Ser as dipeptides instead of sequential couplings of X and Thr or X and Ser, may be employed. For linear peptide monomers sequential couplings of Leu11-Ser12 and Leu22-Ser23 may be replaced by the single coupling of the pseudoproline dipeptide, Fmoc-Leu-Ser(&#x3c8;Me,Mepro)-OH. Additional optimization may be accomplished by reducing the number of couplings by using Fmoc-Gly-Gly-Gly-OH and Fmoc-Gly-Gly-OH, in lieu of serial coupling of Fmoc-Gly-OH. Activation of -Gly-Gly-OH segments may lead to cyclization of the activated acid function with the distal amide function to produce an inactive diketopiperazine; this may reduce coupling yields in a time dependant manner. This problem may be avoided by addition of Fmoc-Glyn-OH (n=2, 3) to the reaction vessel and sequential addition of HOBt and DIC; the activated Fmoc-Glyn-OH may be intercepted by the resin-bound amino group before appreciable cyclization to the diketopiperazine takes place. With these improvements, the synthesis of linear peptide monomers may be completed on the Sonata Peptide Synthesizer on a 10 mmol synthesis scale.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">After chain elongation, the Fmoc may be removed from the N-terminus. The peptide and the free amino group may be acetylated. Then the peptide sequence may be cleaved from the resin and deprotected using &#x201c;Reagent B&#x201d; (TFA:water:phenol:triisopropylsilane, 88:5:5:2, v/v/w/v) for 4 h. After the cleavage reaction the crude peptide may be isolated as a solid by evaporation of the volatiles, trituration of the residue with diethyl ether and washing of the solid thus obtained using the same solvent. In another variation the peptide may be precipitated from the reaction mixture by addition of diethyl ether to the reaction mixture, collecting the solid thus formed and washing with the same solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">Linear peptide monomers may be purified as described below. Again, the numerical references are representative. Crude linear peptide monomers (0.5 g) may be dissolved in CH3CN (40 mL/g) and this solution may be diluted to a final volume of 100 mL with water. The solution may then be filtered. The filtered solution may be loaded onto the preparative HPLC column (Waters, XTerra&#xae; Prep MS C18, 10&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 50&#xd7;250 mm) equilibrated with 10% CH3CN in water (0.1% TFA). After loading, the composition of the eluent may then be ramped to 20% CH3CN-water (0.1% TFA) over 1 min, and a linear gradient may be initiated at a rate of 0.6%/min of CH3CN (0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA) and run for 50 min. Eluted fractions may be checked for purity on an analytical reversed phase C18 column (Waters XTerra MS-C18, 10, 120 &#x212b;, 4.6&#xd7;50 mm) and fractions containing the product in &#x3e;95% purity may be combined and freeze-dried. For each purification of 0.5 g of crude peptide 0.12 g (24%) of linear peptide monomer may be consistently isolated and will provide the peptide in the same yield and purity.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">Synthesis of monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates may be performed as described below. The numerical references are again representative. The last step in the synthesis may be the conjugation of the phospholipid, such as, for example, a pegylated phospholipid such as DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt to a linear peptide monomer. The PEG2000 moiety of DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt (4) is nominally comprised of 45 ethylene glycol units. It should be understood, however, that this material is a distribution of PEG containing species whose centroid is the nominal compound containing 45 ethylenoxy units. The conjugation of a linear peptide monomer with DSPE-PEG2000-NH2 phospholipid ammonium salt may be accomplished by preparation of the glutaric acid monoamide mono NHS ester of a linear peptide monomer and reaction of this with the free amino group of the phospholipid ammonium salt. Thus a linear peptide monomer may be reacted with DSG (4 eq.) in DMF in the presence of DIEA (5 eq.) for 30 min. The reaction mixture may be diluted with ethyl acetate, which may result in precipitation of the peptide glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester. The supernatant containing un-reacted DSG may be decanted and the intermediate peptide mono-NHS ester may be washed several times with ethyl acetate to remove traces of DSG. Mass spectral data confirms the formation of the peptide mono-NHS ester as a clean product. The solid mono-NHS ester may be dissolved in DMF and reacted with DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt (0.9 eq.) in the presence of DIEA (4 eq.) for 24 h. The linear peptide monomer glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester may be used in excess to maximize the consumption of the phospholipid ammonium salt because free phospholipid ammonium salt may complicate the isolation of monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates in highly pure form.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">The reaction mixture may be diluted with a 1:1 mixture of water (0.1% TFA) and CH<sub>3</sub>CN&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1, v/v) (0.1% TFA) (&#x2dc;100 mL), applied to a reversed phase C2 column (Kromasil&#xae; Prep C2, 10&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 50&#xd7;250 mm, flow rate 100 mL/min) and the column may be eluted with a 3:1 mixture of water (0.1% TFA) and CH<sub>3</sub>CN&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1, v/v) (0.1% TFA) to remove hydrophilic impurities. Then the product may be eluted using a gradient of CH<sub>3</sub>CN&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1) (0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA) (see Experimental Section for details). The collected fractions may be analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using an ELS detector which allows the detection of the desired product and the often difficult-to-separate DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid which has very little UV absorbance. This indicates the clear separation of the monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates and DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid. The pure product-containing fractions may be collected, concentrated on a rotary evaporator (to reduce the content of methanol) and freeze-dried to provide monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates as a colorless solid. In order to prepare the required quantity of the monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates, several runs may be conducted employing 0.5 g to 1.0 g of linear peptide monomer. In all cases the target monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugates may be were isolated in high yield and purity (e.g., 57-60% yield and &#x3e;99% purity).</p>

It should be understood that analogs and derivatives of the dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11) and the cyclic disulfide peptide monomers (12) and (13) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0451" num="0450">To accomplish synthesis of the dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11), the monomers used for this purpose optimally should be prepared in bulk. Then the monomers may be tethered to each other using di-succinimidyl glutarate as a linker to form the precursor dimer peptide (16), Acetyl-L-alanyl-glycyl-L-prolyl-L-threonyl-L-tryptophyl-L-cystinyl-L-glutamyl-L-aspartyl-L-aspartyl-L-tryptophyl-L-tyrosyl-L-tyrosyl-L-cystinyl-L-tryptophyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl-glycyl-L-threonyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-L-lysyl[Acetyl-L-valyl-L-cystinyl-L-tryptophyl-L-glutamyl-L-aspartyl-L-seryl-L-tryptophyl-glycyl-glycyl-L-glutamyl-L-valyl-L-cystinyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-arginyl-L-tyrosyl-L-aspartyl-L-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-glycyl-L-lysyl(8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl-8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl-glutaryl-L-lysyl)amide cyclic (2-12) disulfide]-amide cyclic (6-13) disulfide. Then conjugation of the purified precursor dimer peptide (16) to a DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt (18) again via disuccinimidyl glutarate may be used in order to provide the target dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11).</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">In preparing dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11), methods according to the present invention provide at least the following advantages: increased yield of automated chain elongation of the peptide sequences; reduced extent of racemization encountered during synthesis; avoidance of previously observed piperidine amide formation during synthesis of peptide monomer (13); cyclization of linear di-cysteine containing peptide precursors of (12) and (13) using procedures amenable to multigram scale yet allowing efficient and practical sample handling; efficient purification of monomer peptides (12) and (13); maximized yield and purity of precursor dimer peptide (16); development of a procedure for conjugation of the precursor dimer peptide (16) on larger scale; and development of purification protocols that would allow the ready separation of the target dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11) from phospholipid ammonium salt (18).</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">The dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11) may be prepared by automated synthesis of the peptide monomers (12), Ac-Ala-Gly-Pro-Thr-Trp-Cys-Glu-Asp-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr-Cys-Trp-Leu-Phe-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(ivDde)-NH2 cyclic (6-13) disulfide, and (13), Ac-Val-Cys-Trp-Glu-Asp-Ser-Trp-Gly-Gly-Glu-Val-Cys-Phe-Arg-Tyr-Asp-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(Adoa-Adoa)-NH<sub>2 </sub>cyclic (2-12) disulfide, their efficient coupling using disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) to give an ivDde-protected dimer, its deprotection and subsequent coupling to DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2</sub>, also via a glutaryl linkage. Using procedures according to the present invention, monomer peptides may be synthesized on a 10 mmol scale without complication and after HPLC purification may be obtained in about 20% yield and &#x3e;95% purity. Such methods allow dimer formation reactions and the subsequent conjugation to the phospholipid component providing formation of dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11) to be carried out on a gram scale. The precursor dimer peptide (16) may be obtained from the monomer peptides routinely in about 32% yield and &#x3e;95% purity. The dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (11) may be produced from the precursor dimer peptide (16) in 57-60% yield and &#x3e;99% purity.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">Dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugates may be prepared as described below. It should be appreciated that the numerical values referred to in this representative description of the synthesis of dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugates are representative.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">Described below is a representative method for the solid phase synthesis and disulfide cyclization of a peptide monomer (12) Ac-Ala-Gly-Pro-Thr-Trp-Cys-Glu-Asp-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr-Cys-Trp-Leu-Phe-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(ivDde)-NH2 cyclic (6-13) disulfide, and a peptide monomer (13), Ac-Val-Cys-Trp-Glu-Asp-Ser-Trp-Gly-Gly-Glu-Val-Cys-Phe-Arg-Tyr-Asp-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(Adoa-Adoa)-NH2 cyclic (2-12) disulfide.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">The peptides may be constructed as their C-terminal carboxamides on Pal-Peg-PS-resin (substitution level: 0.2 mmol/g). Chain elongation may be accomplished using Fmoc chemistry employing optimized deprotection and coupling protocols on a SONATA&#xae;/Pilot Peptide Synthesizer on a 10 mmol synthesis scale. The optimized synthesis of the peptides by automated SPSS may be developed by study of peptide impurities and the effect of changes of particular elements of the protocols on the overall yield and purity of the peptides obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">Analysis of the impurities obtained from nonoptimized syntheses of the monomer peptides indicates that the major problems are racemization, incomplete couplings and piperidine amide formation (presumably via an intermediate aspartimide or glutarimide intermediate), each of which contributes to suboptimal yield and purity. A dramatic decrease in formation of the piperidine amide may be attained by the use of 25% piperidine in DMF containing HOBt (0.1M) as the reagent for fmoc removal. Racemization may be considerably reduced by using DIC/HOBt as the activator for most couplings; and a 3 h coupling time using a four-fold excess of pre-activated Fmoc-amino acid with an intervening wash with anhydrous DMF (6&#xd7;). N-<sup>{tilde over (&#x3b1;)}</sup>Fmoc amino acids may be dissolved just before their coupling turn and pre-activated with DIC/HOBt in DMF for 4 min and transferred to the reaction vessel. This may be accomplished on the Sonata instrument by loading the solid Fmoc-amino acids into the amino acid vessels of the instrument and then programming the instrument to add DMF, HOBt/DMF and DIC/DMF sequentially with bubbling of the solution after each addition.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">To optimize the yield, the problem of aggregation of the resin during the synthesis of longer peptides, which can be devastating even when optimal coupling reagents are employed, may be addressed. To reduce aggregation during peptide assembly the strategy of using pseudoproline dipeptides to incorporate X-Thr or X-Ser (X refers to the n&#x2212;1 amino acid of the sequence) as dipeptides instead of sequential couplings of X and Thr or X and Ser, may be employed. Thus, for the monomer (12), Ac-Ala-Gly-Pro-Thr-Trp-Cys-Glu-Asp-Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr-Cys-Trp-Leu-Phe-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(ivDde)-NH2 cyclic (6-13) disulfide, sequential coupling of suitably protected Thr and Gly (shown in bold above) may be replaced by the single coupling of the pseudoproline dipeptide, Fmoc-Gly-Thr(&#x3c8;<sup>Me,Me</sup>pro)-OH. Similarly, in the synthesis of the monomer (13), Ac-Val-Cys-Trp-Glu-Asp-Ser-Trp-Gly-Gly-Glu-Val-Cys-Phe-Arg-Tyr-Asp-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys(Adoa-Adoa)-NH2 cyclic (2-12) disulfide, the pseudoproline dipeptide, Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-Ser(&#x3c8;<sup>Me,Me</sup>pro)-OH may be employed to replace the sequential coupling of suitably protected Ser and Asp (shown in bold font above). Further optimization may be accomplished by reducing the number of couplings by using Fmoc-Gly-Gly-Gly-OH and Fmoc-Gly-Gly-OH, in lieu of serial coupling of Fmoc-Gly-OH. Activation of -Gly-Gly-OH segments can lead to cyclization of the activated acid function with the distal amide function to produce an inactive diketopiperazine; this may reduce coupling yields in a time dependant manner. This problem may be avoided by addition of Fmoc-Glyn-OH (n=2, 3) to the reaction vessel and sequential addition of HOBt and DIC; the activated Fmoc-Glyn-OH may be intercepted by the resin-bound amino group before appreciable cyclization to the diketopiperazine takes place. After chain elongation is completed the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group may be removed from each of the peptides and the free amino group may be acetylated.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0458">The pseudo-orthogonally protected derivative, Fmoc-Lys(ivDde)-OH may be used to enable the selective unmasking of the &#x3b5;-amine of the C-terminal lysine of the monomer and dimer peptides and their subsequent functionalization, which also may be optimized. The ivDde group on the &#x3b5;-amine of the C-terminal lysine of each of the peptide monomers may be removed using 10% hydrazine in DMF. Then Fmoc-Adoa, for monomer (13) or Lys(ivDde) for monomer (12) may be appended to the exposed lysine &#x3b5;-amino group using 4 equivalents of the Fmoc amino acid and 4 equivalents each of DIC and HOBt in DMF for 10 h. After completion of the synthesis, the peptide sequence may be cleaved from the resin and deprotected using &#x201c;Reagent B&#x201d; (TFA:water:phenol:triisopropylsilane, 88:5:5:2, v/v/w/v) for 4 h. After the cleavage reaction was complete the peptide may be precipitated, washed with diethyl ether and dried.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0459">The following procedures for cyclization of the linear di-cysteine containing peptides may be used to provide optimal scale-up of monomer peptides. Generally the aerial oxidation of linear di-cysteine peptides may be carried out at ca 0.5-5 mg/mL (for the disclosed peptide monomers &#x2dc;0.18-1.8 mM in peptide, &#x2dc;0.36-3.6 mM in cysteine thiol). In order to work at significantly higher concentrations DMSO-assisted cyclization of di-cysteine peptides allows the cyclization of &#x2dc;10 g of the linear peptides in good yields in as little as &#x2dc;50 mL of solution. Therefore the crude linear di-cysteine peptides may be cyclized in 95% DMSO-H2O (5 mL/g) at pH 8.5 at ambient temperature. The progress of the cyclization may be routinely followed by mass spectroscopy and HPLC. Although cyclization may be essentially complete in &#x2dc;36 h, the reaction mixture may be generally stirred for up to 48 h. The cyclic disulfide peptides may be precipitated from the reaction mixture by dilution with CH<sub>3</sub>CN and the resulting off-white crude solid peptides may be collected by filtration. This is a convenient method for removing DMSO from the crude cyclic peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0460">Purification and isolation of monomer peptide (12), Ac-AGPTWC*EDDWYYC*WLFGTGGGK [K(ivDde)]-NH<sub>2 </sub>may be accomplished as described below. Note that as used herein the designation &#x201c;C*&#x201d; refers to a cysteine residue that contributes to a disulfide bond. Attempts to dissolve 0.5 g of the crude peptide in up to 300 mL of 30% CH<sub>3</sub>CN in water (0.1% TFA) have been unsuccessful. Therefore, as an alternative, the crude peptide, (0.5 g) may be dissolved in DMSO (5 mL/g) and this solution may be diluted to a final volume of 100 mL with 20% CH<sub>3</sub>CN-water. The solution may be filtered. The filtered solution may be loaded onto the preparative HPLC column (Waters, XTerra&#xae; Prep MS C18, 10&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 50&#xd7;250 mm) equilibrated with 10% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), and the column may be eluted with 10% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) to wash DMSO from the column. The composition of the eluent then may be ramped to 35% CH<sub>3</sub>CN-water (0.1% TFA) over 1 min, and a linear gradient may be initiated at a rate of 0.5%/min of CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA) and run for 50 min. Eluted fractions may be checked for purity on an analytical reversed phase C18 column (Waters XTerra&#xae; MS-C18, 10&#x3bc;, 120 &#x212b;, 4.6&#xd7;50 mm) and fractions containing the product in &#x3e;95% purity may be combined and freeze-dried. For each purification of 0.5 g of crude peptide 0.1 g (20%) for (12), Ac-AGPTWC*EDDWYYC*WLFGTGGGK [K(ivDde)]-NH2 may be isolated. Repeat purifications have been found to provide the peptide consistently in the same yield and purity.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0461">The peptide monomer (13), Ac-VC*WEDSWGGEVC*FRYDPGGGK(Adoa-Adoa)-NH<sub>2 </sub>may be purified and isolated as described for peptide monomer (12) except that the subject peptide may be dissolved in 20% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA) in 0.1% aqueous TFA (0.5 g peptide/100 mL) instead of a DMSO-containing diluent. The resulting solution of crude peptide may be loaded onto the preparative HPLC column (Waters, XTerra&#xae; Prep MS C18, 10&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 50&#xd7;250 mm, flow rate 100 mL/min) equilibrated with 10% CH<sub>3</sub>CN in water (0.1% TFA). The column may be eluted with 10% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA)/water (0.1% TFA) at 100 mL/min for 5 min. Then the composition of the eluent may be ramped to 30% CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA)/water (0.1% TFA) over 1 min and a linear gradient rate of 0.5%/min of CH<sub>3</sub>CN (0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA) may be initiated, and maintained until the desired peptide is completely eluted from the column. Product-containing fractions may be analyzed on a Waters XTerra&#xae; analytical reversed phase C-18 column (10&#x3bc;, 120 &#x212b;) and fractions containing the product in &#x3e;95% purity may be pooled and freeze-dried to afford the cyclic disulfide peptide monomer (13) (0.12 g, 24% yield) in &#x3e;95% purity. The 10 g of crude peptide monomer may be purified serially in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">Described below is a representative method for preparing the precursor dimer peptide (16), Ac-AGPTWCEDDWYYCWLFGTGGGK[Ac-VCWEDSWGGEVCFRYDPGGGK(-Adoa-Adoa-Glut-K)[&#x2014;NH<sub>2 </sub>cyclic (2-12) disulfide]-NH<sub>2 </sub>cyclic (6-13) disulfide. The preparation of the precursor dimer peptide may be accomplished by the tethering of the monomer peptides in a two step procedure. First, Ac-AGPTWC*EDDWYYC*WLFGTGGGK-[K(ivDde)]-NH<sub>2 </sub>(12) may be reacted with disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, 5 eq.) in DMF in the presence of DIEA (5 eq.) for 30 min. The reaction mixture may be diluted with ethyl acetate, which results in precipitation of the glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester of the peptide. The supernatant, containing unreacted DSG, may be decanted and the mono-NHS ester may be washed several times with ethyl acetate to remove traces of DSG. Mass spectral data confirms the formation of the mono-NHS ester as a clean product. This may be redissolved in DMF and reacted with monomer peptide Ac-VC*WEDSWGGEVC*FRYDPGGGK(Adoa-Adoa)-NH<sub>2 </sub>(13) in the presence of DIEA (5 eq). HPLC and MS results indicate the formation of the ivDde-bearing dimer, as a single major product. The ivDde protecting group on the &#x3b5;-amine of Lys of the dimer may be removed by stirring the reaction mixture with hydrazine (10%) in DMF for 20 min. The solution then may be acidified with TFA and diluted with 10% CH3CN (0.1% TFA)-water (0.1% TFA), applied to a preparative reversed phase C18 HPLC column and purified by a gradient elution of acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) into 0.1% aqueous TFA. In order to provide the needed quantity of the precursor dimer peptide, the reaction may be conducted employing from 0.5 g to as much as 1 g of each of the monomer peptides. In every case the required precursor dimer peptide may be isolated in &#x2dc;32% yield and &#x3e;95% purity confirming the reproducibility and scalability of the procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">The final step in the synthesis may be the conjugation of DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt (18) to the precursor dimer peptide. As mentioned previously, the PEG2000 moiety of DSPE-PEG2000-NH2 is nominally comprised of 45 ethylene glycol units. It should be understood, however, that this material is a distribution of PEG containing species whose centroid is the nominal compound containing 45 ethylenoxy units.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">Conjugation of the DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>to the precursor dimer peptide may be accomplished by preparation of a glutaric acid monoamide mono NHS ester of the precursor dimer and reaction of this with the free amino group of the phospholipid ammonium salt. Thus the ivDde bearing precursor dimer peptide (16) may be reacted with DSG (4 eq.) in DMF in the presence of DIEA (5 eq.) for 30 min. As in the preparation of the precursor dimer peptide the solution may be diluted with ethyl acetate to precipitate the glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester of the dimer (17), as a solid. The supernatant may be decanted to remove the un-reacted DSG. The solid glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester of the dimer peptide (17) may then be washed several times with ethyl acetate to remove traces of DSG. Mass spectral results confirm the formation of the glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester of the peptide dimer as a clean product.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">The dimer glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester (17) may be dissolved in DMF-CH2Cl2 (8:2) and reacted with DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt (0.9 eq.) in the presence of DIEA (4 eq.) for 24 h. The NHS ester (17) may be used in excess to maximize the consumption of the phospholipid ammonium salt because any free phospholipid may complicate the purification and isolation of the final product. The reaction mixture may be diluted with water (0.1% TFA)-CH3CN&#x2014;CH3OH (1:1) (0.1% TFA) (&#x2dc;100 mL), applied to a reversed phase C4 column (Kromasil&#xae; Prep C4, 10&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 50&#xd7;250 mm, flow rate 100 mL/min) and the column may be eluted with water (0.1% TFA)-CH<sub>3</sub>CN&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1) (0.1% TFA) solvent mixture to remove hydrophilic impurities. Then the product may be eluted using a gradient of CH<sub>3</sub>CN&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1) (0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA). The collected fractions may be analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using an ELS detector which allows the detection of the desired product and the often difficult to separate DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt which has no strong UV chromophore. This indicates the clear separation of dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate and DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>phospholipid ammonium salt. The pure product-containing fractions may be collected, concentrated on a rotary evaporator (to reduce the content of methanol) and freeze-dried to provide the dimer peptide phospholipid conjugate as a colorless solid.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">In order to prepare the required quantity of the dimer peptide phospholipid conjugate, several runs may be conducted employing 0.5 g to 1.0 g of the precursor dimer peptide. In all cases the target dimer peptide phospholipid conjugate may be isolated in 57-60% yield and in &#x3e;99% purity. The bulk quantity of dimer peptide phospholipid conjugate, obtained from the serial runs described above may be obtained by dissolution of the product from the individual runs in t-butanol-acetonitrile-water (1:1:3) followed by lyophilization. The procedure of Ellman for quantitative estimation of free thiol may be applied to the bulk sample of the dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate; free thiol, if present will be below the limit of detection. Amino acid composition analysis gives results within the acceptable limits, supporting the assigned structure of the peptide derivative. MALDI-TOF mass spectral analysis also supports the presumed structure of the dimeric peptide phospholipid conjugate.</p>
<heading id="h-0338" level="1">Methods of Preparation of Dimer-Phospholipid Conjugates Having Low or Negligible Levels of TFA</heading>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">The present invention also provides methods for producing dimeric peptide-phospholipid conjugates having very low levels of TFA. While certain methods provide for the synthesis and purification of such conjugates on a gram scale, formation of a lyso-version of the conjugates has been observed upon storage of lyophilized material at 5&#xb0; C. or upon storage of aqueous solutions of the conjugates. It is believed that the lyso-compound is formed by TFA-promoted acid hydrolysis of one of the phospholipid fatty acid esters in dimer peptide-phospholipid conjugates.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">To obtain the phospholipid peptide as a stable material bearing a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion, highly efficient methods for obtaining dimer peptide-phospholipid conjugates were discovered which convert the TFA salts of the dimer peptide-phospholipid conjugate, or any suitable precursor(s), to analogous pharmaceutical acetate salt(s). Representative embodiments of these methods are provided below.</p>

<p id="p-0473" num="0472">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 110 and 111</figref>, in certain embodiments monomer peptide components of heterodimer peptide (27), namely TFA salts compounds (22) and (25), are subjected to ion exchange chromatography on the macroporous sulfonic acid cation exchange resin AG MP-50 using a step gradient of ammonium acetate to convert them to their acetate salts. Then the two peptide monomer acetates (23) and (26) may be tethered through a glutaryl linker to form the dimer (27) as an acetate salt. Purification of the crude dimer acetate salt of (27), by C-18 preparative HPLC using a linear gradient method employing CH<sub>3</sub>CN H<sub>2</sub>O each containing 10 mM NH4OAc provides the pure dimer acetate (27). Conjugation of this dimer to DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>(29) and final purification of the crude mixture by C-3 preparative HPLC using CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O/NH<sub>4</sub>OAc provides compound (21) as the acetate salt.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">More specifically, compounds (22), (25) and (27) all bear side-chain carboxylic acid and amino groups. AG MP-50, a macroporous cation-exchange resin, may be used to allow full penetration of the resin by the peptides and to exploit the immobilization of the peptides via their basic (amino and guanidine groups). TFA salts of the peptides may be adsorbed to an AG MP-50 column (sulfonic acid form) and the column may be washed with water and then eluted with a step gradient of NH<sub>4</sub>OAc in 0 or 30% CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O, depending on the solubility of the peptides. The peptides may be eluted at about 600 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc and the acetate form of the peptides then may be obtained in pure form. Both IC fluorine analysis and CE TFA counter-ion analysis consistently show very low TFA content of the peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">Preferred methods also include redissolution/relyophilization of the final peptides several times to remove residual NH4OAc. Otherwise, residual traces of NH<sub>4</sub>OAc present in the peptides may give rise to free ammonia in the presence of DIEA. This may result in the formation of unwanted peptide-Glut-amide as a major product in subsequent preparation of (27) from the monomers (23) and (26) or final phospholipid-peptide conjugate (21) from the acetate salt of (27).</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 111</figref>, another embodiment provides the conversion of the TFA salt of dimer (27) to its analogous acetate salt by ion exchange chromatography on the macroporous sulfonic acid cation exchange resin AG MP-50. This dimer acetate then may be conjugated with DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>followed by purification of the crude material by C-3 preparative column using CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O/NH<sub>4</sub>OAc to give the final compound (21) as an acetate salt.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">While the methods described above and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 110 and 111</figref> provide excellent results, the second approach has the advantage of requiring fewer steps. Additional details are provided below in the Examples section.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 112</figref>, another embodiment provides methods for providing dimeric conjugates having minimal amounts of TFA utilizing the size differential between the phospholipid-peptide conjugate (21) and TFA ions. In this embodiment 21&#x25cf;nTFA adduct may be eluted down a size exclusion column in the presence of ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The crude 21&#x25cf;nTFA initially may be freed of the lyso-compound by preparative HPLC on a Zorbax C-3 column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile into water. Both phases may be buffered with 10 mM ammonium acetate. This provides separation of the lyso-compound as indicated by analytical HPLC.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">To further reduce the amount of TFA, the material may be applied to a Sephadex G-25 column and eluted with aqueous ammonium bicarbonate solution. The eluate may be monitored by HPLC. Product-containing fractions may be pooled and lyophilized to afford the desired material (21) essentially free of TFA and with high recovery rates. Additional detail is provided below in the Examples section.</p>

<p id="p-0488" num="0487">The preferred microbubble suspensions of the present invention may be prepared from phospholipids using known processes such as a freeze-drying or spray-drying solutions of the crude phospholipids in a suitable solvent or using the processes set forth in EP 554213; WO 04/069284; U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,774; U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,292; EP 744962; EP 682530; U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,610; U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,518; U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,725; EP 474833; U.S. Pat. No. 5,271,928; U.S. Pat.

No. 5,908,610, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Preferably, as disclosed in International patent application WO 04/069284, a microemulsion can be prepared which contains the phospholipids (e.g DSPC and/or DSPA) in admixture with a lyoprotecting agent (such as, for instance, carbohydrates, sugar alcohols, polyglycols and mixtures thereof, as indicated in detail hereinafter) and optionally other amphiphilic materials (such as stearic acid), dispersed in an emulsion of water and of a water immiscible organic solvent. Preferred organic solvents are those having solubility in water of 1.0 g/l or lower, preferably lower about 0.01 g/l, and include, for instance, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 1-octene, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cyclooctane, 1-methyl-cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, di-butyl ether and di-isopropylketone, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 2-chloro-1-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,2-trifluoroethane (enflurane), 2-chloro-2-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (isoflurane), tetrachloro-1,1-difluoroethane, perfluoropentane, perfluorohexane, perfluoroheptane, perfluorononane, perfluorobenzene, perfluorodecalin, methylperfluorobutylether, methylperfluoroisobutylether, ethylperfluorobutylether, ethylperfluoroisobutylether and mixtures thereof. The peptide-phospholipid conjugate of the invention can be admixed together with the phospholipid forming the microvesicle's envelope, in the microemulsion. Preferably, an aqueous suspension of the peptide-phospholipid conjugate and of a PE-PEG (e.g. DSPE-PEG2000) is first prepared, which is then admixed together with an aqueous-organic emulsion comprising the phospholipid and the lyoprotecting agent. Preferably said mixing is effected under heating, e.g. form about 40&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0488">Prior to formation of the suspension of microbubbles by dispersion in an aqueous carrier, the freeze dried or spray dried phospholipid powders are contacted with air or another gas. When contacted with the aqueous carrier the powdered phospholipids whose structure has been disrupted will form lamellarized or laminarized segments that will stabilize the microbubbles of the gas dispersed therein. This method permits production of suspensions of microbubbles that are stable even when stored for prolonged periods and are obtained by simple dissolution of the dried laminarized phospholipids (which have been stored under a desired gas) without shaking or any violent agitation.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489">Alternatively, microbubbles can be prepared by suspending a gas into an aqueous solution at high agitation speed, as disclosed e.g. in WO 97/29783. A further process for preparing microbubbles is disclosed in WO 2004/069284, herein incorporated by reference, which comprises preparing an emulsion of an organic solvent in an aqueous medium in the presence of a phospholipid and subsequently lyophilizing said emulsion, after optional washing and/or filtration steps. Some preferred preparation methods are disclosed in the examples.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">The formulation for the preparation of the gas-filled microbubbles may advantageously further comprise a lyophilization additive, such as an agent with cryoprotective and/or lyoprotective effect and/or a bulking agent, for example an amino-acid such as glycine; a carbohydrate, e.g. a sugar such as sucrose, mannitol, maltose, trehalose, glucose, lactose or a cyclodextrin, or a polysaccharide such as dextran; or a polyglycol such as polyethylene glycol (e.g. PEG-4000).</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">Any of these ultrasound compositions should also be, as far as possible, isotonic with blood. Hence, before injection, small amounts of isotonic agents may be added to any of above ultrasound contrast agent suspensions. The isotonic agents are physiological solutions commonly used in medicine and they comprise aqueous saline solution (0.9% NaCl), 2.6% glycerol solution, 5% dextrose solution, etc. Additionally, the ultrasound compositions may include standard pharmaceutically acceptable additives, including, for example, emulsifying agents, viscosity modifiers, cryoprotectants, lyoprotectants, bulking agents etc.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">Any biocompatible gas may be used in the ultrasound contrast agents of the invention. The term &#x201c;gas&#x201d; as used herein includes any substances (including mixtures) substantially in gaseous form at the normal human body temperature. The gas may thus include, for example, air, nitrogen, oxygen, CO<sub>2</sub>, argon, xenon or krypton, fluorinated gases (including for example, perfluorocarbons, SF<sub>6</sub>, SeF<sub>6</sub>) a low molecular weight hydrocarbon (e.g., containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms), for example, an alkane such as methane, ethane, a propane, a butane or a pentane, a cycloalkane such as cyclopropane, cyclobutane or cyclopentene, an alkene such as ethylene, propene, propadiene or a butene, or an alkyne such as acetylene or propyne and/or mixtures thereof. However, fluorinated gases are preferred. Fluorinated gases include materials that contain at least one fluorine atom such as SF<sub>6</sub>, freons (organic compounds containing one or more carbon atoms and fluorine, i.e., CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, CBrF<sub>3</sub>, CCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>ClF<sub>5</sub>, and CBrClF<sub>2</sub>) and perfluorocarbons. The term perfluorocarbon refers to compounds containing only carbon and fluorine atoms and includes, in particular, saturated, unsaturated, and cyclic perfluorocarbons. The saturated perfluorocarbons, which are usually preferred, have the formula CnFn+2, where n is from 1 to 12, preferably from 2 to 10, most preferably from 3 to 8 and even more preferably from 3 to 6. Suitable perfluorocarbons include, for example, CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>18</sub>, and C<sub>9</sub>F<sub>20</sub>. Most preferably the gas or gas mixture comprises SF<sub>6 </sub>or a perfluorocarbon selected from the group consisting of C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8 </sub>C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>F<sub>18</sub>, with C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10 </sub>being particularly preferred. See also WO 97/29783, WO 98/53857, WO 98/18498, WO 98/18495, WO 98/18496, WO 98/18497, WO 98/18501, WO 98/05364, WO 98/17324. In a preferred embodiment the gas comprises C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>10 </sub>or SF<sub>6</sub>, optionally in admixture with air, nitrogen, oxygen or carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">In certain circumstances it may be desirable to include a precursor to a gaseous substance (e.g., a material that is capable of being converted to a gas in vivo, often referred to as a &#x201c;gas precursor&#x201d;). Preferably the gas precursor and the gas it produces are physiologically acceptable. The gas precursor may be pH-activated, photo-activated, temperature activated, etc. For example, certain perfluorocarbons may be used as temperature activated gas precursors. These perfluorocarbons, such as perfluoropentane, have a liquid/gas phase transition temperature above room temperature (or the temperature at which the agents are produced and/or stored) but below body temperature; thus they undergo a phase shift and are converted to a gas within the human body.</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">As discussed above, the gas can comprise a mixture of gases. The following combinations are particularly preferred gas mixtures: a mixture of gases (A) and (B) in which, at least one of the gases (B), present in an amount of between 0.5-41% by vol., has a molecular weight greater than 80 daltons and is a fluorinated gas and (A) is selected from the group consisting of air, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and mixtures thereof, the balance of the mixture being gas A.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">Unless it contains a hyperpolarized gas, known to require special storage conditions, the lyophilized product may be stored and transported without need of temperature control of its environment and in particular it may be supplied to hospitals and physicians for on site formulation into a ready-to-use administrable suspension without requiring such users to have special storage facilities. Preferably in such a case it can be supplied in the form of a two-component kit, which can include two separate containers or a dual-chamber container. In the former case preferably the container is a conventional septum-sealed vial, wherein the vial containing the lyophilized residue of step b) is sealed with a septum through which the carrier liquid may be injected using an optionally prefilled syringe. In such a case the syringe used as the container of the second component is also used then for injecting the contrast agent. In the latter case, preferably the dual-chamber container is a dual-chamber syringe and once the lyophilizate has been reconstituted and then suitably mixed or gently shaken, the container can be used directly for injecting the contrast agent. In both cases means for directing or permitting application of sufficient bubble forming energy into the contents of the container are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">However, as noted above, in the stabilised contrast agents according to the invention the size of the gas microbubbles is substantially independent of the amount of agitation energy applied to the reconstituted dried product. Accordingly, no more than gentle hand shaking is generally required to give reproducible products with consistent microbubble size.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0497">It can be appreciated by one of ordinary skilled in the art that other two-chamber reconstitution systems capable of combining the dried powder with the aqueous solution in a sterile manner are also within the scope of the present invention. In such systems, it is particularly advantageous if the aqueous phase can be interposed between the water-insoluble gas and the environment, to increase shelf life of the product. Where a material necessary for forming the contrast agent is not already present in the container (e.g. a targeting ligand to be linked to the phospholipid during reconstitution), it can be packaged with the other components of the kit, preferably in a form or container adapted to facilitate ready combination with the other components of the kit.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0498">No specific containers, vial or connection systems are required; the present invention may use conventional containers, vials and adapters. The only requirement is a good seal between the stopper and the container. The quality of the seal, therefore, becomes a matter of primary concern; any degradation of seal integrity could allow undesirable substances to enter the vial. In addition to assuring sterility, vacuum retention is essential for products stoppered at ambient or reduced pressures to assure safe and proper reconstitution. The stopper may be a compound or multicomponent formulation based on an elastomer, such as poly(isobutylene) or butyl rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0499">In ultrasound applications the contrast agents formed by phospholipid stabilized microbubbles can be administered, for example, in doses such that the amount of phospholipid injected is in the range 0.1 to 200 &#x3bc;g/kg body weight, preferably from about 0.1 to 30 &#x3bc;g/kg.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">Ultrasound imaging techniques that can be used in accordance with the present invention include known techniques, such as color Doppler, power Doppler, Doppler amplitude, stimulated acoustic imaging, and two- or three-dimensional imaging techniques. Imaging may be done in harmonic (resonant frequency) or fundamental modes, with the second harmonic preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">The ultrasound contrast agents of the present invention may further be used in a variety of therapeutic imaging methods. The term therapeutic imaging includes within its meaning any method for the treatment of a disease in a patient which comprises the use of a contrast imaging agent (e.g. for the delivery of a therapeutic agent to a selected receptor or tissue), and which is capable of exerting or is responsible to exert a biological effect in vitro and/or in vivo. Therapeutic imaging may advantageously be associated with the controlled localized destruction of the gas-filled microvesicles, e.g. by means of an ultrasound burst at high acoustic pressure (typically higher than the one generally employed in non-destructive diagnostic imaging methods). This controlled destruction may be used, for instance, for the treatment of blood clots (a technique also known as sonothrombolysis), optionally in combination with the localized release of a suitable therapeutic agent. Alternatively, said therapeutic imaging may include the delivery of a therapeutic agent into cells, as a result of a transient membrane permeabilization at the cellular level induced by the localized burst of the microvesicles. This technique can be used, for instance, for an effective delivery of genetic material into the cells; optionally, a drug can be locally delivered in combination with genetic material, thus allowing a combined pharmaceutical/genetic therapy of the patient (e.g. in case of tumor treatment).</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">The term &#x201c;therapeutic agent&#x201d; includes within its meaning any substance, composition or particle which may be used in any therapeutic application, such as in methods for the treatment of a disease in a patient, as well as any substance which is capable of exerting or responsible to exert a biological effect in vitro and/or in vivo. Therapeutic agents thus include any compound or material capable of being used in the treatment (including diagnosis, prevention, alleviation, pain relief or cure) of any pathological status in a patient (including malady, affliction, disease lesion or injury). Examples of therapeutic agents are drugs, pharmaceuticals, bioactive agents, cytotoxic agents, chemotherapy agents, radiotherapeutic agents, proteins, natural or synthetic peptides, including oligopeptides and polypeptides, vitamins, steroids and genetic material, including nucleosides, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides and plasmids.</p>

<heading id="h-0341" level="1">Method 1 for the ACT 357 MPS and ACT 496 MOS Synthesizers</heading>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">The peptides were synthesized on NovaSyn TGR (Rink amide) resin (0.2 mmol/g) using the Advanced ChemTech ACT 357 or ACT 496 Synthesizers employing Fmoc peptide synthesis protocols, specifically using HOBt/DIC as the coupling reagents and NMP as the solvent. The Fmoc was removed by treating the Nova-Syn TGR (Rink amide-available from NovaBiochem, San Diego Calif.) resin-bound peptide with 25% piperidine in DMF twice (4 min and 10 min). All amino acids were dissolved in NMP (DMF was added when the amino acid was not soluble in pure NMP). The concentration of the amino acid was 0.25M, and the concentrations for HOBt and DIC respectively were 0.5 M.</p>
<p id="h-0342" num="0000">For a 0.04 mmol scale synthesis:</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505">A typical amino acid coupling cycle (not including wash steps) was to dispense piperidine solution (2.4 mL) to each well and mix for 4 min, then empty all wells. NMP (320 &#x3bc;L), HOBt solution (320 &#x3bc;L, 4 eq), amino acid (640 &#x3bc;L, 4 eq) and DIC (320 &#x3bc;L, 4 eq) solutions were dispensed to each well. The coupling time was 3 h; then the resin was washed. The cycle was repeated for each amino acid. After the last amino acid coupling, the resin-bound peptide was treated with 25% piperidine to remove the Fmoc protecting group. After washing, the resin bound peptide was capped with 1.0M Ac<sub>2</sub>O (1.2 mL per well) and diisopropylethylamine in DMF, optionally including varying amounts of HOBt in the mixture for 30 min. The resin was washed with methanol and then dichloromethane and dried. Cleavage of the peptides from the resin and side-chain deprotection was accomplished using Reagent B for 4.5 h. The cleavage solutions were collected and the resins were washed with an additional aliquot of Reagent B. The combined solutions were concentrated to dryness. Ether was added to the residue with swirling or stirring to precipitate the peptides. The ether was decanted, and solid was collected. This procedure was repeated 2-3 times to remove impurities. The crude linear peptides were dissolved in DMSO and water mixtures, and purified by HPLC (column: Waters Associates Xterra C18, 19&#xd7;50 mm; solvents: H<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% TFA and CH<sub>3</sub>CN with 0.1% TFA; UV 220 &#x3bc;m; Flow rate: 50-60 mL/min). The solutions containing the peptide were lyophilized to give the desired peptides as white fluffy lyophilizates (&#x3e;90% purity). The purified linear di-cysteine containing peptides were dissolved in water, mixtures of water-acetonitrile, or mixtures of water-DMSO at concentrations between 0.1 mg/mL and 2.0 mg/mt. The choice of solvent was a function of the solubility of the crude peptide in the solvent. The pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 7.5-8.5 with aqueous ammonia, aqueous ammonium carbonate or aqueous ammonium bicarbonate. The mixture was stirred vigorously in air for 24-48 hrs. In the case of non-DMSO containing solvent systems, the pH of the solution was adjusted to pH 2 with aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture was lyophilized to provide the crude cyclic disulfide containing peptide. The cyclic disulfide peptide was then dissolved to a volume of 1-2 mL in aqueous (0.1% TFA) containing a minimum of acetonitrile (0.1% TFA). The resulting solution was loaded onto a reverse phase column and the desired compound obtained by a gradient elution of acetonitrile into water, employing a C18, or C8 reverse phase semipreparative or preparative HPLC column. In the case of the DMSO-containing solutions, the solution was diluted until the DMSO concentration was minimal without precipitation of the peptide. The resulting mixture was quickly acidified to pH 2 with dilute trifluoroacetic acid and loaded onto the reverse phase HPLC system and purified as described. Fractions containing the desired materials were pooled and the peptides isolated by lyophilization.</p>

<p id="p-0522" num="0521">S-acetylthioglycolic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (SATA) (0.0055 mmol) was added to a solution of a peptide (0.005 mmol, obtained from Methods 1-5 with a free amine) in DMF (0.25 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 6 h. The volatiles were removed under vacuum and the residue was purified by preparative HPLC using acetonitrile-water containing 0.1% TFA. Fractions containing the pure product were collected and freeze-dried to yield the mercaptoacetylated peptide. The mercaptoacetylated peptide was characterized by ESI-MS and the purity was determined by reverse phase HPLC analysis employing a linear gradient of acetonitrile into water (both containing 0.1% TFA).</p>

<p id="p-0525" num="0524">Purified peptides from method 5, after disulfide cyclization, was coupled with S-acetylthioglycolic acid (1.5-10 eq.)/HOBt (1.5-10 eq.)/DIC (1.5-10 eq.) in NMP for 2-16 hours at room temperature. The mixture was then purified by preparative HPLC; the fractions containing pure peptide were combined and lyophilized. In the case of compounds with another lysine protected by an ivDde group, the deprotection reaction employed 2% hydrazine in DMSO for 3 h at room temperature. Purification of the reaction mixture afforded pure peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0525">In the case when preparing a compound with S-acetylthioglycolic acid coupled to two aminodioxaoctanoic acid groups and the peptide, the purified peptide from method 5 (having a free amino group), was coupled to AcSCH<sub>2</sub>CO&#x2014;(NH&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CO)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;OH (30 eq.)/HOBt (30 eq.)/DIC (30 eq.) in NMP for 40 hours at room temperature.

<heading id="h-0371" level="1">Preparation of Homodimers and Heterodimers</heading>
<p id="p-0528" num="0527">The required purified peptides were prepared by SPPS using Method 5. To prepare homodimers, half of the peptide needed to prepare the dimer was dissolved in DMF and treated with 10 equivalents of glutaric acid bis N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis and mass spectroscopy. At completion of the reaction, the volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue was washed with ethyl acetate to remove unreacted bis-NHS ester. The residue was dried, re-dissolved in anhydrous DMF and treated with another half portion of the peptide in the presence of 2 equivalents of DIEA. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h. This mixture was applied directly to a Waters Associates C-18 XTerra reverse phase HPLC column and purified by elution with a linear gradient of acetonitrile into water (both containing 0.1% TFA).</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0528">In the case of heterodimers, one of the monomers was reacted with the bis NHS ester of glutaric acid and after washing off the excess of bis NHS ester, the second peptide was added in the presence of DIEA. After the reaction, the mixture was purified by preparative HPLC.</p>

<p id="p-0530" num="0529">Chimeric fusions of Ig Fc region with human KDR (#357-KD-050), murine KDR (#443-KD-050), human VEGFR-1 (#321-FL-050), human VEGFR-3 (#349-F4-050), and human Trail R4 (#633-TR-100) were purchased in carrier-free form (no BSA) from R &#x26; D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). Trail R4 Fc is an irrelevant Fc fusion protein with the same Fc fusion region as the target Fc fusion (KDR Fc) and is used to deplete the libraries of Fc binders. VEGF<sub>165 </sub>(#100-20) was purchased in carrier-free form from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, N.J.). Protein A Magnetic Beads (#100.02) were purchased from Dynal (Oslo, Norway). Heparin (#H-3393) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo.). A 2-component tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) system was purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, Md.).</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0530">In the following procedures, microtiter plates were washed with a Bio-Tek 404 plate washer (Winooski, Vt.). ELISA signals were read with a Bio-Tek plate reader (Winooski, Vt.). Agitation of 96-well plates was on a LabQuake shaker (Labindustries, Berkeley, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0531">Eight M13 phage display libraries were prepared for screening against immobilized KDR and VEGF/KDR targets: Cyclic peptide display libraries TN6/VI, TN7/IV, TN8/IX, TN9/IV, TN10/IX, TN12/I, and MTN13/I, and a linear display library, Lin20. The design of these libraries has been described, supra.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0532">The DNA encoding the library was synthesized with constant DNA on either side so that the DNA can be PCR amplified using Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.), cleaved with NcoI and PstI, and ligated to similarly cleaved phage display vector. XL1-Blue MFR&#x2032; <i>E. coli </i>cells were transformed with the ligated DNA. All of the libraries were constructed in same manner.</p>
<p id="h-0374" num="0000">KDR Selection Protocol in the Presence of Heparin</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0533">Protein A Magnetic Beads were blocked once with 1&#xd7;PBS (pH 7.5), 0.01% Tween-20, 0.1% HSA (Blocking Buffer) for 30 minutes at room temperature and then washed five times with 1&#xd7;PBS (pH 7.5), 0.01% Tween-20, 5 &#x3bc;g/mL heparin (PBSTH Buffer).</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0534">The cyclic peptide, or &#x201c;constrained loop&#x201d;, libraries were pooled for the initial screening into two pools: TN6/VI, TN7/IV and TN8/IX were in one pool; TN9/IV, TN10/1&#xd7; and TN12/I were in the second pool. The two pooled libraries and the linear library (Lin20) were depleted against Trail R4 Fc fusion (an irrelevant Fc fusion) and then selected against KDR Fc fusion. 10<sup>11 </sup>plaque forming units (pfu) from each library per 100 &#x3bc;L PBSTH were pooled together, e.g., 3 pooled libraries would result in a total volume of &#x2dc;350 &#x3bc;l in PBSTH.</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0535">To prepare the irrelevant Fc fusion beads, 500 &#x3bc;l of Trail R4-Fc fusion (0.1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l stock in PBST (no heparin)) were added to 1000 &#x3bc;l of washed, blocked protein A magnetic beads. The fusion was allowed to bind to the beads overnight with agitation at 4&#xb0; C. The next day, the magnetic beads were washed 5 times with PBSTH. Each phage pool was incubated with 50 &#x3bc;l of Trail R4 Fc fusion beads on a Labquake shaker for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). After incubation, the phage supernatant was removed and incubated with another 50 &#x3bc;L of Trail R4 beads. This was repeated for a total of 5 rounds of depletion, to remove non-specific Fc fusion and bead binding phage from the libraries.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0536">To prepare the KDR target beads, 500 &#x3bc;l of KDR-Fc fusion (0.1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;l stock in PBST (no heparin)) were added to 500 &#x3bc;L of washed, blocked beads. The KDR-Fc fusion was allowed to bind overnight with agitation at 4&#xb0; C. The next day, the beads were washed 5 times with PBSTH. Each depleted library pool was added to 100 &#x3bc;L of KDR-Fc beads and allowed to incubate on a LabQuake shaker for 1 hour at RT. Beads were then washed as rapidly as possible with 5&#xd7;1 mL PBSTH using a magnetic stand (Promega) to separate the beads from the wash buffer. Phage still bound to beads after the washing were eluted once with 250 &#x3bc;l of VEGF (50 &#x3bc;g/mL, &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;M) in PBSTH for 1 hour at RT on a LabQuake shaker. The 1-hour elution was removed and saved. After the first elution, the beads were incubated again with 250 &#x3bc;l of VEGF (50 &#x3bc;g/mL, &#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;M) overnight at RT on a LabQuake shaker. The two VEGF elutions were kept separate and a small aliquot taken from each for titering. Each elution was mixed with an aliquot of XL1-Blue MRF&#x2032; (or other F&#x2032; cell line) <i>E. coli </i>cells that had been chilled on ice after having been grown to mid-logarithmic phase. The remaining beads after VEGF elution were also mixed with cells to amplify the phage still bound to the beads, i.e., KDR-binding phage that had not been competed off by the two VEGF incubations (1-hour and overnight (O/N) elutions). After approximately 15 minutes at room temperature, the phage/cell mixtures were spread onto Bio-Assay Dishes (243&#xd7;243&#xd7;18 mm, Nalge Nunc) containing 250 mL of NZCYM agar with 50 &#x3bc;g/mL of ampicillin. The plate was incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C. The next day, each amplified phage culture was harvested from its respective plate. Over the next day, the input, output and amplified phage cultures were titered for FOI (i.e., Fraction of Input=phage output divided by phage input).</p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0537">In the first round, each pool yielded three amplified eluates. These eluates were panned for 2-3 more additional rounds of selection using &#x2dc;10<sup>10 </sup>input phage/round according to the same protocol as described above. For each additional round, the KDR-Fc beads were prepared the night before the round was initiated. For the elution step in subsequent rounds, the amplified elution re-screen on KDR-Fc beads was always eluted in the same manner, and all other elutions were treated as washes. For example, for the amplified elution recovered by using the still-bound beads to infect <i>E. coli</i>, the 1-hour and overnight VEGF elutions were performed and then discarded as washes. Then the beads were used to again infect <i>E. coli </i>and produce the next round amplified elution. Using this procedure, each library pool only yielded three final elutions at the end of the selection. Two pools and one linear library, therefore, yielded a total of 9 final elutions at the end of the selection.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0538">This selection procedure was repeated for all libraries in the absence of heparin in all binding buffers, i.e., substituting PBST (PBS (pH 7.5), 0.01% Tween-20) for PBSTH in all steps.</p>
<p id="h-0375" num="0000">KDR Selection Protocol in the Absence of Heparin</p>
<p id="p-0540" num="0539">++A true TN11/1 library was used to screen for KDR binders. The same selection protocol as above (KDR Selection Protocol in the Presence of Heparin) was used, except heparin was omitted. The three elution conditions were VEGF elution (1 uM; 1 hr; same as original protocol), Dimer D6 elution (0.1 uM; 1 hr), and then bead elution (same as above). TN11/1 alone was used in the selection and screening. For selected peptides, see Table 27 and Consensus Sequence 9A.</p>

<p id="p-0542" num="0541">Two pools of constrained loop libraries and a linear library (Lin20) were prepared as before and then depleted against KDR Fc fusion alone, instead of Trail-R4 Fc fusion, to remove binders to the receptor without bound VEGF. Once depleted, the libraries were selected against the KDR:VEGF<sub>165 </sub>complex.</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0542">To prepare KDR-Fc fusion depletion beads, 1 mL of KDR-Fc fusion (0.1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L stock in PBST (no heparin)) was added to 1 mL of washed, blocked beads. The fusion was allowed to bind overnight with agitation at 4&#xb0; C. The next day, the beads were washed 5 times with PBSTH. Each phage pool was incubated with 50 &#x3bc;l of KDR-Fc fusion beads on a LabQuake shaker for 1 hour at RT. After incubation, the phage supernatant was removed and incubated with another 50 &#x3bc;L of KDR-Fc beads. This was repeated for a total of 5 rounds of depletion.</p>
<p id="p-0544" num="0543">To prepare the KDR:VEGF complex beads, 300 &#x3bc;L of KDR-Fc fusion beads from above were incubated with 15 &#x3bc;L of VEGF (1 mg/mL). VEGF was allowed to bind for 1 hour at RT. The beads were washed 5 times with PBSTH. Each depleted library pool was added to 100 &#x3bc;l of KDR:VEGF complex beads and allowed to incubate on a LabQuake shaker for 1 hour at RT. Beads were then washed as rapidly as possible with 5&#xd7;1 mL PBSTH using a magnetic stand (Promega) to separate the beads from the wash buffer. To elute the phage still bound after washing, the beads were mixed with cells to amplify the phage still bound to the beads. After approximately 15 minutes at room temperature, the phage/cell mixtures were spread onto Bio-Assay Dishes (243&#xd7;243&#xd7;18 mm, Nalge Nunc) containing 250 mL of NZCYM agar with 50 &#x3bc;g/mL of ampicillin. The plate was incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C. The next day, each amplified phage culture was harvested from its respective plate. Over the next day, the input, output and amplified phage cultures were titered for FOI.

<p id="p-0545" num="0544">100 &#x3bc;l of KDR-Fc fusion or Trail R4-Fc fusion (1 &#x3bc;g/mL) were added to duplicate Immulon II plates, to every well, and allowed to incubate at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. Each plate was washed twice with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20). The wells were filled to the top with 1&#xd7;PBS, 1% BSA and allowed to incubate at RT for 2 hours. Each plate was washed once with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20).</p>
<p id="p-0546" num="0545">To assess binding to KDR:VEGF complex, another set of KDR plates was prepared as above and then 100 &#x3bc;L of VEGF (1 &#x3bc;g/mL) in PBST was added to each KDR well and allowed to incubate at RT for 30 minutes. Each plate was then washed with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20).</p>
<p id="p-0547" num="0546">Once the plates were prepared, each overnight phage culture was diluted 1:1 (or to 10<sup>10 </sup>pfu if using purified phage stock) with PBS, 0.05% Tween-20, 1% BSA. 100 &#x3bc;l of each diluted culture was added and allowed to incubate at RT for 2-3 hours. Each plate was washed 5 times with PBST. The binding phage were visualized by adding 100 &#x3bc;l of a 1:10,000 dilution of HRP-anti-M13 antibody conjugate (Pharmacia), diluted in PBST, to each well, then incubating at room temperature for 1 hr. Each plate was washed 7 times with PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20), then the plates were developed with HRP substrate (&#x2dc;10 minutes) and the absorbance signal (630 nm) detected with plate reader.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0547">KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding phage were recovered, amplified, and the sequences of the display peptides responsible for the binding were determined by standard DNA sequencing methods. The binding peptides of the phage isolates are set forth in Tables 1-7, infra.</p>
<p id="p-0549" num="0548">After isolation of KDR and VEGF/KDR complex isolates in initial selection rounds, certain isolates were selected to act as templates for the construction of secondary libraries, from which additional high affinity binding polypeptides were isolated. In a secondary TN8 library, the phage isolate sequence PKWCEEDWYYCMIT (SEQ ID NO: 21) was used as a template to construct a library that allowed one-, two-, and three-base mutations to the parent sequence at each variable codon. In a secondary TN12 library, the phage isolate sequence SRVCWEDSWGGEVCFRY (SEQ ID NO: 88) was used as a template to construct a library that allowed one-, two-, and three-base mutations to the parent sequence at each variable codon. In a another TN8 secondary library, a recurrent motif from the initial TN8 sequences was kept constant (WVEC---TG-C---; SEQ ID NO: 260) and all of the other codon positions (i.e., at &#x201c;-&#x201d;) were allowed to vary (all possible 20 amino acids) using NNK codon substitution, where N stands for any nucleotide and K stands for any keto nucleotide (G or T).</p>
<p id="p-0550" num="0549">Using a method of peptide optimization by soft randomization as described by Fairbrother et al., <i>Biochemistry, </i>37(51):17754-17764 (1998), two libraries were prepared based on the SEQ ID NO: 21 and SEQ ID NO: 88 sequences. At each residue position, each nucleotide within a particular codon was allowed to evolve by adding fixed amounts of the other three nucleotides that did not correspond to the nucleotide of the parent codon. This nucleotide mixing is accomplished in the synthesis of the template DNA used to make the library. For these libraries, the parent nucleotide within each codon was maintained at 64% for SEQ ID NO: 21 and 67% for SEQ ID NO: 88, whereas the other nucleotides were added at the remainder frequency divided by three. Since the parent nucleotides are in the majority, the overall consensus sequence for the whole library should still contain the parental sequence. Inspection of individual isolates, however, shows that multiple mutations are possible, thus allowing selection of peptides with improved binding ability compared to the parent sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0551" num="0550">For the third library, the TN8 motif described above was kept constant and all of the other positions in were allowed to vary with NNK substitution in the template oligonucleotide. To extend the substitution, NNK diversity was also permitted in the two flanking amino acid positions, thus adding variable amino acid positions N-terminal and C-terminal to the display peptide. The secondary library template, therefore, encoded a display peptide of the following sequence: Xaa-Xaa-Trp-Val-Glu-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Thr-Gly-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa (SEQ ID NO: 261), where Xaa can be any amino acid. Unlike the previous two libraries, where the consensus sequence remains the parental sequence, this library was quite diverse in all allowed positions and only resembled the parent motif in the residues that were held constant.</p>
<p id="p-0552" num="0551">A total of 2&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pfu from each library was used as before, except the elution strategy was changed. Competition elution of bound phage was performed using the parental peptide (50 &#x3bc;M) that was used to make the particular secondary library (i.e., peptides of SEQ ID NOS: 21, 88, and 40, respectively). Binding phage were eluted through three steps: (1) elution for 1 hour at room temperature, the eluted phage being used to infect cells for amplification, (2) elution overnight, wherein fresh competition elution peptide was added to the bound phage and incubated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight with mixing, the eluted phage being then used to infect cells for amplification, and (3) the remaining beads (bearing uneluted binding phage) were used to infect cells directly. Three rounds of selections were performed. Plaques were picked from rounds 2 and 3 and analyzed by ELISA and sequencing. KDR positive isolates were assayed further for competition with 50 &#x3bc;M free parent peptide. Those peptides that showed minimal competition with the parent peptide were deemed higher affinity binders and were synthesized. These sequences are listed in the following table as SEQ ID NOS: 22-33 for the TN8 secondary library and SEQ ID NOS: 89-95 for the TN12 secondary library.</p>

<p id="p-0561" num="0560">* During the course of DNA synthesis, there is always a small percentage of incomplete couplings at each cycle. Since the libraries used for these experiments were constructed using TRIM technology to couple trinucleotides (codons) instead of nucleotides, the library template DNA often has a small percentage of deleted codons. In the case of the TN12 library, for instance, it has been observed that approximately 5.3% of the total library is phage expressing a cyclic 11-mer, rather than a 12-mer, and indeed some phage expressing 11-mers were isolated in the selections described above (see Table 2).</p>
<p id="p-0562" num="0561">In the foregoing tables, Class I peptides only bind KDR in the absence of heparin, and therefore presumably target the heparin binding domain of KDR; Class II peptides bind in the presence or absence of heparin or VEGF, and therefore presumably bind at a non-involved site on KDR; Class III peptides exhibit binding characteristics that are not affected by heparin but are perturbed in the presence of VEGF, and therefore presumably these bind either to VEGF or the VEGF binding domain of KDR. NA signifies data not available. In the elution column, 1 HR, O/N, and Cell stand for 1 hour VEGF, overnight VEGF, and bead infection elutions, respectively. In some cases, a particular isolate sequence was observed in two different elutions. For the isolates identified by second generation library, VEGF elutions were substituted with peptide elutions (see below).</p>

<heading id="h-0379" level="1">Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescein Labeling</heading>
<p id="p-0563" num="0562">Selected KDR or VEGF/KDR complex binding peptides corresponding to positive phage isolates were synthesized on solid phase using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl protocols and purified by reverse phase chromatography. Peptide masses were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and peptides were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm. For synthesis, two N-terminal and two C-terminal amino acids from the phage vector sequence from which the peptide was excised were retained, and a -Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys-NH<sub>2 </sub>linker (SEQ ID NO: 262) was added to the C-terminus of each peptide. Each peptide was N-terminally acetylated. For peptides with selected lysine residues, these were protected with 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)-3-methylbutyl (ivDde), which allows selective coupling to the C-terminal lysine, is not removed during peptide cleavage, and can be removed after coupling with 2% hydrazine in DMF or 0.5 M hydroxylamine, pH 8, in water.</p>
<p id="p-0564" num="0563">Each peptide was labeled with fluorescein on the C-terminal lysine using fluorescein (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivative) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in DMF, 2% diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). If the peptide contained an ivDde protected lysine, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 2% hydrazine, which reacts with all free NHS-fluorescein and removes the internal protecting group. For all other peptides, the reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 0.5 M hydroxylamine, pH 8. The quenched reactions were then diluted with water to less than 10% DMF and then purified using C18 reverse phase chromatography. The peptides were characterized for purity and correct mass on an LC-MS system (HP1100 HPLC with in-line SCIEX AP150 single quadrapole mass spectrometer).</p>

<heading id="h-0381" level="1">Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements and BiaCore Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0565" num="0564">Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in 384-well microplates in a volume of 10 &#x3bc;l in binding buffer (PBS, 0.01% Tween-20, pH 7.5) using a Tecan Polarion fluorescence polarization plate reader. In some cases, heparin (0.5 &#x3bc;g/mL) or 10% human serum was added to the binding buffer (data not shown). The concentration of fluorescein labeled peptide was held constant (20 nM) and the concentration of KDR-Fc (or similar target) was varied. Binding mixtures were equilibrated for 10 minutes in the microplate at 30&#xb0; C. before measurement. The observed change in anisotropy was fit to the equation below via nonlinear regression to obtain the apparent K<sub>D</sub>. This equation (1) assumes that the synthetic peptide and KDR form a reversible complex in solution with 1:1 stoichiometry.</p>

where r<sub>obs </sub>is the observed anisotropy, r<sub>free </sub>is the anisotropy of the free peptide, r<sub>bound </sub>is the anisotropy of the bound peptide, K<sub>D </sub>is the apparent dissociation constant, KDR is the total KDR concentration, and P is the total fluorescein-labeled peptide concentration. K<sub>D </sub>was calculated in a direct binding assay (K<sub>D,B</sub>) (see Table 8), and therefore these values represent KDR binding to the fluorescein labeled peptide.
</p>
<p id="p-0567" num="0566">For BiaCore determinations of K<sub>D</sub>, KDR-Fc (or other protein targets) was cross-linked to the dextran surface of a CM5 sensor chip by the standard amine coupling procedure (0.5 mg/mL solutions diluted 1:20 with 50 mM acetate, pH 6.0, R<sub>L </sub>KDR-Fc=12859). Experiments were performed in HBS-P buffer (0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.005% polysorbate 20 (v/v)). Peptide solutions quantitated by extinction coefficient were diluted to 400 nM in HBS-P. Serial dilutions were performed to produce 200, 100, 50, and 25 nM solutions. For association, peptides were injected at 20 &#x3bc;l/min. for 1 minute using the kinject program. Following a 1-minute dissociation, any remaining peptide was stripped from the target surface with a quick injection of 1M NaCl for 25 sec. at 50 &#x3bc;l/min. All samples were injected in duplicate. Between each peptide series a buffer injection and a non-target binding peptide injection served as additional controls. Sensorgrams were analyzed using the simultaneous k<sub>a</sub>/k<sub>d </sub>fitting program in the BIAevaluation software 3.1. Apparent K<sub>D </sub>by this method is set forth as BiaK<sub>D </sub>in Table 8. Unlike the fluorescence anisotropy experiments above, the unlabeled peptide was used for all testing using this assay and therefore, these values represent KDR binding to the unlabeled peptide. Binding affinities determined for the synthesized polypeptides are set forth in Table 8, below. The putative disulfide-constrained cyclic peptide moieties of the polypeptides are in bold.</p>

<p id="p-0569" num="0568">For the analysis of those peptides that bind specifically to KDR/VEGF complex, each peptide was tested for binding to the complex in both assays (fluorescence anisotropy/Biacore) as above. In the anisotropy assay, KDR-VEGF complex was formed by mixing together a two fold molar excess of VEGF with KDR-Fc. This mixture was then used in the direct binding titration using a fluorescein labeled peptide as done previously. As a control, each peptide was also tested for binding to KDR and VEGF alone to assess their specificity for complex. Since none of the peptides bound VEGF to any extent, the presence of excess VEGF in the assay should not affect the K<sub>D </sub>determination. As shown in Table 9, below, all of the peptides showed a dramatic binding preference, binding for KDR/VEGF complex over VEGF. Some of them, however, did show some residual binding to free KDR. To confirm the anisotropy results, the unlabeled peptides were tested in Biacore as before, except the chip was saturated with VEGF to form KDR/VEGF complex prior to the injection of the peptides. In the peptides tested, the BiaK<sub>D </sub>was within at least 2-fold of the anisotropy measurement.</p>

<heading id="h-0385" level="1">Binding of KDR Binding Peptides/Avidin HRP Complex to KDR Transfected 293H cells</heading>
<p id="p-0575" num="0574">To determine the binding of peptides identified by phage display to KDR expressed in transiently-transfected 293H cells, a novel assay that measures the binding of biotinylated peptides complexed with neutravidin HRP to KDR on the surface of the transfected cells was developed. This assay was used to screen the biotinylated peptides set forth in Example 4. Neutravidin HRP was used instead of streptavidin or avidin because it has lower non-specific binding to molecules other than biotin due to the absence of lectin binding carbohydrate moieties and also due to the absence of the cell adhesion receptor-binding RYD domain in neutravidin.</p>
<p id="p-0576" num="0575">In the experiments described herein, tetrameric complexes of KDR-binding peptides SEQ ID NO: 294, SEQ ID NO: 264, SEQ ID NO: 277 and SEQ ID NO: 356 and a control peptide, which does not bind to KDR, were prepared and tested for their ability to bind 293H cells that were transiently-transfected with KDR. All four tetrameric complexes of KDR-binding peptides were biotinylated and contained the JJ spacer, and bound to the KDR-expressing cells; however, SEQ ID NO: 356 exhibited the best K<sub>D </sub>(1.81 nM). The tetrameric complexes of KDR-binding peptides SEQ ID NO: 294, SEQ ID NO: 264 exhibited improved binding over monomers of the same peptides. Moreover, inclusion of a spacer between the KDR-binding peptide and the biotin was shown to improve binding in Experiment B.</p>
<p id="p-0577" num="0576">In Experiment C, it was shown that this assay can be used to assess the effect of serum on binding of peptides of the invention to KDR and VEGF/KDR complex. The binding of SEQ ID NO: 264, SEQ ID NO: 294, and SEQ ID NO: 356 was not significantly affected by the presence of serum, while the binding of SEQ ID NO: 277 was reduced more than 50% in the presence of serum.</p>
<p id="p-0578" num="0577">In Experiment D, it was shown that this assay is useful in evaluating distinct combinations of KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides for use in multimeric targeting constructs that contain more than one KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptide. Moreover, Experiments D and E establish that tetrameric constructs including two or more KDR binding peptides that bind to different epitopes exhibited superior binding to &#x201c;pure&#x201d; tetrameric constructs of the targeting peptides alone.</p>

<heading id="h-0387" level="1">Preparation of m-RNA &#x26; 5&#x2032; RACE Ready cDNA Library</heading>
<p id="p-0579" num="0578">HUVEC cells were grown to almost 80% confluence in 175 cm<sup>2 </sup>tissue culture flasks (Becton Dickinson, Biocoat, cat #6478) and then 10 ng/mL of bFGF (Oncogene, cat #PF003) was added for 24 h to induce expression of KDR. mRNA was isolated using the micro-fast track 2.0 kit from Invitrogen (cat. # K1520-02). 12 &#x3bc;g of mRNA (measured by absorbance at 260 nM) was obtained from two flasks (about 30 million cells) following the kit instructions. Reverse transcription to generate cDNA was performed with 2 &#x3bc;g of mRNA, oligo dT primer (5&#x2032;-(T)<sub>25</sub>GC-3&#x2032;) and/or smart II oligo (5&#x2032;AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACGCGGG-3&#x2032;) (SEQ ID NO: 357) using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase. The reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 &#x3bc;l and the reaction mix contained 2 &#x3bc;l of RNA, 1 &#x3bc;l smart II oligo, 1 &#x3bc;l of oligo dT primer, 4 &#x3bc;l of 5&#xd7; first-strand buffer (250 mM Tris HCl pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 30 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) 1 &#x3bc;l DTT (20 mM, also supplied with reverse transcriptase), 1 &#x3bc;l dNTP mix (10 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, Stratagene, cat. #200415), 9 &#x3bc;l ddH<sub>2</sub>O and 1 &#x3bc;l MMLV reverse transcriptase (Clonetech, cat #8460-1). The reverse transcription reaction was performed for 90 minutes at 42&#xb0; C., and the reaction was stopped by adding 250 &#x3bc;l of tricine-EDTA buffer (10 mM tricine, 1.0 mM EDTA). The reverse transcription product, a 5&#x2032; RACE ready cDNA library, can be stored for 3 months at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. Note that all water used for DNA and RNA application was DNAse and RNAse free from USB (cat. #70783).</p>
<p id="h-0388" num="0000">Cloning of s-KDR into TOPOII Vector</p>
<p id="p-0580" num="0579">In order to clone s-KDR, a 5&#x2032; oligo (G ATG GAG AGC AAG GTG CTG CTG G) (SEQ ID NO: 358) and a 3&#x2032; oligo (C CAA GTT CGT CTT TTC CTG GGC A) (SEQ ID NO: 359) were used. These were designed to amplify the complete extracellular domain of KDR (&#x2dc;2.2 kbps) from the 5&#x2032; RACE ready cDNA library (prepared above) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with pfu polymerase (Stratagene, cat. #600135). The PCR reaction was done in total volume of 50 &#x3bc;l and the reaction mix contained 2 &#x3bc;l 5&#x2032; RACE ready cDNA library, 1 &#x3bc;l 5&#x2032; oligo (10 &#x3bc;M), 1 &#x3bc;l 3&#x2032; oligo (10 &#x3bc;M), 5 &#x3bc;l 10&#xd7;PCR buffer [PCR buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 100 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) supplied with pfu enzyme plus 1% DMSO and 8% glycerol], 1 &#x3bc;l dNTP mix (10 mM) and 40 &#x3bc;l ddH<sub>2</sub>0. The PCR reaction was performed by using a program set for 40 cycles of 1 minute at 94 C, 1 minute at 68 C and 4 minutes at 72 C. The PCR product was purified by extraction with 1 volume of phenol, followed by extraction with 1 volume of chloroform and precipitated using 3 volume of ethanol and 1/10 volume of 3M sodium acetate. The PCR product was resuspended in 17 &#x3bc;l of ddH<sub>2</sub>O, the 2 &#x3bc;l of 10&#xd7;Taq polymerase buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% gelatin) and 1 &#x3bc;l of Taq polymerase (Stratagene, cat. #600131) was added to generate an A overhang to each end of the product. After incubating for 1 hour at 72 C the modified product was cloned directly into a TOPOII vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) following the manufacturer's protocol to give TOPO-sKDR. The TOPO vector allows easy cloning of PCR products because of the A-overhang in Taq (PCR enzyme)-treated PCR products.</p>
<p id="p-0581" num="0580">Cloning the Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Domains of KDR into Topo II Vector</p>
<p id="p-0582" num="0581">In order to clone the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of KDR, a 5&#x2032; oligo (TCC CCC GGG ATC ATT ATT CTA GTA GGC ACG GCG GTG) (SEQ ID NO: 360) and a 3&#x2032; oligo (C AGG AGG AGA GCT CAG TGT GGT C) (SEQ ID NO: 361) were used. These were designed to amplify the complete transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of KDR (&#x2dc;1.8 kbps) from the 5&#x2032; RACE ready cDNA library (described above) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with pfu polymerase. PCR reaction conditions and the program were exactly the same as described above for s-KDR. Just as with the s-KDR sequence, the PCR product was purified using phenol chloroform extraction, treated with Taq polymerase and cloned into TOPOII vector from Invitrogen to give TOPO-CYTO.</p>
<p id="h-0389" num="0000">Cloning of Full-Length KDR into pcDNA6 Vector</p>
<p id="p-0583" num="0582">To create the full-length receptor, the extra-cellular domain and the cytoplasmic domain (with trans-membrane domain) were amplified by PCR separately from TOPO-sKDR and TOPO-CYTO respectively and ligated later to create the full-length receptor. An oligo with a Not1 site at the 5&#x2032; end of the extracellular domain (A TAA GAA TGC GGC CGC AGG ATG GAG AGC AAG GTG CTG CTG G) (SEQ ID NO: 362) and an oligo complimentary to the 3&#x2032; end of the extracellular domain (TTC CAA GTT CGT CTT TTC CTG GGC ACC) (SEQ ID NO: 363) were used to amplify by PCR the extracellular domain from TOPO-sKDR. Similarly, the 5&#x2032; oligo (ATC ATT ATT CTA GTA GGC ACG GCG GTG) (SEQ ID NO: 364) and the 3&#x2032; oligo, with a Not1 site (A TAA GAA TGC GGC CGC AAC AGG AGG AGA GCT CAG TGT GGT C) (SEQ ID NO: 365), were used to amplify by PCR the cytoplasmic domain of KDR (with transmembrane domain) from TOPO-CYTO. Both PCR products were digested with Not1 and ligated together to create the full-length receptor. The cDNA encoding the full-length receptor was purified on an agarose gel and ligated into the Not I site of the pcDNA6/V5-HisC vector. Purification of DNA and ligation was done as described earlier for psKDR. The ligation reaction was used to transform a culture of DH5&#x3b1; bacteria and a number of individual clones were analyzed for the presence and orientation of insert by restriction analysis of purified plasmid from each clone with EcoRI enzyme.</p>
<p id="h-0390" num="0000">Cell Culture</p>
<p id="p-0584" num="0583">293H cells were obtained from Invitrogen (cat. #11631) and grown as monolayer culture in their recommended media plus 1 mL/L pen/strep (Invitrogen, cat. #15140-148). All the cells were grown in presence of antibiotic for everyday culture but were split into antibiotic free media for 16-20 hours prior to transfection.</p>
<p id="h-0391" num="0000">Preparation of DNA for Transfection</p>
<p id="p-0585" num="0584"><i>E. coli </i>bacteria DH5&#x3b1; containing pf-KDR was streaked onto LB with 50 &#x3bc;g/mL ampicillin (LB agar from US biologicals, cat. #75851 and ampicillin from Sigma, cat. #A2804) plates from a glycerol stock and plates were left in a 37&#xb0; C. incubator to grow overnight. Next morning, a single colony was picked from the plate and grown in 3 mL of LB/ampicillin media (LB from US biologicals, cat. # US75852) at 37&#xb0; C. After 8 hours, 100 &#x3bc;l of bacterial culture from the 3 mL tube was transferred to 250 mL of LB/ampicillin media for overnight incubation at 37&#xb0; C. Bacteria were grown up with circular agitation in a 500 mL bottle (Beckman, cat. #355605) at 220 rpm in a Lab-Line incubator shaker. The next day, the bacterial culture was processed using maxi-prep kit (QIAGEN, cat. #12163). Generally, about 1 mg of plasmid DNA (as quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm) was obtained from 250 mL of bacterial culture.</p>
<p id="h-0392" num="0000">Transfection of 293H Cells in 96 Well Plate</p>
<p id="p-0586" num="0585">Transfection was done as recommended in the lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Invitrogen, cat#11668-019) using a poly-D-lysine-coated 96 well plate. 320 ng of KDR DNA (pc-DNA6-fKDR)/per well in 0.1 mL was used for 96 well transfection. Transfection was done in serum-containing media, the transfection reagent mix was removed from cells after 6-8 hours and replaced with regular serum-containing medium. Transfection was done in black/clear 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson, cat. #354640). The left half of the plate (48 wells) were mock-transfected (with no DNA) and the right half of the plate was transfected with KDR cDNA. The cells were 80-90% confluent at the time of transfection and completely confluent next day, at the time of the assay, otherwise the assay was aborted.</p>
<p id="h-0393" num="0000">Preparation of M199 Media</p>
<p id="p-0587" num="0586">In order to prepare M199 media for the assay, one M199 medium packet (GIBCO, cat. #31100-035), 20 mL of 1 mM HEPES (GIBCO, cat. #15630-080) and 2 gm of DIFCO Gelatin (DIFCO, cat. #0143-15-1) were added to 950 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 by adding approximately 4 mL of 1N NaOH. After pH adjustment, the M199 media was warmed to 37&#xb0; C. in a water bath for 2 hours to dissolve the gelatin, then filter sterilized using 0.2 &#x3bc;m filters (Corning, cat. #43109), and stored at 4&#xb0; C. to be used later in the assay.</p>

<p id="p-0588" num="0587">SoftLink soft release avidin-sepharose was prepared by centrifuging the sepharose obtained from Promega (cat. # V2011) at 12,000 rpm for 2 minutes, washing twice with ice cold water (centrifuging in-between the washes) and resuspending the pellet in ice cold water to make a 50% slurry in ddH<sub>2</sub>O. A fresh 50% slurry of avidin-sepharose was prepared for each experiment.</p>
<p id="h-0395" num="0000">Preparation of Peptide/Neutravidin HRP Solution</p>
<p id="p-0589" num="0588">Biotinylated peptides SEQ ID NOS: 294, 264, 277, 356, and the non-binding biotinylated control peptide were used to prepare 250 &#x3bc;M stock solutions in 50% DMSO and a 33 &#x3bc;M stock solution of neutravidin-HRP was prepared by dissolving 2 mg of neutravidin-HRP (Pierce, cat. #31001) in 1 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O (all polypeptides contained the JJ spacer). Peptide stock solutions were stored at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., whereas the Neutravidin HRP stock solution was stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. To prepare peptide/neutravidin-HRP complexes, 10 &#x3bc;l of 250 &#x3bc;M biotinylated peptide stock solution and 10 &#x3bc;l of 33 &#x3bc;M neutravidin-HRP were added to 1 mL of M199 medium. This mixture was incubated on a rotator at 4&#xb0; C. for 60 minutes, followed by addition of 50 &#x3bc;l of soft release avidin-sepharose (50% slurry in ddH<sub>2</sub>0) to remove excess peptides and another incubation for 30 minutes on a rotator at 4&#xb0; C. Finally, the soft release avidin-sepharose was pelleted by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature, and the resulting supernatant was used for the assays. Fresh peptide/neutravidin-HRP complexes were prepared for each experiment.</p>

Each dilution was added to three separate wells of mock as well as KDR-transfected 293H cells (two plates were used for each saturation binding experiment). After incubation at room temperature, plates were transferred to 4&#xb0; C. for another half-hour incubation. Subsequently, cells were washed 5 times with ice-cold M199 media and once with ice-cold PBS (in that order). After the final wash, 100 &#x3bc;l of ice cold TMB solution (KPL, cat. #50-76-00) was added to each well and each plate was incubated for 30 minutes at 37&#xb0; C. in an air incubator. Finally, the HRP enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 50 &#x3bc;l of 1N phosphoric acid to each well, and binding was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad Model 3550).</p>

<p id="p-0593" num="0592">In this assay, complexes of control peptide, SEQ ID NO: 264, SEQ ID NO: 294, SEQ ID NO: 277, and SEQ ID NO: 356 peptides, each biotinylated with the JJ spacer and conjugated with neutravidin-HRP, were prepared as described above and tested for their ability to bind 293H cells that were transiently-transfected with KDR. During the peptide/neutravidin complex preparation, a 7.5-fold excess of biotinylated peptides over neutravidin-HRP was used to make sure that all four biotin binding sites on neutravidin were occupied. After complex formation, the excess of free biotinylated peptides was removed using soft release avidin-sepharose to avoid any competition between free biotinylated peptides and neutravidin HRP-complexed biotinylated peptides. The experiment was performed at several different concentrations of peptide/neutravidin-HRP, from 0.28 nM to 33.33 nM, to generate saturation binding curves for SEQ ID NO: 264 and SEQ ID NO: 294 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and 0.28 to 5.55 nM to generate saturation binding curve for SEQ ID NO: 277 and SEQ ID NO: 356 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). In order to draw the saturation binding curve, the background binding to mock-transfected cells was subtracted from the binding to KDR-transfected cells for each distinct peptide/neutravidin HRP complex at each concentration tested. Therefore, absorbance on the Y-axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is differential absorbance (KDR minus mock) and not the absolute absorbance. Analysis of the saturation binding data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> using Graph Pad Prism software (version 3.0) yielded a K<sub>D </sub>of 10.00 nM (+/&#x2212;2.36) for the tetrameric SEQ ID NO: 294, 14.87 nM (+/&#x2212;5.066) for the tetrameric SEQ ID NO: 264, 4.031 nM (+/&#x2212;0.86) for the tetrameric SEQ ID NO: 277, and 1.814 nM (+/&#x2212;0.27) for the tetrameric SEQ ID NO: 356 peptide complexes. These binding constants are, as expected, lower than those measured by FP against the KDRFc construct for the related monodentate peptides SEQ ID NO: 294 (69 nM), SEQ ID NO: 264 (280 nM), SEQ ID NO: 310 (51 nM), but similar to monodentate peptide SEQ ID NO: 277 (3 nM). As expected, no saturation of binding for the control (non-binder) peptide/neutravidin HRP-complex was observed. The binding of peptide/neutravidin HRP complexes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at a single concentration (5.55 nM) was plotted to demonstrate that a single concentration experiment can be used to differentiate between a KDR binding peptide (SEQ ID NOS: 264, 294 and 277) from a non-binding peptide.</p>
<heading id="h-0400" level="1">Experiment B</heading>
<p id="p-0594" num="0593">Experiment B was designed to look at the requirement of spacer (JJ, Table 10) between the KDR binding sequences (SEQ ID NOS: 294 and 264) and biotin. In this experiment, biotinylated peptides with and without spacer JJ were tested (e.g., biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 264 with the JJ spacer, biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 264 without the JJ spacer, SEQ ID NO: 294 with a spacer, and biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 294 without the spacer), and a non-KDR binding, biotinylated control peptide (with and without spacer, prepared as set forth above) was used as a control. The peptide structure of all the KDR-binding sequences tested in this experiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0595" num="0594">This experiment was performed as set forth in Experiment A described above, except that it was only done at a single concentration of 2.78 nM.</p>
<p id="p-0596" num="0595">Results: It is evident from the results shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the spacer enhances binding of SEQ ID NO: 294 and SEQ ID NO: 264. The spacer between the binding sequence and biotin can be helpful in enhancing binding to target molecule by multiple mechanisms. First, it could help reduce the steric hindrance between four biotinylated peptides after their binding to a single avidin molecule. Second, it could provide extra length necessary to reach multiple binding sites available on a single cell.</p>
<heading id="h-0401" level="1">Experiment C</heading>
<p id="p-0597" num="0596">Experiment C was designed to look at the serum effect on the binding of SEQ ID NOS: 294, 264, 277 and 356. In this procedure, biotinylated peptide/avidin HRP complexes of SEQ ID NOS: 294, 264, 277 and 356 were tested in M199 media (as described above in Experiment A) with and without 40% rat serum. This experiment was performed as described for Experiment A except that it was only done at single concentration of 6.66 nM for SEQ ID NOS: 294 and 264, 3.33 nM for SEQ ID NO: 277 and 2.22 nM for SEQ ID NO: 356. Each of the polypeptides were biotinylated and had the JJ spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0598" num="0597">Results: Results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicate that binding of SEQ ID NO: 264, SEQ ID NO: 294, and SEQ ID NO: 356 was not significantly affected by 40% rat serum, whereas binding of SEQ ID NO: 277 (c) was more than 50% lower in presence of 40% rat serum. More than an 80% drop in the binding of Tc-labeled SEQ ID NO: 277 with Tc-chelate was observed in the presence of 40% rat serum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>). Since the serum effect on the binding of Tc-labeled SEQ ID NO: 277 is mimicked in the avidin HRP assay disclosed herein, this assay may be used to rapidly evaluate the serum effect on the binding of peptide(s) to KDR.</p>

<p id="p-0599" num="0598">Experiment D was designed to evaluate the binding of tetrameric complexes of KDR and VEGF/KDR complex binding polypeptides SEQ ID NO: 294 and SEQ ID NO: 264, particularly where the constructs included at least two KDR binding polypeptides. The KDR binding peptides and control binding peptide were prepared as described above. This experiment was performed using the protocol set forth for Experiment A, except the procedures set forth below were unique to this experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0600" num="0599">Preparation of Peptide/Neutravidin Solutions:</p>
<p id="p-0601" num="0600">250 &#x3bc;M stock solutions of biotinylated peptides SEQ ID NOs: 264, 294 and control peptide were prepared in 50% DMSO and a 33 &#x3bc;M stock solution of Neutravidin HRP was prepared by dissolving 2 mg of Neutravidin HRP (Pierce, cat. #31001) in 1 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Peptide stock solutions were stored at &#x2212;20 C, whereas the Neutravidin HRP stock solution was stored at &#x2212;80 C. The sequences of the biotinylated peptides are shown above. To prepare peptide/neutravidin HRP complexes, a total 5.36 &#x3bc;L, of 250 &#x3bc;M biotinylated peptide stock solution (or a mixture of peptide solutions, to give peptide molecules four times the number of avidin HRP molecules) and 10 &#x3bc;L, of 33 &#x3bc;M Neutravidin HRP were added to 1 mL of M199 medium. This mixture was incubated on a rotator at 4 C for 60 minutes, followed by addition of 50 &#x3bc;L, of soft release avidin-sepharose (50% slurry in ddH<sub>2</sub>0) to remove excess peptides and another incubation for 30 minutes on a rotator at 4 C. Finally, the soft release avidin-sepharose was pelleted by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature, and the resulting supernatant was used for the assays. Fresh peptide/neutravidin HRP complexes were prepared for each experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0602" num="0601">Assay to Detect the Binding of Peptide/Neutravidin HRP:</p>
<p id="p-0603" num="0602">24 hours after transfection, each well of the 293H cells was washed once with 100 &#x3bc;L, of M199 medium and incubated with 80 &#x3bc;L, of blocking solution at 37 C. After one hour, cells were washed twice with 100 &#x3bc;L, of M199 media and incubated with 70 &#x3bc;L, of 3.33 nM peptide (or peptide mix)/neutravidin HRP solutions (prepared by adding 10 &#x3bc;L, of stock prepared earlier to 1 mL of M199 media) for two and half hours at room temperature. Each dilution was added to three separate wells of mock as well as KDR-transfected 293H cells. After incubation at room temperature, plates were transferred to 4 C for another half-hour incubation. Subsequently, cells were washed five times with ice-cold M199 media and once with ice-cold PBS (in that order). After the final wash, 100 &#x3bc;L, of ice cold TMB solution (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.) was added to each well and each plate was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C in an air incubator. Finally, the HRP enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 50 &#x3bc;L, of 1N phosphoric acid to each well, and binding was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioRad Model 3550).</p>
<p id="p-0604" num="0603">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0605" num="0604">This experiment establishes that SEQ ID NO: 294 and SEQ ID NO: 264 bind to KDR in multimeric fashion, and cooperate with each other for binding to KDR in 293H transfected cells. A biotinylated control peptide that does not bind to KDR was used. As expected, a tetrameric complex of the control peptide with avidin-HRP did not show enhanced binding to KDR-transfected cells. Tetrameric complexes of SEQ ID NO: 294 and SEQ ID NO: 264 bound to KDR-transfected cells significantly better than to mock-transfected cells (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). SEQ ID NO: 294 tetramers, however, bound much better than SEQ ID NO: 264 tetramers. If the control peptide was added to the peptide mixture used to form the tetrameric complexes, the binding to the KDR-transfected cells decreased. The ratio of specific binding of tetramer to monomer, dimer and trimer was calculated by dividing the specific binding (obtained by subtracting the binding to mock transfected cells from KDR transfected cells) of tetramer, trimer and dimer with that of monomer. Results indicate that there is co-operative effect of multimerization of SEQ ID NOS: 264, 294 and 356 on the binding to KDR-transfected cells.</p>

<p id="p-0607" num="0606">A mixture of 25% non-binding control peptide with 75% SEQ ID NO: 264 did not bind significantly over background to KDR-transfected cells, indicating that multivalent binding is critical for the SEQ ID NO: 264/avidn-HRP complex to remain bound to KDR throughout the assay. This phenomenon also held true for SEQ ID NO: 294, where substituting 50% of the peptide with control peptide in the tetrameric complex abolished almost all binding to KDR on the transfected cells.</p>
<p id="p-0608" num="0607">Surprisingly, a peptide mixture composed of 50% control peptide with 25% SEQ ID NO: 294 and 25% SEQ ID NO: 264 bound quite well to KDR-transfected cells relative to mock-transfected cells, indicating that there is a great advantage to targeting two sites or epitopes on the same target molecule. Furthermore, it was noted that tetrameric complexes containing different ratios of SEQ ID NO: 294 and SEQ ID NO: 264 (3:1, 2:2, and 1:3) all bound much better to KDR-transfected cells than pure tetramers of either peptide, in agreement with the idea that targeting two distinct sites on a single target molecule is superior to multimeric binding to a single site. This may be because multimeric binding to a single target requires that the multimeric binding entity span two or more separate target molecules that are close enough together for it to bind them simultaneously, whereas a multimeric binder that can bind two or more distinct sites on a single target molecule does not depend on finding another target molecule within its reach to achieve multimeric binding.</p>

<p id="p-0609" num="0608">Experiment E was designed to confirm that SEQ ID NO: 294 and SEQ ID NO: 264 bind to distinct sites (epitopes) on KDR. If these peptides bind to the same site on KDR, then they should be able to compete with each other; however, if they bind to different sites they should not compete. This experiment was performed using a single concentration of SEQ ID NO: 264/avidin HRP (3.33 nM) solution in each well and adding a varying concentration (0-2.5 &#x3bc;M) of biotinylated control peptide with spacer, SEQ ID NO: 264 and SEQ ID NO: 294, none of which were complexed with avidin.</p>

Thus, SEQ ID NO: 264 and SEQ ID NO: 294 bind to distinct and complementary sites on KDR.</p>

<p id="p-0616" num="0615">Anti-KDR from Sigma (V-9134), as ascites fluid, was biotinylated using a kit from Molecular Probes (F-6347) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0617" num="0616">Preparation of Peptide-Conjugated Fluorescent Beads:</p>
<p id="p-0618" num="0617">0.1 mL of a 0.2 mM stock solution of each biotinylated peptide (prepared as set forth above, in 50% DMSO) was incubated with 0.1 mL of Neutravidin-coated red fluorescent microspheres (2 micron diameter, custom-ordered from Molecular Probes) and 0.2 mL of 50 mM MES (Sigma M-8250) buffer, pH 6.0 for 1 hour at room temperature on a rotator. As a positive control, biotinylated anti-KDR antibody was incubated with the Neutravidin-coated beads as above, except that 0.03 mg of the biotinylated antibody preparation in PBS (Gibco #14190-136) was used instead of peptide solution. Beads can be stored at 4&#xb0; C. until needed for up to 1 week.</p>

<p id="p-0620" num="0619">From the above bead preparations, 0.12 mL was spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and 0.06 mL of MES pH 6.0 was added. Each bead solution was then vortexed and sonicated in a water bath 15 min. To 1.47 mL of DMEM, high glucose (GIBCO #11965-084) with 1&#xd7;MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (NEAA) (GIBCO 11140-050) and 40% FBS (Hyclone SH30070.02) 0.03 mL of the sonicated bead preparations was added. 96-well plates seeded with 293H cells that have been mock-transfected in columns 1 to 6, and KDR-transfected in columns 7 to 12 (as in Example 5), were drained and washed once with DMEM, high glucose with 1&#xd7;NEAA and 40% FBS. To each well 0.1 mL of bead solution was added, six wells per bead preparation. After incubating at room temperature for 30 minutes, the wells were drained by inverting the plates and washed four times with 0.1 mL PBS with Ca<sup>++</sup>Mg<sup>++</sup> (GIBCO #14040-117) with shaking at room temperature for 5 minutes each wash. After draining, 0.1 mL of PBS was added per well. The plates were then read on a Packard FluoroCount fluorometer at excitation 550 nm/emission 620 nm. Unconjugated neutravidin beads were used as a negative control while beads conjugated with a biotinylated anti-KDR antibody were used as the positive control for the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0621" num="0620">To calculate the number of beads bound per well, a standard curve with increasing numbers of the same fluorescent beads was included in each assay plate.

<p id="p-0623" num="0622">The positive control beads with anti-KDR attached clearly bound preferentially to the KDR-expressing cells while avidin beads with nothing attached did not bind to either cell type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 264 beads did not bind to the KDR-transfected cells significantly more than to mock-transfected cells, but adding a hydrophilic spacer between the peptide moiety and the biotin group (biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 264 with a JJ spacer beads) enhanced binding to KDR cells without increasing the binding to mock-transfected cells. Biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 294 beads showed greater binding to KDR-transfected cells, and adding a hydrophilic spacer between the peptide portion and the biotin of the molecule (biotinylated SEQ ID NO: 294 with the JJ spacer) significantly improved the specific binding to KDR in the transfected cells. Thus, the peptide sequences of both SEQ ID NO: 264 and SEQ ID NO: 294 can be used to bind particles such as beads to KDR-expressing sites. Addition of a hydrophilic spacer between the peptide and the group used for attachment to the particle should routinely be tested with new targeting molecules as it improved the binding for both of the peptides evaluated here.</p>

Each 1.2 mL tube was then transferred to a 15.7&#xd7;100 cm tube to be counted in an LKB Gamma Counter using program 54 (<sup>125</sup>I window for 1 minute).</p>
<p id="p-0637" num="0636">Competition of Peptides with <sup>125</sup>I-Labeled VEGF in 293H Cells:</p>
<p id="p-0638" num="0637">The ability of KDR-binding peptides SEQ ID NO: 294, SEQ ID NO: 263, SEQ ID NO: 264 and SEQ ID NO: 277 to specifically block <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF binding to KDR was assessed in mock-transfected and KDR-transfected cells. SEQ ID NO: 263 was used in the assay as a negative control, as it exhibited poor binding to KDR in the FP assays described herein and would therefore not be expected to displace or compete with VEGF. To calculate the specific binding to KDR, the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF to mock-transfected cells was subtracted from KDR-transfected cells. Therefore, the binding of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF to sites other than KDR (which may or may not be present in 293H cells) is not included when calculating the inhibition of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF binding to 293H cells by KDR-binding peptides. Percentage inhibition was calculated using formula [(Y1&#x2212;Y2)*100/Y1], where Y1 is specific binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells in the absence peptides, and Y2 is specific binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells in the presence of peptides or DMSO. Specific binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells was calculated by subtracting binding to mock-transfected 293H cells from binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells.</p>
<p id="p-0639" num="0638">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in 293 cells, SEQ ID NO: 263, which due to its relatively high K<sub>d </sub>(&#x3e;2 &#x3bc;M) was used as a negative control, did not compete significantly with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF, 12.69&#xb1;7.18% at 30 &#x3bc;M and &#x2212;5.45&#xb1;9.37% at 0.3 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). At the same time, SEQ ID NOS: 294 and 277 competed very well with <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF, inhibiting 96.29&#xb1;2.97% and 104.48&#xb1;2.074% of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF binding at 30 &#x3bc;M and 52.27&#xb1;3.78% and 80.96&#xb1;3.8% at 0.3 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) respectively. The percentage inhibition with SEQ ID NO: 264 was 47.95&#xb1;5.09% of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled VEGF binding at 30 &#x3bc;M and 24.41&#xb1;8.43% at 0.3 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Thus, the three strongly KDR-binding polypeptides did compete with VEGF, and their potency increased with their binding affinity. This assay will be useful for identifying peptides that bind tightly to KDR but do not compete with VEGF, a feature that may be useful for imaging KDR in tumors, where there is frequently a high local concentration of VEGF that would otherwise block the binding of KDR-targeting molecules.</p>

<p id="p-0640" num="0639">The ability of KDR-binding peptides identified by phage display to inhibit VEGF induced activation (phosphorylation) of KDR was assessed using the following assay. A number of peptides of the invention were shown to inhibit activation of KDR in monomeric and/or tetrameric constructs. As discussed supra, peptides that inhibit activation of KDR may be useful as anti-angiogenic agents.</p>
<heading id="h-0413" level="1">Protocol</heading>
<p id="p-0641" num="0640">Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Biowhittaker Catalog #CC-2519) were obtained frozen on dry ice and stored in liquid nitrogen until thawing. These cells were thawed, passaged, and maintained as described by the manufacturer in EGM-MV medium (Biowhittaker Catalog #CC-3125). Cells seeded into 100 mm dishes were allowed to become confluent, then cultured overnight in basal EBM medium lacking serum (Biowhittaker Catalog #CC-3121). The next morning, the medium in the dishes was replaced with 10 mL fresh EBM medium at 37 C containing either no additives (negative control), 5 ng/mL VEGF (Calbiochem Catalog #676472 or Peprotech Catalog #100-20) (positive control), or 5 ng/mL VEGF plus the indicated concentration of the KDR-binding peptide (prepared as described above). In some cases, a neutralizing anti-KDR antibody (Catalog #AF357, R&#x26;D Systems) was used as a positive control inhibitor of activation. In such cases, the antibody was pre-incubated with the test cells for 30 min at 37&#xb0; C. prior to the addition of fresh medium containing both VEGF and the antibody. After incubating the dishes 5 min. in a 37&#xb0; C. tissue culture incubator they were washed three times with ice-cold D-PBS containing calcium and magnesium and placed on ice without removing the last 10 mL of Delbecco's phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS). The first dish of a set was drained and 0.5 mL of Triton lysis buffer was added (20 mM Tris base pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 1 mM PMSF(phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride), 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM NaF, 50 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 &#x3bc;g/mL leupeptin, 10 &#x3bc;g/mL aprotinin) The cells were quickly scraped into the lysis buffer using a cell scraper (Falcon, Cat No. #353087), dispersed by pipeting up and down briefly, and the resulting lysate was transferred to the second drained dish of the pair. Another 0.5 mL of lysis buffer was used to rinse out the first dish then transferred to the second dish, which was then also scraped and dispersed. The pooled lysate from the two dishes was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppindorf tube. The above procedure was repeated for each of the controls and test samples (KDR-binding peptides), one at a time. The lysates were stored on ice until all the samples had been processed. At this point samples were either stored at &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. or processed to the end of the assay without interruption.</p>
<p id="p-0642" num="0641">The lysates, freshly prepared or frozen and thawed, were precleared by adding 20 &#x3bc;l of protein A-sepharose beads (Sigma 3391, preswollen in D-PBS, washed three times with a large excess of D-PBS, and reconstituted with 6 mL D-PBS to generate a 50% slurry) and rocking at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 min. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min. in a Picofuge (Stratgene, Catalog #400550) at 2000&#xd7;g and the supernatants transferred to new 1.5 mL tubes. Twenty &#x3bc;g of anti-Flk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Catalog #sc-504) was added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated overnight (16-18 hr.) at 4 C on a rotator to immunoprecipitate KDR. The next day 40 &#x3bc;l of protein A-sepharose beads were added to the tubes that were then incubated 4 C for 1 hr. on a rotator. The beads in each tube were subsequently washed three times by centrifuging for 2 min. in a Picofuge, discarding the supernatant, and dispersing the beads in 1 mL freshly added TBST buffer (20 mM Tris base pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20). After centrifuging and removing the liquid from the last wash, 40 &#x3bc;l of Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Catalog #161-0737) was added to each tube and the tubes were capped and boiled for 5 min. After cooling, the beads in each tube were pelleted by centrifuging and the supernatants containing the immunoprecipitated KDR were transferred to new tubes and used immediately or frozen and stored at &#x2212;70 C for later analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0643" num="0642">Detection of phosphorylated KDR as well as total KDR in the immunoprecipitates was carried out by immunoblot analysis. Half (20 &#x3bc;L) of each immunoprecipitate was resolved on a 7.5% precast Ready Gel (Bio-Rad, Catalog #161-1154) by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (<i>Nature, </i>227:680-685 (1970)).</p>
<p id="p-0644" num="0643">Using a Bio-Rad mini-Protean 3 apparatus (Catalog #165-3302), the resolved proteins in each gel were electroblotted to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, Cat. No. 162-0174) in a Bio-Rad mini Trans-Blot cell (Catalog #170-3930) in CAPS buffer (10 mM CAPS, Sigma Catalog #C-6070, 1% ACS grade methanol, pH 11.0) for 2 hr. at 140 mA according to the method of Matsudaira (<i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>262:10035-10038 (1987)). Blots were blocked at room temperature in 5% Blotto-TBS (Pierce Catalog #37530) pre-warmed to 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hr. The blots were first probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Labs, Catalog #P11120), diluted 1:200 in 5% Blotto-TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 added for 2 hr. at room temp. The unbound antibody was removed by washing the blots four times with D-PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (D-PBST), 5 min. per wash. Subsequently, blots were probed with an HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences Catalog #NA931) diluted 1:25,000 in 5% Blotto-TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 added for 1 hr. at room temp., and washed four times with D-PBST. Finally, the blots were incubated with 2 mL of a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL Plus, Amersham Catalog #RPN2132) spread on top for 2 min., drip-drained well, placed in plastic sheet protector (C-Line Products, Catalog #62038), and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak BioMax ML, Cat No. 1139435) for varying lengths of time to achieve optimal contrast.</p>
<p id="p-0645" num="0644">To confirm that similar amounts of KDR were compared in the assay, the blots were stripped by incubating for 30 min. at 37&#xb0; C. in TBST with its pH adjusted to 2.4 with HCl, blocked for 1 hr. at room temp. with 5% Blotto-TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (Blotto-TBST), and reprobed with an anti-Flk-1 polyclonal antibody (Catalog #sc-315 from Santa Cruz Biotech), 1:200 in 5% Blotto-TBST with 1% normal goat serum (Life Tech Catalog #16210064) for 2 hr. at room temp. The unbound antibody was removed by washing the blots four times with D-PBST, 5 min. per wash. Subsequently, the blots were probed with an HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences Catalog #NA934) diluted 1:10,000 in 5% Blotto-TBST for 1 hr. at room temp., and washed four times with D-PBST. Finally, the blots were incubated with 2 mL of chemiluminescent substrate and exposed to X-ray film as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0646" num="0645">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0647" num="0646">Immunoblots of KDR immunoprecipitates prepared from HUVECs with and without prior VEGF stimulation demonstrated that activated (phosphorylated) KDR could be detected when the HUVECs were stimulated with VEGF. An anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20) detected no phosphorylated proteins close to the migration position of KDR from unstimulated HUVECs on the blots, but after five minutes of VEGF stimulation, an intense band was consistently observed at the expected location (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, upper panel). When the blots were stripped of bound antibodies by incubation in acidic solution then reprobed with an anti-KDR antibody (sc-315), the identity of the phosphorylated protein band was confirmed to be KDR. Moreover, it was observed that immunoprecipitates from unstimulated HUVECs contained about as much total KDR as immunoprecipitates from VEGF-stimulation HUVECs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, lower panel).</p>
<p id="p-0648" num="0647">The foregoing results indicate that the phosphorylated KDR detected was formed from pre-existing KDR through autophosphorylation of KDR dimers resulting from VEGF binding, as five minutes is not enough time to synthesize and process a large glycosylated cell-surface receptor such as KDR.</p>
<p id="p-0649" num="0648">The ability of this assay to detect agents capable of blocking the VEGF activation of KDR was assessed by adding a series of compounds to HUVECs in combination with VEGF and measuring KDR phosphorylation with the immunoblot assay described above. As negative and positive controls, immunoprecipitates from unstimulated HUVECs and from HUVECs stimulated with VEGF in the absence of any test compounds were also tested in every assay. When a neutralizing anti-KDR antibody (Catalog #AF-357 from R&#x26;D Systems) was combined with the VEGF, the extent of KDR phosphorylation was greatly reduced (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, upper panel), indicating that the antibody was able to interfere with the ability of VEGF to bind to and activate KDR. This result was expected since the ability of the antibody to block VEGF-induced DNA synthesis is part of the manufacturer's quality control testing of the antibody. Re-probing the blot with an anti-KDR antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, lower panel) indicated that slightly less total KDR was present in the VEGF+antibody-treated lane (+V+&#x3b1;-KDR) relative to the VEGF-only-treated lane (+V), but the difference was not great enough to account for the much lower abundance of phosphorylated KDR in the antibody-treated lane.</p>
<p id="p-0650" num="0649">To assess the potency of a linear KDR-binding peptide (AFPRFGGDDYWIQQYLRYTD, SEQ ID NO: 140) identified by phage display, the assay was repeated with a synthetic peptide containing the KDR-binding sequence, Ac-AQAFPRFGGDDYWIQQYLRYTDGGK-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ ID NO: 306) in the presence of VEGF. SEQ ID NO: 306 was able to inhibit the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of KDR. Re-probing the blot for total KDR showed that there is even more total KDR in the VEGF+SEQ ID NO: 306-treated cells (+V+SEQ ID NO: 306) than in the VEGF only-treated cells (+V) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, lower panel). Thus, it is clear that the decreased phosphorylation of KDR in the presence of SEQ ID NO: 306 is not due to differential sample loading, but rather the ability of the polypeptide to inhibit VEGF-activation of KDR.</p>
<p id="p-0651" num="0650">Repeating the foregoing assay, the following polypeptides demonstrated at least a 50% inhibition of VEGF-induced KDR phosphorylation at 10 &#x3bc;M:</p>

<p id="p-0658" num="0657">To a 250 mL of SPPS reaction vessel was added 6.64 mmol of H-Gly-2-Cl-trityl resin (0.84 mmol/g, Novabiochem). It was swelled in 80 mL of DMF for 1 h. For each coupling cycle the resin was added 26.6 mmol of DIEA, 26.6 mmol of a Fmoc-amino acid in DMF (EM Science), 26.6 mmol of HOBT (Novabiochem) in DMF, and 26.6 mmol of DIC. The total volume of DMF was 80 mL. The reaction mixture was shaken for 4 h. The resin then was filtered and washed with DMF (3&#xd7;80 mL). A solution of 20% piperidine in DMF (80 mL) was added to the resin and it was shaken for 10 min. The resin was filtered and this piperidine treatment was repeated. The resin finally was washed with DMF (3&#xd7;80 mL) and ready for next coupling cycle. At the last coupling cycle, N,N-dimethyl glycine (Aldrich) was coupled using HATU/DIEA activation. Thus, to a suspension of N,N-dimethyl glycine (26.6 mmol) in DMF was added a solution of 26.6 mmol of HATU (Perseptive Biosystems) in DMF and 53.1 mmol of DIEA. The clear solution was added to the resin and shaken for 16 h. Following the synthesis, the resin was filtered and washed with DMF (3&#xd7;80 mL), CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>(3&#xd7;80 mL) and dried. The resin was mixed with 80 mL of AcOH/CF<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH/DCM (1/1/8, v/v/v) and shaken for 45 min. The resin was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated to a paste. Purification of the crude material by silica gel chromatography using 25% MeOH/DCM afforded 2.0 g of the final product.</p>

The reaction mixture was purified by HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (4.6 mm&#xd7;250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min., using 0.1% TFA in water as aqueous phase and 0.085% TFA in acetonitrile as the organic phase. The following gradient was used: 29.5% org. for 35 min., ramp to 85% over 5 min., hold for 10 min. The fraction containing <sup>99m</sup>Tc SEQ ID NO: 339 was collected into 500 &#x3bc;l of a stabilizing buffer containing 5 mg/mL ascorbic acid and 16 mg/mL hydroxypropyl-&#x3b1;-cyclodextrin in 50 mM phosphate buffer.

A linear increase in the specific binding of Tc-labeled SEQ ID NO: 339 to KDR was observed with increasing concentration of Tc-labeled SEQ ID NO: 339 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</figref>). Linear binding was not surprising because concentration of Tc-labeled SEQ ID NO: 339 was only &#x2dc;100 pM (even at the highest concentration, 11.7 &#x3bc;Ci/mL, tested in the assay), which is far below the K<sub>D </sub>value of &#x2dc;3-4 nM of SEQ ID NO: 277 (as calculated using avidin HRP assay), so no saturation of binding would be expected.</p>

<heading id="h-0433" level="1">Preparation of Homodimeric and Heterodimeric Constructs</heading>
<p id="p-0678" num="0677">The purified peptide monomers mentioned above in Example 8 were used in the preparation of various homodimeric and heterodimeric constructs.</p>
<p id="h-0434" num="0000">Preparation of Homodimer-Containing Constructs</p>
<p id="p-0679" num="0678">To prepare homodimeric compounds, half of the peptide needed to prepare the dimer was dissolved in DMF and treated with 10 equivalents of glutaric acid bis-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis and mass spectroscopy. At completion of the reaction, the volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue was washed with ethyl acetate to remove the unreacted bis-NHS ester. The residue was dried, re-dissolved in anhydrous DMF and treated with another half portion of the peptide in the presence of 2 equivalents of DIEA. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h. This mixture was applied directly to a YMC reverse phase HPLC column and purified by elution with a linear gradient of acetonitrile into water (both containing 0.1% TFA).</p>
<p id="h-0435" num="0000">Preparation of Heterodimer-Containing Constructs</p>
<p id="p-0680" num="0679">In the case of heterodimers, one of the monomers (&#x201c;A&#x201d;) was reacted with the bis-NHS ester of glutaric acid and after washing off the excess of bis-NHS ester (as described for the homodimeric compounds), the second monomer (&#x201c;B&#x201d;) was added in the presence of DIEA. After the reaction the mixture was purified by preparative HPLC. Typically, to a solution of glutaric acid bis N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (0.02 mmol, 10 equivalents) in DMF (0.3 mL) was added a solution of peptide &#x201c;A&#x201d; and DIEA (2 equiv) in DMF (0.5 mL) and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis and mass spectroscopy. At completion of the reaction, the volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue was washed with ethyl acetate (3&#xd7;1.0 mL) to remove the unreacted bis-NHS ester. The residue was dried, re-dissolved in anhydrous DMF (0.5 mL) and treated with a solution of peptide &#x201c;B&#x201d; and DIEA (2 equiv) in DMF (0.5 mL) for 24 h. The mixture was diluted with water (1:1, v/v) and applied directly to a YMC C-18 reverse phase HPLC column and purified by elution with a linear gradient of acetonitrile into water (both containing 0.1% TFA). Fractions were analyzed by analytical HPLC and those containing the pure product were combined and lyophilized to obtain the required dimer. The dimers depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-63</figref> were prepared by this method (structure, name, compound reference number as described in the &#x201c;Brief Description of the Drawings&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0681" num="0680">For the preparation of the dimer D5, after the coupling reaction of the individual peptides, 50 &#x3bc;L of hydrazine was added to the reaction mixture (to expose the lysine N<sup>E</sup>-amino group) and the solution was stirred for 2 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (1.0 mL) and the pH was adjusted to 2 with TFA. This was then purified by the method described above.</p>

Results
</p>
<p id="p-0712" num="0711">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, D1 was able to completely block the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of KDR in HUVECs at 10 nM. More than half of the phosphorylation was inhibited by the compound at 1 nM. Homodimers D2 and D3, made up of the two individual binding moieties that are contained in D1, had no effect on phosphorylation at up to 100 nM, demonstrating the benefit of heterodimer constructs in blocking a receptor-ligand interaction. In multiple experiments, the IC<sub>50 </sub>for D1 in this assay varied between 0.5 and 1 nM. A different heterodimer containing unrelated binding sequences, D28, a tail-to-tail heterodimer comprising the polypeptides of SEQ ID NO: 305 and SEQ ID NO: 306 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>), had no effect on phosphorylation at 100 nM in spite of it's high binding affinity (11 nM for KDR by SPR), suggesting that the choice of KDR-binding moieties is important when constructing a multimer to compete with VEGF for binding to KDR. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to construct suitable heteromultimers using the binding polypeptides provided herein and routine screening assays.</p>
<p id="p-0713" num="0712">Even though the affinity of D1 for KDR is 10-fold higher than that of D2 (by SPR analysis), the IC<sub>50 </sub>of D1 in the activation assay is at least 100-fold lower. This suggests that targeting two distinct epitopes on KDR with a single binding molecule can generate greater steric hindrance than a molecule with similar affinity that only binds to a single epitope on KDR and, therefore, improve the ability to inhibit VEGF induced KDR activity. Similarly, it should be pointed out that the two KDR-binding moieties within D1, when tested as monomeric free peptides (SEQ ID NO: 277 and SEQ ID NO: 337 in the receptor activation assay, had IC<sub>50</sub>s of 0.1 and 1 micromolar, respectively. The IC<sub>50 </sub>for the monomeric free peptides were 100 to 1000-fold higher than the IC<sub>50 </sub>for D1 in the assay and 14 to 30-fold higher than the K<sub>D</sub>s for the fluoresceinated derivatives of the monomeric peptides. Thus, creating a dimer containing two peptides with weak VEGF-blocking activity has resulted in a molecule with very potent VEGF-blocking activity that goes well beyond the increased binding affinity of D1.</p>

<p id="p-0714" num="0713">The following experiment assessed the ability of D1 to block the VEGF-induced migration of HUVECs in culture.</p>
<p id="h-0448" num="0000">Protocol</p>
<p id="p-0715" num="0714">Serum-starved HUVECs were placed, 100,000 cells per well, into the upper chambers of BD Matrigel-coated FluoroBlok 24-well insert plates (#354141). Basal medium, containing either nothing or different attractants such as VEGF (10 ng/mL) or serum (5% FBS) in the presence or absence of potential VEGF-blocking/inhibiting compounds, was added to the lower chamber of the wells. After 22 hours, quantitation of cell migration/invasion was achieved by post-labeling cells in the insert plates with a fluorescent dye and measuring the fluorescence of the invading/migrating cells in a fluorescent plate reader. The VEGF-induced migration was calculated by subtracting the migration that occurred when only basal medium was placed in the lower chamber of the wells.</p>
<p id="h-0449" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0716" num="0715">VEGF induced a large increase in endothelial cell migration in the assay, which was potently blocked by D1. At 5 nM D1, the VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell migration was 84% blocked (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). At 25 nM D1, this migration was almost completely blocked. In other experiments, a known KDR inhibitor, SU-1498 (Strawn, L. et al., 1996, Cancer Res., 56:3540-3545) was tested in the assay. SU-1498 at 3 micromolar did not block the VEGF-induced migration as well as D1 (47% blocked at 3 micromolar). D6 (structure shown below in Example 18), at 50 nM, also produced essentially complete inhibition of the migration stimulated by VEGF. Serum was a very powerful attractant in the assay when used in place of VEGF, but its effect was not significantly diminished by D1, indicating that D1 specifically inhibits endothelial migration induced by VEGF.</p>

<p id="p-0730" num="0729">An experiment was performed to test the ability of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled D5 to bind to KDR-transfected 293H cells. In this experiment, different amounts of <sup>125</sup>I-labeled D5 (1-4 &#x3bc;Ci/mL, labeled with <sup>125</sup>I-Bolton-Hunter reagent and HPLC-purified) were incubated with mock and KDR-transfected 293H cells in 96-well plates for 1 hr at room temperature. Binding was performed with and without 40% mouse serum to evaluate the serum effect on binding to KDR-transfected cells. After washing away the unbound compound, the cells in each well were lysed with 0.5 N NaOH and the lysates were counted with a gamma counter.</p>
<p id="p-0731" num="0730">The results of this experiment are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. <sup>125</sup>I-labeled D5 is able to specifically bind to KDR-transfected cells, and its binding is not affected by the presence of 40% mouse serum.

From these data, it appears that at the higher immobilization densities, the heterodimer binds KDR with a sub-nanomolar affinity (&#x2dc;0.6 nM).
</p>
<p id="p-0736" num="0735">To assess the in vivo clearance of this peptide heterodimer, a small amount of material was iodinated using iodogen and Na<sup>125</sup>I according to standard protocols (Pierce). One tube coated with the iodogen reagent was pre-wet with 1 mL of 25 mM Tris, 0.4M NaCl, pH 7.5. This was discarded and 100 &#x3bc;L of the same buffer added. Using a Hamilton syringe 11 &#x3bc;L of the <sup>125</sup>I-NaI was transferred to the reaction tube. Based on original estimates of the Na<sup>125</sup>I concentration of 143.555 mCi/mt, the 11 &#x3bc;L should contain about 1.5 mCi. After addition, the sample was swirled and set in a lead pig to incubate for 6 min with a swirl every 30 sec. After 6 min, the entire sample was transferred to the protein that was in an Eppendorf tube. The sample was swirled and set to incubate for 8 min, with a swirl every 30 sec. After 8 min the reaction was quenched (terminated) with tyrosine (10 mg/mL, a saturated solution), allowed to sit for 5 min, and then 2 &#x3bc;L was removed for a standard.</p>
<p id="p-0737" num="0736">For purification a 10 mL column of the D-salt polyacrylamide 1800 was used to separate the labeled peptide from labeled tyrosine. The column was first washed with 10 mL saline, then 5 mL of 25 mM Tris, 0.4M NaCl, pH 7.5 containing 2.5% HSA to block non-specific sites. After the HSA buffer wash, the column was eluted with 60 mL of the 25 mM Tris, 0.4 M NaCl buffer, and the column was stored overnight at 4&#xb0; C. The labeled sample contained 1.355 mCi, as determined by the dose calibrator. The 2 &#x3bc;L sample that was removed as a standard contained 8.8 &#x3bc;Ci. The peptide sample was applied to the D-salt 1800 column and eluted with the Tris/NaCl buffer, pH 7.5. The flow was controlled by applying single 0.5 mL aliquots for each fraction, #1-14, and then 1.0 mL for fractions 25-43. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the elution profile of activity versus fraction number. The peak of activity in fractions #9, 10, and 11, was assumed to be the peptide. The radioactivity in 24 through &#x2dc;40 is likely the labeled tyrosine. From this purification, fractions #9-12 were pooled together and used for the subsequent clearance study (concentration of <sup>125</sup>I-D6 in pool is 7.023 &#x3bc;g/mL; 100 &#x3bc;L=0.702 &#x3bc;g with 8.6 &#x3bc;Ci).</p>
<p id="p-0738" num="0737">A total of 15 mice were injected with 100 &#x3bc;L <sup>125</sup>I-D6 and mice (in sets of 3) were sacrificed at the following time points: 0, 7, 15, 30, 90 minutes. After injection more than 2 &#x3bc;Ci was found remaining in the syringe, so actual activity injected was about 6 &#x3bc;Ci. With 6 &#x3bc;Ci injected, the corresponding protein administered was &#x2dc;0.5 &#x3bc;g per animal. Once sacrificed, the counts were determined in a 50 &#x3bc;L plasma sample from each animal. For each set of three animals at each time point, the counts were averaged, converted to % injected dose/ml plasma (ID %/mL), and then plotted to assess the rate of clearance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). This data was fit to either a 4 or 5 parameter equation to determine the biphasic half life of this molecule. The 4 parameter fit resulted in a T<sub>1/2&#x3b1;</sub> of 2.55 minutes and a T<sub>1/2&#x3b2;</sub> of 64.66 minutes. The 5 parameter fit resulted in a T<sub>1/2&#x3b1;</sub> of 2.13 minutes and a T<sub>1/2&#x3b2;</sub> of 23.26 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0739" num="0738">Larger volumes of plasma were also taken from mice sacrificed at the 0, 30, and 90 minute time points. These samples were injected onto a Superdex peptide column (Pharmacia) coupled to a radioactivity detector to assess the association of the peptide with serum proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). As shown, the labeled peptide does associate with higher MW proteins, which could explain its biphasic half life clearance behavior.</p>

<p id="p-0746" num="0763">Experiments were performed in PBS buffer (5.5 mM phosphate, pH 7.65, 0.15 M NaCl)+0.005% P-20 (v/v)). SEQ ID NO: 277, run as a control, was diluted to 125 nM in PBS. Serial dilutions were performed to produce 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, 7.8, and 3.9 nM solutions. D1 and D6 were diluted to 50 nM in PBS and serial dilutions were performed to produce 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 nM solutions. All samples were injected in duplicate. For association, peptides were injected at 30 &#x3bc;L/min for 3 minutes using the kinject program. Following a 10 minute dissociation, any remaining peptide was stripped from the rmKDR-Fc surface with a quickinject of 50 mM NaOH+1 M NaCl for 12 s at 75 &#x3bc;L/min.</p>

The fact that about the same K<sub>D</sub>2 constant was achieved for both heterodimers even when the density of receptor on the sensor chip was reduced by half is consistent with multimeric binding of the heterodimers to individual receptors rather than cross-link-type binding between receptors.</p>

<p id="p-0765" num="0790">Female athymic nude mice (Crl:NU/NU-nuBR) at 6-8 weeks of age were used in this study. A total of 115 mice were injected subcutaneously into the right lateral thorax with 5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>SW-480, human colon carcinoma cells. When tumors reached a target window size of approximately 150&#xb1;75 mg, 90 tumor-bearing mice were randomly selected and distributed into one of nine groups. Test Articles and vehicle were administered intraperitoneally (IP), Cisplatin was administered intravenously (IV). Tumor measurements were recorded twice weekly using hand-held calipers. Mice were monitored daily for signs of toxicity and morbidity. At study termination, animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide overdose and necropsied for tissue collection.</p>
<p id="h-0488" num="0000">B. Group Assignments:</p>
<p id="p-0766" num="0791">A total of nine (9) groups were used in this study. Each group contained ten (10) tumor-bearing mice. Groups 1 and 2 contained untreated and vehicle treated negative control mice, respectively. Groups 3, 4, and 5 contained mice that received one of three different concentrations of the D6 anti-angiogenic peptide. Group 9 contained mice that received cisplatin, a standard chemotherapeutic compound as a positive control.</p>
<p id="h-0489" num="0000">C. Dosing Levels and Regiment:</p>
<p id="p-0767" num="0792">Dose levels for each group are provided in Table 16. Dosing began the same day that animals were randomly sorted into groups (Study Day 7). Each dose was removed from the dose vial using aseptic technique for each animal and the injection site was wiped with an alcohol swab prior to dose administration. Doses were administered with a 1.0 mL syringe and a 27-gauge&#xd7;&#xbd;&#x2033; needle for each mouse</p>
<p id="p-0768" num="0793">The Test Article- and vehicle-treated mice received daily intraperitoneal (IP) injections for 15 days. Cisplatin was administered every other workday for a total of five (5) doses via an intravenous route.</p>

D. Clinical Observations of Animals:
</p>
<p id="p-0770" num="0795">Clinical Observations of each animal were performed and recorded at least once daily for toxicity, morbidity and mortality. Morbidity included signs of illness such as, but not limited to, emaciation, dehydration, lethargy, hunched posture, unkempt appearance, dyspnea and urine or fecal staining</p>
<p id="h-0490" num="0000">E. Tumor Measurements:</p>
<p id="p-0771" num="0796">In accordance with the protocol tumor measurements were taken twice weekly throughout the study by measuring the length and width of tumors with calibrated calipers. Measurements occurred a minimum of 3-4 days apart, except when animals were euthanized and measurements were taken; this sometimes resulted in an interval of less than 3 days. Tumor weights were calculated using the following formula: mg=(L&#xd7;W<sup>2</sup>)/2. Animals were euthanized either when mean tumor weight was &#x2267;1000 mg per group over two (2) consecutive measurements, or if tumors became ulcerated, impaired the animal's ability to ambulate or obtain food and water.</p>
<p id="h-0491" num="0000">F. Unscheduled Euthanasia and Unexpected Deaths:</p>
<p id="h-0492" num="0000">1. Unscheduled Euthanasia:</p>
<p id="p-0772" num="0797">None of the animals required unscheduled euthanasia while on study.</p>
<p id="h-0493" num="0000">2. Unexpected Deaths:</p>
<p id="p-0773" num="0798">None of the animals died while on study.</p>
<p id="h-0494" num="0000">G. Necropsy:</p>
<p id="h-0495" num="0000">1. Euthanasia and Necropsy Order:</p>
<p id="p-0774" num="0799">All mice in groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (50 total) were submitted for necropsy when tumors reached a group mean target size of &#x2267;1000 mg over two (2) consecutive measurements within a group. Animals were submitted for necropsy to the Charles River Laboratories Health Monitoring Laboratory (HM), Wilmington, Mass. All animals were euthanized on Study Day 22, short of received the full 28 day treatment regiment with Test Articles because mean tumor size was &#x2267;1000 mg in Test Article Treated Groups 3-8.</p>
<p id="p-0775" num="0800">All animals were humanely euthanized by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) inhalation.</p>
<p id="h-0496" num="0000">2. Tissue Collection:</p>
<p id="p-0776" num="0801">Tumors were dissected free of surrounding tissue and overlying skin. Additionally the kidneys were collected. Any abnormalities noted on the renal surfaces were noted.</p>
<p id="p-0777" num="0802">Frozen blocks were made of tumors and kidneys for each animal. A representative section of the tissue (tumor, kidneys) was taken. Kidney sections included the cortex and medulla. Tissue sections were placed in the bottom of a labeled plastic-freezing mold. Tissue was embedded with OCT medium. Blocks were submerged into isopentane chilled with dry ice until frozen. Blocks were briefly examined for quality, and stored on dry ice.</p>
<p id="p-0778" num="0803">Blocks were labeled with the animal number and a letter code corresponding to tissue (A=left kidney; B=right kidney; C=mass). Blocks from one animal were placed into a labeled bag.</p>

<p id="h-0498" num="0000">A. In-Life Measurements and Observations</p>
<p id="h-0499" num="0000">1. Clinical Observations, Morbidity and Mortality Summary Statement:</p>
<p id="p-0779" num="0804">All animals appeared healthy and were within normal limits throughout the study. D6 showed no signs of toxicity at the doses used in this study.</p>
<p id="p-0780" num="0805">Animals were euthanized on Study Day 22. All mice, except Group 9 mice, were euthanized prior to completing Test Article administration, because mean tumor size was &#x2267;1000 mg in Groups 1-8. Group 9, Cisplatin-treated animals were euthanized on Study Day 22 when mean tumor weight was 995 mg. No animals died while on study.</p>
<p id="h-0500" num="0000">2. Mass Palpation Summary Statement:</p>
<p id="p-0781" num="0806">Throughout the study palpable masses were detected in all mice, with tumors progressively growing for the duration of the study. As expected tumors in untreated and vehicle treated negative control mice (Groups 1 and 2) grew the fastest, reaching a mean tumor size of 1000 mg on or before Study Day 20. In addition, animals treated with Cisplatin (Group 9) developed tumors that grew the slowest reaching a mean tumor size of 995 mg at study termination (Day 22).</p>
<p id="p-0782" num="0807">In general, except for Group 3 mice, all animals treated with Test Article resulted in slower tumor growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>). Animals in Group 3, which were treated with the low dose of D6 (0.05 mg/kg) had tumors that grew at approximately the same rate as the tumors in untreated and vehicle treated animals in Groups 1 and 2. Animals treated with either higher doses of D6 (Groups 4 and 5) had tumors that grew slower; reaching a mean tumor size of 1000 mg on Study Day 21. When compared to control Groups 1 and 2 mice, Test Article treatment resulted in a delay of tumor growth of approximately 1 day.</p>
<p id="h-0501" num="0000">B. Conclusions</p>
<p id="p-0783" num="0808">Data from this study validate the model used because tumor-bearing mice in negative control Groups 1 and 2 and positive control Group 9 responded as expected.</p>
<p id="p-0784" num="0809">Throughout the study palpable masses were observed in all groups. In addition, all animals were healthy and within normal limits throughout the study. Furthermore, D6 did not adversely affect the animals. Therefore, these data would suggest that animals treated with D6 Test Article had tumors that grew slowly (approximately 1 day slower over the 22 day test period than controls). Also, since the Test Article did not show any significant toxic effects, higher concentrations of Test Article could also be used with potentially better tumor regression.</p>

<p id="p-0786" num="0811">Microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs, Cascade Biologics, Portland, Oreg.) were used to assess the in vitro efficacy of D6 and related analogues for their ability to inhibit VEGF-stimulated proliferation. MVECs (passage 2) were grown to 90% confluency, trypsinized and plated in gelatin-coated 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 4&#x2212;8&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well. Sixteen to 24 hours after plating, the cells were washed one time (2004/well) with media devoid of fetal bovine serum but containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Fresh BSA-containing media was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours. After this 24 hour period of starvation, fresh BSA-containing media (containing 25 ng/mL VEGF) with or without D6 was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 hours at 37 C. To assess the dose reponse in this assay, multiple D6 concentrations were tested in duplicate wells. The media was removed and fresh BSA-containing media was added with or without BrdU and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 hours prior to determining the level of incorporation exactly as described by the manufacturer. Results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0787" num="0812">The following experiment assessed the ability of D25 and D27 to block the VEGF-induced migration of HUVECs in culture and demonstrated that the added glycosylation and/or distinct spacer structure used in D27 enhanced its potency.</p>
<p id="p-0788" num="0813">Protocol:</p>
<p id="p-0789" num="0814">Serum-starved HUVECs were placed, 100,000 cells per well, into the upper chambers of BD fibronectin-coated FluoroBlok 24-well insert plates. Basal medium, with or without VEGF (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of D25 or D27, was added to the lower chamber of the wells. After 22 hours, quantitation of cell migration/invasion was achieved by post-labeling cells in the insert plates with a fluorescent dye and measuring the fluorescence of the invading/migrating cells in a fluorescent plate reader. The VEGF-induced migration was calculated for each experimental condition by subtracting the amount of migration that occurred when only basal medium was added to the lower chamber of the wells.</p>

Surprisingly however, Adjunct Awas able to enhance the potency of D6 by about ten-fold when used in the assay simultaneously with D6 (IC<sub>50 </sub>about 2.5 nM). This indicates that compounds containing the TKPPR sequence (or similar) found in Adjunct A can be used to enhance the potency of certain compounds such as D6, which compete with VEGF for binding to KDR. In addition, a heteromultimer containing the peptide sequences found in D6 or similar) as well as the TKPPR sequence (or similar), in one or more repetitions, would likely possess enhanced activity in this assay. See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/871,974, incorporated by reference in its entirety, for details regarding the preparation of TKPPR constructs.</p>

All couplings were 5-16 hours duration. After each coupling, the completion was confirmed by the Kaiser test. In the case of Ser(GalNAc(Ac)<sub>3</sub>-&#x3b1;-D, the coupling was performed in DMF employing HATU/DIEA as the coupling agent. In cases where the Kaiser test indicated unreacted amino groups the coupling was repeated. Removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group and cleavage from resin was performed. The crude peptide was precipitated in ether and washed twice by ether and dried under vacuum. The linear crude peptide was directly cyclized by dissolving the peptide in DMSO (40 mg/mL). The pH of the solyution was adjusted to 8 by addition of aqueous N-methylglucamine. and the solution was stirred in air for 48 h at room temperature. The peptides were then purified employing gradient HPLC as described in Method 1 employing a Waters-YMC C-18 ODS preparative column (250 mm&#xd7;4.6 mm i.d.).

This 0.7 mL solution was stirred for 4 h. The reaction was monitored by HPLC and mass spectroscopy. DMF was removed under vacuum. The excess diester was removed by addition of ethyl acetate, which precipitated the peptide-monoester 5 while dissolving glutaric acid bis-NHS ester. The mixture was centrifuged and the liquid portion decanted. This was repeated twice. The residue was kept under vacuum for 10 min. The residue was dissolved in DMF and mixed with a solution of 2 (37 mg, 0.009 mmol) in DMF (pH 7). It was stirred at ambient temperature for 16 h. The volatiles were removed under high vacuum and the acetate functions were removed by treatment of the residue with 1 mL of hydrazine/MeOH (15/85, v/v) solution with stirring for 2.5 h at ambient temperature. Acetone was added to quench the excess of hydrazine and the volatiles were removed under vacuum. The resulting residue was dissolved in DMSO and purified by preparative HPLC as described above to provide 9 mg of the pure material.</p>

<heading id="h-0513" level="1">Demonstration of the Distinction Between Binding Affinity and Biological Potency Through In Vitro Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0801" num="0826">The following experiments showed that heteromultimeric peptides can display much greater biological potency than a monomeric peptide with similar binding affinity to the same target.</p>
<p id="p-0802" num="0827">Protocol Experiment 1:</p>
<p id="p-0803" num="0828">293H cells were transfected with the KDR cDNA or mock-transfected by standard techniques described in Example 5. The cells were incubated with <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF in the presence or absence of SEQ ID NO: 504 or D1 (at 300, 30, 3, and 0.3 nM). After washing the cells, the bound radioactivity was quantitated on a gamma counter. The percentage inhibition of VEGF binding was calculated using the formula [(Y1&#x2212;Y2)&#xd7;100/Y1], where Y1 is specific binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells in the absence peptides, and Y2 is specific binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells in the presence of peptide competitors. Specific binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells was calculated by subtracting the binding to mock-transfected 293H cells from the binding to KDR-transfected 293H cells.</p>
<p id="p-0804" num="0829">Protocol Experiment 2:</p>
<p id="p-0805" num="0830">Serum-starved HUVECs were placed, 100,000 cells per well, into the upper chambers of BD fibronectin-coated FluoroBlok 24-well insert plates. Basal medium, with or without VEGF (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of SEQ ID NO: 504 or D1, was added to the lower chamber of the wells. After 22 hours, quantitation of cell migration/invasion was achieved by post-labeling cells in the insert plates with a fluorescent dye and measuring the fluorescence of the invading/migrating cells in a fluorescent plate reader. VEGF-stimulated migration was derived by subtracting the basal migration measured in the absence of VEGF.</p>
<p id="p-0806" num="0831">Results Experiment 1:</p>
<p id="p-0807" num="0832">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, SEQ ID NO: 504 AND D1 competed about equally well with <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF for binding to KDR-transfected cells, indicating that they possess comparable binding affinities as well as a comparable ability to inhibit VEGF from binding to KDR.</p>
<p id="p-0808" num="0833">Results Experiment 2:</p>
<p id="p-0809" num="0834">Despite the fact that both SEQ ID NO: 504 and D1 potently block <sup>125</sup>I-VEGF binding to KDR-expressing cells to the same degree (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>), the heterodimeric D1 was much more potent in blocking the biological effects of VEGF as demonstrated in an endothelial cell migration assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>) than the monomeric SEQ ID NO: 504. At up to 62.5 nM, a peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 504 had no effect on VEGF-stimulated migration whereas D1 completely blocked VEGF-stimulated migration at 50 nM. These data suggest that heteromultimeric binding can more effectively block the biological activity of a ligand than a monomer, even when the monomer has a comparable ability to inhibit ligand binding to its receptor.</p>

<p id="p-0811" num="0836">Protocol:</p>
<p id="p-0812" num="0837">293H cells were transfected with the KDR cDNA or mock-transfected by standard techniques described in Example 6.

<p id="p-0813" num="0838">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0814" num="0839">As shown in Table 18, SEQ ID NO: 462, composed of just the Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr (SEQ ID NO: 490) binding motif that is also shared with SEQ ID NO: 286 along with the non-targeted Gly-Gly-Gly-Lys (SEQ ID NO: 262) sequence that was added to most monomeric peptides synthesized based on phage display data, was the smallest fragment able to block peptide/neutravidin-HRP complex binding with an IC<sub>50 </sub>below one micromolar. Surprisingly, a larger fragment comprising SEQ ID NO: 356, failed to significantly inhibit complex binding at one micromolar. However, when a solubilising motif, (Gly-Arg-Gly)<sub>3 </sub>was added to the latter peptide to make SEQ ID NO: 465, it was able to compete with the complex for binding with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 175 nM, confirming that certain fragments of SEQ ID NO: 356 containing the Asp-Trp-Tyr-Tyr (SEQ ID NO: 490) motif retain KDR-binding activity.</p>

<heading id="h-0517" level="1">Cell Based Assay for Binding of KDR/VEGF Complex Binders</heading>
<p id="p-0816" num="0841">The ability of a KDR/VEGF complex-binding peptide to selectively bind to the KDR/VEGF complex was demonstrated.</p>
<p id="h-0518" num="0000">Reagent Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0817" num="0842">The reagents for this assay were prepared as described in Example 5 except where noted.</p>
<p id="h-0519" num="0000">Preparation of Peptide-<sup>125</sup>I-Neutravidin Solution</p>
<p id="p-0818" num="0843">Biotinylated peptides SEQ ID NOS: 321, 320 and 323, and a biotinylated non-binding control peptide were used to prepare 1.25 &#x3bc;M stock solutions in 50% DMSO. A 33.33 nM stock solution of <sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin was purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). A stock solution of 13.33 nM <sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin/100 nM VEGF was prepared by mixing 850 mL of <sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin with 22 &#x3bc;L of 10 &#x3bc;M VEGF and 1275 &#x3bc;L of M199 media. Another stock solution was prepared in the same manner, but lacking VEGF. To prepare 13.33 nM peptide-<sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin complex solutions&#xb1;VEGF, 500 &#x3bc;L of the <sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin (with and without VEGF) stock solutions (prepared in last step) were mixed with 24 &#x3bc;L of 1.25 &#x3bc;M peptide solution of SEQ ID NOS: 321, 320 and 323, or control peptide. The mixtures were incubated on a rotator at 4 C for 60 minutes, followed by addition of 50 &#x3bc;L, of soft release avidin-sepharose (50% slurry in ddH<sub>2</sub>0) to remove excess peptides and another incubation for 30 minutes on a rotator at 4 C. Finally, the soft release avidin-sepharose was pelleted by centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature, and the resulting supernatants were used for the assays.</p>
<p id="h-0520" num="0000">Binding of Peptide/Neutravidin HRP to KDR-Transfected Cells</p>
<p id="p-0819" num="0844">Complexes of control peptide and the test peptides (SEQ ID NOS: 321, 320 and 323) with <sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin in the presence or absence of VEGF (prepared as above) were tested for their ability to bind 293H cells that were transiently-transfected with KDR. The complex of SEQ ID NO: 321 with <sup>125</sup>I-neutravidin specifically bound to KDR-transfected 293H cells as compared to mock transfected cells in the presence of VEGF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>), but not where VEGF was omitted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>). SEQ ID NO: 321, was also the best KDR/VEGF complex binder among the peptides tested using fluorescence polarization and SPR (BIAcore) assays (Table 9). This example shows that peptide (SEQ ID NO: 321) can specifically bind to the KDR/VEGF complex present on the cell surface. This establishes a utility for the assay as useful for targeting the KDR/VEGF complex in vitro and in vivo for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Since the KDR/VEGF binding peptide only detects the functional and active KDR receptor and not all the KDR present on cell surface, it will be useful in detecting and/or treating active angiogenesis in tumors, metastasis, diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, and arthropathies.</p>
<heading id="h-0521" level="1">Example 28</heading>
<p id="p-0820" num="0845">This example provides more evidence that heterodimeric peptides targeting two epitopes on KDR are superior to a homodimeric peptide that binds one of the two epitopes on the target molecule. The following experiment provides further evidence that heterodimeric constructs are superior to homodimeric peptides in their ability to block the biological effects of VEGF.</p>
<p id="p-0821" num="0846">Protocol:</p>
<p id="p-0822" num="0847">Serum-starved HUVECs were placed, 100,000 cells per well, into the upper chambers of BD fibronectin-coated FluoroBlok 24-well insert plates. Basal medium, containing either nothing or VEGF in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of homodimericD8 or heterodimeric D17, was added to the lower chamber of the wells. After 22 hours, quantitation of cell migration/invasion was achieved by post-labeling cells in the insert plates with a fluorescent dye and measuring the fluorescence of the invading/migrating cells in a fluorescent plate reader.</p>
<p id="p-0823" num="0848">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0824" num="0849">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, VEGF induced a large increase in endothelial cell migration in the assay, which was potently blocked by D17 but not D8. D17 blocked VEGF-induced migration with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of about 250 nM while D8 had no significant effect on migration even at 800 nM. This is in spite of the fact that D8 used the full targeting sequence found in SEQ ID NO: 356 while D17 contained a truncated version of the SEQ ID NO: 356 sequence (as seen in SEQ ID NO: 465) with a lower affinity for KDR (as demonstrated in Example 26). Thus a heterodimer with the capability of binding two separate epitopes on KDR is more effective at blocking ligand binding to KDR than a homodimer containing the same or even more potent targeting sequences.</p>

The cycle, encompassing the same sequence positions as those included in SEQ ID NO: 301 (made by formation of the disulfide bond) was made by condensation of the side-chain amino and side-chain acid moieties, resulting in a lactam ring that bridges the residues 6-13 as does the disulfide bond of SEQ ID NO: 301.</p>

Synthesis of Resin bound SEQ ID NO: 453
</p>
<p id="p-0828" num="0853">Synthesis of 1 was carried out using Method 5 on a 0.25 mmol scale. The peptide resin 1 was washed and dried for further derivatization manually (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0524" num="0000">Synthesis of 4 (SEQ ID NO: 453)</p>
<p id="p-0829" num="0854">To 1 (240 mg, 0.06 mmol) was added NMM (N-methyl morpholine)/HOAc/DMF 1/2/10 (v/v/v) (65 mL). Palladium tris-triphenylphosphine [Pd(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, 554.4 mg, 0.48 mmol] was added and the resin was shaken for 20 h shielded from light. The resin was filtered and washed with a solution of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (0.5 g)/DIEA (0.5 mL)/DMF (100 mL), and finally with DMF (3&#xd7;70 mL). This treatment served to expose only the carboxy and amino groups of Glu6 and Lys13 that are required for the lactam forming reaction. The on-resin cyclization of 2 was carried out using HATU (114 mg, 0.3 mmol), NMM (66 &#x3bc;L, 0.6 mmol) and DMF (10 mL) for 3 h. The completion of the cyclization was monitored by Kaiser test. The peptide was cleaved from the peptide resin 3 using reagent B for 4 h. The resin was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated to a paste. The crude peptide was precipitated in ether and washed twice with ether. The cyclic peptide was purified by preparative reverse phase linear gradient HPLC using a Waters-YMC C-18 column (250 mm&#xd7;30 mm i.d.) with CH<sub>3</sub>CN into H<sub>2</sub>O (both with 0.1% TFA) as the eluent. Lyophilization of the product-containing fractions afforded 8 mg of (SEQ ID NO: 453). SEQ ID NOS: 454, 455, 456 and 457 were prepared similarly.</p>

<heading id="h-0529" level="1">Use of the Neutravidin/Avidin HRP Assay with Biotinylated Peptides Identified by Phage Display Allows Identification of Peptides Capable of Binding to the Target Even where the Affinity of the Peptides is Too Low for Other Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0836" num="0861">This example confirms that the neutravidin/HRP screening assay described herein is an effective technique for screening peptides whose affinity as monomers is too low for use in conventional screening assays, such as, for example, an ELISA.</p>
<p id="p-0837" num="0862">Three different derivatives of SEQ ID NO: 482, which was identified by phage display as a peptide that binds to cMet, were prepared as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 60/451,588 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), filed on the same date as U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/382,082, of which the present application is a continuation-in-part.</p>
<p id="p-0838" num="0863">These three peptides and a control peptide that does not bind to cMet, were tested as tetrameric complexes with neutravidin HRP for their ability to bind cMet-expressing MB-231 cells. All three tetrameric complexes of cMet-binding peptides bound to the MB231 cells as compared to control peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0839" num="0864">Cell Culture:</p>
<p id="p-0840" num="0865">MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown as monolayer culture in their recommended media plus 1 mL/L pen/strep (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells were split the day before the assay, 35000 cells were added to each well of a 96 well plate. The rest of the experiment was conducted as in Example 6, except as noted below.</p>
<p id="p-0841" num="0866">Binding of Peptide/Neutravidin HRP to MDA-MB-231 Cells:</p>
<p id="p-0842" num="0867">Complexes of control peptide, and SEQ ID NO: 482 derivatives with 0, 1 or 2 J spacers with neutravidin-HRP were prepared as described above and tested for their ability to bind MDA-MB-231 cells. During the peptide/neutravidin-HRP complex preparation, a 7.5-fold excess of biotinylated peptides over neutravidin-HRP was used to make sure that all four biotin binding sites on neutravidin were occupied. After complex formation, the excess of free biotinylated peptides was removed using soft release avidin-sepharose to avoid any competition between free biotinylated peptides and neutravidin HRP-complexed biotinylated peptides. The experiment was performed at several different concentrations of peptide/neutravidin-HRP, from 0.28 nM to 33.33 nM, to generate saturation binding curves for derivatives with no or one spacer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>) and 0.28 to 16.65 nM to generate a saturation binding curve for the derivative with two spacers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>). In order to draw the saturation binding curve, the background binding of the control peptide/neutravidin HRP complex was subtracted from the binding of the binding derivative peptide/neutravidin-HRP complexes for each concentration tested. Therefore, absorbance on the Y-axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> is differential absorbance (cMet-binding peptide minus control peptide) and not the absolute absorbance. Analysis of the saturation binding data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> using Graph Pad Prism software (version 3.0) yielded a K<sub>D </sub>of 12.62 nM (+/&#x2212;3.16) for the tetrameric derivative with two spacers, 155.4 nM (+/&#x2212;86.56) for the tetrameric derivative with one spacer and 123.8 nM (+/&#x2212;37.71) for the tetrameric derivative without a spacer. These binding constants are, as expected, lower than that measured by FP for the related monodentate peptide SEQ ID NO: 482 (880 nM).</p>
<p id="p-0843" num="0868">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0844" num="0869">As was the case where the binding target was KDR, the neutravidin-HRP assay with biotinylated peptides identified with phage display was useful for identifying peptides capable of binding to an immobilized target even when the affinity of the monomeric binding sequence is too low for an ELISA-type assay (with washing steps after binding) to work well (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>).</p>

In Vivo Animal Models
</p>
<p id="p-0889" num="0914">Known models of angiogenic tissue (rat matrigel model and rat Mat B III model) were used to examine the ability of the peptide conjugated ultrasound conjugates to localize to and provide an image of angiogenic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0890" num="0915">Animals: Female Fisher 344 rat (Charles River Laboratories, France) weighing 120 to 160 g were used for the MATBIII tumor implantation. Male OFA rats (Charles River Laboratories, France) weighing 100 to 150 g were used for Matrigel injection.</p>
<p id="p-0891" num="0916">Anesthesia: Rats were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection (1 mL/kg) of Ketaminol/xylazine (Veterinaria AG/Sigma) (50/10 mg/mL) mixture before implantation of Matrigel or MatBIII cells. For imaging experiments, animals were anesthetized with the same mixture, plus subcutaneous injection of 50% urethane (1 g/kg).</p>
<p id="p-0892" num="0917">Rat MATBIII tumor model: A rat mammary adenocarcinoma, designated 13762 Mat B III, was obtained from ATCC(CRL-1666) and grown in McCoy's 5a medium+10% FCS. 1% glutamine and 1% pen/strep (Invitrogen cat#15290-018). Cells in suspension were collected and washed in growth medium, counted, centrifuged and resuspended in PBS or growth medium at 1.10<sup>7 </sup>cells per mL. For tumor induction: 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells in 0.1 mL were injected into the mammary fat pad of anesthetized female Fisher 344 rat. Tumors usually grow to a diameter of 5-8 mm within 8 days.</p>
<p id="p-0893" num="0918">Rat matrigel model: Matrigel (400 &#x3bc;L) (ECM, Sigma, St Louis, Mo.) containing human bFGF (600 ng/mL) (Chemicon: ref: GF003) was subcutaneously injected in the dorsal flank of each rat.</p>
<p id="p-0894" num="0919">Matrigel solution was kept liquid at 4 C until injection. Immediately after matrigel injection, the injection site was maintained closed for a few seconds with the hand in order to avoid leaking of the matrigel. At the body temperature, matrigel becomes gelatinous. Ten days post-injection, neoangiogenesis was observed in matrigel plug of rat and imaging experiment were performed.</p>
<p id="p-0895" num="0920">In vivo ultrasound imaging: Mat B III tumor or matrigel imaging was performed using an ultrasound imaging system ATL HDI 5000 apparatus equipped with a L7-4 linear probe. B-mode pulse inversion at low acoustic power (MI=0.05) was used to follow accumulation of peptide conjugated-microbubbles on the KDR receptor expressed on the endothelium of neovessels. For the control experiments, an intravenous bolus of unconjugated microbubbles or microbubbles conjugated to non-specific peptide was injected. The linear probe was fixed on the skin directly on line with the implanted tumors or matrigel plug and accumulation of targeted bubbles was followed during thirty minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0896" num="0921">In both models, a perfusion of SonoVue&#xae; was administrated before injecting the test bubble suspension. This allows for the evaluation of the vascularization status; the video intensity obtained after SonoVue&#xae; injection is taken as an internal reference.</p>
<p id="p-0897" num="0922">A baseline frame was recorded and then insonation was stopped during the bubble injection. At various time points after injection (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes) insonation was reactivated and 2 frames of one second were recorded on a videotape.</p>
<p id="p-0898" num="0923">Video frames from matrigel or Mat B III tumor imaging experiments were captured and analysed with the video-capture and Image-Pro Plus 2.0 software respectively. The same rectangular Area of Interest (AOI) including the whole sectional area of the tumor or matrigel was selected on images at different time points (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes). At each time point, the sum of the video pixel inside the AOI was calculated after the substraction of the AOI baseline. Results are expressed as the percentage of the signal obtained with SonoVue, which is taken as 100%. Similarly, a second AOI situated outside from matrigel or tumor, and representing the freely circulating contrast agent, is also analysed.</p>
<p id="h-0561" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0899" num="0924">The results indicate that ultrasound contrast agents bearing KDR binding moieties of the invention localize to angiogenic (and thus KDR expressing) tissue in animal models.

<heading id="h-0563" level="1">Enhancing the Serum Residence of KDR-Binding Peptides</heading>
<p id="p-0900" num="0925">Compounds that contain maleimide and other groups that can react with thiols react with thiols on serum proteins, especially serum albumin, when the compounds are injected. The adducts have serum life times similar to serum albumin, more than 14 days in humans for example.</p>
<p id="h-0564" num="0000">Conjugation to Maleimide</p>
<p id="p-0901" num="0926">Methods are available that allow for the direct synthesis of maleimide-labeled linear peptides encompassed by the present invention (Holmes, D. et al., 2000. <i>Bioconjug. Chem., </i>11:439-444).</p>
<p id="p-0902" num="0927">Peptides that include disulfides can be derivatized with maleimide in one of several ways. For example, a third cysteine can be added at the carboxy terminus. The added cysteine is protected with protecting group that is orthogonal to the type of groups used for the cysteines that are to form the disulfide. The disulfide is formed by selectively deprotecting the intended cysteines and oxidizing the peptide. The final cysteine is then deprotected and the peptide reacted with a large molar excess of a bismaleimide. The resulting compound has one of the maleimides free to react with serum albumin or other thiol-containing serum proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0903" num="0928">Alternatively, a cyclic peptide of the present invention is synthesized with a lysine-containing C-terminal extention, such as -GGGK (SEQ ID NO: 262). Lysines of the KDR-binding motif are protected with ivDde and the C-terminal lysine is deprotected. This lysine is reacted with a maleimide-contining compound, such as N-[e-maleimidocaproyloxy]succinimide ester (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill.) or N-(a-Maleimidoacetoxy)succinimide ester (Pierce Biotechnology).</p>
<p id="h-0565" num="0000">Conjugation to a Moiety that Binds Serum Albumin Non-Covelently</p>
<p id="p-0904" num="0929">Polypeptides having a molecular weight less than 50-60 kDa are rapidly excreted. Many small molecules, such as fatty acids, bind to serum albumin. Fatty acids containing 10 to 20 carbon atoms have substantial affinity for serum albumin. Linear and branched fatty acids can be used. This binding in serum can reduce the rate of excretion. Using methods known in the art, serum-albumin-binding moieties can be conjugated to any one of the peptides herein disclosed. The serum-albumin-binding moiety can be joined to the KDR-binding peptide through a linker. The linker can be peptidic or otherwise, such as PEG. Linkers of zero to about thirty atoms are preferred. It is preferred that the linker be hydrophilic. The serum-albumin-binding moiety can be conjugated to the KDR-binding peptide at either end or though a side group of an appended amino acid. Suitable side groups include lysine and cysteine. Such compounds can also comprise chelators for radionuclides, as discussed herein. A KDR-binding peptide joined to a serum-albumin-binding moiety will bind KDR.</p>
<p id="h-0566" num="0000">Conjugation to PEG</p>
<p id="p-0905" num="0930">Attachment of poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) to proteins and peptides enhances the serum residence of these molecules. Attachment of PEG (linear or branched) to a KDR-binding peptide is expected give substantial enhancement of serum residence time. The molecular weight of the PEG should be at least 10 kDA, more preferably at least 20 kDa, and most preferably 30 kDa or more. The PEG could be attached at the N- or C-terminus. Methods of attaching PEG to peptides are well known in the art (Roberts M. et al., 2002. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev., 54:459-476). PEG can be attached to reactive side groups such as lysine or cysteine.</p>
<p id="h-0567" num="0000">Fusion to Serum Protein</p>
<p id="p-0906" num="0931">Proteins comprising serum albumin (SA) and other proteins have enhanced serum residence times. The amino-acid sequence of human SA (hSA) is shown in Table 22. Table 23 shows a fusion protein comprising: AGDWWVE<u style="single">CRVGTGLC</u>YRYDTGTGGGK(SEQ ID NO: 286):: PGGSGGEGGSGGEGGRPGGSEGGTGG::mature hSA:: GGSGGEGGSGGEGGSGPGEGGEGSGGRP:: GDSRVCWEDSWGGEVCFRYDPGGGK(SEQ ID NO: 294). The KDR-binding peptides are separated from mature hSA by linkers that are rich in glycine to allow flexible spacing. One need not use all of hSA to obtain an injectable protein that will have an enhanced serum residence time. Chemical groups, such as maleimide and alpha bromo carboxylates, react with the unpaired cysteine (residue 34) to form stable adducts. Thus, one can attach a single chelator to hSA fusion proteins so that the adduct will bind a radionuclide. One can prepare a chelator with a maleimide group and couple that to hSA or an hSA derivative. Alternatively, hSA or an hSA derivative can be reacted with a bismaleimide and a chelator carrying a reactive thiol could be reacted with the bismaleimide-derivatized hSA.</p>
<p id="p-0907" num="0932">Construction of genes that encode a given amino-acid sequence are known in the art. Expression of HSA fusions in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>is known in the art (Sleep, D et al., 1991. Biotechnology (NY), 9:183-187).</p>
<p id="h-0568" num="0000">Pretargeting Radioactivity or Toxins to KDR Expressing Tumors</p>
<p id="p-0908" num="0933">Conventional radioimmune cancer therapy is plagued by two problems. The generally attainable targeting ratio (ratio of administered dose localizing to tumor versus administered dose circulating in blood or ratio of administered dose localizing to tumor versus administered dose migrating to bone marrow) is low. Also, the absolute dose of radiation or therapeutic agent delivered to the tumor is insufficient in many cases to elicit a significant tumor response. Improvement in targeting ratio or absolute dose to tumor would be of great importance for cancer therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0909" num="0934">The present invention provides methods of increasing active agent localization at a target cell site of a mammalian recipient. The methods include, for example, a) administering to a recipient a fusion protein comprising a targeting moiety and a member of a ligand-anti-ligand binding pair; b) thereafter administering to the recipient a clearing agent capable of directing the clearance of circulating fusion protein via hepatocyte receptors of the recipient, wherein the clearing agent incorporates a member of the ligand-anti-ligand binding pair; and c) subsequently administering to the recipient an active agent comprising a ligand/anti-ligand binding pair member.</p>
<p id="p-0910" num="0935">Hexoses, particularly the hexoses galactose, glucose, mannose, mannose-6-phosphate, N-acetylglucosamine, pentamannosyl phosphate, N-acetylgalactosamine, thioglycosides of galactose, and mixtures thereof are effective in causing hepatic clearance. Binding of sugars to hepatic receptors is not, however, the only means of directing a molecule to the liver.)</p>
<p id="p-0911" num="0936">Clearance of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) from the circulation is by binding to Kupffer cells in the liver. We have shown that CEA binding to Kupffer cells occurs via a peptide sequence YPELPK representing amino acids 107-112 of the CEA sequence. This peptide sequence is located in the region between the N-terminal and the first immunoglobulin like loop domain. Using native CEA and peptides containing this sequence complexed with a heterobifunctional crosslinking agent and ligand blotting with biotinylated CEA and NCA we have shown binding to an 80 kD protein on the Kupffer cell surface. This binding protein may be important in the development of hepatic metastases. (Thomas, P. et al., 1992. <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., </i>188:671-677</p>
<p id="p-0912" num="0937">To use YPELPK (SEQ ID NO: 498) as a clearance agent, one fuses this sequence via a linker to a moiety that binds the fusion protein (Ab). For example, if the Ab has affinity for DOTA/Re, one would make a derivative having YPELPK attached to DOTA/Re; for example, rvYPELPKpsGGG-DOTA. &#x2018;rvYPELPKps&#x2019; is a fragment of CEA that includes the YPELPK sequence identified by Thomas et al. Any convenient point on DOTA can be use for attachment. RVYPELPKPSGGG-DOTA/cold Re (SEQ ID NO: 499) would then be used as a clearing agent. The Fab corresponding to the fusion Ab would have affinity for the clearing agent of Kd&#x3c;100 nM, preferably Kd&#x3c;10 nM, and most preferably Kd&#x3c;1 nM.</p>
<p id="p-0913" num="0938">The therapeutic agent would contain DOTA/<sup>185</sup>Re. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic agent would contain two or more DOTA moieties so that the Ab immobilized on the tumor would bind the bis-DOTA compound with high avidity. The two DOTA moieties would preferably be connected with a hydrophilic linker of ten to thirty units of PEG. PEG is a preferred linker because it is not degraded, promotes solubility. Ten to thirty units of PEG is not sufficient to give the bis DOTA compound a very long serum residence time. A half-life of 30 minutes to 10 hours is acceptable. The serum half life should be longer than the radioactive half life of the radionuclide used so that most of the radiation is delivered to the tumor or to the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0914" num="0939">In one embodiment, a &#x201c;fusion protein&#x201d; of the present invention comprises at least one KDR-binding peptide fused to the amino terminus or the carboxy terminus of either the light chain (LC) or the heavy chain (HC) of a human antibody. Optionally and preferably, two or more KDR-binding peptides are fused to the antibody. The antibody is picked to have high affinity for a small molecule that can be made radioactive or have a toxin attached. Preferably, the affinity of the Fab corresponding to the Ab has affinity for the small molecule with Kd less than 100 nM, more preferably less than 10 nM, and most preferably less than 1 nM. The small molecule could be a chelator capable of binding a useful radioactive atom, many of which are listed herein. The small molecule could be a peptide having one or more tyrosines to which radioactive iodine can be attached without greatly affecting the binding property of the peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0915" num="0940">Any KDR-binding peptide (KDR-BP) of the present invention can be fused to either end of either chain of an antibody that is capable of binding a small radioactive compound.</p>

<p id="p-0916" num="0941">In cases (5)-(15), the linkers (shown as &#x201c;link1&#x201d;, &#x201c;link2&#x201d;, &#x201c;link3&#x201d;, and &#x201c;link4&#x201d;) can be the same or different or be absent. These linkers, if present, are preferably hydrophilic, protease resistant, non-toxic, non-immunogenic, and flexible. Preferably, the linkers do not contain glycosylation sites or sequences known to cause hepatic clearance. A length of zero to fifteen amino acids is preferred. The KDR-binding peptides (KDR-BP#1, #2, #3, and #4) could be the same or different. If the encoded amino-acid sequences are the same, it is preferred that the DNA encoding these sequences is different.</p>
<p id="p-0917" num="0942">Since antibodies are dimeric, each fusion protein will present two copies of each of the fused peptides. In case (15), there will be eight KDR-BPs present and binding to KDR-displaying cells should be highly avid. It is possible that tumor penetration will be aided by moderate KDR affinity in each of the KDR-BPs rather than maximal affinity.</p>
<p id="p-0918" num="0943">One group of preferred embodiments have SEQ ID NO: 294 as one of the KDR-BPs and SEQ ID NO: 286 as the other. For example, in case (7) (KDR-BP#1::link1::LC/KDR-BP#2::link2::HC), KDR-BP#1 is SEQ ID NO: 294 and KDR-BP#2 is SEQ ID NO: 286 and link1 is between 10 and 20 amino acids and link2 is also between ten and twenty amino acids. A suitable sequence for link1 is GGSGGEGRPGEGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 491) and a suitable sequence for link2 is GSESGGRPEGGSGEGG (SEQ ID NO: 492). Other sequences rich in Gly, Ser, Glu, Asp, Thr, Gln, Arg, and Lys are suitable. To reduce the risk of proteolysis, it is preferred to follow Arg or Lys with Pro. To avoid difficulties in production and poor solubility, it is preferred to avoid long stretches (more than twelve) of uncharged residues. Since the peptides are displayed at the amino termini of LC and HC, the combined linker length will allow them to bind to KDR simultaneously. Additionally, in case (15)(KDR-BP#1::link1::LC::link2::KDR-BP#2/KDR-BP#3::link3::HC::link4::KDR-BP#4), KDR-BP#1 and KDR-BP#2 are SEQ ID NO: 294 and KDR-BP#3 and KDR-BP#4 are SEQ ID NO: 29. Link1 and link3 are 10 to 20 amino acids and link2 and link4 are each 15 to 30 amino acids. Link2 and link4 are longer because they need to allow a peptide on the carboxy terminus of LC to reach a peptide on the carboxy terminus of HC.</p>
<p id="p-0919" num="0944">The fusion protein is produced in eukaryotic cells so that the constant parts of the HC will be glycosylated. Preferably, the cells are mammalian cells, such as CHO cells.</p>
<p id="p-0920" num="0945">The fusion proteins are injected into a patient, and time is allowed for the fusion protein to accumulate at the tumor. A clearing agent is injected so that fusion protein that has not become immobilized at the tumor will be cleared. In previous pretargeting methods, the antibody combining site has been used to target to the tumor and biotin/avidin or biotin/streptavidin has been used to attach the radioactive or toxic agent to the immobilized antibody. The biotin/avidin or streptavidin binding is essentially irreversible. Here we fuse a target-binding peptide to the antibody that is picked to bind a radioactive or toxic agent. Because the fusion protein contains 2, 4, 6, or 8 KDR-BPs, binding of the fusion protein to the tumor is very avid. A clearing agent that will cause fusion protein not immobilized at the tumor to clear can be administered between 2 and 48 hours of the injection of the fusion protein. Because the clearance agent is monomeric in the moiety that binds the antibody, complexes of clearance agent and immobilized fusion protein will not have very long life times. Within 4 to 48 hours of injecting clearance agent, the immobilized antibody will have lost any clearance agent that binds there. The active agent is, preferably, dimeric in the moiety that binds the fusion protein. The active agent is injected between 2 and &#x2dc;48 hours of injection of clearance agent.</p>

Tumors are measured, and when tumors reach 100-200 mg, 100 animals are selected and randomized into 10 study groups of 10 animals each. The overall study is summarized in Table 24 below. The dosing schedule follows the chart shown in Table 25. Tumor measurements are taken on each animal twice a week during the normal workweek. Measurements are made by hand-held vernier caliper. Body weights and tumor measurements are recorded twice a week. This study is based on a typical four week study from beginning of dosing and includes removal of 30 tumors.</p>

<p id="p-0963" num="0988">Where the SEQ ID NO: 294-derived sequence and the SEQ ID NO: 480-derived sequence are separately attached to phospholipid stabilized microbubbles as monomers the resulting preparations achieve binding of the bubbles to KDR transfected cells in vitro to a different extent (3.5% and 16.8%). When a preparation of phospholipid stabilized microbubbles resulting from the addition of equal quantities of each of these peptide monomers (but the same total peptide load) is tested in the same system, 12.9% binding is achieved. Binding is a little more than the average of the two but as it is achieved with two sequences that bind to different sites on the target will be more resistant to competition at one or other of the sites on the target. However, for D23, the dimer, binding is increased to 22.9% (with the same peptide load). These results indicate that hetromultimers of the invention permit increased binding and increased resistance to competition.</p>
<p id="h-0618" num="0000">In Vivo Animal Models</p>
<p id="p-0964" num="0989">A known model of angiogenic tissue (the rat Mat B III model) was used to examine the ability of phospholipids-stabilized microbubbles conjugated to a heteromultimer of the invention to localize to and provide images of angiogenic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0965" num="0990">Female Fisher 344 rat (Charles River Laboratories, France) weighing 120 to 160 g were used for the MATBIII tumor implantation. Male OFA rats (Charles River Laboratories, France) weighing 100 to 150 g were used for Matrigel injection.</p>
<p id="h-0619" num="0000">Anesthesia</p>
<p id="p-0966" num="0991">Rats were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection (1 mL/kg) of Ketaminol&#xae;/xylazine (Veterinaria AG/Sigma) (50/10 mg/mL) mixture before implantation of Matrigel or MatBIII cells. For imaging experiments, animals were anesthetized with the same mixture, plus subcutaneous injection of 50% urethane (1 g/kg).</p>
<p id="h-0620" num="0000">Rat MATBIII Tumor Model</p>
<p id="p-0967" num="0992">A rat mammary adenocarcinoma, designated 13762 Mat B III, was obtained from ATCC(CRL-1666) and grown in McCoy's 5a medium+10% FCS. 1% glutamine and 1% pen/strep (InVitrogen cat#15290-018). Cells in suspension were collected and washed in growth medium, counted, centrifuged and resuspended in PBS or growth medium at 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>cells per mL. For tumor induction: 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells in 0.1 mL were injected into the mammary fat pad of anesthetized female Fisher 344 rat. Tumors usually grow to a diameter of 5-8 mm within 8 days.</p>
<p id="h-0621" num="0000">In Vivo Ultrasound Imaging</p>
<p id="p-0968" num="0993">Tumor imaging was performed using an ultrasound imaging system ATL HDI 5000 apparatus equipped with a L7-4 linear probe. B-mode pulse inversion at low acoustic power (MI=0.05) was used to follow accumulation of peptide conjugated-microbubbles on the KDR receptor expressed on the endothelium of neovessels. For the control experiments, an intravenous bolus of unconjugated microbubbles or microbubbles conjugated to non-specific peptide was injected. The linear probe was fixed on the skin directly on line with the implanted tumors and accumulation of targeted bubbles was followed during thirty minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0969" num="0994">A perfusion of SonoVue&#xae; was administrated before injecting the test bubble suspension. This allows for the evaluation of the vascularization status and the video intensity obtained after SonoVue&#xae; injection is taken as an internal reference.</p>
<p id="p-0970" num="0995">A baseline frame was recorded and then insonation was stopped during the injection of the microbubbles. At various time points after injection (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes) insonation was reactivated and 2 frames of one second were recorded on a videotape.</p>
<p id="p-0971" num="0996">Video frames from tumor imaging experiments were captured and analysed with the video-capture and Image-Pro Plus 2.0 software respectively. The same rectangular Area of Interest (AOI) including the whole sectional area of the tumor was selected on images at different time points (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 minutes). At each time point, the sum of the video pixel inside the AOI was calculated after the subtraction of the AOI baseline. Results are expressed as the percentage of the signal obtained with SonoVue&#xae;, which is taken as 100%. Similarly, a second AOI situated outside the tumor, and representing the freely circulating contrast agent, is also analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0972" num="0997"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> shows uptake and retention of bubble contrast in the tumor up to 30 minutes post injection for suspensions of phospholipid stabilized microbubbles conjugated to a heteromultimeric construct of the invention prepared as described above (D23). In contrast, the same bubbles showed only transient (no more than 10 minutes) visualization/bubble contrast in the AOI situated outside the tumor site.</p>
<heading id="h-0622" level="1">Example 47</heading>
<p id="p-0973" num="0998">The study described below was performed to assess the ability of contrast agents containing representative KDR-binding peptides described herein to detect, monitor and assess the anti-angiogenic therapeutic effect of therapeutic agents such as Sunitinib (a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits KDR).</p>
<p id="h-0623" num="0000">Material and Methods</p>
<p id="p-0974" num="0999">Four (4) female OFA rats (Charles River, Lyon, France) were investigated. At the specific age of 42 days, animals received intraperitoneal injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea 50 mg/kg (NMU, Sigma-Aldrich, ref D3254) prepared in 0.9% NaCl, in order to develop a KDR-expressing tumor in the animals (see latency period infra) Weight of the animals was 241.8&#xb1;6.3 g when entering the protocol. Animals received food and water (tap water) ad libitum.</p>
<p id="h-0624" num="0000">Study Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0975" num="1000">Sunitinib malate salt (LC Laboratories, ref S-8803) was dissolved in NaCl 0.9% containing 10% polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300, Sigma-Aldrich, ref 90878), 0.5% polysorbate 80 (Tween 80, Sigma-Aldrich, ref) pH 3.75. Stock solution was made weekly and stored at 4&#xb0; C. Rats received daily oral gavage of 53.6 mg/kg of sunitinib malate salt, which corresponds to 40 mg/kg of sunitinib.</p>
<p id="h-0625" num="0000">Animal Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0976" num="1001">Gaseous anesthesia of the rat was achieved by Isoflurane inhalation 5% in 1 L/min oxygen enriched (95%) air. At the level of the tumor site, skin was gently shaved and an ultrasound coupling gel (Aquasonic 100, Parker, USA) was applied between the clinical ultrasound probe and the skin.</p>
<p id="h-0626" num="0000">Imaging Examination</p>
<p id="p-0977" num="1002">Ultrasound imaging was performed using a clinical ultrasound device (Philips iU22, vision 2008, Philips Medical System, Eindhoven, The Netherlands), operating in a contrast-specific imaging mode. The linear probe L12-5 was used.</p>
<p id="h-0627" num="0000">Experimental Procedure</p>
<p id="h-0628" num="0000">Dosing of Animals</p>
<p id="p-0978" num="1003">Vials of a contrast agent containing D5 were reconstituted in 2 ml glucose 5%. D5 is described in more detail in Examples 50 and 51. As described in Example 51, D5 includes the peptide monomers (12) (SEQ ID NO. 277) and (13) (SEQ ID NO. 337) which form dimer (16) (D5). Lipopeptides comprising the dimer D5 were prepared as described in Example 52. The lyophilized precursor of the contrast agent was obtained according to the procedure illustrated in Example 59a, by replacing DSPE-PEG2000 with DPPE-PEG5000 (2.3 mg) and admixing it with 3.3. mg of the dimeric phospholipid conjugate (11) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in 60 mL of a distilled water, containing 10% PEG4000. Stearate was further replaced by palmitic acid (1.0 mg) and admixed with DSPC (59 mg) in cyclooctane (4.8 ml). Emulsification was effected at 12&#x2032;000 rpm (five minutes). The lyophilizate was reconsistituted as described above. The contrast agent was quickly injected through the catheter placed in the caudal vein at the dose of 2 &#x3bc;l gas per kg. The injection volume ranged from 49 to 61 &#x3bc;l followed by a flush of 100 &#x3bc;l saline. Injections were performed at a constant rate of 4 ml/min.</p>
<p id="h-0629" num="0000">Echographic Evaluations</p>
<p id="p-0979" num="1004">Tumor size was assessed in fundamental-B mode using calipers.</p>
<p id="p-0980" num="1005">For each injection, tumor imaging was performed in contrast mode starting 10 sec before contrast injection until 10 to 14 minutes after injection</p>
<p id="h-0630" num="0000">Quantification of Tumor Contrast Enhancement and Targeting</p>
<p id="p-0981" num="1006">Contrast enhancement was quantified from Dicom files using an in-house quantification and providing, among other parameters, mean echo-signal values in areas of interest as a function of time. The amplitude of the echo signal was expressed as linearized echo amplitude values. Individual frames were analyzed, time-intensity curves were generated and Maximum intensity (Imax) was determined as an index of tumor vascularization and late phase opacification (LPO) was determined at 10 min after injection in the median plane of the tumor.</p>
<p id="h-0631" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0982" num="1007">Latency for tumor appearance ranged between 44 days and 93 days after NMU-treatment for the four tested rats. When the lesion was detected, tumor size, assessed by fundamental-B mode was around 0.3 cm<sup>2 </sup>(largest cross section). Performing in vivo imaging with D5-containing microbubbles showed that Imax, an index of tumor vascularization, was quite variable throughout the follow up of tumor growth whereas LPO, which correlates with the expression of KDR receptor, was more stable over the duration of the protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0983" num="1008">In rats no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3, treatment with sunitinib (a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which inhibits KDR) was initiated on day 106 after NMU treatment, at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Tumor size was determined in fundamental B-mode. Values were multiplied by 10 to fit with Y abscissa scale. Imax and LPO were measured using contrast mode and after injection of the D5-containing contrast agent.</p>

<p id="p-0993" num="1018">On day 78, tumor was harvested and processed for immunohistochemistry staining <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> provides immunohistochemistry images for this sample.</p>
<p id="p-0994" num="1019">48 hours after treatment (day 108) tumor size remained unchanged in rats no. 1 and no. 4 (respectively &#x2212;4.6% and &#x2212;0.7% when expressed as a percentage of the tumor prior sunitinib treatment). In rat no. 3 there was a reduction of tumor size by 30%. Imax was slightly decreased in rat no. 1 (&#x2212;11%) and increased in both rats no. 2 and no. 3 (+23% and +11% respectively). Finally, the measurement of LPO, i.e. targeted microbubbles bound to KDR receptor, revealed a strong decrease in all 3 rats 24 hours after sunitinib treatment (&#x2212;30%, &#x2212;70% and &#x2212;66% in rats no. 1, no. 2 and no. 3 respectively). Sunitinib treatment was maintained up to day 109 for rat no. 2 and up to day 116 for rats no. 1 and no. 3. Treatment with sunitinib for longer periods (up to 3 days for rat no. 2 and 10 days for rats no. 1 and no. 3) resulted in a decrease in all measured parameters, tumor size, Imax and LPO.</p>
<p id="p-0995" num="1020">Interestingly in rat no. 2, immunohistochemistry performed 3 days after initiation of sunitinib treatment, showed large area of necrosis in the tumor, in agreement with the reduction of all echographic parameters (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0996" num="1021">Finally, in rat no. 4, which did not receive sunitinib, immunohistochemistry was performed on day 78 after NMU treatment. Tumor size was around 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. Staining for CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, revealed a strong staining of vessels (mostly straight) in stroma tissue surrounding tumor nodules, whereas the staining was weak inside the tumor nodules. Conversely KDR staining in tumor vessels was very strong and showed tortuous vessels in tumor nodules, whereas only a few vessels were stained for KDR in the stroma (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0633" num="0000">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0997" num="1022">These data indicate that use of targeted microbubbles comprising KDR binding peptides such as D5, allows for the early evaluation of the efficacy of anti-angiogenic treatment therapies. Thus, according to certain embodiments, the present invention allows for adjustments to therapeutic regimens to be made as needed and in a timely manner.</p>

<p id="p-0998" num="1023">Solvents for reactions, chromatographic purification and HPLC analyses were E. Merck Omni grade solvents from VWR Corporation (West Chester, Pa.). N-Methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were obtained from Pharmco Products Inc. (Brookfield, Conn.), and were peptide synthesis grade or low water/amine-free Biotech grade quality. Piperidine (sequencing grade, redistilled 99+%) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (spectrophotometric grade or sequencing grade) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation (Milwaukee, Wis.) or from the Fluka Chemical Division of Sigma-Alrich Corporation. N,N&#x2032;-Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), phenol (99%), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) and triisopropylsilane (TIS) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. Fmoc-protected amino acids, pseudoproline dipeptides, Fmoc-Asp(O-tBu)-Ser(&#x3c8;Me,Mepro)-OH and Fmoc-Gly-Thr(&#x3c8;Me,Mepro)-OH and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) were obtained from Novabiochem (San Diego, Calif.). Fmoc-8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (Adoa) was obtained from NeoMPS Corp (San Diego, Calif.) or Suven Life Sciences (Hyderabad, India). Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-ethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethyleneglycol)2000]ammonium salt, [DSPE-PEG2000-NH2] were obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, Ill.) and Avanti&#xae; Polar Lipids (Alabaster, Ala.), respectively. Fmoc-Gly-Gly-Gly-OH and Fmoc-Gly-Gly-OH were prepared in-house from the corresponding triglycine or diglycine by the reaction with Fmoc-OSu. An AG MP-50 ion-exchange resin was obtained from Bio-Rad (Hercules, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0999" num="1024">Analytical HPLC data were generally obtained using a Shimadzu LC-10AT VP dual pump gradient system employing a Waters XTerra MS-C18 4.6&#xd7;50 mm column, (particle size: 5 &#x3bc;L; 120 &#x212b; pore size) and gradient or isocratic elution systems using water (0.1% TFA) as eluent A and CH3CN (0.1% TFA) or CH3CN&#x2014;CH3OH (1:1, v/v) (0.1% TFA) as eluent B. Detection of compounds was accomplished using UV at 220 and 254 nm. The purity of the phospholipid-PEG-peptide derivatives was determined on a YMC C-4 (5 &#x3bc;M, 300 &#x212b;, 4.6&#xd7;250 mm) column or on a Zorbax 300 SB-C3 (3.5 &#x3bc;M; 300 &#x212b;, 3&#xd7;150 mm) column using a SEDEX 55 Light Scattering Detector (LSD) and with a UV detector.</p>
<p id="p-1000" num="1025">Preparative HPLC was conducted on a Shimadzu LC-8A dual pump gradient system equipped with a SPD-10AV UV detector fitted with a preparative flow cell. Generally the solution containing the crude peptide was loaded onto a reversed phase C18, C4 or C3 column, depending on the compound characteristics, using a third pump attached to the preparative Shimadzu LC-8A dual pump gradient system. After the solution of the crude product mixture was applied to the preparative HPLC column the reaction solvents and solvents employed as diluents, such as DMF or DMSO, were eluted from the column at low organic phase composition. Then the desired product was eluted using a gradient elution of eluent B into eluent A. Product-containing fractions were combined based on their purity as determined by analytical HPLC and mass spectral analysis. The combined fractions were freeze-dried to provide the desired product.</p>
<p id="p-1001" num="1026">Amino acid composition analyses were performed at the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University, New Haven, Conn. Mass spectral data were obtained from MScan Inc. (606 Brandywine Parkway, West Chester Pa. 19380) or obtained in-house on an Agilent LC-MSD 1100 Mass Spectrometer. For the purposes of fraction selection and characterization of the products mass spectral values were usually obtained using API-ES in negative ion mode. Generally the molecular weight of the target peptides was &#x2dc;3000; the mass spectra usually exhibited doubly or triply negatively charged ion mass values rather than [M-H]&#x2014;. These were generally employed for selection of fractions for collection and combination to obtain the pure peptide during HPLC purification. In some cases fractions exhibited dominant peaks attributable to [M-2H]/2+57 or [M-2H]/2+114 in the mass spectrum. These peaks are due to the formation of adducts of one or two molecules of trifluoroacetic acid per molecule of the peptide. After careful collection of fractions by comparing MS results and HPLC purities and freeze-drying process, a small amount of the isolated fluffy solid was dissolved in water (0.5 mg/mL) and treated with a drop of aqueous N-methyl-D-glucamine (&#x2dc;0.5 M). This solution was analyzed by HPLC and MS for final purity results of the purified peptide. Peptide solutions in the presence of N-methyl-D-glucamine did not exhibit [M-2H]/2+57 or [M-2H]/2+114 mass value peaks in the mass spectrum, instead the expected [M-2H]/2 or [M-3H]/3 peaks were observed.</p>

<p id="p-1004" num="1029">The linear peptide monomer (2) was synthesized by an established automated protocol on a SONATA&#xae;/Pilot Peptide Synthesizer using Fmoc-Pal-Peg-PS resin (0.2 mmol/g), Fmoc-protected amino acids and DIC-mediated HOBt ester activation in DMF. The peptide sequence was synthesized in stepwise fashion by SPPS methods on the Fmoc-Pal-Peg-PS resin, typically on a 10 mmol scale. The amino acid couplings were carried out with a 4-fold excess each of amino acid and the DIC-HOBt reagent pair in DMF.</p>
<p id="p-1005" num="1030">In a typical coupling of an amino acid, 5 mL of dry DMF per gram of resin was used. The total volume of DMF, calculated on the basis of resin used, was allocated among amino acid, HOBt and DIC for solution preparation. For example, for the synthesis involving 50 g (10 mmol scale) of resin, the calculated volume of 250 mL of DMF was distributed among amino acid (150 mL), HOBt (50 mL) and DIC (50 mL). The amino acid vessel on the Sonata Pilot Peptide Synthesizer was charged with the solid dry amino acid (4-fold excess with respect to the resin). At inception of the coupling step, the software of the instrument was employed to deliver successively the chosen volume of DMF (for dilution of the amino acid) and HOBt (4 eq.) in DMF and DIC (4 eq.) in DMF and mixing by nitrogen bubbling was initiated and conducted for 4 min. This served to pre-activate the amino acid and to insure complete dissolution of all components of the mixture. After activation, the software mediated the transfer of the solution of the activated Fmoc-amino acid to the reaction vessel containing the resin. After transfer was complete the vessel was agitated for 3 h with recurrent nitrogen bubbling. After the 3 h coupling time, the resin was washed thoroughly with DMF (5 mL/g, 6&#xd7;) and the cleavage of the Fmoc-group was performed with 25% piperidine in DMF (5 mL/g) containing HOBt (0.1M) (2&#xd7;10 min). The resin was thoroughly washed with DMF (5 mL/g, 6&#xd7;) to assure complete removal of piperidine from the resin in preparation for the ensuing amino acid coupling. In the case of Fmoc-Gly-Gly-Gly-OH and Fmoc-Gly-Gly-OH, the pre-activation in the amino acid bottle was not conducted in order to minimize the formation of diketopiperazine during the activation time as discussed in the text. Therefore, in these two cases, the solutions of amino acid, HOBt and DIC were added to the reaction vessel sequentially and the coupling process was conducted with &#x2018;in situ&#x2019; activation.</p>
<p id="p-1006" num="1031">After chain elongation was completed, the Fmoc group of the N-terminal amino acid was removed in the standard manner followed by the standard wash with DMF (vide supra). The N-terminal amino acid was then capped by treatment with freshly prepared acetylation mixture (0.5M acetic anhydride, 0.125M DIEA and 0.015M HOBt in DMF/6 mL/g of resin), 2&#xd7;20 min. After completion of the peptide synthesis, the resin was treated with the cleavage cocktail, &#x2018;Reagent B&#x2019; (TFA:water:phenol:triisopropylsilane, 88:5:5:2, v/v/w/v) (10 mL/g of resin) for 4 h. The volatiles were removed and the paste thus obtained was triturated with ether to provide a solid which was washed with ether (3&#xd7;) with intervening centrifugation (to compact the suspended solids in order to allow decantation of the supernatant) and then dried under vacuum to provide the required peptide as an off-white solid. A 10 mmol scale synthesis of the linear peptide monomer (2) gave 33.82 g (103% of theory) of the crude peptide. The greater than theoretical yield was most likely due to moisture and residual solvents.</p>

The column was not eluted with the equilibrating eluent during application of the sample solution. After the sample solution was applied to the column, the composition of the eluent was ramped to 20% CH<sub>3</sub>CN-water (0.1% TFA) over 1 min, and a linear gradient at a rate of 0.6%/min of CH3CN (0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA) was initiated and maintained for 50 min. Fractions (15 mL) were manually collected using UV at 220 nm as an indicator of product elution. The collected fractions were analyzed on a Waters XTerra analytical reversed phase C-18 column (5 particle, 120 &#x212b; pore) and product-containing fractions of &#x3e;95% purity were pooled and freeze-dried to afford the corresponding pure linear peptide monomer (2). Typically the purification of 0.5 g of crude (2) afforded 0.12 g (24% yield) of the desired product (&#x3e;95% purity).</p>

<p id="p-1011" num="1036">A round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stir bar and septum cap was charged sequentially with anhydrous dimethylformamide (7.5 mL), disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG, 0.25 g, 0.75 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.10 g, 0.78 mmol) with stirring. Solid linear peptide monomer (2) (0.5 g, 0.152 mmol) was added portionwise to the above solution over a period of 2 min; then the solution was stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted to &#x2dc;50 mL with anhydrous ethyl acetate; this resulted in precipitation of the intermediate mono-NHS ester (3), the glutaric acid monoamide mono-NHS ester of peptide monomer (2). The solution was centrifuged to bring down mono-NHS ester (3) as a colorless solid. The supernatant containing excess DSG was decanted from the compacted solid mono-NHS ester (3) which was again dispersed in ethyl acetate, centrifuged and washed twice more to remove the remaining traces of DSG. The solid intermediate mono-NHS ester (3) thus obtained was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (10.0 mL); diisopropylethylamine (0.10 g, 0.78 mmol) was added; and the mixture was stirred.</p>

The clear solution was then evaporated on a rotary evaporator to remove the volatiles and dried further under vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-1013" num="1038">The solid phospholipid ammonium salt (4) was dissolved in DMF (5 mL) and transferred to the stirred solution of mono-NHS ester (3) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted to 100 mL with a 1:1 mixture of CH<sub>3</sub>OH and CH<sub>3</sub>CN-water (1:1, v/v) and the insolubles were filtered. Half of the filtered solution was loaded onto a reversed phase C2 preparative column (Kromasil&#xae; Prep C2, 10&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 50&#xd7;250 mm) which had been pre-equilibrated with 3:1 (v/v) mixture of water (0.1% TFA) and CH<sub>3</sub>OH&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>CN (1:1, v/v, 0.1% TFA) at a flow rate of 100 mL/min. Note that the column was not eluted with the equilibrating eluent during loading of the sample. After the sample solution was loaded the column was washed with the equilibration eluent until the plug of DMF was eluted. The composition of the eluent was ramped to 70% CH<sub>3</sub>OH&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>CN (1:1, 0.1% TFA) over 9 min and a linear gradient of 0.75%/min of CH<sub>3</sub>OH&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>CN (1:1, 0.1% TFA) into water (0.1% TFA) was initiated and run for 40 min. Fractions (15 mL) were collected using UV (220 nm) as an indicator of product elution. Fractions were checked for purity on an analytical HPLC system (column: YMC C-4, 5&#x3bc;, 300 &#x212b;, 4.6&#xd7;250 mm) using UV at 220 nm and an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD). The latter detector (ELSD) was employed to detect DSPE-PEG2000-NH2 phospholipid ammonium salt (4) which has very little UV absorbance at 220 nm. Product-containing fractions of &#x3e;98% purity, and devoid of DSPE-PEG2000-NH2 phospholipid ammonium salt (4) were combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to reduce the content of CH<sub>3</sub>OH. The concentrated solution was then diluted with 10% CH3CN in water until a faint flocculent precipitate formed. The resulting solution was freeze-dried to provide monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (1) as a colorless solid. The second portion of crude monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (1) was purified as described above. The combined yield of the target monomeric peptide phospholipid conjugate (1) was 0.40 g (47% yield).</p>

<p id="p-1046" num="1072">To a solution of disuccinimidyl glutarate-DSG (3.7 mg, 11.3 &#x3bc;mol) in anhydrous DMF (0.1 mL) was added a solution of neutralized dimer peptide (27) acetate salt, (15 mg, 2.75 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (0.2 mL), dropwise. The reaction solution was stirred at RT for 0.5 h. HPLC analysis with a Waters Xterra C-18 column and MS showed the completion of the reaction. The solvent was evaporated and EtOAc (8 mL) was added to precipitate the intermediate (28). The vessel containing the precipitated intermediate (28) was centrifuged and the liquid layer was decanted. This procedure was repeated 3 times to remove the excess of DSG. The solid was dried with a stream of dry nitrogen and then dissolved in 0.3 mL of anhydrous DMF. DSPE-PEG2000-NH<sub>2 </sub>ammonium salt (29) (6.5 mg, 2.33 &#x3bc;mol) was added in solid form and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to (28). The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 16 h. The mixture was analyzed by MS and HPLC with a Zorbax 300 SB-C3 column and this indicated that the reaction was complete.</p>
<p id="p-1047" num="1073">To minimize the potential contamination of the product with TFA, the crude reaction mixture was purified by preparative HPLC equipped using a new Zorbax 300SB-C3 column (21.2&#xd7;150 mm, 5&#x3bc; particle) which had never been exposed to TFA. The HPLC system was pre-washed by CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O/NH<sub>4</sub>OAc extensively to remove traces of TFA. The reaction mixture was loaded onto the column which was pre-equilibrated with 20% B (A: 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc in H<sub>2</sub>O; B: 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>OAc in CH<sub>3</sub>CN/H<sub>2</sub>O, 9/1 v/v) at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. The column was eluted at 30 mL/min with the same eluent until the plug of DMF was eluted. The eluent composition was then increased to 40% B over 3 min and then ramped to 90% B over 50 min.

<p id="h-0674" num="0000">Transfection of 293H Cells on Thermanox&#xae; Coverslips</p>
<p id="p-1093" num="1119">Cells were grown on poly-D-lysine-coated Thermanox&#xae; circular coverslips in 24-well plate. Transfection was done as recommended in the lipofectamine 2000 protocol (Invitrogen, cat#11668-019) using 1 &#x3bc;g of DNA (pc-DNA6-fKDR)/per coverslip (1.3 cm2) in 0.1 mL. Transfection was done in serum-free media, the transfection reagent mix was removed from cells after 2 hours and replaced with regular serum-containing medium. Some of the cell-coated coverslips were mock-transfected (with no DNA). The next day, expression of the KDR receptor was assessed by immunocytochemistry and the binding assay was performed.</p>
<p id="h-0675" num="0000">Bubble Binding Assay</p>
<p id="p-1094" num="1120">The transfected cells were incubated with KDR-targeted microbubbles resuspended in 50% human plasma in PBS. For the incubation with the transfected cells a small plastic cap was filled with a suspension containing a 1.3&#xd7;108 bubbles and the cap was covered with an inverted Thermanox&#xae; coverslip so as to put the transfected cells in contact with the targeted microbubbles. After 30 min of incubation at RT, the coverslip was lifted with tweezers, rinsed three times in PBS and examined under a microscope to assess binding of the targeted microbubbles.</p>
<p id="h-0676" num="0000">Determination of the % of Surface Covered by Microbubbles</p>
<p id="p-1095" num="1121">Images were acquired with a digital camera DC300F (Leica) and the percent of surface covered by bound microbubbles in the imaged area was determined using the software QWin version 3.1 (Leica Microsystem AG, Basel, Switzerland). Pictures were taken of each Thermanox&#xae; coverslip. For each preparation of Examples 56 and 57, the binding assay was repeated a minimum of two times thus obtaining an average value of the surface covered. In the following Tables 6-A and 7-A, the binding activity of the microbubbles prepared according to Examples 56 and 57 above are recorded.</p>
<p id="p-1096" num="1122">As indicated by the Tables, the same peptide may show different binding activities when included (as a lipopeptide) in different phospholipid formulations forming the stabilizing envelope of the microbubble.

<p id="p-1098" num="1124">Glass coverslips (40 mm in diameter, Bioptechs Inc., Butler, Pa., USA) were coated with recombinant human VEGF-R2/Fc Chimeric protein (R&#x26;D Systems) according the following methodology.</p>
<p id="p-1099" num="1125">A surface of dimensions 14&#xd7;25 mm was delimited on the glass coverslip using a special marker (Dako Pen) and 400 &#x3bc;L of Fc-VEGF-R2 solution at 4 &#x3bc;g/mL in PBS was deposited on this surface. After an overnight incubation at 4&#xb0; C., the solution was aspirated, replaced by 0.5 mL of a solution of BSA 1% w/v in PBS-0.05% Tween 80, pH 7.4 and incubated for 3 hours at RT. Then the coverslip was washed three times with 5 ml of PBS-0.05% Tween 80.</p>
<p id="p-1100" num="1126">Binding Assay</p>
<p id="p-1101" num="1127">Binding studies of targeted bubbles were carried out using a parallel-plate flow chamber (FCS2, Bioptech Inc., Butler, Pa., USA) with a chamber gasket of 0.25 mm in thickness, with a customized adapter for upside-down chamber inversion. The coated coverslip was inserted as a plate of the flow chamber. Microbubbles (5&#xd7;106 bubbles/mL in 50% human plasma in PBS) were drawn through the flow chamber using an adjustable infusion pump (Auto Syringe&#xae; AS50 Infusion Pump, Baxter, Deerfield, Ill., USA) with a 60 mL syringe (Terumo). The pump flow rate was adjusted to 1 mL/min to obtain the desired shear rate of about 114 s-1. After 10 minutes, the flow was stopped and pictures were taken randomly at different positions on the coverslip (on areas of about 0.025 mm2) using a 40&#xd7; objective and a CCD monochrome camera (F-View II, Soft Imaging Systems, Germany) connected to an inverted Olympus IX 50 microscope.</p>
<p id="p-1102" num="1128">The number of microbubbles on each picture was determined, averaged with respect to the total number of pictures and the obtained value was then divided by ten (to obtain the &#x201c;slope&#x201d;, i.e. the average amount of bound microbubbles per minute).</p>
<p id="p-1103" num="1129">For each preparation of Examples 58 and 59, the binding assay was repeated four times thus obtaining an average value of the slope.</p>
<p id="p-1104" num="1130">The slope represents the bubble binding rate on the target substrate. For instance, a slope value of 8 indicates that an average of eighty (80) microbubbles was bound on the coated coverslip in ten minutes. A higher slope indicates a better capacity of bubbles to bind to the target under flow conditions.</p>
<p id="p-1105" num="1131">In the following tables 8-A and 9-A, the binding activity of the microbubbles prepared according to Examples 58 and 59 above were illustrated.</p>

<heading id="h-0680" level="1">In Vivo Evaluation of Ultrasound Contrast Agents Targeted to KDR</heading>
<p id="p-1111" num="1137">The ability of ultrasound contrast agents containing KDR binding lipopeptides of the invention to bind to KDR-expressing tissue in vivo was assessed using a known model of angiogenesis: the rabbit VX2 tumor model.</p>
<p id="p-1112" num="1138">A known model of angiogenic tissue was used to examine the ability of the KDR-targeted ultrasound microbubbles to localize to and provide an image of angiogenic tissue. The VX2 rabbit carcinoma was serially implanted in the dorsal muscle of New Zealand rabbits (Charles River Laboratories, France) weighting 2.5/3 kg.</p>
<p id="p-1113" num="1139">Preparation of Tumor Homogenate</p>
<p id="p-1114" num="1140">Tumor was surgically removed, placed into McCoy's culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, 1.5 mM Glutamax I and cut into small pieces that were rinsed to remove blood and debris. Then tumor pieces (3 to 5 cm3) were placed in a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 5 mL of complete medium. The tumor tissue was ground (Polytron) until no more solid pieces were visible. The murky fluid was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 300 g and the supernatant discarded. Seven mL of fresh medium was added per 5 mL of pellet.</p>
<p id="p-1115" num="1141">Tumor Implantation</p>
<p id="p-1116" num="1142">Rabbits received first 0.3 mL of Vetranquil (Acepromazine, Sanofi, injected intramuscularly) and were then anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of Ketaminol&#xae;5/Xylazine (Veterinaria AG/Sigma) mixture (50/10 mg/mL, 0.7 mL/kg). One hundred microliters of VX2 tumor homogenate was injected intramuscularly. Fifteen days after implantation of VX2 tumors, animals were anesthetized again with the same mixture, plus subcutaneous injection of 50% Urethane (2 mL/kg, s.c.) (Sigma) for imaging experiments.</p>
<p id="p-1117" num="1143">In Vivo Ultrasound Imaging</p>
<p id="p-1118" num="1144">VX2 tumor imaging was performed using an ultrasound imaging system ATL HDI 5000 apparatus equipped with a L7-4 linear probe. B-mode pulse inversion at high acoustic power (MI=0.9) was used to evaluate accumulation of targeted microbubbles on the KDR receptor expressed on the endothelium of neovessels. The linear probe was fixed on the skin directly over the implanted tumors.</p>
<p id="p-1119" num="1145">After bubble injection (0.14/kg of gas) using the preparations of either Example 63 or Example 64, insonation was stopped allowing bubbles to accumulate for 25 minutes. Then, insonation was reactivated at high acoustic power (MI 0.9) destroying all the bubbles present in the tumor. The amount of free circulating bubbles was then assessed by recording the signal obtained after 20 sec accumulation without insonation.</p>
<p id="p-1120" num="1146">Video frames from VX2 tumor imaging experiments were captured with video-capture and analysed with Image-Pro Plus 2.0 software. The image representing free circulating bubbles was subtracted from the image obtained at 25 min, to provide an image representing bound bubbles.</p>
<p id="p-1121" num="1147">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 115</figref> (which shows the results with the preparation of Example 63) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116</figref> (which shows the results with the preparation of Example 64), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 115A and 116A</figref> show an image before bubble injection (baseline); <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 115B and 116B</figref> show retention of bubble contrast in the tumor 25 minutes post injection; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 115C and 116C</figref> show the result obtained after subtraction of the baseline and free circulating bubbles and represent bound microbubbles containing KDR lipopeptides according to the present invention. Examples 62-64 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 115 and 116</figref> confirm that ultrasound contrast agents bearing such KDR binding moieties localize to KDR expressing (and thus angiogenic) tissue in animal models.</p>
