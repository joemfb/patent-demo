<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/312,461, filed Mar. 10, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a neck assembly for a fuel system component, such as a fuel tank. Specifically, the disclosure relates to a neck assembly for a fuel system component that is made by blow molding.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following is not an admission that anything discussed below is prior art or part of the common general knowledge of persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,860,398 (Potter et al.) discloses low permeation fittings and low permeation plastic containers using the low permeating fittings. The low permeation fittings and low permeation plastic containers are constructed by molding an outer component into the wall of a plastic container while it is being formed. This causes the opening of a passageway in the outer component to be covered with wall forming material. The inner component is then inserted into the outer component through the wall forming material thereby trapping the wall material between the internal and external components. The barrier layer of the container wall is therefore continuous from the container to inside the fitting. A new fuel container, fuel neck fitting, and flange for mounting components on a fuel tank are disclosed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following summary is provided to introduce the reader to the more detailed discussion to follow. The summary is not intended to limit or define the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect, a neck assembly of a fuel system component is provided. The neck assembly comprises a housing. The housing comprises a sleeve having a first end portion positioned exterior to the fuel system component and a longitudinally opposed second end portion. The housing further comprises an encapsulation ring extending radially outwardly from the second end portion of the sleeve and encapsulated within a wall of the fuel system component. The neck assembly further comprises a valve cartridge at least partially received within the sleeve and secured thereto. The valve cartridge comprises a first end portion positioned exterior to the fuel system component and a longitudinally opposed second end portion. The valve cartridge defines a conduit for fluid flow.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">No example described below limits any claimed invention and any claimed invention may cover processes or apparatuses that are not described below. The claimed inventions are not limited to apparatuses or processes having all of the features of any one apparatus or process described below or to features common to multiple or all of the apparatuses described below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example of a fuel system component <b>10</b> is shown. The fuel system component <b>10</b> is a fuel tank <b>13</b> for storing fuel. A fuel filler pipe <b>12</b> is provided for conveying fuel into the fuel tank <b>13</b>. A ventilation system <b>14</b> aids in vapor displacement when introducing liquid fuel into the tank <b>10</b>. An exit port <b>16</b> controls the release of the stored liquid fuel for use elsewhere in the system. A neck assembly <b>18</b> is used to connect the fuel tank <b>13</b> to the fuel filler pipe <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As will be described in further detail, the neck assembly <b>18</b> is secured to the fuel tank <b>13</b> by encapsulation. In this process, a portion of the assembly <b>18</b> is placed into the forming tool during the tank molding process and is exposed to the plastic of the fuel tank <b>13</b> while the plastic of the fuel tank <b>13</b> is in its liquid state so it can envelop, i.e. encapsulate, a portion of the neck assembly <b>18</b>, thereby creating a hermetic seal between the two components.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> the neck assembly <b>18</b> includes a housing <b>20</b>. The housing <b>20</b> includes a sleeve <b>26</b> (also known as a spud), and an encapsulation ring <b>24</b>. The sleeve <b>26</b> is generally cylindrical, and has a first end portion <b>28</b> and a longitudinally opposed second end portion <b>30</b>. The second end portion <b>30</b> has a flange <b>31</b> extending radially outwardly therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the encapsulation ring <b>24</b> extends radially outwardly from the second end portion <b>30</b> of the sleeve <b>26</b>. In the example shown, the encapsulation ring <b>24</b> is separately formed from the sleeve <b>26</b> and secured to the sleeve <b>26</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In use, the neck assembly <b>18</b> may be assembled by securing the sleeve <b>26</b> and encapsulation ring <b>24</b> together, for example by laser welding, if they are separately formed. The encapsulation ring <b>24</b> may then be encapsulated in a wall <b>11</b> of the fuel tank <b>13</b> during blow molding of the fuel tank <b>13</b>, such that the first end portion <b>28</b> of the sleeve <b>26</b> is positioned exterior to the fuel tank <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After encapsulation, a hole may have to be cut, drilled, or pierced in the wall <b>11</b> of the fuel tank <b>13</b>, within the area of the encapsulation ring <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first <b>70</b> and second <b>78</b> seals may be mounted to the valve cartridge <b>32</b> by seating the first seal <b>70</b> in the first recess <b>76</b> and seating the second seal <b>78</b> in the second recess <b>82</b>. The valve assembly <b>44</b> may be secured to the second end portion <b>38</b> of the valve cartridge <b>32</b> by inserting the second end portion <b>38</b> of the valve cartridge <b>32</b> into the valve assembly <b>44</b>, flexing the flaps <b>51</b> outwardly, positioning the apertures <b>50</b> over the protrusions <b>48</b>, and allowing the flaps <b>51</b> to flex back inwardly, so that the protrusions <b>48</b> are received in the apertures <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The valve cartridge <b>32</b>, with the annular seals <b>68</b> and valve assembly <b>44</b> mounted thereto, may then be mounted to the housing <b>20</b> by inserting the valve cartridge <b>32</b> into the sleeve <b>26</b> from the first end portion <b>28</b> of the sleeve <b>26</b> towards the second end portion <b>30</b>, and securing and sealing the valve cartridge <b>32</b> to the sleeve <b>26</b>. As described above, as the first end portion <b>36</b> of the valve cartridge approaches the first end portion <b>28</b> of the sleeve, the first end portion <b>28</b> of the sleeve <b>26</b> will enter the slot <b>66</b>. The rim <b>55</b> will contact the protrusions <b>64</b>, and force the flaps <b>65</b> to flex radially outwardly. As the valve cartridge <b>32</b> is slid further into the housing <b>26</b>, the flaps <b>65</b> will snap radially inwardly, so that the protrusions <b>64</b> are inserted into the apertures <b>54</b>. Further, during insertion, the first seal <b>70</b> will be compressed between the valve cartridge <b>32</b> and the sleeve <b>26</b>, and the second seal <b>78</b> will be compressed between the shoulder <b>80</b> and the wall <b>11</b> of the fuel tank <b>13</b>, to seal the valve assembly <b>44</b> to the sleeve <b>26</b> and the fuel tank <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A fuel filler pipe <b>12</b> may then be connected to the neck assembly <b>18</b> in any suitable manner, for example by using a worm gear clamp or a crimp style clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In alternate examples (not shown), a neck assembly may be configured such that a quick connect coupling could be used to connect the neck assembly to the fuel filler pipe <b>12</b>. In such examples, the neck assembly may be configured similarly to the neck assembly <b>18</b> described hereinabove, however the lip may be spaced from the first end portion of the valve cartridge, and may be positioned further towards the second end portion of the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Another example of a neck assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 8B</figref>, in which like reference numerals have been used to refer to like features as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, with the number seven (7) before each reference numeral. The neck assembly <b>718</b> is similar to the neck assembly <b>18</b>, however, in the neck assembly <b>718</b>, the sleeve connector <b>752</b> and valve cartridge connector <b>756</b> are configured differently from the sleeve connector <b>52</b> and valve cartridge connector <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the valve cartridge connector <b>756</b> includes at least one recess <b>784</b> defined in an outer surface <b>772</b> of the valve cartridge <b>732</b>. As exemplified, the valve cartridge connector <b>756</b> includes a single annular recess <b>784</b> extending around the outer surface <b>772</b> of the conduit <b>734</b>. In alternate examples, the valve cartridge connector <b>756</b> may comprise a plurality of recesses extending around the outer surface <b>772</b> of the conduit <b>734</b>. The recess <b>784</b> includes a base surface <b>786</b> facing towards the first end portion <b>728</b> of the conduit <b>734</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The sleeve connector <b>752</b> includes at least one portion that will bent into position so that it becomes a protrusion <b>788</b> extending inwardly from the sleeve <b>726</b> and protruding into the at least one recess <b>784</b>. As exemplified, the protrusion <b>788</b> includes a plurality of tabs <b>790</b> extending inwardly from the sleeve <b>726</b> and protruding into the annular recess <b>784</b>. The tabs <b>790</b> have a proximal end <b>792</b> connected to the sleeve <b>726</b>, and an opposed distal end <b>794</b>. The distal end <b>794</b> abuts the base surface <b>786</b> to secure the valve cartridge <b>732</b> to the housing <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In examples wherein the sleeve <b>726</b> is fabricated from a metal, the tabs <b>790</b> may comprise cutouts that are formed into the sleeve <b>726</b>, and the tabs <b>790</b> may be crimped or bent into the recess <b>784</b> after the valve cartridge <b>732</b> is inserted into the housing <b>720</b>. Alternately, the tabs <b>790</b> may be resiliently flexible, and may snap into the annular recess <b>782</b> as the valve cartridge <b>732</b> is inserted into the housing <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 8B</figref>, a valve assembly is not shown; however it will be appreciated that a valve assembly could be mounted to the second end portion <b>738</b> in the same manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the examples described above, the neck assemblies <b>18</b> and <b>718</b> extend generally perpendicular to the wall <b>11</b> of the fuel tank <b>13</b>. In alternate examples, one or more of the parts of a neck assembly may extend at an angle to the wall <b>11</b> of the fuel tank <b>13</b>. For example, a valve housing and valve cartridge may extend at an angle of&#x2014;30&#xb0;&#x2014;to the fuel tank.</p>
