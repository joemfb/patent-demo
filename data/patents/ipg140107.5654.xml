<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a Divisional Application of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/362,918 filed on Feb. 28, 2006 now U.S. Pat. No. 8,250,068 which claims priority from Japanese Patent Applications Nos. JP 2005-053615 filed on Feb. 28, 2005 and JP 2006-047321 filed on Feb. 23, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electronic album editing system, an electronic album editing method and an electronic album editing program. Particularly, the present invention relates to an electronic album editing system, an electronic album editing method and an electronic album for editing an electronic album including a plurality of images.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, digital cameras have become widespread rapidly. A digital camera is different from a silver-halide camera which is designed to capture or record the optical image of an object by exposing a film to light. On the other hand, the digital camera captures an optical image of an object using a CCD and records the optical image on a recording medium such as a flash memory or the like. The image captured by the digital camera is digital data. Here, this advantage being digital data is utilized for researching a technology for managing collectively a plurality of images as an electronic album. For example, there has been known a technology for efficiently managing images by classifying images based on information indicative of the characteristic of images when the plurality of images are managed as an electronic album, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-112165.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is assumed that a user intends to add the image included in the other electronic album to a certain electronic album to edit the certain electronic album when the user manages a plurality of images as the electronic albums. Here, when the user classifies each image for each category based on the characteristic of the image, it is preferred that the image added to the user's electronic album is not any image randomly selected from the other album but an image associated with the image included in the user's electronic album. In other words, it is preferred that the image to be added is suitable for a category in the user's electronic album. However, the conventional electronic album apparatus disclosed in the Japanese Paten Application Publication No. 2002-112165 does not disclose such electronic album editing method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic album system, an electronic album editing method and an electronic album editing program which is capable of solving the problem accompanying the conventional art.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, the present invention will now be described through preferred embodiments. The embodiments do not limit the invention according to claims and all combinations of the features described in the embodiments are not necessarily essential to means for solving the problems of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a functional configuration of an electronic album editing system <b>10</b>. The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> includes a first storage section <b>100</b>, a second storage section <b>110</b>, a category selection section <b>120</b>, a range acquiring section <b>130</b>, a category detection section <b>140</b> and an editing section <b>150</b>. The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> edits an electronic album including a plurality of images. Here, the first storage section <b>100</b> stores a plurality of images included in a first electronic album, and the second storage section <b>110</b> stores a plurality of images included in a second electronic album. Then, the electronic album editing system <b>10</b> edits the electronic album by adding at least part of the image stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> to the second storage section <b>110</b> and storing therein the same.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electronic album editing system according to the present embodiment previously calculate the range of image information indicative of the characteristic of the image for each of the plurality of categories in the first electronic album when each of the images are classified into a plurality of categories in the first electronic album and the second electronic album. Therefore, the image required for adding to the second electronic album by the user can be efficiently selected from the first electronic album along with adding the selected image to the second electronic album, so that the second electronic album can be edited.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first storage section <b>100</b> classifies each of the plurality of images included in the first electronic album into a plurality of categories based on image information indicative of the characteristic of the image and stores therein the same along with previously storing range information indicative of the range of image information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories. Here, the image information may be information indicative of the image-capturing time and date of an image, and may be information indicative of the image-capturing point of an image. The rage of image information may be, for example when the image information is the image-capturing time and date of the image, a period including the image-capturing time and dates of all the images included in the category, that is an image-capturing period. Additionally, range information may be information including the starting time and date and the end time and date of the image-capturing period. The first storage section <b>100</b> may be a magnetic memory device such as a hard disk drive, a semiconductor recording medium such as a flash memory, an optical recording medium such as a CD-R or the other recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The second storage section <b>110</b> classifies each of the plurality of images included in the second electronic album into a plurality of categories based on image information indicative of the characteristic of the image and stores therein the same. Here, the second storage section may be a magnetic memory device such as a hard disk drive, a semiconductor recording medium such as a flash memory, an optical recording medium such as a CD-R or the other recording medium. The category selection section <b>120</b> selects one category from the plurality of category of the image stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> and outputs information indicative of the selected category to the range acquiring section <b>130</b>. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the range of image information corresponding to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> from the image information of the image included in the category. Then, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> outputs the information indicative of the acquired range of image information to the category detection section.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the range similar to the range of image information acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> using the range information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories previously stored in the first storage section. Then, the category detection section <b>140</b> outputs information indicative of the detected category to the editing section <b>150</b>. The editing section <b>150</b> edits the second electronic album by storing at least part of the image classified into the category detected by storing in the second storage section the category detection section <b>140</b> in association with the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electronic album editing system according to the present embodiment can extract the image classified into the category similar to the category selected in the second electronic album and add the same to the second electronic album when the second electronic album is edited by adding the image included in the first electronic album to the second electronic album. That is to say, the image added to the second electronic album is not relate to the image included in the selected category at all but the image similar to the image information indicative of the image. Therefore, the electronic album editing system <b>10</b> can automatically extract the image required for adding to the selected category by the user such as the photographer of the second electronic album from the first electronic album and add the same to the second electronic album. In other words, the photographer of the second electronic album can add the desirable image to the second electronic album to edit the second electronic album by using the electronic album editing system <b>10</b> without the other working, such as retrieving the image to be added to the second electronic album as viewing the number of images included in the first electronic album. Additionally, when the photographer of the first electronic album and that of the second electronic album are same parson, a complicated combining work of the electronic album such that as for the images in the electronic albums which are individually generated and managed, the images in a certain category are collectively managed while the images in the other categories are individually managed in the future can be efficiently executed by using the electronic album editing system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally, the electronic album editing system according to the present embodiment previously calculates the range of image information corresponding to each of the categories in the first electronic album and stores the same in the first storage section. Therefore, the range of the category in the first storage section similar to the range of category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> in the second storage section <b>110</b> can more efficiently detect in comparison with calculating according to need. Therefore, even if a plurality of electronic albums are used as a first electronic album and the image extracted from any of the plurality of electronic album is added to the second electronic album to edit the same, the category in the first electronic album corresponding to the category selected in the second electronic album among the number of categories in the plurality of electronic albums can be efficiently detected at short times.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of a first storage section <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of a second storage section <b>110</b> according to the present embodiment. In this example, image information indicative of the characteristic of the image included in the electronic album includes the time and date at which the image is captured. Accordingly, the range of image information includes the period for which the image is captured.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first storage section <b>100</b> classifies each of plurality of images included in the first electronic album into a plurality of categories (<b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, . . . ) based on the time and date at which each image is captured and stored therein the same. For example, the first storage section <b>100</b> stores classifies images as an image <b>212</b> and an image <b>214</b> . . . into the category <b>200</b>. Then, the first storage section <b>100</b> previously stores image-capturing period information indicative of the image-capturing period including the image-capturing time and dates of all the images included in the category for each of the plurality of categories as the range information of the category. Specifically, the first storage section <b>100</b> previously stores image-capturing period information including the starting time and date and the end time and date within the image-capturing period for each of the plurality of categories.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second storage section <b>110</b> classifies each of the images included in the second electronic image into a plurality of categories (<b>300</b>, <b>310</b> . . . ) based on the time and date at which each image is captured. For example, the second storage section <b>110</b> classifies the images as an image <b>302</b>, an image <b>304</b> . . . into the category <b>300</b>. Additionally for example, the second storage section <b>110</b> classifies the images as an image <b>312</b> and an image <b>314</b> . . . into a category <b>310</b>. Further, the second storage section <b>110</b> stores image-capturing time and date information indicative of the time and date at which the image is captured in association with each of the images.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the image-capturing time and date corresponding to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> based on the oldest image-capturing time and date and the latest image-capturing time and date among the image-capturing time and dates of the images included in the category. For example, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> may acquire a period each of which end point is the oldest image-capturing time and date and the latest image-capturing time and date as the image-capturing period. Then, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the acquired image-capturing period as the category corresponding to the image-capturing period similar to the image-capturing period acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> using image-capturing period information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories which are previously stored in the first storage section <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment can edit the second electronic album by adding the image related to the image in the selected category. For example, an image captured in the season same as the image classified in the category selected in the second electronic album among the images included in the first electronic album is added to the second electronic album when images are classified in each of the first electronic album and the second electronic album based on the image-capturing time and date. Additionally, when the photographer of each of the electronic album is same, images captured around the same time can be collectively managed so that an editing work can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a first example of a processing in a category detection section <b>140</b> according to the present embodiment. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows an example of a range corresponding to each of the categories in the first storage section according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a range corresponding to the category in the second storage section <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a second example of a processing in the category detection section <b>140</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows an example of a range corresponding to each of the categories in the first storage section <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a range corresponding to the category in the second storage section <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this example, the first storage section <b>100</b> and the second storage section <b>110</b> classify each of the plurality of images included in the electronic album into a plurality of categories based on each time and date at which the image is captured as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, in the following description, images may be classified based on not only each image-capturing time and date but also the other image information.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the image-capturing period acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> among the image-capturing period for each category previously stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> as a category similar to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b>. However, when any category is detected under only the condition whether the image-capturing period is at least partially overlapped, the similarity between the detected category and the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> is not enough. Accordingly, the photographer of the second electronic album sometimes feels that the image classified into the detected category is not suitable for adding to the selected category. Therefore, it is preferred that the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category more similar to the selected category and adds more appropriate image to the second electronic album. Thus, now it will be described that the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category more similar to the selected category with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to one image-capturing period information when an image-capturing period indicated by the one image-capturing information among plural pieces of image-capturing period information previously stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> is the only image-capturing period entirely included in the image-capturing period acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b>. Now, a specific example is shown using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The first storage section <b>100</b> classifies at least a part of images included in the first electronic album into a category corresponding to each of an image-capturing period <b>400</b>, an image-capturing period <b>410</b> and an image-capturing period <b>420</b> which are different from each other and stores therein the same in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Here, the category section <b>120</b> selects one category in the second electronic album. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires an image-capturing period <b>430</b> as the image-capturing period corresponding to the selected category. In this case, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the image-capturing period <b>410</b> as the category similar to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> by determining that the image-capturing period <b>410</b> is the only image-capturing period entirely included in the image-capturing period <b>430</b> among the image-capturing periods corresponding to each of the categories in the first storage section <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, another specific example is shown using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The first storage section <b>100</b> classifies at least a part of images included in the first electronic album into categories corresponding to each of an image-capturing period <b>500</b>, an image-capturing period <b>510</b> and an image-capturing period <b>520</b> which are different from each other and stores therein the same in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Here, the category selection section <b>120</b> selects one category in the second electronic album. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the image-capturing period <b>430</b> as the image-capturing period corresponding to the selected category. In this case, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects the image-capturing period too and the image-capturing period <b>510</b> as the image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the image-capturing period <b>530</b>. However, the category detection section <b>140</b> can not detect the only image-capturing period because all of the detected image-capturing period are entirely included in the image-capturing period <b>530</b>. Accordingly, the category detection section <b>140</b> does not detect any category similar to the selected category so that the editing section <b>150</b> does not edit the second electronic album. In this case, the electronic editing album system <b>10</b> may present information indicative of each of the categories corresponding to the plurality of image-capturing periods entirely included in the image-capturing period <b>530</b> to the user and cause the user to designate which is category from which an image to be added to the second electronic album is extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment can automatically extract an image to be added to the second electronic album when the a category more similar to the selected category is uniquely determined by automatically detecting the category corresponding to the only range entirely included in the range corresponding to the selected category as the category from which the image to be added to the second electronic album is extracted. Therefore, the image required for adding to the selected category in the second electronic album by the user can be extracted without any work by the user and added to the second electronic album.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to one image-capturing period information as the category similar to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> when the image-capturing period indicated by the one image-capturing period information among the plurality of image-capturing period information previously stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> is the only image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the image-capturing period acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b>. Additionally, the category detection section <b>140</b> may further detect a category corresponding to the one image-capturing period information as the category similar to the selected category when the ratio between the length of the portion over which the image-capturing period indicated by the one image-capturing period information is overlapped with the image-capturing period acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> and the length of the image-capturing period indicated by the one image-capturing period information is more than a predetermined reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Now, a specific example is shown using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

Here, the category selection section <b>120</b> selects one category in the second electronic album. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires an image-capturing period <b>610</b> as the image-capturing period corresponding to the selected category. In this case, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to an image-capturing period <b>600</b> as the category similar to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> by determining that the image-capturing period <b>600</b> is the only image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the image-capturing period <b>610</b>.

In this case, the category detection section <b>140</b> can not detect the only image-capturing period because the category detection section <b>140</b> detects the image-capturing period <b>700</b> and the image-capturing period <b>710</b> as the image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the image-capturing period <b>720</b>. Accordingly, the category detection section <b>140</b> does not detect any category similar to the selected category, so that the editing section <b>150</b> does not edit the second electronic album.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present invention can automatically extract the image to be added to the second electronic album when the category more similar to the selected category is uniquely determined by automatically detecting the category corresponding to the only range at least partially overlapped with the range corresponding to the selected category as the category from which the image to be added to the second electronic album should be extracted.

In this example, image information indicative of the characteristic of the image included in the electronic album includes the image-capturing point at which the image is captured. Accordingly, the range of image information includes the area at which the image is captured.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first storage section <b>100</b> classifies each images included in the first electronic album into a plurality of categories (<b>900</b>, <b>910</b> . . . ) based on each image-capturing time and date and stores therein the same. For example, the first storage section <b>100</b> classifies the images as an image <b>902</b> and an image <b>904</b> . . . into a category <b>900</b>. Additionally for example, the first storage section <b>100</b> classifies the images as an image <b>912</b> and an image <b>914</b> in a category <b>910</b>. Then, the first storage section <b>100</b> previously stores image-capturing area information indicative of the image-capturing area including the image-capturing point of all the images included in the category for each of the plurality of categories. Specifically, the first storage section <b>100</b> previously stores the longitude and latitude of each vertex of a polygon in the image-capturing area which are defined as the polygon corresponding to each of the plurality of categories.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the second storage section <b>110</b> classifies each images included in the second electronic album into a plurality of categories (<b>1000</b>, <b>1100</b>, . . . ) based on each image-capturing time and date.

Further the second storage section <b>110</b> stores image-capturing point information indicative of the point at which the image is captured, specifically, the longitude and latitude of the image-capturing point in association with each of the images.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Now, an processing that the range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires an image-capturing point corresponding to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> will be described.

The range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires an image-capturing area corresponding to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> based on based on a polygon which includes the image-capturing points of all the images included in the selected category and of which vertexes are selecting pointes selected from the image-capturing points of all the images, where each of the vertex angle is less than 180 degree. Specifically, when the image-capturing points of the image included in the category are distributed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the range <b>1100</b> being the polygon shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> as the outer edge of the image-capturing area corresponding to the selected category.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Then, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the image-capturing area at least partially overlapped with the acquired image-capturing area as the category corresponding to the image-capturing area similar to the image-capturing area acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> using image-capturing area information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories previously stored in the first storage section <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment can edit the second electronic album by adding the image related to the image in the selected category. For, example, when images for each travel destination are classified in each of the first electronic album and the second electronic album, the image captured at the travel destination same as the travel destination in the category selected in the second electronic album is added to the second electronic album. Additionally, when the photographer of each electronic album are same, images captured at the same travel destination can be collectively managed, so that an editing work can be efficiently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a flowchart of a processing of an electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment. Firstly, the category selection section <b>120</b> selects one category from a plurality of categories of the image stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> (S<b>1200</b>). For example, the category selection section <b>120</b> may edit the second electronic album by sequentially selecting the plurality of categories in the second electronic album and causing the editing section <b>150</b> to take the images of all the categories in the other electronic album in the electronic album editing system <b>10</b>. Additionally for example, the category selection section <b>120</b> may present information indicative of all the categories in the second electronic album to the user such as the photographer of the second electronic album and select the category designated by the user. Next, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the range of image information corresponding to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> from the image information of the image included in the category (S<b>1210</b>). Next, the category detection section <b>140</b> determines whether a category corresponding to the range similar to the range acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> is detected (S<b>1230</b>). Then, when it is determined that the category detection section <b>140</b> detects the category (S<b>1230</b>: Yes), the editing section <b>150</b> edits the second electronic album by storing in the second storage section <b>110</b> at least a part of image classified in the detected category among the plurality of images stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> in association with the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> (S<b>1240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a functional configuration of the electronic album editing system <b>10</b> to according to the present embodiment. The electronic album editing system further includes an image information range presentation section <b>160</b>, an image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b>, an image-capturing area change control section <b>172</b> and an image reclassification section <b>180</b>. The category selection section <b>120</b> further outputs the kind of one category selected from a plurality of categories in the images stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> to the image reclassification section <b>180</b>. Additionally, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the range of image information corresponding to one category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> from image information of the image included in the one category and further outputs the acquired range of image information to the image information range presentation section <b>160</b>. Here, the image information may include the image-capturing time and date and the image-capturing point of the image included in the electronic album. The image information range presentation section <b>160</b> presents an image-capturing period corresponding to one category acquired by the rage acquiring section <b>130</b> to the user.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> cause the user to change an image-capturing period presented by the image information presentation section <b>160</b>. Then, the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> outputs the image-capturing period changed by the user to the range acquiring section <b>130</b>. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> may replace the image-capturing period received from the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> with the image-capturing period of one category received from the category selection section <b>120</b> to set the latter as a new image-capturing period for the one category. Additionally, the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> may output the result of the image-capturing period changed by the user to the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> and causes the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> to present the changed image-capturing period to the user. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> outputs the image-capturing period received from the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> to the category detection section <b>140</b>. The category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the image-capturing period at least partially overlapped with the image-capturing period changed by the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> using the image-capturing period information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories previously stored in the first storage section <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment can present the image-capturing period for the category acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> to the user and then, the user can change the presented image-capturing period.

The range acquiring section <b>130</b> may set the image-capturing area received from the image-capturing area change control section <b>172</b> to a new image-capturing area in the one category instead of the image-capturing area of the category of the position received from the category selection section <b>120</b>. Additionally, the image-capturing area change control section <b>172</b> may output the result of the image-capturing area changed by the user to the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> and cause the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> to present the changed image-capturing area to the user. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> outputs the image-capturing area received from the image-capturing area change control section <b>172</b> to the category detection section <b>140</b>. The category detection section <b>140</b> detects a category corresponding to the image-capturing area at least a partially overlapped with the image-capturing area changed by the image-capturing area change control section <b>172</b> using the image-capturing area information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories stored in the first storage section <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally, in the case that the category detection section <b>140</b> can not detect any category corresponding to the range similar to the range of the image information received from the range acquiring section <b>130</b> when the kinds of the categories into which the plurality of images stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> are classified are different from the kinds of the categories into which the plurality of images stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> are classified, the image reclassification section <b>180</b> classifies the plurality of images included in the first electronic album into the kinds of the categories into which the plurality of images stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> are classified.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Specifically, when the category detection section <b>140</b> does not detect from the first storage section any category corresponding to the range of image information received from the range acquiring section <b>130</b>, the category detection section <b>140</b> outputs information on being not detecting to the image reclassification section <b>180</b>. When the image reclassification section <b>180</b> receives information that the category detection section <b>140</b> can not detect, the image reclassification section <b>180</b> classifies the plurality of images stored in the first storage section <b>100</b> into the category of which kind is same as that of the categories received from the category selection section <b>120</b>. Then, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects the category classified by the image reclassification section <b>180</b> as a range similar to the range acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an image information range presentation section <b>160</b> according to the present embodiment. The image information range presentation section <b>160</b> presents an image-capturing period corresponding to one category acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> to the user. For example, the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> may divide the image-capturing period into the predetermined periods and display the same as a scale <b>460</b>.

Specifically, the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> may display a bar <b>450</b> on the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> and cause the user to operate a slider <b>452</b> and a slider <b>456</b> to change the image-capturing period.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For example, the image-capturing period acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> is from the beginning of May, 2005 to the middle of May, 2005, the image information range presentation section <b>160</b> firstly displays the slider <b>452</b> at the position of the beginning of May, 2005 in the scale <b>460</b>, and then, displays the slider <b>454</b> at the position of the middle of May, 2005. Next, the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> may cause the user to shift the slider <b>454</b> to the position of the slider <b>456</b> in the direction an arrow <b>480</b> when the user desires that the image-capturing period is changed to the period from the beginning of May, 2005 to the beginning of June, 2005. Therefore, the image-capturing period change control section <b>170</b> can change the image-capturing period to an image-capturing period desired by the user. Here, the image-capturing period may be an image-capturing date (year-month-day) in minutes.

Then, the category detection section <b>140</b> can detect a category corresponding to the image-capturing area changed by the user from the first storage section <b>100</b>. Therefore, the user can extract from the first storage section an image captured at the time and date at which the user forgot to capture images and can not capture images due to occurring any problem of the image-capturing apparatus, and can store the same in the user's electronic album. Therefore, it can improve the satisfaction of the user on editing the electronic album.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a flowchart of a processing of the electronic album editing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment. Firstly, the category selection section <b>120</b> selects one category from a plurality of categories into which images stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> are classified (S<b>1202</b>). Next, the category selection section <b>120</b> outputs image information of the image included in the selected one category to the range acquiring section <b>130</b>. The range acquiring section <b>130</b> acquires the range of image information corresponding to the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> (S<b>1212</b>). Then, the range acquiring section <b>130</b> outputs the acquired range of image information to the category detection section <b>140</b>. The category detection section <b>140</b> attempts to detect a category corresponding to the range similar to the range of image information acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> using the image information corresponding to each of the plurality of categories previously stored in the first storage section (S<b>1222</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, the category detection section <b>140</b> determines whether a category having the range similar to the range acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b> can not be detected (S<b>1232</b>). When the category detection section can not detect that (S<b>1232</b>: Yes), the category detection section <b>140</b> outputs information that it can not detect the category to the image reclassification section <b>180</b>. Then, the image reclassification section <b>180</b> which has received the information that it can not detect the category classifies the plurality of images stored in the first electronic album into the category of which kind is same as that of the category into which the image stored in the second storage section <b>110</b> is stored (S<b>1235</b>). Then, the category detection section <b>140</b> detects the category classified by the image reclassification section <b>180</b> as a category corresponding to the range similar to the range acquired by the range acquiring section <b>130</b>. The editing section <b>150</b> edits the second electronic album by storing in the second storage section <b>110</b> at least a part of image classified in the category detected by the category detection section <b>140</b> among the plurality of images stored in the first storage section in association with the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> (S<b>1242</b>). Here, when the category detection section <b>140</b> detects the category (S<b>1232</b>: No), the editing section <b>150</b> edits the second electronic album by storing in the second storage section <b>110</b> at least a part of image classified in the category among the plurality of images store in the first storage section <b>100</b> in association with the category selected by the category selection section <b>120</b> (S<b>1242</b>).</p>
