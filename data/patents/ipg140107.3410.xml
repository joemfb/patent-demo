<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a spark plug.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally known methods of joining a noble metal tip to a ground electrode of a spark plug are disclosed in, for example, PCT Application Laid-Open No. 2004-517459 and US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0103046.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to the method disclosed in PCT Application Laid-Open No. 2004-517459, a noble metal tip is completely melted and joined to a ground electrode. This method can increase the welding strength between the ground electrode and the noble metal tip, but involves a problem of a deterioration in spark endurance, since the discharge surface of the noble metal tip contains components of a ground electrode base metal as a result of fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, according to the method disclosed in US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0103046, a peripheral portion of a noble metal tip is melted, thereby joining the noble metal tip to a ground electrode. This method, however, involves the following problem: the welding strength between the ground electrode and a central portion of the noble metal tip is weak, and cracking may be generated in the noble metal tip or a fusion zone, potentially resulting in separation of the noble metal tip.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, a method which uses resistance welding is known for joining a noble metal tip to a ground electrode. This method, however, involves the following problem: since the layer of a fusion zone at the interface between the ground electrode and the noble metal tip is thin, welding strength fails to cope with severe operating conditions, such as with respect to a spark plug that is increased in temperature because of the recent tendency toward higher engine outputs. Such operating conditions can potentially result in separation of the noble metal tip.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been conceived to solve the conventional problems mentioned above. An advantage of the present invention is a technique for improving the welding strength between a ground electrode and a noble metal tip.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve, at least partially, the above problems, the present invention can be embodied in the following modes or application examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug comprising an insulator having an axial hole extending therethrough in an axial direction. A center electrode is provided at a front end portion of the axial hole. A substantially tubular metallic shell holds the insulator. A ground electrode has one end attached to a front end portion of the metallic shell and the other end faces a front end portion of the center electrode. A noble metal tip is provided on a surface of the ground electrode which faces the front end portion of the center electrode, and forms a spark discharge gap in cooperation with the center electrode. The spark plug is characterized in that: a fusion zone is formed at least a portion of the boundary between the ground electrode and the noble metal tip through fusion of a portion of the ground electrode and a portion of the noble metal tip; and when A represents the thickness of the thickest portion of the fusion zone as measured along the axial direction, and B represents the length of the longest portion of the fusion zone as measured along the longitudinal direction of the ground electrode, the relation 1.5&#x2266;B/A is satisfied.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above in application example 1, wherein when the fusion zone is cut by a plane which passes through the center axis of the ground electrode and is in parallel with the axial direction, a portion of the fusion zone which has a thickness of A/1.3 is located within a range B/2 extending from the back end of the fusion zone with respect to a melting direction.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 3</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above in application examples 1 or 2, wherein when C represents the length of the noble metal tip along the longitudinal direction of the ground electrode, the relation C&#x2266;B is satisfied.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">APPLICATION EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug comprising an insulator having an axial hole extending therethrough in an axial direction.

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Embodiments of a spark plug according to a mode for carrying out the present invention will next be described in the following order. A. First embodiment; B.

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">A. First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">A1. Structure of Spark Plug:</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a partially sectional view showing a spark plug <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the following description, an axial direction OD of the spark plug <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to as the vertical direction, and the lower side of the spark plug <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is referred to as the front side of the spark plug <b>100</b>, and the upper side as the rear side.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The spark plug <b>100</b> includes a ceramic insulator <b>10</b>, a metallic shell <b>50</b>, a center electrode <b>20</b>, a ground electrode <b>30</b>, and a metal terminal <b>40</b>. The center electrode <b>20</b> is held in the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> while extending in the axial direction OD. The ceramic insulator <b>10</b> functions as an insulator. The metallic shell <b>50</b> holds the ceramic insulator <b>10</b>. The metal terminal <b>40</b> is provided at a rear end portion of the ceramic insulator <b>10</b>. The construction of the center electrode <b>20</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b> will be described in detail later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The ceramic insulator <b>10</b> is formed from alumina, etc. through firing and has a tubular shape such that an axial hole <b>12</b> extends therethrough coaxially along the axial direction OD. The ceramic insulator <b>10</b> has a flange portion <b>19</b> having the largest outside diameter. Flange portion <b>19</b> is located substantially at the center with respect to the axial direction OD. A rear trunk portion <b>18</b> is located rearward (upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the flange portion <b>19</b>. The ceramic insulator <b>10</b> also has a front trunk portion <b>17</b> that is smaller in outside diameter than the rear trunk portion <b>18</b> and that is located frontward (downward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the flange portion <b>19</b>. A leg portion <b>13</b> smaller in outside diameter than the front trunk portion <b>17</b> is located frontward of the front trunk portion <b>17</b>. The leg portion <b>13</b> is reduced in diameter in the frontward direction and is exposed to a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine when the spark plug <b>100</b> is mounted to an engine head <b>200</b> of the engine. A stepped portion <b>15</b> is formed between the leg portion <b>13</b> and the front trunk portion <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The metallic shell <b>50</b> is a cylindrical metallic member formed of low-carbon steel and is adapted to fix, i.e., attach, the spark plug <b>100</b> to the engine head <b>200</b> of the internal combustion engine. The metallic shell <b>50</b> holds the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> therein while surrounding a region of the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> extending from a portion of the rear trunk portion <b>18</b> to the leg portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The metallic shell <b>50</b> has a tool engagement portion <b>51</b> and a mounting threaded portion <b>52</b>. The tool engagement portion <b>51</b> allows a spark plug wrench (not shown) to be fitted thereto. The mounting threaded portion <b>52</b> of the metallic shell <b>50</b> has threads formed thereon. Threaded portion <b>52</b> is dimensioned to threadingly engage with a mounting threaded hole <b>201</b> of the engine head <b>200</b> provided at an upper portion of an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The metallic shell <b>50</b> has a flange-like seal portion <b>54</b> formed between the tool engagement portion <b>51</b> and the mounting threaded portion <b>52</b>. An annular gasket <b>5</b> formed by folding a sheet is fitted to a screw neck <b>59</b> between the mounting threaded portion <b>52</b> and the seal portion <b>54</b>. When the spark plug <b>100</b> is mounted to the engine head <b>200</b>, the gasket <b>5</b> is crushed and deformed between a seat surface <b>55</b> of the seal portion <b>54</b> and a peripheral-portion-around-opening <b>205</b> of the mounting threaded hole <b>201</b>. The deformation of the gasket <b>5</b> provides a seal between the spark plug <b>100</b> and the engine head <b>200</b>, thereby preventing gas leakage from inside the engine via the mounting threaded hole <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The metallic shell <b>50</b> has a thin-walled crimp portion <b>53</b> located rearward of the tool engagement portion <b>51</b>. The metallic shell <b>50</b> also has a buckle portion <b>58</b>, which is thin-walled similar to the crimp portion <b>53</b>, between the seal portion <b>54</b> and the tool engagement portion <b>51</b>. Annular ring members <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> are disposed between an outer circumferential surface of the rear trunk portion <b>18</b> of the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> and an inner circumferential surface of the metallic shell <b>50</b> extending from the tool engagement portion <b>51</b> to the crimp portion <b>53</b>. Further, a space between the two ring members <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> is filled with a powder of talc <b>9</b>. When the crimp portion <b>53</b> is crimped inward, the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> is pressed frontward within the metallic shell <b>50</b> via the ring members <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and the talc <b>9</b>. Accordingly, the stepped portion <b>15</b> of the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> is supported by a stepped portion <b>56</b> formed on the inner circumference of the metallic shell <b>50</b>, whereby the metallic shell <b>50</b> and the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> are united together. At this time, gastightness between the metallic shell <b>50</b> and the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> is maintained by means of an annular sheet packing <b>8</b> which intervenes between the stepped portion <b>15</b> of the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> and the stepped portion <b>56</b> of the metallic shell <b>50</b>, thereby preventing outflow of combustion gas. The buckle portion <b>58</b> is designed to be deformed outwardly in association with application of compressive force in a crimping process, thereby contributing toward increasing the length of compression of the talc <b>9</b> and thus enhancing the gastightness of the interior of the metallic shell <b>50</b>. A clearance CL having a predetermined dimension is provided between the ceramic insulator <b>10</b> and a portion of the metallic shell <b>50</b> located frontward of the stepped portion <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged view showing a front end portion <b>22</b> of the center electrode <b>20</b> and its periphery of the spark plug <b>100</b>. The center electrode <b>20</b> is a rodlike electrode having a structure in which a core <b>25</b> is embedded within an electrode base metal <b>21</b>. The electrode base metal <b>21</b> is formed of nickel or an alloy which contains Ni as a main component, such as INCONEL (trade name) 600 or 601. The core <b>25</b> is formed of copper or an ally which contains Cu as a main component, copper and the alloy being superior in thermal conductivity to the electrode base metal <b>21</b>. Usually, the center electrode <b>20</b> is fabricated as follows: the core <b>25</b> is disposed within the electrode base metal <b>21</b> which is formed into a closed-bottomed tubular shape, and the resultant assembly is drawn by extrusion from the bottom side. The core <b>25</b> is formed such that, while a trunk portion has a substantially constant outside diameter, a front end portion is tapered. The center electrode <b>20</b> extends rearward through the axial hole <b>12</b> and is electrically connected to the metal terminal <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) via a seal body <b>4</b> and a ceramic resistor <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A high-voltage cable (not shown) is connected to the metal terminal <b>40</b> via a plug cap (not shown) for applying high voltage to the metal terminal <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The front end portion <b>22</b> of the center electrode <b>20</b> projects from a front end portion <b>11</b> of the ceramic insulator <b>10</b>. A center electrode tip <b>90</b> is joined to the front end surface of the front end portion <b>22</b> of the center electrode <b>20</b>. The center electrode tip <b>90</b> has a substantially circular columnar shape extending in the axial direction OD and is formed of a noble metal having high melting point in order to improve resistance to spark-induced erosion. The center electrode tip <b>90</b> is formed of, for example, iridium (Ir) or an Ir alloy which contains Ir as a main component and an additive of one or more elements selected from among platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru), palladium (Pd), and rhenium (Re).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The ground electrode <b>30</b> is formed of a metal having high corrosion resistance, such as by way of example and not limitation, an Ni alloy, such as INCONEL (trade name) 600 or 601. A proximal end portion <b>32</b> of the ground electrode <b>30</b> is joined to a front end portion <b>57</b> of the metallic shell <b>50</b> by welding. Also, the ground electrode <b>30</b> is bent such that a distal end portion <b>33</b> thereof faces the front end portion <b>22</b> of the center electrode <b>20</b> and also faces a front end surface <b>92</b> of the center electrode tip <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, a ground electrode tip <b>95</b> is joined to the distal end portion <b>33</b> of the ground electrode <b>30</b> via a fusion zone <b>98</b>. A discharge surface <b>96</b> of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> faces the front end surface <b>92</b> of the center electrode tip <b>90</b>. A gap G is formed between the discharge surface <b>96</b> of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the front end surface <b>92</b> of the center electrode tip <b>90</b>. The ground electrode tip <b>95</b> can be formed from a material similar to that used to form the center electrode tip <b>90</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref> is a view of the distal end portion <b>33</b> of the ground electrode <b>30</b> as viewed from the axial direction OD. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref> is a sectional view taken along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> is fitted in a groove portion <b>88</b> formed in the ground electrode <b>30</b>. The fusion zone <b>98</b> is formed along at least a portion of the boundary between the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b>. The fusion zone <b>98</b> is formed through fusion of a portion of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and a portion of the ground electrode <b>30</b> and contains components of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b>. Thus, the fusion zone <b>98</b> has an intermediate composition between the ground electrode <b>30</b> and the ground electrode tip <b>95</b>. In actuality, most of the fusion zone <b>98</b> is invisible from the axial direction OD; however, for convenience of description, the fusion zone <b>98</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>. The same also applies to the drawings referred to in the following description. A broken line appears at the boundary between the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>(B)); however, in actuality, in the fusion zone <b>98</b>, the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b> are fused together, and the boundary represented by the broken line does not exist. The same also applies to the drawings referred to in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The fusion zone <b>98</b> can be formed through radiation of a high-energy beam from a direction LD substantially parallel to the boundary between the ground electrode <b>30</b> and the ground electrode tip <b>95</b>. Preferably, a fiber laser beam or an electron beam, for example, is used as the high-energy beam for forming the fusion zone <b>98</b>. Particularly, the fiber laser beam can deeply melt the ground electrode <b>30</b> and the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> along the boundary therebetween. Thus, the ground electrode <b>30</b> and the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> can be firmly joined together.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the thickness Ax of the fusion zone <b>98</b> as measured along a direction perpendicular to the discharge surface <b>96</b> of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> increases along a direction TD oriented toward the distal end of the ground electrode <b>30</b> (hereinafter, may be referred to as the longitudinal direction TD of the ground electrode <b>30</b>). As will be described later, in a state where the spark plug <b>100</b> is in service, the temperature of the ground electrode <b>30</b> increases gradually along the direction TD oriented toward the distal end of the ground electrode <b>30</b>. Thus, the closer to a distal end surface <b>31</b> of the ground electrode, the greater the stress imposed on the ground electrode <b>30</b>. Since the fusion zone <b>98</b> has an intermediate thermal expansion coefficient between those of the ground electrode <b>30</b> and the ground electrode tip <b>95</b>, stress imposed on the ground electrode <b>30</b> can be mitigated. Thus, by means of the thickness Ax of the fusion zone <b>98</b> being gradually increased along the direction TD oriented toward the distal end of the ground electrode <b>30</b>, stress imposed on the ground electrode <b>30</b> can be appropriately mitigated. Therefore, the generation of oxide scale is restrained, whereby the separation of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> from the ground electrode <b>30</b> can be restrained. In other words, preferably, the higher the temperature of a portion of the ground electrode <b>95</b> in a state where the spark plug <b>100</b> is in service, the greater the thickness Ax of the fusion zone <b>98</b> as measured, at an associated position, along a direction perpendicular to the discharge surface <b>96</b> of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b>.</p>

This is for the same reason as that for gradually increasing the thickness Ax of the fusion zone <b>98</b> along the direction TD oriented toward the distal end of the ground electrode <b>30</b> as mentioned above. Since, through employment of such the width Wx, stress imposed on the ground electrode <b>30</b> can be appropriately mitigated, the generation of oxide scale is restrained, whereby the separation of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> from the ground electrode <b>30</b> can be restrained.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph showing the relation between the fusion zone ratio B/A and the oxide scale percentage. The horizontal axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the fusion zone ratio B/A, whereas the vertical axis shows the oxide scale percentage. As is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, as the fusion zone ratio B/A increases, the oxide scale percentage reduces. Conceivably, this is for the following reason: as the fusion zone ratio B/A increases, the volume of such a portion of the fusion zone <b>98</b> that is formed along the interface between the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b> increases, whereby oxide scale is less likely to be generated at the interface between the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> and the ground electrode <b>30</b>. At a fusion zone ratio B/A of 1.5 or greater, the oxide scale percentage is 0%. Therefore, preferably, the fusion zone <b>98</b> is formed such that the fusion zone ratio B/A is 1.5 or greater. Similarly, in the spark plug <b>100</b><i>d </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, preferably, the fusion zone <b>98</b><i>d </i>is formed such that the fusion zone ratio E/D is 1.5 or greater.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A desk spark test was conducted on spark plug samples which have the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and differ in the fusion-zone level difference LA, in order to study the relation between the fusion-zone level difference LA (=L<b>2</b>&#x2212;L<b>1</b>) and the amount of increase in the gap G after the test.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref> is a graph showing the relation between the fusion-zone level difference LA and the amount of increase in the gap G after the test.

As is understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, the smaller the fusion-zone level difference LA, the smaller the amount of increase in the gap G, whereby the durability of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> improves. Also, when the fusion-zone level difference LA is reduced to 0.3 or less, the amount of increase in the gap G can be restrained to 0.1 mm, whereby the durability of the ground electrode tip <b>95</b> can be further improved. Therefore, preferably, the fusion zone <b>98</b> is formed such that the fusion-zone level difference LA is 0.3 mm or less.
