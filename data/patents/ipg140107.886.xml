<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The drainage pump is mounted at the drainage chamber <b>22</b>. The drainage pump includes a drainage motor <b>51</b> and an impeller <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The filtering unit includes a pump housing <b>60</b> having a space where the impeller <b>42</b> is mounted, a filter housing <b>70</b> mounted such that the filter housing <b>70</b> covers the top of the pump housing <b>60</b>, and a cover <b>80</b> mounted such that the cover <b>80</b> covers the top of the filter housing <b>70</b> and the top of the sump <b>20</b>. The pump housing <b>60</b> is disposed at the bottom of the filter housing <b>70</b>, and the cover <b>80</b> is disposed at the top of the filter housing <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The filter housing <b>70</b> has a filth collection chamber <b>75</b>. The filth collection chamber <b>75</b> has a drainage pipe <b>75</b><i>a</i>, which communicates with the drainage chamber <b>22</b>. The drainage pipe <b>75</b><i>a </i>protrudes downward by a predetermined length from the bottom of the filter housing <b>70</b>. Consequently, the drainage pipe <b>75</b><i>a </i>is located in the drainage chamber <b>22</b> at the time of assembling the drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cover <b>80</b> has a filter <b>81</b>, which is disposed corresponding to the filth collection chamber <b>75</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b>, and a plurality of collection holes <b>82</b> formed outside the filter <b>81</b>. The collection holes <b>82</b> communicate with the sump <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Hereinafter, the filter housing <b>70</b>, in which the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> is mounted, will be described in more detail with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The filter housing <b>70</b> includes a wash water introduction part <b>72</b> constructed such that wash water pumped by the impeller is introduced to the wash water introduction part <b>72</b>, and main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>and a sampling flow channel <b>74</b> connected to the wash water introduction part <b>72</b>. The filth collection chamber <b>75</b> is connected to the sampling flow channel <b>74</b>. At the drainage pipe <b>75</b><i>a </i>of the filth collection chamber <b>75</b> is mounted an opening and closing valve for discharging the wash water and the food wastes from the filth collection chamber <b>75</b> to the drainage chamber <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at the time of a draining operation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the above description, the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> is a flow channel formed to continuously filter out foreign matter contained in the wash water collected in the sump <b>20</b> using some of the wash water introduced to the wash water introduction part <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The flow channel control valve <b>26</b> is rotatably located in the wash water introduction part <b>72</b> of the filter housing <b>70</b> for opening and closing the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b</i>. The flow channel control valve <b>26</b> is axially coupled to the flow channel control unit <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) mounted at the sump <b>20</b>. At the edge of the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> is formed an opening and closing rib <b>26</b><i>a </i>for opening and closing the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Now, the operation of the dish washer with the above-stated construction will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The dish washer performs sequentially or selectively a preliminary washing operation, a main washing operation, a rinsing operation, a heating-rinsing operation, and a drying operation so as to wash dishes. Between the respective operations, a draining operation is performed. Hereinafter, the main washing operation and the draining operation will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When the main washing operation is initiated, the washing motor is driven, and therefore, the impeller <b>42</b> is rotated. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the impeller <b>42</b> pumps wash water (containing detergent) from the sump <b>20</b> to the wash water introduction part <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the pump housing <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At this time, the flow channel control unit <b>25</b> is rotated. As a result, the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> selectively opens one of the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>under the control of a microprocessor. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> opens the main flow channel <b>73</b><i>a</i>. Although not shown, however, the flow channel control valve <b>26</b> may simultaneously open both the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b</i>. That is, the opened state of the main flow channels is changed depending upon the rotating positions of the flow channel control valve <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Consequently, most of the wash water introduced into the wash water introduction part <b>72</b> is supplied to both the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> or one of the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> through the opened one(s) of the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>under the control of the flow channel control unit <b>25</b> based on the microprocessor. On the other hand, the remainder of the wash water is supplied to the filth collection chamber <b>75</b> through the sampling flow channel <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The flow channel control valve <b>26</b> may be controlled such that the two main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>are simultaneously opened, and therefore, the wash water is supplied to both the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, such that only one of the main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>is opened, and therefore, the wash water is supplied to one of the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, or such that the two main flow channels <b>73</b><i>a </i>and <b>73</b><i>b </i>are alternately opened, and therefore, the wash water is alternately supplied to the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">On the other hand, some of the wash water is always supplied to the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> irrespective of which main flow channel is opened by the flow channel control valve <b>26</b>. This is because the wash water must be continuously supplied to the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> in order to continuously filter out foreign matter from the wash water.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The wash water supplied to the filth collection chamber <b>75</b> through the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> overflows through the filter <b>81</b> disposed above the filth collection chamber <b>75</b>. At this time, the filter <b>81</b> filters out foreign matter from the wash water.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The wash water filtered during the overflow and the wash water injected through the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> and having fallen to the cover <b>80</b> is reintroduced into the sump <b>20</b> through the collection holes <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the wash water flows through the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> for a short period of time, the amount of wash water flowing through the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> is small, and therefore, the filtering effect of the wash water accomplished through the sampling flow channel is insignificant. According to the present invention, however, the wash water continuously flows through the sampling flow channel <b>74</b> for a relatively long period of time during the main washing operation, and therefore, most of the wash water is substantially filtered.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the washing operation is completed, a draining operation is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the draining operation is initiated, the drainage pump <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> is driven. At this time, wash water and food wastes in the sump <b>20</b> are introduced to the drainage pump <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> due to a suction force of the drainage pump <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. At the same time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, wash water and food wastes in the filth collection chamber <b>75</b> are also introduced to the drainage pump <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> through the drainage pipe <b>75</b><i>a</i>. The wash water and the food wastes introduced to the drainage pump <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are discharged to the outside through the drainage hose <b>9</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, the conventional dish washer has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First, the dish washer has a problem in that only some of the pumped wash water is injected through the washing arms, and therefore, the amount of wash water substantially injected to wash dishes is considerably reduced, whereby the washing efficiency of the dish washer is lowered. Also, the wash water is pumped in consideration of the amount of wash water circulating through the sampling flow channel, and therefore, it is needed to increase the capacity of the washing pump such that the amount of the injected wash water is sufficiently maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Second, it is needed to consider the amount of wash water to be sufficiently injected to the dishes through the washing arms, the amount of wash water filtered while circulating through the sampling flow channel, and the amount of wash water injected from the lower washing arm to the filter so as to remove the food wastes from the filter. As a result, the amount of wash water substantially needed during the washing operation of the dish washer is considerably increased.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Third, the wash water pumped from the sump is directly introduced into the filth collection chamber through the sampling flow channel. As a result, a large amount of filth is introduced into the filth collection chamber, and therefore, the filter of the cover is clogged. Also, when the filter is clogged, large water pressure is applied to the filth collection chamber with the result that the wash water in the filth collection chamber is drained through the drainage hose, and therefore, the wash water is wasted. Furthermore, fatigue is accumulated in the filter, and therefore, the filter may be deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Fourth, when the wash water is wasted as described above, it is needed to replenish wash water. Also, when a heating-washing operation is performed, the replenished wash water must be heated by the heater. Consequently, the consumption of wash water and power is unnecessarily increased.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Fifth, the sampling flow channel and the filth collection chamber are separately formed to filter the wash water. Consequently, the flow channel of the wash water is complicated. In addition, as the flow channel is complicated, wash water pumping pressure is considerably decreased. As a result, it is needed to use a washing pump having an increased capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Sixth, the washing pump is mounted in an upright driven fashion, the disposer is mounted to the shaft of the washing pump, and the filth collection chamber is mounted above the pump housing. As a result, the structure of the drive unit is complicated, and the height of the drive unit is greatly increased. Otherwise, it is needed to reduce the inner space of the sump. Furthermore, as the size of the drive unit is increased, the capacity of the tub is relatively decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Seventh, the flow channel of the dish washer is complicated, and food wastes are left in the filth collection chamber and the filter during the drainage operation of the dish washer. As time passes, the leftover food wastes go rotten in the dish washer, thereby generating a bad smell. Furthermore, when the food wastes are left in various flow channels, such as the filth collection chamber, it is very difficult to remove the food wastes.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The housing assembly <b>100</b> includes a lower housing <b>130</b>, an upper housing <b>140</b> coupled to the lower housing <b>130</b> such that the lower housing <b>130</b> is covered by the upper housing <b>140</b>, and a connection housing <b>150</b> coupled to the upper housing <b>140</b> and a connection pipe connected to the washing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The coupling of the upper and lower housings <b>140</b> and <b>130</b> provides a pump compartment <b>131</b> in which the impeller <b>122</b> constituting the washing pump <b>120</b> is disposed, and a flow channel control compartment <b>132</b>, communicating with the pump compartment <b>131</b>, in which a flow channel control valve is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The upper housing <b>140</b> has main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> for guiding the wash water to the respective washing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The connection housing <b>150</b> is coupled to the upper housing <b>140</b> such that the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> of the upper housing <b>140</b> are covered by the connection housing <b>150</b>. The connection housing <b>150</b> is provided at the opposite ends thereof with coupling parts, which are coupled to connection pipes (not shown) connected to the washing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The lower housing <b>130</b> and the upper housing <b>140</b> are separately constructed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Although not shown, however, the lower housing <b>130</b> and the upper housing <b>140</b> may be integrally constructed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Preferably, the pump compartment <b>131</b> and the flow channel control compartment <b>132</b> are disposed on the same plane. This is because the height of the housing assembly <b>100</b> is decreased and the inner space of the sump <b>110</b> is increased. Also preferably, the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are disposed above the pump compartment <b>131</b> and the flow channel control compartment <b>132</b>. This is because the width of the housing assembly <b>100</b> is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Preferably, the cover <b>160</b>, which covers the sump <b>110</b>, is disposed with an inclination (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) toward the filter unit <b>170</b> such that the filth and the wash water having fallen to the cover <b>160</b> can easily flow to the filter unit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Preferably, a plurality of filter holes <b>161</b> are formed in the cover <b>160</b> such that some of the wash water having fallen to the cover <b>160</b> is filtered and directly introduced into the tub. More preferably, the filter holes <b>161</b> are disposed in the cover <b>160</b> at regions where the housing assembly <b>100</b> is not located such that the contamination of the outer surface of the housing assembly due to the contaminated wash water is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The filter unit <b>170</b> is constructed such that the lower end of the filter unit <b>170</b> is open. The open lower end of the filter unit <b>170</b> is coupled to the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b>. Preferably, the lower end of the filter unit <b>170</b> is spaced a predetermined distance from the bottom of the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b>. For example, a step part <b>111</b><i>a </i>is formed at the upper end of the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> such that the open lower end of the filter unit <b>170</b> can be supported by the step part <b>111</b><i>a</i>. The discharge flow channel <b>112</b> is disposed below the step part <b>111</b><i>a </i>of the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b>. Consequently, filth in the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> is discharged to the drainage chamber <b>113</b> through the discharge flow channel <b>112</b> without the interference of the filter unit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The filter unit <b>170</b> includes an upper filter <b>176</b> fitted through the cover <b>160</b> for allowing the filth and the wash water having fallen to the cover <b>160</b> to pass therethrough and a lower filter <b>171</b> coupled to the upper filter <b>176</b> and the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> for filtering out filth from the wash water. The lower filter <b>171</b> has an open lower end.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Preferably, the upper filter <b>176</b> and/or the lower filter <b>171</b> are detachably attached to the cover <b>160</b>. The upper filter <b>176</b> serves to filter out large particles of food wastes, and the lower filter <b>171</b> serves to filter out small particles of food wastes that have not been filtered out by the upper filter <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Preferably, the upper filter <b>176</b> protruded a predetermined height from the top of the cover <b>160</b>. This is because a user can easily pull out the upper filter <b>176</b> while holding the upper filter <b>176</b>. Of course, it is not necessarily needed for the upper filter to protrude from the top of the cover so long as the user can easily pull out the upper filter <b>176</b> while holding the upper filter <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The flow channel control valve <b>190</b> includes a rotary shaft <b>191</b> coupled to a shaft of a control motor <b>200</b> and a flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b> disposed at the upper end of the rotary shaft <b>191</b>, formed generally in the shape of a disc, and having communication holes <b>192</b><i>a </i>and <b>192</b><i>b </i>for selectively or simultaneously opening and closing the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> when the flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b> is rotated. The flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is formed in the shape of a disc because the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are disposed above the flow channel control valve <b>190</b>. Also, the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is constructed in a structure in which pumping pressure of the washing pump <b>120</b> is applied upward. Consequently, when the pumping pressure is applied, the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is pressed against the upper housing <b>140</b>, and therefore, the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is stably supported without shaking.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The communication holes <b>192</b><i>a </i>and <b>192</b><i>b </i>formed in the flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b> have different areas. Consequently, it is possible to selectively control the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> depending upon the rotating positions of the flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Now, the operation of the dish washer with the above-stated construction according to the present invention will be described. The dish washer performs sequentially or selectively a preliminary washing operation, a main washing operation, a rinsing operation, a heating-rinsing operation, and a drying operation so as to wash dishes. Between the respective operations, a draining operation is performed. Hereinafter, the main washing operation and the draining operation will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">First, the washing operation of the dish washer will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b> to <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">When the washing motor <b>121</b> is driven, the impeller <b>122</b> is rotated. As a result, wash water is supplied from the sump <b>110</b> to the pump compartment <b>131</b> and the flow channel control compartment <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At this time, the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is rotated such that the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> communicate with the flow channel control compartment <b>132</b>. Here, the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> may selectively open one of the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> or simultaneously open both the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. Otherwise, the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> may alternately open the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are opened, the wash water is supplied from the flow channel control compartment <b>132</b> to the corresponding washing arms along the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> such that the wash water can be injected by the washing arms.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">When the flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b> of the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, for example, the wash water is supplied to the upper washing arm <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through the main flow channel <b>142</b>. When the flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b> of the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the wash water is supplied to the lower washing arm <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through the main flow channel <b>141</b>. When the flow channel opening and closing plate <b>192</b> of the flow channel control valve <b>190</b> is positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the wash water is supplied to the upper and lower washing arms <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> through both the main flow channels <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The dish washer according to the present invention is not provided with a sampling flow channel unlike the conventional dish washer. For this reason, all the pumped wash water is supplied to the washing arms. As a result, the amount of wash water injected to dishes is increased, and all the pumped wash water is substantially used to wash the dishes. Consequently, it is possible to apply a washing pump <b>120</b> having a capacity smaller than that of the washing pump used in the conventional dish washer to the dish washer according to the present invention. Also, the consumption of wash water is considerably reduced. Furthermore, the wash water flow channel of the dish washer according to the present invention is simplified as compared to the conventional dish washer. Consequently, the flow channel resistance of the wash water is decreased, and therefore, the pumping efficiency is improved although the capacity of the washing pump <b>120</b> of the dish washer according to the present invention is equal to that of the washing pump of the conventional dish washer.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The wash water injected from the washing arms washes dishes and falls to the cover <b>160</b>. At this time, the filth and the wash water having fallen to the cover <b>160</b> are introduced into the upper filter <b>176</b> because the cover <b>160</b> is inclined toward the filter unit <b>170</b>. Also, some of the wash water is directly introduced into the sump <b>110</b> through the filter holes <b>161</b> of the cover <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The upper filter <b>176</b> filters out large particles of filth, and the lower filter <b>171</b> filters out filth that has not been filtered out by the upper filter <b>176</b>. Consequently, only wash water containing no filth is introduced into the sump <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to the present invention, it is not needed to periodically clean the filter unit <b>170</b> during the washing operation of the dish washer unlike the conventional dish washer. Consequently, it is possible to provide the same injection amount of wash water as the conventional dish washer although a smaller amount of wash water is pumped than the conventional dish washer. In addition, the consumption of the wash water is considerably reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The washing operation is performed for a predetermined period of time. As time passes, the amount of food wastes gathered in the filter unit <b>170</b> is gradually increased. After the washing operation is completed, a draining operation of the dishwasher is initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Hereinafter, the draining operation of the dish washer will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the drainage pump <b>180</b> is driven, the wash water in the sump <b>110</b> is introduced into the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> through the lower filter <b>171</b> due to the suction force of the drainage pump <b>180</b>. Then, the wash water is introduced into the drainage chamber <b>113</b> together with the filth gathered in the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b>. At this time, the filth is smoothly introduced into the drainage chamber <b>113</b> because the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> is inclined toward the drainage chamber <b>113</b>. Subsequently, the filth and the wash water in the drainage chamber <b>113</b> are discharged to the outside through the drainage hose of the drainage chamber <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">According to the present invention, the drainage section (the flow channel between the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> and the drainage chamber <b>113</b>) is considerably short as compared to the conventional dish washer. Consequently, hardly any of the filth is left in the drainage section.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Due to the aforesaid action, the filth gathered in the filth receiving chamber <b>111</b> is completely discharged to the outside during the draining operation of the dish washer.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The present invention provides a dish washer. More particularly, the present invention provides a dish washer having improved washing efficiency while being constructed in a compact structure. A general dish washer is an apparatus that injects wash water to dishes so as to wash the dishes, and dries and/or sterilizes the washed dishes. The dish washer according to the present invention includes a filter unit for filtering at least some of the wash water injected from a tub, fallen downward, and directed to a collection part of a sump.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to the present invention, it is possible to improve the washing efficiency of the dish washer, reduce the capacity of the washing pump, considerably decrease the amount of wash water substantially needed during a washing operation of the dish washer, reduce the consumption of wash water and power, reduce the flow channel resistance, considerably increase the wash water pumping pressure, simplify the structure of the drive unit, considerably reduce the height of the drive unit, increasing the inner space of the sump, and minimally prevent food wastes from being left in the sump during a drainage operation of the dish washer.</p>
