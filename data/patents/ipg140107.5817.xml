<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to computers and computer-related technology. More specifically, the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing a selective multicast proxy on a computer network.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computer and communication technologies continue to advance at a rapid pace. Indeed, computer and communication technologies are involved in many aspects of a person's day. For example, many devices being used today by consumers have a small computer inside of the device. These small computers come in varying sizes and degrees of sophistication. These small computers include everything from one microcontroller to a fully-functional complete computer system. For example, these small computers may be a one-chip computer, such as a microcontroller, a one-board type of computer, such as a controller, a typical desktop computer, such as an IBM-PC compatible, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computers typically have one or more processors at the heart of the computer. The processor(s) usually are interconnected to different external inputs and outputs and function to manage the particular computer or device. For example, a processor in a thermostat may be connected to buttons used to select the temperature setting, to the furnace or air conditioner to change the temperature, and to temperature sensors to read and display the current temperature on a display.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many appliances, devices, etc., include one or more small computers. For example, thermostats, furnaces, air conditioning systems, refrigerators, telephones, typewriters, automobiles, vending machines, and many different types of industrial equipment now typically have small computers, or processors, inside of them. Computer software runs the processors of these computers and instructs the processors how to carry out certain tasks. For example, the computer software running on a thermostat may cause an air conditioner to stop running when a particular temperature is reached or may cause a heater to turn on when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">These types of small computers that are a part of a device, appliance, tool, etc., are often referred to as embedded devices or embedded systems. (The terms &#x201c;embedded device&#x201d; and &#x201c;embedded system&#x201d; will be used interchangeably herein.) An embedded system usually refers to computer hardware and software that is part of a larger system. Embedded systems may not have typical input and output devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and/or monitor. Usually, at the heart of each embedded system is one or more processor(s).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A lighting system may incorporate an embedded system. The embedded system may be used to monitor and control the effects of the lighting system. For example, the embedded system may provide controls to dim the brightness of the lights within the lighting system. Alternatively, the embedded system may provide controls to increase the brightness of the lights. The embedded system may provide controls to initiate a specific lighting pattern among the individual lights within the lighting system. Embedded systems may be coupled to individual switches within the lighting system. These embedded systems may instruct the switches to power up or power down individual lights or the entire lighting system. Similarly, embedded systems may be coupled to individual lights within the lighting system. The brightness or power state of each individual light may be controlled by the embedded system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A security system may also incorporate an embedded system. The embedded system may be used to control the individual security sensors that comprise the security system. For example, the embedded system may provide controls to power up each of the security sensors automatically. Embedded systems may be coupled to each of the individual security sensors. For example, an embedded system may be coupled to a motion sensor. The embedded system may power up the individual motion sensor automatically and provide controls to activate the motion sensor if motion is detected. Activating a motion sensor may include providing instructions to power up an LED located within the motion sensor, output an alarm from the output ports of the motion sensor, and the like. Embedded systems may also be coupled to sensors monitoring a door. The embedded system may provide instructions to the sensor monitoring the door to activate when the door is opened or closed. Similarly, embedded systems may be coupled to sensors monitoring a window. The embedded system may provide instructions to activate the sensor monitoring the window if the window is opened or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some embedded systems may also be used to control wireless products such as cell phones. The embedded system may provide instructions to power up the LED display of the cell phone. The embedded system may also activate the audio speakers within the cell phone to provide the user with an audio notification relating to the cell phone.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Home appliances may also incorporate an embedded system. Home appliances may include appliances typically used in a conventional kitchen, e.g., stove, refrigerator, microwave, etc. Home appliances may also include appliances that relate to the health and well-being of the user. For example, a massage recliner may incorporate an embedded system. The embedded system may provide instructions to automatically recline the back portion of the chair according to the preferences of the user. The embedded system may also provide instructions to initiate the oscillating components within the chair that cause vibrations within the recliner according to the preferences of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional products typically found in homes may also incorporate embedded systems. For example, an embedded system may be used within a toilet to control the level of water used to refill the container tank. Embedded systems may be used within a jetted bathtub to control the outflow of air.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As stated, embedded systems may be used to monitor or control many different systems, resources, products, etc. With the growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, embedded systems are increasingly connected to the Internet so that they can be remotely monitored and/or controlled. Other embedded systems may be connected to computer networks including local area networks, wide area networks, etc. As used herein, the term &#x201c;computer network&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;network&#x201d;) refers to any system in which a series of nodes are interconnected by a communications path. The term &#x201c;node&#x201d; refers to any device that may be connected as part of a computer network. An embedded system may be a network node. Other examples of network nodes include computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some embedded systems may provide data and/or services to other computing devices using a computer network. Many different kinds of services may be provided. Some examples of services include providing temperature data from a location, providing surveillance data, providing weather information, providing an audio stream, providing a video stream, etc. As used herein, the term &#x201c;requester&#x201d; refers to a node that requests a service from a provider. The term &#x201c;provider&#x201d; refers to a node that provides a service to a requestor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Some of the nodes within a computer network may be configured to send messages to other nodes on the network using multicast technology. Within the context of computer networks, the term &#x201c;multicasting&#x201d; refers to the process of sending a message simultaneously to more than one node on the network. Multicasting is different from broadcasting in that multicasting means sending a message to specific groups of nodes within a network, whereas broadcasting implies sending a message to all of the nodes on the network.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A node that is requesting a service (i.e., a requester) may send a service request to other nodes within the network via multicast. However, several issues have arisen with known approaches to the use of multicast technology on a computer network to request services. For example, a computer network may include one or more resource-constrained nodes that are not capable of receiving and/or processing multicast messages. If a requestor sends a request for a service to other nodes within the network via multicast, these resource-constrained nodes may not receive (and therefore have an opportunity to respond to) the service request.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another issue with known approaches is that each node that receives a service request via multicast typically determines whether it provides the requested service, and if it does, it responds to the service request. Such an approach may be inefficient under some circumstances because several nodes that do not provide the requested service may still process a request for the service.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another issue with known approaches is that it may be discovered that one or more nodes within the network are defective in some way. If this occurs, it may be desirable to prevent such nodes from directly processing multicast messages. This may be accomplished by shutting down the appropriate multicast protocol stack on the node. However, such an approach may not be desirable under some circumstances because this may prevent such nodes from receiving and responding to service requests that are sent on the network via multicast.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In view of the foregoing, benefits may be realized by improvements related to the use of multicast technology on a computer network. Accordingly, some exemplary systems and methods for facilitating more efficient processing of multicast requests on a computer network are disclosed herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Systems and methods for providing a selective multicast proxy on a computer network are disclosed. In an exemplary embodiment, a selective multicast proxy receives registration of a plurality of non-multicast nodes that do not process multicast messages. In response to receiving a request for a service from a requestor via multicast, the selective multicast proxy identifies among the plurality of non-multicast nodes one or more providers of the requested service. The selective multicast proxy sends the request to the one or more providers without sending the request to other non-multicast nodes on the computer network. If the selective multicast proxy receives one or more responses to the request from the one or more providers, the selective multicast proxy sends the response(s) to the original requestor. The selective multicast proxy, the requestor, and the plurality of non-multicast nodes may all be located within the same local area network.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The request may be sent to the one or more providers via a connection-based protocol. Alternatively, the request may be sent to the one or more providers via a connectionless protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to identify the one or more providers of the requested service, a database of registered nodes may be maintained. The request may include a service identifier that identifies the requested service. The selective multicast proxy may detect the service identifier within the request, and then search for the service identifier within the database of registered nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The plurality of non-multicast nodes may include at least one resource-constrained node that is not capable of processing multicast messages. Alternatively, or in addition, the plurality of non-multicast nodes may include at least one multicast-capable node that is capable of processing multicast messages. The selective multicast proxy may facilitate registration of multicast-capable nodes by periodically sending a proxy announcement message via multicast.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various embodiments of the invention are now described with reference to the Figures, where like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. The embodiments of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of several exemplary embodiments of the present invention, as represented in the Figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of the embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used exclusively herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. While the various aspects of the embodiments are presented in drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale unless specifically indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Many features of the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as computer software, electronic hardware, or combinations of both. To clearly illustrate this interchangeability of hardware and software, various components will be described generally in terms of their functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Skilled artisans may implement the described functionality in varying ways for each particular application, but such implementation decisions should not be interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Where the described functionality is implemented as computer software, such software may include any type of computer instruction or computer executable code located within a memory device and/or transmitted as electronic signals over a system bus or network. Software that implements the functionality associated with components described herein may comprise a single instruction, or many instructions, and may be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a system <b>100</b> for processing multicast requests on a computer network according to an embodiment. The embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is implemented within a single local area network (LAN). The LAN includes a plurality of nodes that are connected by a communications link that enables nodes on the LAN to interact with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Some of the nodes within the LAN provide services to other nodes. As stated above, a requestor is a node that requests a service from a provider. A provider is a node that provides a service to a requestor.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a requestor <b>102</b> sends a request <b>104</b> for a service <b>106</b> to other nodes within the LAN via multicast. A connectionless protocol, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), may be used as the transport protocol to send service requests via multicast. Such service requests may be referred to as UDP multicast requests.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Some of the nodes in the LAN may not process multicast messages. For example, the LAN may include one or more resource-constrained nodes that are not capable of receiving and/or processing multicast messages (e.g., that do not have the appropriate multicast protocol stack for processing multicast messages). As another example, the LAN may include one or more nodes that are capable of processing multicast messages but that have been configured or notified not to process multicast messages, at least temporarily. The term &#x201c;non-multicast node&#x201d; will be used herein to refer to a node that does not process multicast messages, either because it is not capable of processing multicast messages or because it has been configured or notified not to process multicast messages.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the depicted embodiment, a selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> is provided on the LAN. In general terms, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> serves as an interface between the requestor <b>102</b> and non-multicast nodes on the LAN that do not process the request <b>104</b>. The functionality provided by the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Non-multicast nodes within the LAN register with the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b>. Some exemplary ways that a non-multicast node may register with the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> will be discussed below. The selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> maintains information <b>110</b> about the non-multicast nodes that have registered with it.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> receives a request <b>104</b> for a service <b>106</b>, it does not simply forward the service request <b>104</b> to all non-multicast nodes that have registered with it. Rather, in response to receiving a request <b>104</b> for a particular service <b>106</b>, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> determines which (if any) of the registered non-multicast nodes are capable of providing the requested service <b>106</b>. In other words, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> identifies one or more providers <b>112</b> of the requested service <b>106</b> from among the non-multicast nodes that have registered with it. Some exemplary ways that the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may identify a provider <b>112</b> of the requested service <b>106</b> will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A service request <b>104</b> may specify that only the provider <b>112</b> with a specific provider identifier <b>116</b> of a service <b>106</b> should provide the request <b>104</b>. Alternatively, a service request <b>104</b> may specify that all providers <b>112</b> of a service <b>106</b> should provide the request <b>104</b>. In alternative embodiments, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may identify more than one provider <b>112</b> of the requested service <b>106</b> with the same provider identifier <b>116</b>. If this occurs, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may select one provider <b>112</b> from among these providers with the same provider identifier <b>116</b>. Various algorithms may be used to make this selection.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the depicted embodiment, once the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> has identified one or more providers <b>112</b> of the requested service <b>106</b>, it forwards the request <b>104</b> to the provider(s) <b>112</b>. If a connection (e.g., TCP/IP connection, serial connection, etc.) has been established between the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> and a particular provider <b>112</b>, then the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may send the service request <b>104</b> to the provider <b>112</b> via this connection. However, it is not necessary that a connection be established between the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> and the identified provider(s) <b>112</b>. For example, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may send the service request <b>104</b> to the provider(s) <b>112</b> via a connectionless protocol, such as UDP unicast.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Advantageously, the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may be configured so that it only sends the service request <b>104</b> to the identified provider(s) <b>112</b>, and not to other registered non-multicast nodes (or to other nodes within the LAN). Accordingly, it is not necessary for nodes that do not provide the requested service <b>106</b> to process the request <b>104</b> for the service <b>106</b>, thereby conserving computational resources on these nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The identified provider(s) <b>112</b> of the requested service <b>106</b> receive(s) the service request <b>104</b> from the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> and respond(s) to it.

The selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may forward any responses <b>114</b> that it receives from the provider(s) <b>112</b> back to the original requestor <b>102</b> using a connectionless protocol, such as UDP unicast.</p>

Some exemplary ways that the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> may identify the provider(s) <b>112</b> of the requested service <b>106</b> will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If in step <b>206</b> the selective multicast proxy <b>108</b> determines that none of the registered non-multicast nodes are capable of providing the requested service <b>106</b>, then the method <b>200</b> ends.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates various components within a selective multicast proxy <b>308</b> that is configured according to an embodiment. The illustrated components may implement the functionality of processing service requests <b>304</b> received from requestors within the LAN.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown, the selective multicast proxy <b>308</b> may include a multicast server <b>316</b> and a request processor <b>318</b>. The multicast server <b>316</b> may be configured to listen on a specified multicast address and port for multicast packets and to pass the received packets as requests <b>304</b> to the request processor <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the depicted embodiment, the request processor <b>318</b> within the selective multicast proxy <b>308</b> has access to a database <b>320</b> of registered nodes. The database <b>320</b> may be an integral or external module of the selective multicast proxy <b>308</b>. The database <b>320</b> includes node identifiers <b>322</b> for the nodes that have registered with the selective multicast proxy <b>308</b>. Each node identifier <b>322</b> is associated with one or more service identifiers <b>324</b>. A service identifier <b>324</b> is information that identifies a particular service that may be provided by a node. In the depicted embodiment, when a service identifier <b>324</b> is associated with a node identifier <b>322</b>, this means that the node that corresponds to the node identifier <b>322</b> is capable of providing the service that corresponds to the service identifier <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown, a request <b>304</b> for a particular service includes a service identifier <b>324</b> that identifies the requested service. In the depicted embodiment, when a request <b>304</b> for a particular service is passed to the request processor <b>318</b>, a parsing module <b>326</b> detects the service identifier <b>324</b> within the request <b>304</b>. The service identifier <b>324</b> is passed to a searching module <b>328</b>, which searches for the service identifier <b>324</b> within the database <b>320</b> of registered nodes. If the searching module <b>328</b> detects a node identifier <b>322</b> that is associated with the service identifier <b>324</b>, then the corresponding node is selected as a provider of the requested service. If the searching module <b>328</b> determines that more than one of the same node identifiers <b>322</b> are associated with the service identifier <b>324</b>, then this means that there is more than one potential provider with the same node identifier <b>322</b> of the requested service. If this occurs, a selection module <b>330</b> selects the provider of the requested service from among the same potential providers that have been identified.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the depicted embodiment, once the request processor <b>318</b> has identified the provider(s) of the requested service, it passes the request <b>304</b> to a communication module <b>332</b>. The request processor <b>318</b> may also pass the node identifier(s) <b>322</b> of the identified provider(s) to the communication module <b>332</b>. The communication module <b>332</b> may be configured to operate in accordance with a connection-oriented protocol, such as TCP/IP. Alternatively, or in addition, the communication module <b>332</b> may be configured to operate in accordance with a connectionless protocol, such as UDP. Once the communication module <b>332</b> has received the service request <b>304</b> and the node identifier(s) <b>322</b> of the provider(s) from the request processor <b>318</b>, the communication module <b>332</b> may send the request <b>304</b> to the provider(s) of the requested service.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additional information about how a selective multicast proxy may determine which of the non-multicast nodes are capable of providing the requested service are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,954,798, entitled &#x201c;Content-Based Routing of Data from a Provider to a Requestor,&#x201d; with inventor Bryant Eastham. This U.S. patent is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As briefly discussed above, the selective multicast proxy may be configured to receive registration of non-multicast nodes. In other words, non-multicast nodes within the LAN may register with the selective multicast proxy so that the selective multicast proxy receives multicast requests on their behalf. The non-multicast nodes that register with the selective multicast proxy may include one or more nodes that are capable of processing multicast messages. (Nodes that are capable of processing multicast messages may be referred to herein as &#x201c;multicast-capable nodes.&#x201d;) There are a variety of reasons why a selective multicast proxy may be configured to serve as a multicast proxy for multicast-capable nodes. For example, if a multicast-capable node within the LAN is defective in some way (e.g., it has a &#x201c;bug&#x201d;), the LAN administrator may want to prevent that node from directly processing multicast messages until the defect can be fixed. In this case, the selective multicast proxy <b>308</b> can intervene and override the defective aspects of the defective node.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to serving as a multicast proxy on behalf of multicast-capable nodes, the selective multicast proxy may also serve as a multicast proxy for resource constrained nodes that are not capable of processing multicast requests. This allows resource constrained nodes to respond to service requests using non-multicast requests proxied for them, where otherwise they could not receive those requests because of their inability to process multicast.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram that illustrates various additional components within a selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> that is configured according to an embodiment. The illustrated components may implement the functionality of receiving registration of non-multicast nodes, which in the depicted embodiment may be resource constrained nodes that are not capable of processing multicast requests, and/or multicast-capable nodes that have been notified or configured not to process multicast requests.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown, the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> may include a connection module <b>434</b>. The connection module <b>434</b> may be configured to establish connections to non-multicast nodes in the LAN. In some embodiments the connection module <b>434</b> may be configured to establish TCP/IP connections. For example, the functionality of the connection module <b>434</b> may be implemented by a TCP/IP protocol stack that is configured to establish TCP/IP connections with other nodes in the LAN. Alternatively, or in addition, the connection module <b>434</b> may be configured to establish other kinds of connections, such as serial connections, to non-multicast nodes in the LAN.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> may also include a user interface <b>436</b>. A user of the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> may interact with and provide instructions to the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> via the user interface <b>436</b>. For example, a LAN administrator may instruct the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> to open one or more connections to non-multicast nodes in the LAN via the user interface <b>436</b> that is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> may also include a proxy announcement module <b>438</b>. The proxy announcement module <b>438</b> may be configured to periodically send a proxy announcement message, via multicast, to one or more multicast groups on the LAN. The proxy announcement message may serve to notify multicast-capable nodes in the LAN of the existence of the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b>. For example, as will be explained in greater detail below, the proxy announcement message may be interpreted by multicast-capable nodes in the LAN as an instruction to stop processing multicast messages.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram that illustrates the operation of the connection module <b>434</b>, the user interface <b>436</b>, and the proxy announcement module <b>438</b> according to an embodiment. The method <b>500</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be performed in order to facilitate registration of a multicast-capable node with the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>502</b>, the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> receives an instruction (e.g., from a LAN administrator), via the user interface <b>436</b> or configuration, to open a connection to a multicast-capable node. In step <b>504</b>, in response to the instruction received in step <b>502</b>, the connection module <b>434</b> opens a connection to the specified multicast-capable node. In other embodiments, multicast-capable nodes can be programmed, configured, or notified to connect to the selective multicast proxy's <b>308</b> communication module <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>506</b>, the proxy announcement module <b>438</b> sends a proxy announcement message, via multicast, to a multicast group that includes the multicast capable node that was specified in step <b>502</b>. The proxy announcement message may include the address of the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b>. In response to receiving the proxy announcement message, the multicast-capable node may determine whether it is presently connected to the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> (i.e., the node that is referenced in the proxy announcement message). If it is presently connected to the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b>, then the multicast-capable node should, in response, stop processing multicast messages. For example, the multicast-capable node may terminate its multicast protocol stack. Alternatively, the multicast-capable node may simply start ignoring multicast messages, without terminating its multicast protocol stack. If the multicast-capable node is not presently connected to the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b>, the multicast-capable node may choose to connect to the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> and stop processing multicast messages. If at some point the connection between the multicast-capable node and the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> is terminated, then the multicast-capable node may resume processing multicast messages.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the method <b>500</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the step of sending the proxy announcement message is shown occurring after the step of opening a connection to a multicast-capable node. However, in some embodiments, these steps may not occur in this order. For example, in some embodiments, the proxy announcement module <b>438</b> may be configured so that it periodically sends out a proxy announcement message on the LAN. When the selective multicast proxy <b>408</b> opens a connection to a multicast-capable node, the multicast capable node may continue to receive and process multicast messages until the next scheduled proxy announcement message is sent.</p>
