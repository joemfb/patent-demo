<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a wavelength-tunable light source apparatus using active mode locking that employs cross gain modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, light sources in which wavelengths can be changed at high-speed wavelength sweep rates on the order of several hundred kHz to several MHz in a wide wavelength sweep width range of several hundred nanometers have been researched and developed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of them is a dispersion tuning technique based on active mode locking using wavelength dispersion of refractive index in a resonator (hereinafter also referred to simply as &#x201c;dispersion&#x201d;) is disclosed in S. Yamashita, et al., Opt. Exp. Vol. 14, pp. 9299-9306 (2006) (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Non Patent Literature 1&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The technique disclosed in Non Patent Literature 1 utilizes the fact that free spectral range (FSR) (free frequency space) varies with a wavelength when dispersion is present in a resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Specifically, a technique is disclosed for changing an oscillation wavelength by changing a modulation frequency by utilizing the fact that a modulation frequency varies with a central wavelength at which a laser oscillates to directly modulate an electric current to be injected into a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) forming a laser and to obtain active mode locking.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Proceedings of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE) Electronics Society Conference 2009, C-4-14 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Non Patent Literature 2&#x201d;) disclose the use of cross-gain modulation employing external light, not using modulation of an electric current to be injected into a gain medium (SOA), to obtain active mode locking.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With the above-described dispersion tuning, because a wavelength tuning operation uses differences of mode locking frequency, in terms of stability of each varying laser oscillation frequency to the time axis, determination accuracy in a modulation frequency is important. Accordingly, a modulation method with reduced temporal variation (displacement) or fluctuation in a signal (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;jitter&#x201d;) is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technique of Non Patent Literature 1 modulates an electric current for driving a gain medium, whereas that of Non Patent Literature 2 performs modulation using light modulated from continuous light generated by a semiconductor laser (laser diode (LD)) by an electro-optic modulator (EOM).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the techniques disclosed in the above Non Patent Literatures are a modulation method by which the shape of an electric current waveform subjected to electrical modulation is mirrored, so it is difficult to reduce jitter occurring in generation of an electric current and thus further improvement is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An embodiment includes a wavelength-tunable light source apparatus. The wavelength-tunable light source apparatus includes a first light source apparatus and a second light source apparatus. The first light source apparatus changes an oscillation wavelength and includes a resonator. The resonator includes an optical amplification medium for amplifying light and a waveguide having wavelength distribution. The second light source apparatus is connected to the waveguide and introduces pulsed light as modulation light to the first light source apparatus. The oscillation wavelength is controlled by active mode locking employing cross-gain modulation using the modulation light. The pulse width of the modulation light has a duration shorter than a duration of a half period of a driving signal for generating the modulation light.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The optical amplification medium <b>301</b> can be a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA), for example. Basically, a semiconductor optical amplifier is the one in which a resonator is removed from a semiconductor laser and utilizes an optical amplification process, and it has a structure that suppresses reflection at its end faces to avoid it from configuring a resonator. The optical amplification medium <b>301</b> is connected to a direct-current power supply (not illustrated) and receives an injected electric current that allows carriers sufficient to cause the optical amplification medium <b>301</b> to oscillate as a mode-locking laser.</p>

This modulation light (pulsed light) is used in controlling an oscillation wavelength of the first light source apparatus <b>350</b> employing active mode locking using cross-gain modulation. In addition, the pulse width of the modulation light is narrower than the duration of a half period of a driving signal for generating modulation light, and pulsed light having a specific narrow pulse width is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, operation of the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus using the first light source apparatus and the second light source apparatus according to an embodiment is described.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Here, because the resonator includes the waveguide <b>304</b> having wavelength dispersion, the refractive index is n(&#x3bb;) having dispersion in which the wavelength is a variable, and the value of the modulation frequency f varies with the central oscillation wavelength. Therefore, the oscillation wavelength determined by active mode locking can be changed by changing the modulation frequency f. This is a principle of dispersion tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Accordingly, accuracy in determining the value of the modulation frequency f relates to accuracy in selecting the oscillation wavelength for the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus. In high-speed wavelength tuning at several hundred kHz or above using the dispersion tuning process, the modulation frequency f can be a higher value. The dispersion tuning process employing cross-gain modulation using external light as modulation light is suited for such high-speed wavelength tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For the technique disclosed in Non Patent Literature 2 described in the Related Art, light obtained by modulating continuous light employing a modulator, such as EOM, is used as modulation light, it is introduced into the resonator including the SOA, loss is provided thereto, and mode locking is obtained. Therefore, pulsed light to which the waveform of a driving electric current being a modulation signal is strongly reflected is generated by the resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In contrast to this, for the embodiments, modulation light generated by the second light source apparatus is configured to have a specific pulse width (have a duration narrower than a duration of a half period of a driving signal for generating modulation light). The modulation light generated by the second light source apparatus corresponds to pulsed light that oscillates in a duration narrower than that of the waveform of a driving signal when a so-called gain switching laser is used.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, for cross-gain modulations using these two kinds of pulsed light as modulation light, accuracy in determining the mode locking frequency f when a gain switching laser is used is better. The reasons are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> are graphs illustrating relationships between each of a driving signal for generating modulation light and the modulation light and a gain of pulsed light obtained by oscillation. In this case, light in which continuous light is modulated by a modulator is used as modulation light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates a time waveform of a driving electric current, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> illustrates a time waveform for the intensity of modulation light, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> illustrates a time waveform of a gain when a gain medium (optical amplification medium) is subjected to cross-gain modulation using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> are graphs when pulsed light from a gain switching laser is used as modulation light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a time waveform of a driving electric current, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a time waveform for the intensity of modulation light, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates a time waveform of a gain when a gain medium is subjected to cross-gain modulation using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The waveform illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> is the same as that of a driving electric current illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, whereas the waveform illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a pulse waveform oscillating in a duration narrower than a half period of the waveform of a driving electric current illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When an optical amplification medium (gain medium) is subjected to cross-gain modulation using such different pulsed light as modulation light, the gain illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> rises more sharply than that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. In other words, the slope of an increase in gain in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is steeper.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, when the mode locking frequency defined by f<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> and that defined by f<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> are discussed, fluctuations of the value of f<b>2</b> are smaller than those of f<b>1</b>. That is, for the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, jitter characteristics in active mode locking are improved, and reliability of mode locking frequency is improved. In addition, in terms of wavelength sweeping by dispersion tuning, accuracy of wavelength selectivity is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The value of integral of the gain of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is larger than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. Therefore, the quantity of output light in laser oscillation for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is also larger.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In consideration of these benefits, no matter how narrow the pulse width of modulation light is, cross-gain modulation by induced emission occurs in a gain medium. However, if the pulse width is too narrow, the peak value of the quantity of light in pulse is high and this may cause undesired effects, such as extension of the pulse width during propagation along the waveguide or the occurrence of non-linear effects in the gain medium.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, a useful pulse width is the one at which the slope of a gain enabling sufficient effects of improving jitter can be formed with respect to a frequency modulation range in dispersion tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In light of these respects, it is useful that the slope of an intensity curve at (the place of) a half value of a maximum value of intensity defining the pulse width of modulation light be larger than the slope of an intensity curve at (the place of) a half value of a maximum value of intensity in (signal) waveform of a driving electric current. The second light source apparatus for generating modulation light having a narrow pulse width can be made of a gain switching semiconductor laser or a mode locking laser. The embodiments also encompass mode in which the second light source apparatus is made of a wavelength-tunable semiconductor laser.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the foregoing, an example in which a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) is used as an optical amplification medium is described. Other examples of the optical amplification medium can include a rare earth doped (ion doped) optical fiber containing, for example, erbium or ytterbium, and an optical fiber doped with coloring matter for use in amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A rare earth doped optical fiber is useful in high gain and good noise characteristics. With a coloring matter doped optical fiber, when fluorescent dye or its host material is appropriately selected, a tuning wavelength can be selected from increased options.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A semiconductor optical amplifier is useful in that it is small and can be controlled at high speeds. As the semiconductor optical amplifier, both a reflective type and a traveling-wave type can be used. The semiconductor optical amplifier can be made of a compound semiconductor forming a general semiconductor laser, and examples thereof can include indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), indium arsenide phosphide (InAsP), gallium aluminum antimonide (GaAlSb), gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP), aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs), and gallium nitride (GaN) compound semiconductors. The semiconductor optical amplifier can be selected from among ones having gain central wavelengths 840 nm, 1060 nm, 1300 nm, and 1550 nm, depending on the application of the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For the embodiments, as an optical waveguide, basically, the one having the function of enabling light to propagate therethrough and having wavelength dispersion can be used. To minimize external effects, a slab waveguide or an optical fiber that enables light to propagate therethrough while confining light therein can be used. A typical waveguide that enables confined light to propagate therethrough includes a section having a high refractive index (core) and a section having a low refractive index (clad). To achieve small-range FSR, the length of the resonator can be relatively long. From this respect, an optical fiber can be used. This is because from the principle of dispersion tuning, small-range FSR leads to a small pitch in selecting an oscillation wavelength. Examples of the optical fiber can include one employing quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) glass, one employing plastic, and one employing both quartz and plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For the embodiments, a dispersion value of wavelength dispersion of the optical waveguide can be any specific dispersion value in the range of a normal dispersion value (negative) to an anomalous dispersion (positive), depending on the used optical amplification medium, a target sweeping speed, and a target sweeping wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of a resonator that can be used in the embodiments can include a ring resonator, which is previously described, and an optical resonator having a pair of parallel planes as reflection planes at both ends (so-called Fabry-Perot resonator). From the viewpoint that traveling waves in a resonator are in a uniform direction, a ring resonator including an isolator can be used. From the viewpoint of a light source apparatus having no isolator and made at low cost, a Fabry-Perot resonator can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The embodiments of the present invention are specifically described in detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A wavelength-tunable light source apparatus is described that performs dispersion tuning employing cross-gain modulation by introducing modulation light generated by a gain switching laser to a ring resonator using a fiber from the outside and that has a central sweep wavelength of 1.06 &#x3bc;m band.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The light source apparatus according to the present embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The light source apparatus includes a ring resonator <b>305</b> made up of a optical amplification medium <b>301</b>, an isolator <b>302</b>, an output coupler <b>303</b>, and a dispersion fiber <b>304</b> for use in providing dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The light source apparatus further includes a semiconductor laser (LD) <b>306</b> outside the ring resonator <b>305</b> and performs a gain switching operation by applying a voltage in which a direct-current component and an alternating-current component are superimposed from a power supply <b>307</b> in the vicinity of a threshold electric current of the semiconductor laser <b>306</b>. After external modulation light generated by the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> passes through an isolator <b>310</b>, its light quantity is increased by an optical amplification medium <b>308</b>. The external modulation light is introduced to the ring resonator <b>305</b> through a circulator <b>309</b>. The external modulation light propagates through an active layer of the optical amplification medium <b>301</b>, and carriers in the active layer are consumed by induced emission, thus losing the gain of the optical amplification medium <b>301</b> and thereby performing cross-gain modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each of the optical amplification media <b>301</b> and <b>308</b> according to the present embodiment is the one in which a gain central wavelength is in 1.06 &#x3bc;m band. Each of the optical amplification media <b>301</b> and <b>308</b> is in a state where a direct-current voltage is applied and it has a sufficient gain. The operating wavelength band of each of the isolators <b>302</b> and <b>307</b>, the output coupler <b>303</b>, and the circulator <b>309</b> is also 1.06 &#x3bc;m band.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The dispersion value of the dispersion fiber <b>304</b> is approximately &#x2212;50 (ps/km&#xb7;nm), and the length thereof is approximately 100 m. At this time, when active mode locking is performed at the mode locking frequency f around 1 GHz and the frequency f is changed about &#xb1;500 kHz, a tuning wavelength width of approximately 50 nm can be obtained from the principle of dispersion tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The external modulation light capable of performing such frequency modulation is generated by the semiconductor laser <b>306</b>. When the threshold of the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> is approximately 40 mA, applying a voltage in which a voltage corresponding to the direct-current component 30 mA and that corresponding to the alternating-current component &#xb1;20 mA are superimposed from the power supply <b>307</b> enables the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> to perform a gain switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When a driving signal of approximately 1 GHz (gigahertz) sine wave, that is, a current waveform of a half-value width of approximately 500 ps (picoseconds) and a period of approximately 1 GHz is applied to the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> from the power supply <b>307</b>, a repetitive pulse train of a half-value width of approximately 100 ps and a period of approximately 1 GHz is generated by the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> being in a gain switching operation state.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This behavior is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. The electric current waveform is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and light of a pulse width narrower than its half-value width is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Additionally, when the frequency of the power supply <b>307</b> is subjected to frequency modulation in the range of &#xb1;500 kHz with respect to 1 GHz, desired modulation light can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">From the viewpoint of efficient cross-gain modulation on the optical amplification medium <b>301</b>, the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> can be a wavelength-tunable LD.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> can have a wavelength shorter than the oscillation wavelength at the ring resonator <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Dispersion tuning having good jitter characteristics can be achieved by performing active mode locking employing cross-gain modulation on the optical amplification medium <b>301</b> in the ring resonator <b>305</b> using the above-described pulsed light.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As a result, light with a tunable oscillation wavelength is output from the output coupler <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Repeating sweeping the frequency of the power supply <b>307</b> in the above-described range enables outputting light subjected to repetitive sweeping from &#x3bb;<b>1</b> to &#x3bb;n as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> from the output coupler <b>303</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The wavelength-tunable light source apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an apparatus in which jitter characteristics of pulse oscillation are improved by introducing continuous light having a wavelength slightly shorter than the oscillation wavelength from the outside to the LD for performing a gain switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Introducing continuous light having a wavelength slightly shorter than the oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> from the semiconductor laser <b>401</b> (third light source apparatus) enables reduction in the amount of generation of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light in the semiconductor laser <b>306</b>.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The desired delay time used here is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, reference numeral <b>1001</b> indicates pulsed light in a gain switching operation of the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> and indicates the timing of its oscillation. The length of the delay path is adjusted such that feedback light <b>1002</b> is fed back to the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> immediately before the oscillation of the pulsed light <b>1001</b> by time &#x3c4;. The time &#x3c4; is approximately 0 to 100 ps (picoseconds). At this time, part of carriers in the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> is consumed by induced emission caused by the feedback light <b>1002</b>, and the slope of the density of carries exceeding the oscillation threshold is sharp. Therefore, jitter characteristics in a gain switching operation are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Accordingly, dispersion tuning performed on the ring resonator <b>305</b> using pulsed light occurring in the above-described way supplied from the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> further improves jitter characteristics in comparison with the apparatus illustrated in the first embodiment, and thus the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus having excellent wavelength selectivity can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In comparison with the case where jitter characteristics of a gain switching laser are improved by the use of continuous light as in the second embodiment, because the timing for feedback is important as described above, a wavelength-control condition of a slightly shorter than the oscillation wavelength is relieved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In addition, because an external light source apparatus is not disposed, the present embodiment is useful in terms of cost reduction, in comparison with the apparatus illustrated in the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A light source apparatus according to the present embodiment has jitter characteristics in a gain switching operation improved by feeding part of light output from the ring resonator <b>305</b> to the semiconductor laser <b>306</b>, which is the light source of external modulation light for the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus illustrated in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, reference numerals <b>701</b> and <b>702</b> indicate couplers, reference numeral <b>703</b> indicates a fiber stretcher, and other components are substantially the same as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described in the third embodiment, feeding pulsed light back to the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> at appropriate timing enables improvement in jitter in a gain switching operation. For the present embodiment, part of intensity of light output from the output coupler <b>303</b>, the light being the output light from the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus, is extracted by the coupler <b>701</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A delay path containing the fiber stretcher <b>703</b> provides the extracted light with a desired delay time. The light is fed back to the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> through the coupler <b>702</b>. The desired delay time used here is the same as the one described in the third embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> and the wavelength of light output from the ring resonator <b>305</b> are different, and the occurrence of parasitic oscillation induced by feedback light in the semiconductor laser <b>306</b> can be reduced. This can reduce effects in which the pulsed light <b>1001</b> and the feedback light <b>1002</b> overlap each other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the limitation on accuracy in the desired delay time is relieved. It is useful that the wavelength band of light output from the ring resonator <b>305</b> be contained in the gain band of the semiconductor laser <b>306</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">An example in which the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus according to at least one of the embodiments is used in a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) apparatus is described.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram of a SS-OCT apparatus using the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus according to at least one of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the SS-OCT apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, light from a wavelength-tunable light source <b>601</b> (light source unit) is divided into sample light <b>604</b> to be guided to an object <b>603</b> through a coupler <b>602</b> and reference light <b>606</b> to be guided to a fixed mirror (reference mirror) <b>605</b>. After the division, the sample light <b>604</b> is guided to the object <b>603</b> through a collimator lens <b>607</b>, a scanning mirror <b>608</b>, and an objective lens <b>609</b>, thereby radiating the object <b>603</b> with the light.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Reflected light having information indicating the depth of the object <b>603</b> returns through an optical path that was used in reaching the object <b>603</b> to the coupler <b>602</b>. The objective lens <b>609</b>, scanning mirror <b>608</b>, and collimator lens <b>607</b> form an object measurement unit.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The reference light <b>606</b> passes through a collimator lens <b>610</b> and an objective lens <b>611</b> and is then reflected by the fixed mirror (reference mirror) <b>605</b>. The reflected light returns along an optical path that was used in reaching the reference mirror <b>605</b> to the coupler <b>602</b> (interference unit). The reference mirror <b>605</b>, objective lens <b>611</b>, and collimator lens <b>610</b> form a reference unit, and it is configured to transmit reflected light to the coupler (interference unit) <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The reference light <b>606</b> returned to the coupler <b>602</b> and the sample light (reflected light) <b>604</b> are guided to a photodiode (optical detection unit) <b>612</b> and generate an interference signal. A computing device (image processing unit) <b>613</b> rearranges the interference signal based on a light source scanning signal and performs signal processing centered on Fourier transform. In this way, a tomographic image in the depth direction is obtainable. That is, a tomographic image of an object is obtainable on the basis of interference light detected by the photodiode <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The use of the wavelength-tunable light source according to the embodiments enables an OCT signal employing light having good wavelength selectivity and can achieve accurately identifying a reflection position of the object <b>603</b> in the depth direction.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Degradation in image caused by fluctuation in oscillation wavelength of the light source in obtainment of a tomographic image in the depth direction by the SS-OCT apparatus is reduced, and a good-quality image having a good signal-to-noise ratio is obtainable.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The reasons why the SS-OCT apparatus according to the present embodiment can provide a good-quality image are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the inside of the object <b>603</b> has a layered structure of x<b>1</b> to xn. When the sample light <b>604</b> and the reference light <b>606</b> are combined by the coupler <b>602</b>, interference signals corresponding to the optical path length differences L<b>1</b> to Ln associated with x<b>1</b> to xn of the object <b>603</b> are generated with respect to the reference mirror <b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The light combined by the coupler <b>602</b> is received by the photodiode <b>612</b>. When this light is observed by an oscilloscope, an interference waveform illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is obtained. The optical path length difference L is calculated by performing Fourier transform on this waveform, and x<b>1</b> to xn being the reflected positions within the object <b>603</b> are identified. In this way, the SS-OCT apparatus obtains a tomographic image in the depth direction.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Here, whether the interference waveform is a peak or valley corresponds to whether the interference condition is that the optical path length difference L is strengthen or that it is weakened with respect to the pulse central wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">That is, fluctuation in central wavelength in sweeping the wavelength of the light source corresponds to fluctuation in interference waveform illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As a result, the S/N ratio in Fourier transform is degraded, and the S/N ratio for a tomographic image obtained by the SS-OCT apparatus is also degraded. Accordingly, the use of the wavelength-tunable light source apparatus having good wavelength selectivity in the SS-OCT apparatus enables the obtainment of a good-quality image having a good S/N ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The wavelength-tunable light source apparatus according to the embodiments can be applied in fields in which a wavelength-tunable light source apparatus can be used, such as the communication network field and the field for testing apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-005182 filed Jan. 13, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
