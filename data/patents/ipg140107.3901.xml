<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods and systems for imaging-while-drilling and look-ahead imaging of a geological formation using a borehole devices measuring multi-component vector and/or tensor logging data. An electromagnetic field transmitter generates an electromagnetic field. Electromagnetic receivers measure the response from the geological formation around the borehole and ahead of the device at various receiving positions. A central processing unit may compute a migration field by simulating the replacement of the receivers with conceptual transmitters, calculate an integrated sensitivity of the recorded electromagnetic field data, compute a reference field, and calculate a cross power spectra of the reference and the migration fields or cross correlation functions between the reference and the migration fields. A spatial weighting of the cross power spectra or cross correlation functions produces a numerical reconstruction of directional images and look-ahead images of the conductivity distribution around the borehole and/or ahead of the device located within the borehole.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. The Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The embodiments disclosed herein relate to electromagnetic imaging of geological formation. In general, the embodiments disclosed herein relate to formation evaluation, imaging-while-drilling and look-ahead imaging using borehole devices measuring multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic logging data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. The Relevant Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A multi-component induction logging tool was originally introduced for resolving anisotropic geological formations (e.g. as described by Fanini, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,677,756 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,900,640; and by Kriegshauser et al. (Improved shale sand interpretation in highly deviated and horizontal wells using multi-component induction log data: 42st Annual Logging Symposium, SPWLA, Transactions, paper S and An efficient and accurate pseudo 2-D inversion scheme for multi component induction log data: 71st Annual International Meeting, SEG, Expanded Abstracts, 376380). This instrument has three mutually perpendicular magnetic induction receiver coils and three magnetic induction transmitter coils.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The foundations of tensor induction well logging (TIWL) in anisotropic geological formations were outlined in papers by Zhdanov et al. (Foundations of tensor induction well-logging: Petrophysics, 42, 588-610 and Principles of tensor induction well logging in a deviated well in an anisotropic medium: Transactions, 42-nd SPWLA Annual Logging Symposium, Houston, paper R).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It was demonstrated by Zhdanov in U.S. Pat. No. 6,253,100 that the methods of optical and radio holography can be extended to a broad band electromagnetic (EM) field for imaging objects in nontransparent media by a system of electric and/or magnetic transmitters and receivers placed at different positions around the object.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The embodiments disclosed herein provide a method of formation evaluation, imaging-while-drilling and look-ahead imaging of a geological formation using borehole devices measuring multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic data. An induction and/or galvanic electromagnetic field transmitters located in the borehole may generate a frequency domain or a time domain electromagnetic field. Multi-component electric or/or magnetic field receivers may measure the response from the geological formation around the borehole and/or ahead of the device at various receiving positions in the borehole. A central processing unit may collect the recorded electromagnetic field data and compute a migration field by simulating the replacement of the receivers with an array of induction and/or galvanic transmitters, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The central processing unit may then calculate an integrated sensitivity of the recorded electromagnetic field data to conductivity perturbations at a specific local area of the examined geological formation around and/or ahead of the device. The central processing unit may also compute a reference field as an electromagnetic field generated by the induction and/or galvanic transmitters in the background medium consisting of the examined geological formation without the presence of an anomalous target and calculates a cross power spectra of the reference and migration fields or cross correlation functions between the reference and migration fields in the area around the borehole and/or ahead of the device. A spatial weighting of the cross power spectra or cross correlation functions produces a numerical reconstruction of directional images and look-ahead images of the conductivity distribution around the borehole and/or ahead of the device located within the borehole.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The embodiments disclosed herein relate in general to formation evaluation and imaging-while-drilling using borehole devices measuring multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic data. The embodiments disclosed herein can be applied for directional images to identify fracture zones and hydrocarbon reservoir locations, to provide look ahead images for early warning of approaching formation boundaries, and for adjusting borehole position and orientation (inclination and azimuth angles) during drilling operation to reach one or more specific geological formations. Of course, it will be appreciated that the embodiments disclosed herein may be applied to other applications as well such as tunnel and underground facility detection.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, a multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic well-logging instrument may be put in a borehole either by wireline or by mounting direct to a mandrill. The instrument may provide electromagnetic transmitters and receivers suitable for transmitting and receiving electric and/or magnetic fields in different directions parallel and orthogonal to the axis of the borehole. The transmitters may generate a frequency domain or time domain electromagnetic field which propagates through a geological formation, including fracture zones, hydrocarbon reservoirs, water reservoirs, or approaching formation boundaries, and is recorded by the receivers. The receivers may be either for electric fields and/or for magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The measured electromagnetic field components in the receiver locations may be used as conceptual sources (transmitters) of electromagnetic field data, as each source has an electric and/or magnetic moment that replicate the actually measured electric and/or magnetic field component. These conceptual sources (transmitters) may produce a migration electromagnetic field {E<sup>m</sup>, H<sup>m</sup>}. A reference field or background field {E<sup>b</sup>, H<sup>b</sup>}, representative of a background medium consisting of an examined geologic formation without the presence of anomalous targets, may be calculated using Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An integrated sensitivity of the multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic logging instrument may be obtained by estimating a least square norm of values of perturbations of at least one component of the measured electromagnetic field data due to a conductivity perturbation at a specific local area of the examined geologic formation. A migration image of the resistivity distribution around and/or ahead of the well-logging instrument may then be reconstructed by spatially weighting a cross power spectra of the reference and the migration fields or cross correlation functions between the reference and the migration fields in the area around the borehole and/or ahead of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The embodiments disclosed herein are well suited for logging-while-drilling (LWD) and/or measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and/or imaging-while-drilling, and/or look-ahead applications which require a imaging of geological formations from a borehole around and ahead of the borehole. The embodiments disclosed herein may also be applied for wireline or mandrill-mounted applications. The desired images, such as the three-dimensional resistivity distribution of the target are readily derived from the multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic logging data. The measured electric and/or magnetic field components in the receiver locations are used as the electric and/or magnetic moments of the conceptual electric and/or magnetic transmitters to generate numerically the migration field. A spatial weighting of the cross spectrum or correlation function between the migration and reference fields by an integrated sensitivity produces a numerical reconstruction of a volume image of resistivity distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Attention is now given to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates an embodiment of imaging-while-drilling and look-ahead imaging of geological formation using borehole devices. The imaging system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be comprised of three mutually orthogonal transmitter coils <b>1</b> and one or more similar sets of receiver coils <b>2</b> located at some distance from the transmitting set of coils <b>1</b>. The array of transmitters and receivers may either consist of one transmitter set and one receiver set (as shown) or of multiple transmitter sets and multiple receiver sets. The imaging system is located in the borehole, which may be drilled along the different trajectories <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, or <b>5</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the borehole trajectories <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> are approaching a target and may enter the main reservoir <b>6</b> from the overlying shale layer <b>7</b> and go along the reservoir layer as shown by trajectory <b>4</b>, or instead of staying in the main reservoir, they may continue into the poor sand <b>8</b> as shown by trajectory <b>3</b>, or even never cross the main reservoir as shown by trajectory <b>5</b>. Accordingly, the embodiments disclosed herein introduce an imaging method which allows the operator to navigate the borehole into the main reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The transmitters <b>1</b> may generate a harmonic (frequency domain) or a pulse (time domain) primary electromagnetic field which may propagate through the medium containing the geologic deposit. The receivers <b>2</b> may receive an electromagnetic field that has been scattered by the geological formation. The central processing unit <b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may then collect the recorded amplitudes and/or phases of the electromagnetic field that has been scattered by the geological formation and may operate the migration imaging system, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The desired properties of the geologic formation, such as conductivity or resistivity distribution, may then be derived from this image. The central processing unit <b>9</b> may be located in the borehole electromagnetic device and the images transmitted to the operator, or may be located with the operator to where electromagnetic data are transmitted from the borehole electromagnetic device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an example embodiment of the processor <b>9</b>, which in this embodiment may be a computing system that is able to perform various operations for producing a migration image in accordance with the principles of the embodiments disclosed herein. As shown, processor <b>9</b> receives measured electromagnetic data <b>110</b> from at least one of the receivers <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The processor <b>9</b> may then conceptually replace the at least one receiver <b>2</b> with an array of one or more conceptual sources <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, and <b>25</b><i>c </i>(also referred to herein as conceptual sources <b>25</b>) of an electric or magnetic component located in the positions of the receiver <b>3</b>. The ellipses <b>25</b><i>d </i>represent that there may be any number of additional conceptual sources <b>25</b> depending on the number of receivers <b>2</b>. The conceptual sources <b>25</b> replicate the actually measured electric or magnetic field of the receivers <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processor <b>9</b> may then obtain and/or compute migration electromagnetic fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>(also referred to herein as migration electromagnetic fields <b>20</b>) and potentially any number of additional back-propagating (migration) fields as illustrated by the ellipses <b>20</b><i>d</i>. The migration electromagnetic fields may be equivalent migration electromagnetic fields produced by the conceptual sources <b>25</b>. The processor <b>9</b> may also obtain and/or compute reference field <b>21</b> representative of a background medium consisting of an examined geologic formation without the presence of an anomalous target.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other words, the measured electric and/or magnetic field components in the receiver locations (amplitudes and phases in the frequency domain or amplitude in time domain) are used as the electric and/or magnetic moments of one or more conceptual transmitters that may replace the actual receivers in order to numerically generate the migration electromagnetic field. The central processing unit <b>9</b> calculates the reference electromagnetic field <b>21</b> representative of a background medium consisting of the examined geologic formation without the presence of the anomalous target.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the processor <b>9</b> includes a sensitivity module <b>30</b>. The sensitivity module <b>30</b> may obtain and/or compute an integrated sensitivity <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, <b>35</b><i>c </i>of the sensors <b>1</b> and/or <b>2</b>. In one embodiment, the sensitivity module <b>30</b> estimates a least square norm of values of perturbations of the measured electromagnetic tensor data at the locations of the receivers <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A generation module <b>40</b> of the processor <b>9</b> may then generate and/or produce a migration image <b>45</b><i>a </i>by calculating a cross power spectra of the reference fields <b>21</b> and the migration electromagnetic fields <b>20</b> and spatially weighting cross power spectra with the integrated sensitivity <b>35</b>. The processor <b>9</b> may then determine the location, shape, and electrical conductivity of an anomalous target within the geologic formation around the borehole and/or ahead of the device in a wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other words, the central processing unit <b>9</b> may also calculate an integrated sensitivity of the imaging system (e.g., the multi-component vector and/or tensor electromagnetic logging instrument) to conductivity perturbations at different local areas of the examined geologic formation. A vector cross power spectrum of the reference and migration EM fields or a cross correlation function between the reference and migration EM fields weighted with the integrated sensitivity may produce a numerical reconstruction of a volume image of conductivity or resistivity distribution around the borehole and ahead of the device in the borehole. An imaging apparatus applied according to the embodiments disclosed herein has relatively simple software for imaging-while-drilling and is also able to perform in real time as well as post-measurement.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electromagnetic field is recorded by receivers <b>2</b> that have been placed in the borehole at some distance from transmitters <b>1</b>. The CPU system <b>9</b> analyzes the recorded field and fulfills the following numerical processes:</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(1) It numerically simulates a system of conceptual transmitters located in the positions of the receivers with the moments, determined by formula (2).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(2) It computes the migration fields, {E<sup>m</sup>, H<sup>m</sup>}, generated by the conceptual transmitters located in the positions of the receivers.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(3) It computes the integrated sensitivity of the data acquisition system to the conductivity variations.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">(4) It constructs the volume images of conductivity and/or resistivity distribution by calculating a spatial distribution of cross correlation function between the reference and the migration fields weighted with the integrated sensitivity.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a practical example of LWD electromagnetic migration imaging, the same geoelectrical model of the rock formation penetrated by a borehole <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is considered. It is assumed that the background resistivity of the formation <b>13</b> penetrated by a borehole is 1 Ohm-m, the resistivity of the main reservoir <b>14</b> is 100 Ohm-m, and the resistivity of the underlying layer <b>15</b> is 1 Ohm-m. The main reservoir <b>14</b> has a thickness of 10 m. The induction logging device comprising the three mutually orthogonal transmitter coils <b>11</b> and three mutually orthogonal receiver coils <b>12</b> detects the time domain responses of the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the first case, the borehole is approaching the main reservoir layer vertically as shown by line <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows (shown by cross <b>51</b>) the location of the tensor induction well-logging instrument. It may be observed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the migration conductivity distribution ahead of the borehole for different distances of 14 m, 10 m, and 7 m from the induction logging device to the main reservoir, respectively (see panels a, b, and c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). One can see that the resistive target layer associated with the main reservoir <b>14</b> can be clearly detected by the time domain EM migration imaging ahead of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the second case, a deviated borehole is approaching the main reservoir layer at a degree of 45&#xb0; as shown by line <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The different panels in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> (a, b, and c) show the migration images for a device located at different distances from the main reservoir of 7 m, 6 m, and 5 m, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> corresponds to the case when the borehole is deviated at a degree of 10&#xb0;. Panels a and b in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> present the migration images for a device located at 4 m and 3 m from the approaching reservoir, respectively. It is obvious that the set of images shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref> provide the necessary imaging-while-drilling capability in order to navigate the borehole inside the main reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An embodiment of a method <b>200</b> for imaging an object is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and will be explained with reference to the imaging system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the method <b>200</b>, and other methods and processes described herein, set forth various functional blocks or actions that may be described as processing steps, functional operations, events and/or acts, etc., which may be performed by hardware, software, and/or firmware.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The method <b>200</b> includes an act <b>201</b> of placing an electromagnetic logging device including one or more transmitters and one or more receivers in a borehole and generating frequency domain or time domain electromagnetic field. For example, the transmitters <b>1</b> and sensors <b>2</b> may be placed in the borehole and may be used to generate and measure the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The method <b>200</b> also includes an act <b>202</b> of replacing the at least one receiver with at least one conceptual source. For example, the processor <b>9</b> may conceptually replace the receiver <b>2</b> with the conceptual sources <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>25</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The method <b>200</b> further includes an act <b>203</b> of obtaining a migration electromagnetic field. For example, the processor <b>9</b> may calculate one or more migration electromagnetic fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c</i>. The migration electromagnetic fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>c </i>may be equivalent to back-propagating (migration) fields produced by the conceptual sources <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The method <b>200</b> also includes an act <b>204</b> of calculating a reference electromagnetic field representative of a background medium. For instance, the processor <b>9</b> may calculate the reference electromagnetic field <b>21</b> of the background field.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The method <b>200</b> also includes an act <b>205</b> of obtaining an integrated sensitivity of the electromagnetic logging device including one or more transmitters and one or more receivers. For instance, the processor <b>9</b> may calculate an integrated sensitivity <b>35</b> of the electromagnetic logging device including one or more transmitters <b>1</b> and one or more receivers <b>2</b>. In one embodiment, an estimate is made of a least square norm of values of perturbations of the measured data <b>10</b> at various locations in the geologic formation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The method <b>200</b> further includes an act <b>206</b> of producing a migration image of the object in the examined medium. For example, the processor <b>9</b> may generate or produce a migration image <b>45</b><i>a </i>by generating a power spectra of the fields <b>20</b> and the field <b>21</b> or cross correlation of the fields <b>20</b> and the field <b>21</b> and spatially weighting the power spectra or cross correlation with the integrated sensitivity <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The various illustrative logical blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both. To clearly illustrate this interchangeability of hardware and software, various illustrative components, blocks, modules, circuits, and steps have been described above generally in terms of their functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Skilled artisans may implement the described functionality in varying ways for each particular application, but such implementation decisions should not be interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Embodiments of the present invention may comprise or utilize a special purpose or general-purpose computer including computer hardware, as discussed in greater detail below. Embodiments within the scope of the present invention also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and/or data structures. Such computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions are physical non-transitory storage media. Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the invention can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: physical non-transitory storage media and transmission media.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Physical non-transitory storage media includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network and/or data links which can be used to carry or desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to physical storage media (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RAM and/or to less volatile physical storage media at a computer system. Thus, it should be understood that physical storage media can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. The computer executable instructions may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the described features or acts described above. Rather, the described features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including, personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, message processors, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, mobile telephones, PDAs, pagers, routers, switches, and the like. The invention may also be practiced in distributed system environments where local and remote computer systems, which are linked (either by hardwired data links, wireless data links, or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links) through a network, both perform tasks. In a distributed system environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope.</p>
