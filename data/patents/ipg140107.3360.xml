<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wind power converting apparatus that includes a rotor unit. The rotor unit includes a rotary blade assembly and a cover. The rotary blade assembly has a rotary blade disposed in the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft, and is rotated by the wind from the outside. The cover blocks a headwind, which blows opposite to the direction in which the rotary blade assembly is rotated, from being introduced to the rotary blade assembly. According to the wind power converting apparatus, the operating efficiency of the wind power converting apparatus is increased, power generation is possible even in light wind, and a plurality of generators can be connected together.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, wind power converting apparatuses of the related art are limited in the extent to which the generation efficiency thereof can be improved, in consideration of their structures. Therefore, it is demanded that the structure of wind power converting apparatuses be improved in order to increase the generation efficiency thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a wind power converting apparatus, which is configured such that its operating efficiency can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the present invention provides a wind power converting apparatus that includes a rotor unit. The rotor unit includes a rotary blade assembly having a rotary blade disposed in the longitudinal direction of the rotary shaft, the rotary blade assembly being rotated by the wind from the outside; and a cover, the cover blocking a headwind, which blows opposite to the direction in which the rotary blade assembly is rotated, from being introduced to the rotary blade assembly.</p>
