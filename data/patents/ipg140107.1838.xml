<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments include a system for manipulating a portion of the spine. A support body provides support for extender sleeves that are coupled to bone screws implanted in bone. The extender sleeves are coupled to the support body in a manner that allows translation and rotation of the extender sleeves relative to the support body. Movement and rotation of the extender sleeves in selected directions can be allowed while movement and rotation in other directions can be inhibited. The extender sleeves can be manipulated to move the bone.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to surgical tools and in particular to an external support with multiple components that may be controlled individually to manipulate the spine during spinal surgery.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The human spine consists of segments known as vertebrae linked by intervertebral disks and held together by ligaments. There are 24 movable vertebrae&#x2014;7 cervical (neck) vertebrae, 12 thoracic (chest) vertebrae, and 5 lumbar (back) vertebrae. Each vertebra has a somewhat cylindrical bony body (centrum), a number of winglike projections (processes), and a bony arch. The arches are positioned so that the space they enclose forms the vertebral canal. The vertebral canal houses and protects the spinal cord, and within it the spinal fluid circulates. Ligaments and muscles are attached to various projections of the vertebrae. The bodies of the vertebrae form the supporting column of the skeleton. Fused vertebra make up the sacrum and coccyx, the very bottom of the vertebral column.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The spine is subject to abnormal curvature, injury, infections, tumor formation, arthritic disorders, and puncture or slippage of the cartilage disks. Modern spine surgery often involves the use of spinal stabilization/fixation procedures such as a vertebral body fusion procedure to correct or treat various acute or chronic spine disorders and/or to support the spine. In conjunction with these procedures, some spinal implants may be utilized to help stabilize the spine, correct deformities of the spine such as spondylolisthesis or pseudoarthrosis, facilitate fusion, or treat spinal fractures. Some spinal fixation systems may provide fused and/or rigid support for the affected regions of the spine. For example, a spinal fixation system may include a corrective spinal implant that is attached to selected vertebrae of the spine by screws, hooks, and clamps. The corrective spinal implant may include spinal rods or plates that are generally parallel to the patient's back. The corrective spinal implant may also include transverse connecting rods that extend between neighboring spinal rods. Spinal fixation systems can be used to correct problems in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar portions of the spine, and are often installed posterior to the spine on opposite sides of the spinous process and adjacent to the transverse process. Spinal fixation systems when implanted inhibit movement in the affected regions in virtually all directions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">More recently, so called &#x201c;dynamic&#x201d; systems have been introduced. Dynamic spinal stabilization systems can better match a patient's anatomy than some spinal stabilization systems used to provide static support. When implanted in a patient, a dynamic spinal stabilization system can allow at least some movement (e.g., flexion, extension, lateral bending, or torsional rotation) of the affected regions of the spine in at least some of the directions, giving the patient a greater range of motion. Dynamic stabilization systems can be used in scenarios in which vertebral body fusion is not desired, in which vertebral body (re)alignment is desired, and in which it is desired to support or strengthen degraded, diseased, damaged, or otherwise weakened portions of the spine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often, spinal stabilization systems include rods which can bear a portion of the forces that would otherwise be transmitted along the spine. These rods may be implanted in pairs or in other numbers along portions of the spine of interest. Some spinal stabilization systems may support a portion of the spine including only two vertebrae (and associated anatomical structures) while some spinal stabilization systems support portions of the spine extending beyond two vertebrae. Spinal stabilizations systems can be used to support various portions of the spine, including the lumbar portion of the spine and the thoracic portion of the spine. Regardless of the number of rods implanted, or the portion of the spine in which they may be implanted, the rods can be attached to one or more vertebrae of the spine to provide support and stabilize, align, or otherwise treat the region of the spine of interest. Surgical personnel may use one or more anchor systems to attach the rods to one or more vertebrae. One such anchor system includes pedicle screws constructs which define slots, keyways, grooves, apertures, or other features for accepting and retaining stabilization rods which may be static, dynamic, or a combination of both. In many pedicle screw constructs, pedicle screws are placed in vertebrae selected by surgical personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Severe conditions such as scoliosis, burst fractures and other deformities often require manipulation of the vertebrae. In some surgical systems, translation (compression or distraction) of vertebral bodies is possible only if the rod is already placed and one of the vertebral bodies has been provisionally locked to the rod. Once the manipulation has been completed, the second vertebral body must be locked to the rod or movement will not be fixed. If a second type of manipulation (i.e., angular rotation) is required, the implants must be unlocked to allow the manipulation, which can result in the original movement being undone.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of a surgical instrument support system described herein do not require a spinal stabilization rod to be installed until after the movement has been completed. Advantageously, consecutive movements may be performed and held in place by various components, enabling percutaneous and minimally invasive surgery techniques to be used to correct increasingly complex deformities or treat trauma.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, a system for positioning components in a surgical procedure is provided. The system can include a support body to support extender sleeves that are used to manipulate the vertebrae. A support body collar is mounted to the support body and can translate along the support body. A linkage is coupled to the support body collar and can translate perpendicular (or other selected angle) to the support body collar. A sleeve collar is connected to the linkage by a connection that allows polyaxial rotation of the sleeve collar. The sleeve collar is sized to receive an extender sleeve and allow translation of the extender sleeve in the sleeve collar. Through movement of the various components, the sleeve can be placed in a desired location and orientation relative to a patient's body. Locking mechanisms can be used to selectively inhibit motion of the support body collar relative to the support body, the linkage relative to the support body collar, the sleeve collar relative to the linkage and the sleeve relative to the sleeve collar. For various steps in a surgical procedure, the surgeon can configure the system to allow only motion in selected directions while preventing undesired motion. Motion of an extender sleeve can be allowed or inhibited for each procedural step as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment, a method for treating spinal injuries can comprise providing a rigid support body coupled to a set of extender sleeves. The support body provides support for the extender sleeves outside of a human body and the extender sleeves can translate and rotate relative the support body. The method can further comprise determining a desired longitudinal position and orientation of each of the set of extender sleeves and locking each of the set of extender sleeves in the desired longitudinal position and orientation. The method can further comprise advancing a set of bone anchors into vertebrae using the extender sleeves. The method can further comprise allowing selected translation and rotation of each extender sleeve relative to the support body while continuing to inhibit other translation and rotation relative to the support body. The extender sleeves can be manipulated to move selected vertebrae. The position and orientation of each of the set of extender sleeves can be locked when the selected vertebrae are in desired positions</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of a surgical instrument support system may be beneficial in the treatment or correction of a spine having a deformity. The surgical instrument support system may be attached to the affected spine and one or more vertebrae may be moved individually or as a unit to correct the curvature of the spine, ensure proper positioning of vertebrae, or perform other translational or rotational adjustments until the spine has the correct curvature and alignment.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A spinal stabilization system may be installed in a patient to stabilize a portion of a spine. Spinal stabilization systems are often installed in patients having degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, pseudoarthrosis, and/or spinal deformities; patients having fracture or other vertebral trauma; and patients having undergone tumor resection. A spinal stabilization system may be installed using a minimally invasive procedure. An instrumentation set may include instruments and spinal stabilization system components for forming a spinal stabilization system in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A minimally invasive procedure may be used to limit an amount of trauma to soft tissue surrounding vertebrae that are to be stabilized. In some embodiments, the natural flexibility of skin and soft tissue may be used to limit the length and/or depth of an incision or incisions needed during the stabilization procedure. Minimally invasive procedures may provide limited direct visibility in vivo. Forming a spinal stabilization system using a minimally invasive procedure may include using tools to position system components in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments described in this disclosure provide systems and methods for using a surgical instrument support to position tools during a spinal stabilization procedure. In particular, embodiments of a surgical instrument support system can be positioned over a patient to hold tools in a manner that allows the tools to be used to correct the alignment of a deformed spinal column, repair damaged portions of the spine, and stabilize the spine. The surgical instrument support can be rigidly attached to a table or other surgical platform and tools may be coupled to the body of the surgical instrument support. The tools can be coupled to the support body in manner that allows a surgeon to move the tools along the surgical instrument support and lock the tools in desired positions and orientations. In some cases, the surgeon can lock the tools with respect to motion in one or more directions while allowing the tool to move in other directions during surgery. The surgeon can manipulate the supported tools to reposition the vertebrae during procedures to treat deformities or trauma.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a diagrammatic representation of system <b>100</b> usable to adjust the alignment of a spinal column, provide access to damaged or degenerative vertebrae, discs or other spine components and stabilize the spine. System <b>100</b> may include a support body <b>10</b>, crossbar <b>15</b>, support body collar <b>20</b>, linkage <b>30</b> and sleeve collar <b>40</b>. Support body <b>10</b> can be used to support one or more extender sleeves <b>50</b>. An extender sleeve <b>50</b> is a sleeve that can detachably couple to a bone anchor <b>60</b> and provide a working passage from the surface of the patient's body to bone anchor <b>60</b> so that tools, closure tops or other components can be guided to the bone anchor. Example extender sleeves include, but are not limited to, extender sleeves for the PATHFINDER Pedicle Screw System by ZIMMER SPINE of Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Support body <b>10</b> can be formed as a single piece, or can be formed having members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>joined by connectors <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In one embodiment, members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>can be coupled together in a manner that allows the width of support body <b>10</b> to be adjusted. By way of example, but not limitation, members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>can slide relative to each other. Support body <b>10</b> may include markings <b>11</b>, which may be useful for a surgeon to determine a characteristic of the spine, such as the separation between adjacent vertebrae during a distraction procedure. Support body <b>10</b> may have a curvature generally parallel to the curvature of a spine or a desired curvature of the spine, can be straight or have other desired shape. Support body <b>10</b> may be sized for positioning over a single vertebra or a small incision such as found in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), or may be sized for procedures involving multiple MIS incisions or vertebrae.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">System <b>100</b> can include body collars <b>20</b> for translation of components relative to support body <b>10</b>. Support body collar <b>20</b> can be translated along support body <b>10</b> parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spine so that sleeve <b>50</b> can be placed at the appropriate vertebra. In one embodiment, support body collar <b>20</b> can also be rotated relative to support body <b>10</b>. According to one embodiment, support body <b>10</b> may have a generally circular outer cross-sectional profile and support body collars <b>20</b> may have a generally circular inner cross-sectional profile to allow rotation of support body collars <b>20</b> relative to support body <b>10</b> about an axis. Assuming support body <b>10</b> is oriented so that the long portions of members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spine, the axis of rotation of collars <b>20</b> will also be parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spine. In another embodiment, the outer surface of support body <b>10</b> and inner surface of support body collars <b>20</b> may have complementary angular cross-sections to prevent rotation of support body collars <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Support body collars <b>20</b> may include a support body collar locking mechanism to inhibit translational or rotational movement of support body collar <b>20</b> relative to support instrument support <b>10</b>. A locking mechanism on support body collar <b>20</b> may directly engage support instrument support <b>10</b> to inhibit movement. For example, the locking mechanism can include a ball or pin in collar <b>20</b> that rests in complementary holes/detents in support body <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, the locking mechanism can include a set screw that advances in support body collar <b>20</b> to bias support body <b>10</b> against support body collar <b>20</b>. According to one embodiment, for example, a surgeon can turn knob <b>46</b> to easily advance the set screw. In other embodiments a squeeze connection other friction fit can be used. In yet other embodiments, other mechanisms known in the art can act to prevent translation and/or rotation of collar <b>20</b> relative to support body <b>10</b>. A single locking mechanism or separate locking mechanisms can be used to prevent translation and rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">System <b>100</b> may further include crossbar <b>15</b> having a length for spanning the width of support instrument support <b>10</b>. According to one embodiment, crossbar <b>15</b> can translate relative to support body collar <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, a mechanism used to allow or inhibit movement of crossbar <b>15</b> relative to support body collar <b>20</b> includes crossbar set screw <b>16</b>. Advancement of crossbar set screw <b>16</b> in support body collar <b>20</b> may bias support body collar <b>20</b> or support instrument support <b>10</b> against crossbar <b>15</b> to generate a friction force large enough to inhibit movement of crossbar <b>15</b> relative to support body collar <b>20</b>. Other embodiments can use other locking mechanism to inhibit movement of crossbar <b>15</b> relative to support body collar <b>20</b>. According to one embodiment, crossbar <b>15</b> can be coupled to support body collar <b>20</b> at each end to keep support body collars <b>20</b> on members <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>laterally aligned. Crossbar <b>15</b> may also be used to mount additional surgical tools.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">System <b>100</b> may further include linkage <b>30</b> slidably and rotatably connected to support body collar <b>20</b>. According to one embodiment, support body collar <b>20</b> can define a passage into which linkage <b>30</b> fits. Linkage <b>30</b> can translate laterally in the passage to adjust the distance of sleeve <b>50</b> from support instrument support <b>10</b>. Linkage <b>30</b> may be generally straight or may have a bend or curve. In addition to translating, linkage <b>30</b>, according to one embodiment, can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the spine. This rotation can orient the sleeve at an angle relative to the anteriorposterior axis of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A linkage locking mechanism can used to selectively inhibit translation and/or rotation of linkage <b>30</b>. One example of a mechanism used to allow or inhibit movement of linkage <b>30</b> relative to support body collar <b>20</b> is linkage set screw <b>36</b>. By advancing linkage set screw <b>36</b> into threads on support body collar <b>20</b>, linkage set screw <b>36</b> may contact linkage <b>30</b>. Additional advancement of linkage set screw <b>36</b> in support body collar <b>20</b> may bias linkage <b>30</b> against support body collar <b>20</b> to generate a friction force large enough to inhibit movement of linkage <b>30</b> relative to support body collar <b>20</b>. Other examples of locking mechanisms can include a ball or pin that rests in a complementary hole/detent in linkage <b>30</b>, a squeeze connection or other friction fit or other mechanism known in the art that can act to prevent translation and/or rotation of linkage <b>30</b>. A single locking mechanism or separate locking mechanisms can be used to prevent translation and rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An end of sleeve collar <b>44</b> can be coupled to linkage <b>30</b> at connection <b>34</b> in a manner that allows rotational movement between sleeve collar <b>40</b> and linkage <b>30</b>. In some embodiments, connection <b>34</b> between sleeve collar <b>40</b> and linkage <b>30</b> may provide polyaxial movement to allow the angle of sleeve <b>50</b> relative to anteriorposterior axis of the patient to be adjusted. One non-limiting example of such a connection is a ball and socket type joint. Second end <b>44</b> of sleeve collar <b>40</b> and second end <b>34</b> of linkage <b>30</b> may be locked using a sleeve collar locking mechanism to inhibit movement of sleeve collar <b>40</b> relative to linkage <b>30</b>. According to one embodiment, a set screw, indent/detent, a squeeze connection or other friction fit or other mechanism known in the art can be used to inhibit relative movement of sleeve collar <b>40</b> and linkage <b>30</b>. For example, set screw <b>46</b> can be advanced through the side of connection <b>46</b> to bias a ball in a ball and socket joint against the surface of the socket, thereby inhibiting movement of sleeve collar <b>44</b> relative to linkage <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Sleeve collar <b>40</b> can couple to extender sleeve <b>50</b>. Sleeve collar <b>40</b> can have an open passage <b>42</b> with an inner cross-sectional profile to allow sleeve <b>50</b> to translate in sleeve collar <b>40</b>. Passage <b>42</b> can also be shaped so that sleeve <b>50</b> can also rotate. When extender sleeve <b>50</b> is in a desired position, a sleeve locking mechanisms can securely couple sleeve <b>50</b> to inhibit translational and rotational movement of sleeve <b>50</b> relative to sleeve collar <b>40</b>. One example of a mechanism for inhibiting movement of sleeve collar relative to sleeve <b>50</b> is sleeve collar set screw <b>46</b>. By advancing sleeve collar set screw <b>46</b> into threads on sleeve collar <b>40</b>, sleeve collar set screw <b>46</b> may contact sleeve <b>50</b>. Additional advancement of sleeve collar set screw <b>46</b> in sleeve collar <b>40</b> may bias sleeve collar <b>40</b> against sleeve <b>50</b> to generate a friction force large enough to inhibit movement of sleeve <b>50</b> relative to sleeve collar <b>40</b>. In other embodiments, a screw can engage a hole in sleeve <b>50</b> to prevent translation, a ball or pin can engage a corresponding hole/detent to prevent movement, sleeve collar <b>40</b> can be tightened to hold sleeve <b>50</b> or other mechanism used to prevent translation and/or rotation of sleeve <b>50</b> relative to sleeve collar <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Sleeve <b>50</b> may couple to bone anchor <b>60</b> such that bone anchors <b>60</b> can be manipulated using sleeve <b>50</b>. Sleeve <b>50</b> may be coupled to bone anchor <b>60</b> before insertion of bone anchor <b>60</b> into the patient or may be coupled after bone anchor <b>60</b> has been advanced into a vertebra. Sleeve <b>50</b> can be used to guide tools and components of a spinal stabilization to the bone anchor <b>60</b> for installation of the spinal stabilization system. While only one sleeve is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, multiple sleeves <b>50</b> can be coupled to support body <b>10</b>. The sleeves <b>50</b> or other components can be manipulated as individuals or as a group.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As can be understood from the foregoing, sleeve <b>50</b> can be coupled to support body <b>10</b> so that sleeve <b>50</b> can be placed in an appropriate longitudinal and lateral position. Additionally, sleeve <b>50</b> can rotate about first axis (e.g., parallel to the longitudinal axis), a second axis (perpendicular to the longitudinal axis) and/or polyaxially to position sleeve <b>50</b> in a desired orientation relative to the anteriorposterior axis of the patient. This allows a surgeon to place sleeve <b>50</b> in a desired longitudinal and lateral position and orientation for a procedure and lock sleeve <b>50</b> in that position so that the surgeon's hands are free to manipulate other tools. In some cases the surgeon can unlock one or more degrees of movement of sleeve <b>50</b> so that the surgeon can manipulate sleeve <b>50</b> in a desired manner during a procedure while preventing movement in undesired directions.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Support body <b>10</b> can be helpful in spinal stabilization procedures that involve manipulating the vertebrae. One example of a spinal procedure in which a surgical instrument support may be helpful is in the treatment of a burst fracture. During repair of a burst fracture, the spine must be brought into proper alignment. This may involve multiple steps, such as the following: a first step in which adjacent vertebrae are rotated to correct for an abnormal spine curvature, a second step in which the affected vertebra is distracted, and a third step in which adjacent vertebrae are moved closer to the injured vertebra. Support body <b>10</b> provides a stable platform outside of the patient's body for manipulating extender sleeves <b>50</b> during such a procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> depict a portion of the spine undergoing correction for a burst fracture to vertebra T12. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> are discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> depicts a portion of the spine exhibiting an abnormal spine curvature because of a burst fracture. The distance D between the affected vertebra T12 and adjacent vertebrae T11 and L1 may or may not be affected. Fluoroscopic imaging or other medical imaging technique can be used to verify the position or angle of a vertebra, the separation or relative positioning between two or more vertebra and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once the injured vertebra has been identified, bone anchors can be placed in one or more vertebrae on either side of the fractured vertebra, such as T10-T11 and L1-L2 for this example. The bone anchors can be installed according to methods known or developed in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> depicts a side view of a portion of the spine with bone anchors <b>60</b> installed in the adjacent vertebra T10-T11 and L1-L2. Bone anchors <b>60</b> are installed using extender sleeves <b>50</b>. Bone anchors <b>60</b> and extender sleeves <b>50</b> may be advanced into the patient using minimally-invasive surgery (MIS) procedures or other procedures. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, multiple sleeves <b>50</b> can be inserted in the patient's body at the same time. A parallel row of sleeves may also be used so that there are two (or more) bone anchors are installed in each vertebra.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Support body <b>10</b> can be used to position and orient sleeves <b>50</b> during installation of anchors <b>60</b>. Images of the vertebra can be used to determine the correct position and angle of sleeves <b>50</b> relative to the patient's body. The surgeon can lock each sleeve <b>50</b> in a desired orientation and lateral/longitudinal position while allowing sleeve <b>50</b> to translate in sleeve collar <b>40</b> to account for the fact that the depth of sleeve <b>50</b> changes as it advances into the body. When a bone anchor <b>60</b> is in position, the surgeon can optionally lock all motion of the sleeve <b>50</b> relative to support instrument support <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To correct the curvature of the spine, the extender sleeves <b>50</b> on either side of the burst fracture can be rotated away from each other as indicated by the arrows. By way of example, the extender sleeves corresponding to vertebrae L1 and L2 can be rotated in a clockwise direction, while the extender sleeves corresponding to vertebrae T10 and T11 can be rotated in a counter clockwise direction. As each extender sleeve rotates it will move relative to support instrument support <b>10</b> in several ways. First, a portion of the sleeve will translate in a longitudinal direction relative to support body <b>10</b>. Second, the angle of each sleeve <b>50</b> will change. Third, the amount each sleeve extends beyond its respective sleeve collar <b>40</b> may change. In order to allow for such movement, the surgeon can configure system <b>100</b> to allow select degrees of motion for sleeves <b>50</b>. For example, the surgeon can unlock support body collars <b>20</b> associated with vertebrae T10-T11 and L1-L2 so that the support body collars can translate along support instrument support <b>10</b>, unlock the sleeves <b>50</b> so that they can translate in their sleeve collars, and unlock rotation of sleeve collars <b>40</b> relative to linkages <b>30</b> and/or linkages <b>30</b> relative to support body collars <b>20</b> to allow the orientation of sleeves <b>50</b> to change.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> depicts a view of the spine after the curvature has been corrected. In some cases, it may be desirable to change the distance D between adjacent vertebrae after curvature the curvature of the spine has been corrected. To move vertebrae T10-T11 and L1-L2 closer to T12, support body collars <b>20</b> can be disengaged from support instrument support <b>10</b> so that they are free to translate while movement and rotation in other directions is inhibited. Support body collars <b>20</b> may then be translated along support instrument support <b>10</b> in a desired direction (e.g., as indicated by the arrows). Markings <b>11</b> on support instrument support <b>10</b> can provide an indication of the distance support body collars <b>20</b> are to be moved. Once vertebrae T10-T11 and L1-L2 are positioned relative to T12, support body collars <b>20</b> may be locked to prevent additional translation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> depicts a view of the spine showing distraction of vertebra T12. A bone anchor <b>60</b> can be implanted in vertebrae T12 with an extender sleeve <b>50</b> coupled to it. The orientation and longitudinal/lateral position of the extender sleeve can be locked to prevent undesired movement. However, extender sleeve <b>50</b> can be free to translate in the corresponding sleeve collar <b>40</b> so that the surgeon can pull extender sleeve <b>50</b> to move vertebrae T12. When vertebrae T12 is in a desired position, the position of extender sleeve <b>50</b> relative to sleeve collar <b>40</b> can be locked.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> depicts a view of the spine after angulation and translation of vertebrae in the spine. Rod <b>80</b> may be inserted in bone screws <b>60</b> to lock the spine in place. In some cases, the spinal stabilization rod <b>80</b> can also be coupled to vertebra T12. Spinal stabilization rod <b>80</b> can be a rigid stabilization rod or can be a dynamic stabilization rod having portions with various degrees of flexibility. Spinal stabilization rod <b>80</b> can be installed using any suitable procedure known or developed in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition to use in treatment of burst fractures, surgical instrument support <b>10</b> can be used in any number of procedures in which extender sleeves are used. Multiple surgical instrument supports may be used as needed or desired. Components of system <b>100</b> can be formed any suitable material(s) including, but not limited to, titanium, titanium alloys, stainless steel, ceramics, and/or polymers. Some components of a spinal stabilization system may be autoclaved and/or chemically sterilized. Components that may not be autoclaved and/or chemically sterilized may be made of sterile materials. Components made of sterile materials may be placed in working relation to other sterile components.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a posterior view of a portion of a spine, showing an abnormal curvature such as scoliosis. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a spine may have an associated curvature C away from a desired alignment N, and may also be twisted such that the spinous processes have an additional element T. In this type of situation, support body <b>10</b> can be used to aid in adjusting vertebrae individually or in groups to correct the curvature. For example, in some embodiments, vertebra T8 may be individually rotated into alignment with vertebrae T7 and T9, vertebrae T7-T9 may be rotated as a group into alignment with vertebrae T6 and T10, and so forth. In some embodiments, vertebra T4-T12 may be rotated as a group until vertebrae T4 and T12 are in alignment with vertebrae T3 and L1, vertebrae T5-T11 may be further rotated until vertebrae T5 and T11 are in alignment with T4 and T12, and so forth. In some embodiments, a first surgical instrument support is used in adjusting vertebrae T3-T8 and a second surgical instrument support is used in adjusting vertebrae T9-L1. An advantage to translating and rotating vertebrae as a group may be the distribution of forces, which may reduce the likelihood of injuring the patient during surgery.</p>
