<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an LED having vertical topology, and more particularly, to an LED having vertical topology that is capable of achieving high luminous efficiency and reliability thereof, and is also capable of improving mass productivity, and a method of making the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) are well-known semiconductor light-emitting devices that convert electric current into light. They have been used as light sources for display image of electronic equipment including information communication equipment, since the commercialization of red LEDs using GaAsP semiconductors in 1962, and in conjunction with green GaP:N LEDs that became commercialized thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The wavelength of light emitted by such LEDs is dependent upon the kinds of the semiconductor materials that are used to manufacture of the LEDs. This is because the wavelength of emitted light is dependent upon the band-gap of the semiconductor materials that represent an energy difference between valence-band electrons and conduction band electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Gallium nitride (GaN) has a high thermal stability and a broad band gap (ranging from 0.8 to 6.2 eV), and therefore has received a great deal of attention in the development of high-power output electronic component devices and LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In LEDs, another reason why gallium nitride has attracted a great deal of interest is because it is possible to fabricate semiconductor layers emitting green, blue and white light, by using GaN in combination with other elements such as indium (In), aluminum (Al) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Due to the capability of controlling an emission wavelength via the use of GaN, the emission wavelength may be adjusted based on the intrinsic properties of the materials used to comply with the characteristics of specific equipment. For example, the use of GaN makes it possible to manufacture blue LEDs, which are beneficial for optical writing, and white LEDs, which are capable of replacing incandescent lamps.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Due to various advantages of such GaN-based materials, the GaN-based LED market is rapidly growing. As a result, technologies of GaN-based optoelectronic devices have been rapidly advancing since its commercial introduction in 1994.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As such, the fabrication technology of LEDs utilizing Group III/V nitride semiconductor materials has achieved rapid development since the mid 1990's. In particular, owing to further advanced understanding of the growth methods and structures of the nitride semiconductor materials, significant improvements have been achieved in LED's characteristics such as brightness, output, driving voltage, and electrostatic properties, as well as reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Despite the rapid advancement in technologies of GaN-based semiconductor devices, the fabrication of GaN-based devices suffers from a great disadvantage in terms of high-production costs. This disadvantage is closely related to difficulties associated with growing GaN epitaxial layers and subsequent cutting of finished GaN-based devices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The GaN-based devices are generally fabricated on a sapphire substrate. This is because the sapphire substrate is commercially available in a size suited for the mass production of the GaN-based devices, supports a relatively high quality GaN epitaxial growth, and exhibits high processability in a wide range of temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, the sapphire substrate is chemically and thermally stable, and has a high-melting point, thus making it possible to perform a high-temperature manufacturing process, and has a high binding energy (122.4 Kcal/mole) as well as a high dielectric constant. In terms of its chemical structure, sapphire is crystalline aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Meanwhile, because sapphire is an insulating material, the use of sapphire substrate (or any other insulating substrate) practically limits the LED device using the insulating substrate to a lateral structure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the lateral structure, all metal contacts used in injecting electric current into the LED are positioned on the top surface of the device structure (or on the same plane as the substrate).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, as an available fabrication process of the LED device, a flip chip bonding method is widely employed that involves fabrication of an LED chip and reverse attachment of the resulting chip to a sub-mount such as a silicon wafer or ceramic substrate having excellent thermal conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, the LED having the lateral structure or the LED fabricated using the flip chip method suffers from problems associated with poor heat release efficiency because the sapphire substrate has heat conductivity of about 27 W/mK, thus leading to very high heat resistance. Further, the flip chip method has additional disadvantages of requiring large numbers of photolithography process steps, thus resulting in complicated manufacturing processes.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">On the other hand, the vertical structure is characterized in that the sapphire substrate is removed by the so-called laser lift-off (LLO) process, followed by fabrication of electrodes. In the vertical structure, one metal contact is positioned on the top surface and the other contact is positioned on the bottom surface of the device structure after removal of the sapphire (insulating) substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Even though the laser lift-off process has advantages of remarkably reducing the number of the manufacturing process steps and providing excellent luminescence properties, such a conventional laser lift-off process damages the crystal structure of the LED due to thermal stress occurring between the sapphire substrate and LED structure when performing laser irradiation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas, separated and discharged from Ga upon performing laser irradiation, passes through the LED structure, which leads to damage of the LED crystal structure, and thus significantly reduces production yield and consequently makes it difficult to realize mass production.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described, for example, with reference to a gallium nitride (GaN)-based light emitting diode (LED) formed on a non-conductive substrate such as a sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)-based substrate. However, the present invention is not limited to such a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The embodiments of the present invention may employ other kinds of substrates including a conductive substrate. Therefore, the embodiments of the present invention may include AlGaInP LEDs on a GaP substrate, GaN LEDs on a SiC substrate, SiC diodes on a sapphire substrate, and/or any combination of nitride-based LEDs on GaN, SiC, MN, ZnO and/or other substrates. Further, in the present invention, use of an active layer region is not limited to LED regions. In addition, other forms of the active layer region may be employed in compliance with some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">[Semiconductor Thin Film Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of nitride-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> are formed on a substrate <b>100</b>, using a conventional semiconductor process technology such as a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method, a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The semiconductors layers <b>200</b> may be formed on a substrate with a similar kind of material such as gallium nitride (GaN), or otherwise may be formed on a different kind of substrate such as sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silicon (Si), silicon carbide (SiC) or the like. Hereinafter, by way of example, the formation of the semiconductor layers <b>200</b> are made on a sapphire substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The semiconductor layers <b>200</b> have a structure including a first conductive semiconductor layer <b>210</b>, an active layer <b>220</b> and a second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b>, which may be sequentially formed on the substrate <b>100</b>. Hereinafter, the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>210</b> may be an n-type GaN semiconductor layer and the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b> may be a p-type GaN semiconductor layer, or vice versa, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When it is desired to grow a thin film of nitride on the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> with an orientation-determining structure, the occurrence of lattice mismatch may lead to deterioration in quality of the resulting thin film. Therefore, preferably a buffer layer <b>110</b> may be first formed on the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>, and the plurality of GaN semiconductor layers <b>200</b> may then be formed on the buffer layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Herein, the buffer layer <b>110</b> may comprise of a first buffer layer serving as a seed on the substrate <b>100</b> and growing at a low temperature and a second buffer layer may be formed on the first buffer layer and may be made of an undoped GaN semiconductor layer (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, the first buffer layer may also comprise of an In<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>1-x</sub>N or In<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>1-x</sub>N/GaN superlattice layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The active layer <b>220</b> may have an InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) structure. In addition, a material such as AlGaN, AlInGaN or the like may also be used as the material for the active layer <b>220</b>. The active layer <b>220</b> generates light by combination of electron-hole pairs when an electric field is applied through an electrode, which is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the active layer <b>220</b> may have a multi quantum well (MQW) structure by forming a plurality of quantum well (QW) structures, in order to improve the brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this manner, on the substrate <b>100</b> are sequentially formed a series of the GaN semiconductor layers including the GaN buffer layer <b>110</b>, the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>210</b>, the InGaN/GaN/AlGaInN active layer <b>220</b> having a multi quantum well (MQW) structure, and the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Herein, the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> typically has a thickness of about 330 to 430 &#x3bc;m and a series of the GaN semiconductor layers <b>200</b> have a total thickness of about 10 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a current diffusion layer <b>240</b> may be formed on the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b>. As the current diffusion layer <b>240</b>, an In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N layer or an In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N/GaN superlattice layer may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The current diffusion layer <b>240</b> may serve to improve the carrier mobility, thereby facilitating the flow of electric current, and is also called as a current transport enhanced layer (CTEL).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">[Trench Etching]</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, etching is carried out in chip separation regions to be separated when chips are completed later, using a dry etching method. That is, etching is carried out through the series of the GaN-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> to the surface portion of the substrate <b>100</b> to form a plurality of trenches <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Because the series of the GaN-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> and the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> are extremely hard, it is preferred to form the trenches <b>300</b> by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), particularly Inductively Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etching (ICP RIE).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To form the trenches <b>300</b>, a photoresist film (not shown) is applied to the GaN-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> by spin coating, and the applied photoresist film is subjected to selective exposure and development processes to thereby form a photoresist film pattern (not shown). Using the ICP RIE method and the thus-formed photoresist film pattern as an etching mask, etching is carried out from the GaN-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> to the surface portion sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) substrate <b>100</b> to thereby form trenches <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the above process, photoresist (PR) or a metal mask may be used as the etching mask. For the metal mask, chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), gold (Au) or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">[Primary Ohmic/Reflective Electrode Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first electrodes <b>410</b> may be formed on the upper parts of the semiconductor layers <b>200</b> separated from each other by the formation of the trenches <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first electrode <b>410</b> may comprise of a transparent electrode <b>411</b> and a reflective electrode <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">That is, in order to secure ohmic characteristics, the transparent electrode <b>411</b> may be formed with a transparent conductive oxide (TCO). In other words, the transparent electrode <b>411</b> may serve as an ohmic electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Where such a transparent electrode <b>411</b> is employed, it may be more advantageous to form the transparent electrode <b>411</b> on the current diffusion layer <b>240</b>, utilizing the transparent conductive oxide (TCO).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In such a structure, a work function of the current diffusion layer <b>240</b> may be smaller than that of a p-type GaN semiconductor layer constituting the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b> and may be greater than that of the transparent electrode <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, the range of work functions of the current diffusion layer <b>240</b> and the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b> may be partially overlapped therebetween. Work functions of the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>230</b> and the transparent electrode <b>411</b> may also be partially overlapped therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As the transparent conductive oxide constituting the transparent electrode <b>411</b>, an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) layer may be used. Further, other materials such as indium-zinc-oxide (IZO), aluminum-zinc-oxide (AZO), magnesium-zinc-oxide (MZO), gallium-zinc-oxide (GZO) and the like may also be used as the transparent conductive oxide material.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As discussed above, the reflective electrode <b>412</b> may be formed on the transparent electrode <b>411</b>. An advantage of such an electrode structure is to improve reflectivity.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The reflective electrode <b>412</b> may be formed of aluminum (Al), silver (Ag) or the like. Where the supporting layer is formed later, a material capable of being used as a connection metal layer that is a seed metal or a bonding metal may be employed in forming the reflective electrode <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, passivation layers <b>510</b> are formed in the trench <b>300</b> regions between semiconductor layers <b>200</b> on which the first electrodes <b>410</b> were formed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">[Passivation Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The passivation layers <b>510</b> protect the individually separated semiconductor layers <b>200</b> and chips, suppress the occurrence of leakage current, and may facilitate in the separation of the chips while alleviating an impact applied to the semiconductor layers <b>200</b>, upon performing a subsequent separation process of the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Examples of the material constituting the passivation layer <b>510</b> may include SiO<sub>2</sub>, SU-8 (epoxy-based photoresist (PR)), WPR (acrylic-based PR), SOG, polyimide and the like, and may be appropriately selected taking into consideration various factors such as hardness, elastic modulus and transmissivity of the materials to be used, adhesion between materials and the like. These materials may be used alone or in any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Mechanical properties of the material constituting the passivation layer <b>510</b> are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below. As can be seen from Tables 1 and 2, SiO<sub>2 </sub>exhibits tensile strength and elastic modulus superior to other materials, and therefore is most resistant to stress that may occur during a chip separation process. In addition, it can be seen that SiO<sub>2 </sub>exhibits lower adhesion with the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>, as compared to SU-8, and therefore an impact applied to the chip during a stress release process may be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Such a separation process of the substrate <b>100</b> may be carried out by the following process.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Hereinafter, the separation between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and the GaN-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> will be reviewed in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>.</p>

For convenient illustration, only the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, KrF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 248 nm or ArF excimer laser beam having a wavelength of 193 nm is irradiated at the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; through the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In order to achieve uniform distribution of an energy density of the laser beam at the laser beam spot irradiated at the target interface, it is preferred to irradiate the laser beam under a condition in which a beam homogenizer (not shown) is positioned between a laser light source (not shown) and the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">When the beam homogenizer is used as described above, a uniformity of the laser beam energy density is about 95% or higher. Because light having the above-specified wavelength range is not absorbed by the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>, but is absorbed by the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, the laser beam that passes through the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> is absorbed by the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; at the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;. Therefore, a surface of the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; is rapidly heated by absorption of laser beam energy.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Then, the heated surface of the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; begins to melt and forms high-temperature and high-pressure surface plasma, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.

The rapid plasma expansion brings about generation of an acoustic stress wave around the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The acoustic stress wave generated at the interface serves to apply a physical force to the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; in opposite directions from each other.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Experiments were carried out to examine changes of pressure over time, generated at the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; when the laser beam was irradiated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> schematically shows an experimental apparatus measuring pressure generated by the laser beam irradiation, using a conventional piezo film sensor <b>750</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a graph showing the measurement results.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the piezo film sensor <b>750</b> was attached to the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, using an epoxy resin <b>760</b>. The pressure of sonic wave generated by the irradiation of single-pulse laser was detected by the piezo film sensor <b>750</b>, and an oscilloscope <b>770</b> was connected to the piezo film sensor <b>750</b>, in order to monitor electrical signals outputted from the sensor <b>750</b>. For the irradiation laser, KrF excimer laser having a wavelength of 248 nm and an energy density of 0.9 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>was used. The pressure of sonic wave detected by the sensor <b>750</b> was converted into electrical signals using a conversion constant of 13&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>V/N, and was then outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As shown in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a signal having a maximum value was detected at around 15 &#x3bc;s, the duration of the first main peak was about 30 &#x3bc;s, and thereafter several peaks appeared with a sharply declined intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Zones <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to <b>4</b> of the first peak in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> correspond to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref>, <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively. That is, Time point <b>1</b> refers to an irradiation step of laser beam to the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;; Time point <b>2</b> refers to a plasma generation step after melting of the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; portion at the interface, due to the irradiation of laser beam; Time point <b>3</b> refers to a generating step of an acoustic stress wave by rapid expansion of the generated plasma; and Time point <b>4</b> refers to an immediate separation step of the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> from the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, by the acoustic stress wave.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The duration of the first peak was about 30 &#x3bc;s. Therefore, the above graph illustrates clearly that the separation of the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> from the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, achieved by the acoustic stress wave generated at the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, took only about 30 &#x3bc;s.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">On the other hand, in order to examine effects of the laser-beam energy density on generation of the acoustic stress wave, a laser energy beam having a wavelength of 248 nm and a laser energy beam having a wavelength of 193 nm, with varying energy density, have irradiated at the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, respectively, and then the highest (maximum) value of stress generated by the acoustic stress wave was measured. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a graph showing the acoustic stress with respect to a varying energy density, for the 248 nm-laser beam and the 193 nm-laser beam, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As shown in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the acoustic stress was very weak or was not substantially detected at the energy density of less than 0.50 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>for the 248 nm-laser beam, and an immediate separation of the sapphire substrate was not possible at the energy density of less than 0.60 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>for both the 248 nm-laser beam and the 193 nm-laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">That is, because a critical energy density of the laser beam, at which plasma formation takes place after melting of the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, is about 0.30 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, it can be seen that the separation of the sapphire substrate itself may be possible if the irradiated laser has an energy density of more than 0.30 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, but an immediate separation of the sapphire substrate cannot be achieved at the energy density of less than 0.60 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Therefore, in order to take advantage of a mechanical or physical force, e.g. an acoustic stress wave, upon the separation of the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> from the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032;, the irradiating laser should have the energy density of at least more than 0.50 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. In addition, for an immediate separation of the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>, the irradiating laser preferably shall have the energy density of more than 0.60 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Meanwhile, as shown in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, it was measured that acoustic stress is significantly higher for the 248 nm-laser beam under the same conditions, as compared to the 193 nm-laser beam. This is because the 193 nm-laser beam undergoes a greater loss of beam, as compared to the 248 nm-laser beam, when the laser beam passes through the sapphire substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When the beam loss was measured upon penetration of the beam through the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> having a thickness of 450 &#x3bc;m, the 248 nm-laser beam exhibited the beam loss of about 15%, whereas the 193 nm-laser beam exhibited the beam loss of about 22%.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As discussed above, the acoustic stress wave generated at the interface between the sapphire substrate <b>100</b> and GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>&#x2032; may apply a high impact to a GaN layer within a laser beam spot region.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) showing the impact applied by the acoustic stress wave generated upon the irradiation of the 248 nm-laser beam having an energy density of 1.0 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to the interface between the monolithic GaN layer and sapphire substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, Arrow a represents damage of the GaN-based semiconductor layer occurred around edges of a square-shaped beam spot, and Arrow b represents a trajectory of the acoustic stress wave developed at the interface. That is, as indicted by the photograph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, if the irradiated laser beam has an excessively high energy density, the GaN layer may be damaged due to high impact caused by the acoustic stress wave.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Hence, in order to prevent the damage of the GaN-based semiconductor layer simultaneously with immediate separation of the sapphire substrate, it is necessary to optimize the energy density of the irradiated laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In order to find an optimal energy density of the laser beam, observations were made for the damage of the GaN-based semiconductor layer that occurred when the energy density of the laser beam, irradiated at the interface between the monolithic GaN layer and sapphire substrate, was 0.75 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.80 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.85 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 0.90 J/cm2, 0.95 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 1.00 J/cm2, respectively. The results thus obtained are given in SEMs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 to 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 to 26</figref>, when it is desired to make the separation between the monolithic GaN layer and sapphire substrate, the laser beam energy density of 0.75 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>results in slight damage to the GaN-based semiconductor layer, whereas an increased energy density of the laser beam, when exceeding 0.75 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, leads to more severe damage of the GaN-based semiconductor layer. Therefore, the optimal energy density of the laser beam is in the range of 0.60 to 0.75 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, when making separation between the monolithic GaN layer and sapphire substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Optionally, as mentioned already in the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to block lateral propagation of the acoustic stress wave generated at the interface between the sapphire substrate and GaN-based semiconductor layer, by forming trenches that pass through the GaN-based semiconductor layer to reach the sapphire substrate or to penetrate into a portion of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As a result, it is possible to prevent damage of the GaN layer in a broader range of energy density values. It was observed that there is no damage of the GaN layer even at a high energy density of up to 1.10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, when such trenches are formed, the laser beam energy density is preferably in a range of 0.60 to 1.10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

Herein, as described above, the etch stop layer <b>720</b> is etch resistant to an etchant of the second supporting layer <b>730</b>, and therefore is not etched, thereby resulting in a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, when the etch stop layer <b>720</b> is also removed by a separate etching process, the PR post <b>610</b> may be exposed and may also be removed, thereby resulting in a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, where the PR post <b>610</b> was removed in the above process, respective chip separation regions may be connected therebetween via the connection metal layer <b>420</b> and the passivation layers <b>510</b> and may be easily separated by a conventional method such as tape expansion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> shows the state of the chip that was finally separated by such a process.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">[Passivation Open Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Although the above-mentioned structure is directed to a structure in which the passivation layers <b>510</b> are filled in the trenches <b>300</b> formed in chip separation regions, the passivation structure formed in the trenches <b>300</b> may have various forms depending upon the efficiency of the substrate <b>100</b> separation process and chip separation process.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">That is, the semiconductor layers <b>200</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>100</b>, and in that state, the trenches <b>300</b> may be formed in the chip separation regions. Thereafter, the first electrodes <b>410</b> may be formed on the semiconductor layers <b>200</b>, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, passivation films <b>520</b> filling some portions of trenches <b>300</b> may be formed in trench <b>300</b> regions.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Forming the semiconductor layers <b>200</b>, trenches <b>300</b> and first electrodes <b>410</b> on the substrate <b>100</b> may be carried out in the same manner as in the above embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">According to such a structure, the passivation films <b>520</b> passivating only around chips may be formed and the remaining portions may be open to form openings <b>521</b>, instead of achieving passivation by completely filling the trench <b>300</b> regions between chips, using photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In this way, forming the openings <b>521</b> on the passivation film <b>520</b> may lead to lowering of adhesion between the passivation film <b>520</b> and substrate <b>100</b>, and therefore a passivating material may be formed of a single material (for example, PR material such as SU-8 or WPR). In addition, such an opening structure serves to alleviate stress, generated upon separation of the substrate <b>100</b>, within the chip separation regions, thus making it possible to reduce mechanical damage applied to the chips, and consequently obtaining stable device characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In fact, if laser lift-off (LLO) was carried out under the condition in which the trenches <b>300</b> were completely filled with a certain material such as SU-8, high adhesion characteristics between SU-8 and the surface of sapphire substrate <b>100</b> would lead to a failure to effectively alleviate stress generated upon performing LLO, which in turn results in the transfer of an impact to the chips, thereby causing the occurrence of cracks, chip breaking, and delamination of thin films.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Therefore, the structure, which carries out passivation functions by forming of the passivation films <b>520</b> having openings <b>512</b> while only some regions are attached to the sapphire substrate <b>100</b>, may provide for easy separation from the substrate <b>100</b>, upon performing LLO.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">[Trench Fill Structure]</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In such a manner, due to the formation of the passivation films <b>520</b> on portions of the trenches <b>300</b>, spaces may be formed in the trenches <b>300</b> formed in the chip separation regions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. At this time, when metal layers <b>530</b> are filled in at least portions of the spaces, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the metal layers <b>530</b> may serve to further alleviate stress generated upon performing LLO.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The structure including the formation of the metal layers <b>530</b> is a structure applied to alleviate stress during LLO and to facilitate the chip separation.

<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Alternatively, the first supporting layers <b>740</b> may cover and support the upper sides of the connection metal layers <b>420</b>.

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">For this purpose, masks <b>820</b> for forming the second electrodes <b>830</b> may be formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, and thereafter the light-extraction structures <b>900</b> may be formed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. The light-extraction structures <b>900</b> may be similar to those defined above. The light-extraction structures <b>900</b> may be formed by treating the surface of the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>210</b>, or by forming the conductive semiconductors <b>200</b> with irregularities on the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Hereinafter, a light-extraction efficiency of the above-manufactured light-emitting diode chip will be described in connection with the light-extraction structure <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 to 61</figref> show various examples of patterns of holes <b>910</b> constituting the light-extraction structure <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">That is, the above-mentioned light-extraction structure <b>900</b> forms a photonic crystal (PC) structure. Examples of the photonic crystal (PC) structure may include a square lattice structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, a triangular lattice structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, an archimedean-like lattice structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, a 12-fold quasicrystal structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, and a random structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In connection with such a photonic crystal structure, assuming that the distance between the holes <b>910</b>, i.e. a period of the photonic crystal structure, is designated as &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the diameter of holes <b>910</b> may have a value of 0.1A to 0.9A, and the depth of holes <b>910</b> may have a value of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to up to the thickness of the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>210</b> of the GaN-based semiconductor layer <b>200</b>, i.e. the thickness of the n-type semiconductor layer in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Preferably, in the above photonic crystal structure, the distance between unit shapes forming the above-mentioned patterns, i.e. the holes <b>910</b>, is 0.8 times the wavelength of light emitted, and the radius of holes <b>910</b> is 0.25 times the distance between the holes <b>910</b>. When the photonic crystal structure is applied to a nitride-based LED, the hole-to-hole distance, i.e. a period of the photonic crystal structure, is preferably in a range of 0.5 to 2 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The light-extraction efficiency measured after applying each of the above photonic crystal structures to the LED of the various embodiments of the present invention are given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62 and 63</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>, it can be seen that the archimedean-like lattice structure and the quasicrystal structure exhibit an excellent light-extraction efficiency, as compared to the absence of the photonic crystal structure and the triangular lattice structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>, it can be seen that the archimedean-like lattice structure and the quasicrystal structure exhibit an excellent light-extraction efficiency, as compared to the square lattice structure, the triangular lattice structure and the random structure.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Therefore, concerning the light-extraction structure <b>900</b>, it is advantageous to apply the archimedean-like lattice structure or the quasicrystal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 64 and 65</figref> show the light-emitting surface of the LED having the photonic crystals of the square lattice structure and the LED having the quasicrystal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In the case of the square lattice structure, it can be seen that several beam spots appear and an emission angle of light depends upon a viewing angle. Whereas, the quasicrystal structure shows appearance of a single beam spot and represents a Gaussian beam profile.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Characteristics of the archimedean-like lattice structure and the quasicrystal structure are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 and 67</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Strictly speaking, the archimedean-like lattice structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref> is a kind of triangular lattice structure. However, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, the archimedean-like lattice structure is different from the triangular lattice structure in that the number of holes <b>910</b> contained in a unit cell <b>920</b> constituting crystals is 19, not one.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Taking into consideration that 6 holes <b>910</b> out of 19 holes <b>910</b> in a unit cell <b>920</b> are being shared with adjacent unit cells <b>920</b>, 13 holes <b>910</b> are included in the one unit cell <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In a broad sense, such a lattice structure maintains a hexagonal symmetry. However, such a structure simultaneously shows a dodecagonal symmetry due to the fact that 12 holes <b>910</b> are positioned in the outermost part of the unit cell <b>920</b>. In addition, the archimedean-like lattice structure has a translational symmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Therefore, the archimedean-like lattice structure may be favorably utilized in desired applications including LEDs, requiring isotropic properties for all incidence angles of light.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The dodecagonal quasicrystal structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> is similar to the archimedean-like lattice structure in that the unit cell <b>920</b> comprises of 19 holes <b>910</b>, but has a difference in that a translational symmetry is not formed and each unit cell <b>920</b> is arranged while being rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">However, these two structures have a very similar configuration in the Fourier space, and therefore exhibit a high similarity in various characteristics associated with the diffraction of light.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The position of the holes <b>910</b> within such quasicrystals corresponds to a vertex of each unit cell when a two-dimensional plane is gradually filled with an equilateral triangle and a regular quadrilateral. As such, it is possible to realize various forms of quasicrystals, depending upon different methods of filling the two-dimensional plane with the equilateral triangle and regular quadrilateral, and kinds of unit cells that correspond to structural pieces of quasicrystals.</p>

<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Meanwhile, in the above-mentioned fabrication process, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, one integration electrode <b>430</b> may be formed on a GaN-based semiconductor layers <b>200</b> and portions or entire portions of passivation layers <b>510</b> formed between the semiconductor layers <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">Such an integration electrode <b>430</b> may be formed of a single metal or an alloy of various metals, may be in ohmic contact with the semiconductor layers <b>200</b>, and may include functions such as an reflective electrode and a seed metal.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Utilization of such an integrated electrode <b>430</b> may result in simplification of a device structure. In addition, a supporting layer may be formed on the integrated electrode <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">On the other hand, the reflective electrode utilized in the aforesaid various embodiments may be formed using Ag or Al, as described hereinbefore. The reflectivity with respect to a thickness of the reflective electrode will now be illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Such a reflectivity represents a reflectivity obtained when the reflective electrode is disposed between the GaN semiconductor layer and Ni.</p>

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 69 and 70</figref>, the reflectivity with respect to a thickness of the reflective electrode shows a tendency toward gradual saturation, when the electrode thickness exceeds a certain thickness.</p>
