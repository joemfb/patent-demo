<p id="p-0067" num="0246">Also, the acetamide compound (2) wherein R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrogen atom can be produced by reacting the mandelonitrile compound (6) with 0.1 to 1 mol of hydrogen chloride and 1 to 4 mol of water, based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile compound (6). In the reaction, the formation of a carboxylic acid compound produced by the hydrolysis of the acetamide compound (2) tends to be suppressed, and thus it is a preferred method for producing the acetamide compound (2) wherein R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrogen atom.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0247">Hydrochloric acid, an aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride, may be used instead of hydrogen chloride. When hydrochloric acid is used, the concentration of hydrogen chloride is usually from 10 to 36% by weight, and preferably from 25 to 36% by weight. As described above, the amount of hydrogen chloride used is from 0.1 to 1 mol, and preferably from 0.5 to 1 mol, based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile compound (6). When the amount of hydrogen chloride used is 0.1 mol or more based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile (6), the yield of the acetamide compound (2) wherein R<sup>2 </sup>is a hydrogen atom tends to be improved. On the other hand, when the amount is 1 mol or less based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile compound (6), the progress of hydrolysis reaction of the acetamide compound (2) tends to be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0248">Water may be used alone or simultaneously with hydrogen chloride in the form of hydrochloric acid. As described above, the amount of water used is from 1 to 4 mol, and preferably from 2 to 4 mol, based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile compound (6). When the amount of water used is 1 mol or more based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile compound (6), the conversion rate of the mandelonitrile compound (6) tends to be improved. On the other hand, when the amount is 4 mol or less based on 1 mol of the mandelonitrile compound (6), the progress of hydrolysis reaction of the acetamide compound (2) tends to be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0249">The reaction of the mandelonitrile compound (6), hydrogen chloride and water is preferably carried out in the presence of an organic solvent. Examples of the organic solvent include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene and chlorobenzene; aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane and heptane; alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents such as cyclopentane and cyclohexane; ketone solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone; and ether solvents such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran. These solvents may be used alone, or two or more kinds of solvents may be used in combination. Among these solvents, aromatic hydrocarbon solvents are preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0250">The amount of the organic solvent used is usually from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, and preferably from 1 to 5 parts by weight, based on 1 part by weight of the mandelonitrile compound (6).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0251">The reaction is carried out by mixing the mandelonitrile compound (6), hydrogen chloride and water. For example, hydrogen chloride and water may be added to the mandelonitrile compound (6), or the mandelonitrile compound (4) may be added to hydrogen chloride and water. Alternatively, the mandelonitrile compound (6) may be diluted with an organic solvent before the diluted solution is mixed with hydrogen chloride and water.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0252">The reaction temperature is usually from &#x2212;20 to 100&#xb0; C., and preferably from 20 to 80&#xb0; C. The reaction time depends on the reaction temperature, and is usually from 0.5 to 20 hours, and preferably from 1 to 10 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0253">The progress of the reaction can be recognized by general analytical means such as high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0254">The obtained reaction mixture may be used in the above reaction of the acetamide compound (2) with the dialkyl sulfate (3) directly or after washing. Alternatively, the acetamide compound (2) may be separated from the reaction mixture by concentration, crystallization or the like, and the acetamide compound (2) separated may be used in the above reaction of the acetamide compound (2) with the dialkyl sulfate (3). The acetamide compound (2) thus separated may be further purified by general purification means such as column chromatography.</p>
