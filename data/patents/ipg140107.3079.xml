<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a device that contains a micro electromechanical structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Known MEMS devices (Micro ElectroMechanical System devices) are integrated circuit structures wherein part of circuit structure has been undercut so that it is free to move relative to the underlying substrate. In addition the MEMS device contains electronic circuitry to generate electric fields to exert forces on the free part of the structure and/or measure electric parameters relating to the free part, such as current flowing to it, accumulated charge etc. In a typical MEMS device the free part is made of crystalline silicon, but other materials may be used, dependent on the technology used to manufacture the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices with micromechanical structures are typically manufactured by processing a silicon wafer, using techniques known from integrated circuit processing. In order to create a free part in a micro mechanical structure a two-dimensional shape of a mechanical bar or block on the wafer may be defined by lithography, and undercut etching may be used to detach part of the bar or block from the underlying material. Thus it is possible to create a bar or block of crystalline silicon material that is free to vibrate mechanically over at least part of its length. Moreover, during manufacture of such a device electrodes may be defined that can be used to apply electrical fields in order to excite the vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">PCT patent application WO2006/067757 describes a charge biased micro-mechanical resonator, containing a micromechanical structure. This document shows a clamped bar structure, which comprises an elongated strip of material, with end portions attached to the underlying substrate and an unattached mid portion that is free to move subject to the laws of elasticity that govern deformation of the bar. An electrode next to this mid portion can be used to excite vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Non-linearity is a known problem of this type of device. For small deformation the behavior of the structure is linear, i.e. the amount of deformation is proportional to force applied to the structure. For larger deformations non-linearity gives rise to deviations from the linear behavior. Non-linearity may have detrimental effects in terms of decreased power efficiency, lower resonance quality etc. Non-linearity arises, among others, due to non-linear elastic properties of the material of the structure. WO2006/067757 describes that the use of stored charge can reduce non-linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another solution to the problem of non-linearity is described in an article by Manu Agarwal et al. in Applied Physics Letters 89, 214105 2006, pages 214105-1 to 214105-3 and titled &#x201c;Optimal drive condition for nonlinearity reduction in electrostatic microresonators&#x201d;. Agarwal discloses that in a clamped bar the non linearity due to the mechanical properties of the bar can be compensated at certain excitation amplitudes by opposite non-linear behavior of the electrical field strength of the field from the electrode. With a fixed voltage difference between the electrode and the bar, the force due to this field is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bar and the electrode, which means that the force depends non-linearly on the displacement of the bar. Agarwal et al note that this non-linearity can compensate the elastic non-linearity. However, this solution only works over a narrow range of excitation amplitudes, as the non-linearity of the electric field and the non-linearity due to the material properties and geometry depend differently on amplitude. Moreover, the double clamping of the bar leads to energy losses which reduce the quality factor of the resonance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Among others, it is an object to provide for reduced non-linearity of a micro electromechanical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A device according to claim <b>1</b> is provided. This device comprises a micro electromechanical structure and an electrode on a substrate. The micro electromechanical structure comprises a &#x201c;free&#x201d; part that is able to move relative to the substrate. The free part comprises parts of a first arm, a second arm and a connection between the first and second arm. The arms extend transversely to each other. In this way, an additional degree of design freedom is created that makes it possible to reduce non-linearity over a wider range. In an embodiment at least two non-zero order coefficients of an expansion of the stiffness in powers of the deviation of the structure from a stable position are made substantially zero by adjusting the dimensions of the arms.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The second arm may be combined with a third arm to form a clamped bar arrangement, with an optional area to form a mass in the middle of the bar and with the first arm extending transversely to the bar, for example. This provides for a symmetrical arrangement where the directions of movement are limited due to symmetry. In a further embodiment the first arm is used as a main arm, to provide the majority of the mechanical spring force and to make one non zero order coefficient zero when there is an operational bias voltage on the electrode, and the second and third arm are used as auxiliary arms to compensate for higher order non-linearity. Preferably, the electrode is configured so that it applies an average field in the direction of the first arm. Thus losses due the second and third arms can be kept low.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment a &#x201c;dog bone&#x201d; structure is used, with masses formed by two mains area, which are connected via the first arm. Second arms may be attached to each of the main areas. In this case the first arm may be kept free from the substrate, or it may be attached to the substrate at a point where there is zero displacement due to symmetry. Thus losses due to attachment to the substrate can be further reduced, which results in a high Q factor in resonant operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment a main area between two first arms is used, which are attached to the substrate via with further arms transverse to the first arms on their end opposite to the substrate. This makes it possible to realize a high quality factor, because the first arms need not be clamped and at the same time non-linear effects can be reduced.</p>

Except for the end portions, main area <b>100</b>, first, second and third arms <b>102</b>, <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>are &#x201c;free&#x201d; from the substrate so that they are capable of moving relative to the substrate, subject to forces due to their attachment to the fixed end portions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Electrode <b>12</b> is located adjacent to main area <b>100</b>, divided from it by a gap <b>14</b>, at a side opposite to the side from which first arm <b>102</b> extends. Electrode <b>12</b> may be attached entirely to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">First arm <b>102</b> extends from main area <b>100</b> in a first direction. An end portion <b>108</b> of first arm <b>102</b> is attached to the substrate, the remainder of first arm having no direct attachment to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>extend from main area <b>100</b> at mutually opposite sides. Second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>have the same dimensions.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a device with micro electromechanical structure <b>10</b> (shown as a &#x201c;black box&#x201d;). A driver circuit <b>20</b> and a bias voltage source <b>22</b> are provided, with outputs coupled to electrode <b>12</b> and micro electromechanical structure <b>10</b> is coupled to ground via a resistance <b>24</b> and to a sensing circuit <b>26</b>. Driver circuit <b>20</b> and bias voltage source <b>22</b> may be used to apply AC and DC components of an electric field through the gap.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further embodiment a pair of further electrodes may be provided on either side of first arm <b>102</b>, separated from main area by a further gap. In this case, driver circuit <b>20</b> may apply a voltage difference between this pair on one side and electrode <b>12</b> on the other side. Although a circuit is shown in which main area <b>100</b> and the arms are coupled to a resistor, these may be connected differently in other embodiments, for example to ground. The sensing circuit may be coupled to first arm <b>102</b> for example, or to electrode <b>12</b> for measuring current to electrode <b>12</b>. Another alternative is to connect the actuation circuit to the structure while the sensing circuit is attached to the electrode. In terms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> this means that blocks <b>20</b>,<b>22</b> may be electrically connected to structure <b>10</b>, while blocks <b>24</b>,<b>26</b> are electrically connected to electrode <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, main area <b>100</b> acts as a mass and first, second and third arms <b>102</b>, <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, act as springs on which this mass is suspended. In a stationary electric field first, second and third arms <b>102</b>, <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, define a stable position of main area <b>100</b>. When main area <b>100</b> is away from the stable position first, second and third arms <b>102</b>, <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>exert mechanical (elastic) forces (also called spring forces) to move main area <b>100</b> back to its stable position. For small deviations from the stable position the combination of these mechanical forces may be a linear function of de deviation from the stable position. For larger deviations, a non-linear relation holds between the mechanical force and the deviations. This relation may be expressed as a sum of terms, each term being the product of a coefficient and a respective power (1,2, etc) of the deviation. As there is no term with zero power, the force may be expressed as a factor times the deviation, wherein the factor is called the &#x201c;stiffness&#x201d;. The stiffness is the force divided by the deviation. The stiffness can be expressed as a sum of further terms, each term being the product of one of the coefficients and a respective lowered power (0,1, etc) of the deviation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">First arm <b>102</b> provides for a force with both even and odd powers in the force as a function of displacement in the direction perpendicular to the direction of extension of second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, or in other words, it provides for a stiffness with both odd and even powers.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An electric voltage between electrode <b>12</b> and micro electromechanical structure <b>10</b> causes an electric field between electrode <b>12</b> and main area <b>100</b>, which also results in a force on main area <b>100</b>. This force is directed in the direction perpendicular to the direction of extension of second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>. This force also depends non-linearly on the deviation, because the electric field strength and charge depends on gap size. This force may also be expressed as a sum of terms, each term being a product of a coefficient and a power of the displacement, with both even and odd powers. As in the case of the elastic force, the electric force may be expressed as a stiffness times the deviation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment first arm <b>102</b> provides the majority of the mechanical force to return the structure to its stable position. Second a third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>serve to compensate for non-linearity of the stiffness due to first arm <b>102</b> and the electric force provided by the field from electrode <b>12</b>. Due to symmetry second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, only provide for a force with terms with odd powers (1, 3 etc) when main area <b>100</b> is displaced in a direction perpendicular to the direction of extension of second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>from main area <b>100</b>. In other words, in this case the second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>affect stiffness for such displacement only for even powers (0, 2 etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The overall force on main area <b>100</b> is a sum of the elastic force from first, second and third arms <b>102</b>, <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>and the electric force. Thus the overall force can also be expressed as a sum of terms, wherein each terms is the product of a power of the deviation and a sum of coefficients for that power in the expressions for the individual elastic force and the electric force.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As is relevant here, the electric force and the elastic forces provide for second and higher order coefficients of opposite sign. That is, whereas the elastic stiffness &#x201c;hardens&#x201d; (gets stronger) with increasing deviation, the electric stiffness &#x201c;softens&#x201d; (gets weaker). This means that the combined coefficients of the stiffness for several non-zero powers of the deviation can be made zero, non linearity due to electric and elastic forces cancelling each other. Thus linear behavior over a large range of deviations can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This should be contrasted with a situation without first arm <b>102</b>. With only second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>cancellation of the non-linear effects of elastic and electric stiffness can only be realized for a selected size of the deviation. Cancelling of coefficients can be achieved only for coefficients for even, non zero powers of the deviation in the elastic stiffness, because second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>only provides non-zero coefficients for these powers. As the electric stiffness also has a non zero coefficients for odd, non zero powers of the deviation, the main contribution to non-linearity, the coefficient of the first power of the deviation cannot be made zero without first arm <b>102</b>. Instead this coefficient must be compensated by the effect of higher power terms, which is only possible for a singular deviation size.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It has been found that by using a combination of second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>and a first arm <b>102</b> in a direction transverse to the direction of second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>it is made possible to cancel or at least reduce non-linearity over a much larger range of amplitudes. A bias voltage source <b>22</b> may be provided that is configured to supply a bias voltage at which a plurality of non-zero order coefficients of the stiffness is substantially made to cancel. Such a bias voltage source can act as bias means for biasing the electrode <b>12</b> to this bias voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The precise dimensions that lead to such an elimination or reduction depend on the particular device structure. For a given structure it can readily be determined experimentally or by using a model. In an experimental determination devices with arms of various dimensions may be made and the stiffness may be measured, so that coefficients of the stiffness can be plotted as a function of the dimensions and dimensions that lead to the elimination or reduction of coefficients can be selected from the plot.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Instead of using experiments, a model may be used to predict the coefficients. In such a model, the structure can be modeled as a mass m (the main area) hung by three springs connected in parallel. For the model it may be supposed that the mass m is not stretched, that means it does not contribute to significant spring stiffness. The stiffness of the whole spring system is the sum of the stiffness of second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, which will be called springs X with a length Lx/2 and a width Wx and the stiffness of the first arm <b>102</b>, which will be called a spring Y with a length Ly and a width Wy. In the following effective spring stiffnesses of the constituent springs will be calculated separately.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Springs X can be in fact modeled as a single clamped-clamped beam with the length Lx and width Wx, which is loaded at the middle point. The spring stiffness expression contains only the zeroth and the even terms:

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Note that the above formulae are valid for the free-free beam resonator. For the a &#x201c;dog-bone&#x201d; structure, which will be disclosed in the following, we may assume that an extra mass m is mounted on the tip of the free beam and this only affects the effective mass of the system, but the effective spring stiffness is still the same. That means Eqs (7-10) can be used in this case, in which L is replaced by Ly; k, k<sub>0</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2 </sub>are replaced by k<sub>Y</sub>, k<sub>0Y</sub>, k<sub>1Y</sub>, k<sub>2Y</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Because the springs are connected in parallel, the total mechanical spring stiffness, k<sub>m</sub>, is the sum of the constituent spring stiffnesses:

By replacing (1-3) and (7-10) into (11) we finally have:

To fully compensate for the nonlinear terms of the springs, the higher order terms of the mechanical springs should cancel out the corresponding terms of the electrical spring. That means the following set of equations should be satisfied:

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When (19) is satisfied the total spring has only the zeroth order term, that means it is a linear spring. By solving the above set of equations, relations between the dimensions of the springs, the gap, Si crystal orientation and the bias voltage can be defined. Because there are many parameters can be tuned to satisfy (19), we have many choices for selecting a suitable set of parameters which meet other requirements such as the robustness of the structure, operation at moderate bias voltages and high Q.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The following exemplary values of the parameters may be used inputs for Eqs. (19):

Solving equations (19) results in a set of values of the width of the Y spring Wy, the 2&#xd7; length (Lx) of the spring X and the corresponding bias voltage V<sub>DC</sub>. Those values can be found as the coordinates of the 3D curve.

<p id="p-0050" num="0054">Although the principles of operation have been demonstrated with one example of a micro electromechanical structure, it should be appreciated that many alternatives are possible. The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is X-symmetric, with equal second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>extending from main area <b>100</b> in the X-direction, and first arm <b>102</b> as well as the electric field directed in the Y axis perpendicularly to the X direction (at least on average).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">Instead of such a symmetric arrangement a more asymmetric arrangement may be realized, for example with only one arm extending in the x-direction, the second arm in the x-direction being omitted. As another example, first arm <b>102</b> and second arm <b>104</b><i>a </i>need not extend perpendicularly to each other. However, at least a non-zero angle between the two should be used in order to be able to eliminate several coefficients of non-linearity at the same time with a structure of reasonable dimensions. Preferably an angle of between forty five and a hundred thirty five degrees is used. Similarly, the electric field may be applied at an angle to the Y axis.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">However, an X-symmetric arrangement (mirror symmetry around the direction of first arm <b>102</b>) is preferred for the free part of the structure, as this results in better control over movement of the structure (e.g. by excluding movement in the X direction), which limits the risk that non-linear effects due to movement in that direction affects non-linearity. Thus, if one first arm is used, the free part of the structure is preferably mirror symmetric around a central line through first arm <b>102</b> extending from main area <b>100</b>. If more than one arm along the direction of first arm <b>102</b> is used, the mirror axis is an axis of symmetry of the arrangement of these arms. Furthermore, in view of this mirror symmetry it is preferred to use arms, such as second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, that extend in a direction transverse to the direction of first arm, mirror symmetrically on both sides of the axis of mirror symmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">Furthermore, it is preferred that there is also a limited amount of Y-symmetry, i.e. mirror symmetry around an axis perpendicular to the axis of X-symmetry. This applies for example to second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b</i>, which are mirror symmetric about a further symmetry axis that extends from main area <b>100</b> through these arms. This Y symmetry has the effect that the mechanical (elastic) properties of these arms affect only even order coefficients of the stiffness. This makes it possible to construct a design where other (not Y-symmetric) arms are used to make one ore more odd order coefficients of the stiffness zero (e.g. the first order coefficient) and to select the dimensions of second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>to compensate the even order coefficients of the stiffness (e.g. the second order coefficients) due to the other arms and the electrical field. Thus, second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>act as auxiliary arms to compensate higher order non-linearity. It has been found that with this compensation an overall even order coefficient of the stiffness can be made zero. More generally, any Y symmetric set of auxiliary arms may be used, i.e. a set of arms that is mirror symmetric around an axis perpendicular to the direction through which first arm <b>102</b> extends from main area <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">Furthermore, it is preferred to use a first arm <b>102</b> that has a higher width to length ratio (e.g. at least five times wider) than second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>(the width is the dimension perpendicular to the direction at which the relevant arm extends from main area <b>100</b>; the dimension along that direction will be called the length of the arm). This keeps stiffness and therefore losses to second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>low. It has been found that only relatively small auxiliary arms such as second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>are needed for the compensation of higher order coefficients. Using a small width for the second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>has the effect that losses due to the attachment of second and third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>to the substrate are kept small. The configuration of the electrode and first arm <b>102</b> keeps the losses due to first arm <b>102</b> small.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">There are many ways to realize symmetric structures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref> show a number of examples. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example wherein the first arm is replaced by two parallel sub-arms <b>30</b><i>a,b </i>separated by a slit <b>32</b>. Slit <b>32</b> makes it possible to sense deformation of first arm <b>102</b> by means of the Piezo-resistive effect. A measurement circuit <b>34</b> may be provided to determine the resistance between the ends of first arm <b>102</b> on opposite sides of slit <b>32</b> at the attachment to the substrate, or to measure a quantity related to this resistance, such as the voltage between the ends when a given current is applied. Instead of using slit <b>32</b> and connecting measurement circuit <b>34</b> to the both ends of first arm <b>102</b>, measurement circuit <b>34</b> may be coupled to an end of first arm and any other point on the structure, such as the end of one of second or third arm <b>104</b><i>a,b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example wherein the structure is doubled into a kind of &#x201c;dog-bone&#x201d; shape, with two main areas <b>100</b>, each with a mass that exceeds the mass of the arms. A main arm <b>40</b> connects the two main areas <b>100</b>. This structure may provide for resonators of higher quality. Each main area <b>100</b> has extending second and third arms <b>104</b><i>a,b </i>on mutually opposite sides, in a direction transverse to the direction in which main arm <b>40</b> connects main areas <b>100</b>. Electrodes <b>12</b><i>a,b </i>are provided on mutually opposite sides of the dog bone opposite main arm <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">In this structure main arm <b>40</b> takes over the role of first arm <b>102</b> symmetrically for both main areas <b>100</b>. Main arm <b>40</b> need not be attached to the substrate (not shown), so that it can move entirely free from the substrate. Alternatively it may be connected midway between main areas <b>100</b>. This improves overall attachment with little loss of quality.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">A driving circuit <b>42</b> may be provided to apply periodic voltages in phase to electrodes <b>12</b> on mutually opposite sides of the structure. As a result of this form of driving, movement at any attachment to the substrate in the middle of first bar is kept to a minimum, which results in low losses and high quality.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment wherein second and third arms <b>50</b><i>a,b </i>are connected to first arm <b>52</b> rather than to main area <b>100</b>. In this case first arm <b>52</b> is not attached to the substrate (not shown), except through second and third arms <b>50</b><i>a,b </i>so that first arm <b>52</b> can move entirely relative to the substrate. In this case the model is different, because the springs are effectively coupled in series. As a result the expression for the total mechanical spring stiffness, k<sub>m </sub>(equation 11) is changed to k<sub>m</sub><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>=k<sub>x</sub><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>+k<sub>y</sub><sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the expressions that follow from it should be modified correspondingly. However, this does not modify the fact that in an X-symmetric arrangement the second and third arms <b>50</b><i>a,b </i>only affect even order coefficients of the stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an embodiment, wherein two first arms <b>60</b><i>a,b </i>are provided transverse to second and third arms <b>62</b><i>a,b </i>on mutually opposite sides of main area <b>100</b>. Electrodes <b>64</b> may be provided on mutually opposite sides of main area <b>100</b> and on either side of first arms <b>60</b><i>a,b</i>. This structure makes it possible to provide for a doubled force with the same field.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an embodiment like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, but with first arms <b>52</b>, <b>72</b> and second and third arms <b>50</b><i>a,b</i>, <b>70</b><i>a,b </i>symmetrically on either side.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">Although embodiments have been shown with a main area <b>100</b> to act as mass, it should be appreciated that parts of the arms could serve as mass, in which case main area <b>100</b> may be omitted, a relevant part of the arms taking its place. Although embodiments have been shown wherein the same electrode is used for both a bias voltage and an AC voltage that serves to excite motion of the structure, it should be understood that separate electrodes may be used for these two functions. In this case electrodes for both functions are preferably disposed symmetrically to the Y axis of mirror symmetry.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">Other variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims. In the claims, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; does not exclude other elements or steps, and the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; does not exclude a plurality. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measured cannot be used to advantage. Any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as limiting the scope.</p>
