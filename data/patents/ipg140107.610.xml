<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure generally relates to a shelter, and more specifically to a transportable storm shelter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Over the centuries, countless improvements have been made to the safety and efficiency of shelters, but providing a safe storm shelter that is easy to use and/or transport has remained a problem. To address this, structures have been built in the basement of a house, using the existing floor, with the structure typically resting against a wall of the basement. A problem with this approach was that if the home was destroyed, the occupants of the structure would be trapped.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another approach was to utilize numerous wall pieces that could be mated together to supply a shelter. A problem with this approach was that the resultant structure was not sufficiently sturdy to withstand a storm, particularly if utilized outside of the house structure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another approach was to utilize an inflatable structure over which cement could be formed. A problem with this approach is that once the structure is built it was too heavy to move. Another problem is the time required to build the structure is extensive.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, it is readily apparent that there is a recognizable unmet need for a storm shelter which is easily transportable, yet strong and sturdy enough to withstand a storm.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Briefly described, in a preferred embodiment, the present apparatus and method overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages and meets the recognized need for a storm shelter and method of use by providing a transportable storm shelter. The apparatus preferably has a base section and a top section. The base section and the top section have cavities that can be filled with water to encumber the storm shelter. The top section is cone-shaped and is dimensioned to be placed on, and in contact with, the bottom of the base section. After the top section is placed on the base section, the top section is secured to the base section via bolts. Both the top section and bottom section are divided into sub-cavities such that if one sub-cavity develops a leak the other sub-cavities remain unaffected.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to its major aspects and broadly stated, the present apparatus in its preferred form is a storm shelter comprising a top section, a base section and an enclosed area, the top section being conically shaped, the base section being dimensioned to receive the top section, and the enclosed area being disposed between the top section and the base section. The top section has a door, and base section is a truncated cone. The top section also has at least one segment, and wherein each segment has a water-fillable interior portion, a fill cap, and a drain cap. The base section also has at least one cell, and wherein each cell has a filling cap and a draining cap. The top section also has a window. The top section also has an exterior wall, and the door also has an exterior, and the door's exterior and the exterior wall provide a flush exterior surface, and the door is openable into the top section.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The door also has a window, and the conical top has four sub-chambers, and the base has four cells. The top section also has a skirt, and the base section also has a fringe, and the skirt and the fringe are near to, and in contact with, each other when the top section is disposed on the base section. The top section also has an upper terminus, and the base section has an upper surface, and the upper terminus is at least four feet higher than the upper surface. The skirt and the fringe each have stake holes, and the stake holes of the skirt and fringe are alignable when the top section is disposed on the base section. The skirt and fringe each have bolt holes, and the bolt holes of the skirt and fringe are alignable when the top section is disposed on the base section.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In use, a user places the base on the ground, and subsequently places the conical top over the base, the conical top having a door, and the door having a window. The user then opens the door inwardly into the conical top. The conical top has four sub-chambers, and the base has four cells, and the user fills each of the four sub-chambers and cells with water. The conical top also has a skirt, and the base also has a fringe, and the skirt has skirt bolt holes and skirt base holes, and the fringe has fringe bolt holes and fringe stake holes. The user secures a bolt through one of the skirt bolt holes and one of the fringe bolt holes, and also secures a stake through one of the skirt stake holes and one of the fringe stake holes, the stake being further secured into a ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an alternate embodiment, the storm shelter has a cone-shaped top, the cone-shaped top having at least one chamber, and wherein each of the at least one chambers can be filled with water. The cone-shaped top also has a door, and the storm shelter also has an enclosed area, the enclosed area being disposed within the cone-shaped top. The storm shelter also has a base, and the base is a truncated cone, and the base is dimensioned to receive the cone-shaped top.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More specifically, the present disclosure of a preferred embodiment is a storm shelter, the storm shelter having a conical top, a base, an enclosed area, at least one bolt, at least one nut and at least one stake, the stake having a stake diameter. The conical top has an inside wall, an interior surface, an outside wall, an exterior surface, at least one chamber, an upper terminus, a door, a window, a hinge, a door frame, a diameter, a lightning rod, a wire, a grounding stake and a skirt. The at least one chamber preferably comprises a first sub-chamber, a second sub-chamber, a third sub-chamber, a fourth sub-chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first sub-chamber has a first sub-chamber fill cap and a first sub-chamber drain cap, the second sub-chamber has a second sub-chamber fill cap and a second sub-chamber drain cap, the third sub-chamber has a third sub-chamber fill cap and a third sub-chamber drain cap, and the fourth sub-chamber has a fourth sub-chamber fill cap and a fourth sub-chamber drain cap.
