<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/903,006, entitled &#x201c;TROCAR WITH RETENTION CANNULA,&#x201d; filed Oct. 12, 2010, currently pending, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/366,010, entitled &#x201c;TROCAR WITH RETENTION CANNULA,&#x201d; filed Jul. 20, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/250,399, entitled &#x201c;TROCAR WITH RETENTION CANNULA,&#x201d; filed Oct. 9, 2009. These applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure is generally related to surgical instruments, and more particularly, to a trocar comprising a retention cannula with an inverted or incised retention pattern disposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Laparoscopic procedures often use trocars to provide instrument access across a body wall into a body cavity, while protecting the incision against trauma from instrument manipulation. Trocars with unthreaded cannula exhibit reduced incision site trauma and smaller incision sizes compared with a trocar with a threaded cannula, at the expense of reduced retention force. Cannulae equipped with barbs reduce the likelihood of the cannula pulling out of the body wall mid-procedure; however, the cannula barbs do not prevent the cannula from migrating inward over the course of a procedure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A trocar comprises a retention cannula comprising an inverted or incised retention pattern disposed thereon. Embodiments of the incised cannula exhibit reduced tissue trauma compared with screw-threaded cannula, improved fixation and/or retention compared with an unthreaded cannula, and good sealing between the cannula and the incision.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some embodiments provide a trocar comprising: a retention cannula comprising: a proximal end, a distal end, and a longitudinal axis; a cannula wall defining a lumen extending between the proximal end and the distal end; a tip disposed at the distal end of the cannula, a cannula body between the proximal end of the cannula and the tip; and an inverted, tissue retention pattern extending into the wall of on the cannula body, wherein an outer diameter of the inverted pattern is not greater than an outer diameter of the cannula body; and a seal assembly coupled to the proximal end of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the inverted pattern comprises a thread root defining the outer diameter of the inverted pattern and a thread tip defining the outer diameter of the cannula body. In some embodiments, the inverted pattern comprises at least one of a fillet and a chamfer. In some embodiments, the thread root has a width, and the width of the thread root is not constant over the inverted pattern. In some embodiments, the inverted pattern comprises a first plurality of thread roots extending circumferentially about the cannula wall generally perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the trocar. In some embodiments, each of the first plurality of thread roots extends circumferentially about the cannula wall about an arced segment defining an angle less than 180 degrees. In some embodiments, the inverted pattern further comprises a second plurality of thread roots each having a retention segment extending circumferentially about the cannula wall generally perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the trocar, and a flow channel extending circumferentially about the cannula wall transverse to the longitudinal axis. In some embodiments, the retention segments are joined to adjacent flow channels such that the second plurality of thread roots defines a continuous channel. In some embodiments, each retention segment of the second plurality of thread roots is spaced from an adjacent retention segment by at least one of the thread roots of the first plurality of thread roots. In some embodiments, each retention segment of the second plurality of thread roots is spaced from an adjacent retention segment by one of the thread roots of the first plurality of thread roots.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments of trocar, the inverted pattern comprises a continuous thread root having alternating retention segments extending circumferentially about the cannula wall generally perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the trocar and flow channels extending circumferentially about the cannula wall transverse to the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments of trocar, the cannula wall has a region of relatively high thickness and wherein the inverted pattern is disposed in the region of relatively high thickness such that the inverted pattern comprises a thread root defining the outer diameter of the inverted pattern and a thread tip defining an outer diameter greater than the outer diameter of the cannula body.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, a trocar is provided comprising a retention cannula and a seal assembly. The retention cannula comprises a tubular body, a tip, and a tissue retention channel. The tubular body has a proximal end, a distal end, a lumen extending between the proximal end and the distal end, an outer diameter, and a longitudinal axis. The tip is disposed at the distal end of the tubular body. The tissue retention channel extends radially into the tubular body and has a root surface with a diameter less than the diameter of the tubular body. The tissue retention channel comprises a first plurality of thread roots and a second plurality of thread roots. The first plurality of thread roots extends generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tubular body; and the second plurality of thread roots each has a retention segment extending generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tubular body and a flow channel extending generally transverse to the longitudinal axis of the tubular body. The seal assembly is coupled to the proximal end of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of trocar, the second plurality of thread roots are continuous to define a continuous thread root.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments of trocar, wherein each thread root of the first plurality of thread roots extends circumferentially around the tubular body about an arc segment of less than 180 degrees and each thread root of the first plurality of thread roots is positioned such that each thread root of the first plurality of thread roots is spaced apart from adjacent thread roots.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments of trocar, each retention segment of the second plurality of thread roots is spaced from an adjacent retention segment by at least one of the thread roots of the first plurality of thread roots.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of an embodiment of a cannula portion of a trocar. The retention cannula <b>100</b> comprises a proximal end <b>102</b>, a distal end <b>104</b>, a longitudinal axis, and a tubular wall <b>106</b> defining a lumen extending from the proximal end <b>102</b> to the distal end <b>104</b> of the cannula <b>100</b>. A bell <b>110</b> disposed at the proximal end <b>102</b> is couplable to a trocar seal assembly (not illustrated). The distal end <b>104</b> terminates in an angled, beveled tip <b>120</b> in the illustrated embodiment. A generally cylindrical cannula body <b>130</b> extends between the bell <b>110</b> and the tip <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An inverted or incised retention pattern or thread <b>140</b> is disposed on the wall <b>106</b> of the cannula body <b>130</b>. The inverted pattern <b>140</b> extends into the wall <b>106</b>, but not through the wall <b>106</b>. Consequently, the inverted pattern <b>140</b> is opposite of a typical threaded cannula in which the threads extend outwardly from the wall. In the illustrated embodiment, the inverted pattern <b>140</b> is generally helical. Consequently, the inverted pattern <b>140</b> is also referred to herein as an &#x201c;inverted thread&#x201d;, although, as discussed below, in some embodiments, the inverted pattern <b>120</b> is not helical. In the illustrated embodiment, the inverted thread <b>140</b> is right handed, although in other embodiments, the inverted thread <b>140</b> is left handed, comprises right-handed and left-handed portions, or is not handed. An outer diameter of the inverted thread <b>140</b> is not greater than an outer diameter of the cannula body <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the cannula <b>100</b> comprise any suitable material, for example, metal, polymer, and composites thereof. In some embodiments, the cannula <b>100</b> comprises at least one of polycarbonate and polyester. In some embodiments, the cannula <b>100</b> is injection molded. In other embodiments, the cannula <b>100</b> is cast, forged, and/or machined.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A trocar comprising the retention cannula <b>100</b> comprising the inverted thread <b>140</b> exhibits improved tissue fixation and/or retention compared with an unthreaded cannula. Some embodiments of the fixation cannula <b>100</b> exhibit at least as high a tissue retention force as a typical threaded cannula. Compared with a threaded cannula, the cannula <b>100</b> exhibits reduced tissue trauma because the incision into which the cannula <b>100</b> is inserted is smaller, and an overall diameter of the inverted thread cannula <b>100</b> is smaller. Because an outer diameter of the inverted threaded portion <b>140</b> is generally the same as an outer diameter of the tip <b>120</b>, advancing the inverted thread <b>140</b> through a body wall does not entail additional deformation of the tissue beyond the deformation caused by the tip <b>120</b>. In contrast, advancing the threaded portion of a threaded cannula expands the size of the opening to an outer diameter of the threads, thereby increasing tissue trauma.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is believed that the tip <b>130</b> of the cannula expands and/or stretches the tissue as the cannula <b>100</b> is advanced through the body wall. When a desired insertion depth is reached, the stretched tissue relaxes into the inverted threads <b>140</b>, thereby holding or fixing the cannula <b>100</b> in place. Embodiments of the cannula <b>100</b> are inserted and/or withdrawn directly and/or rotationally.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, advantageously, cannulae described herein having inverted patterns of threads can advantageously have an insertion force substantially similar to an insertion force of an unthreaded cannula having an equivalent outer diameter to the outer diameter of the cannulae with inverted thread patterns described herein. However, as tissue adjacent the cannulae can relax into the inverted threads as described above, cannulae with inverted thread patterns can have superior retention performance in terms of retention force and sealing with adjacent tissue in the body wall in an incision site as compared with nonthreaded cannulae of equivalent outer diameters. Thus, the cannulae with inverted thread patterns can provide a relatively low insertion force, similar to that of a nonthreaded cannulae, with relatively high retention performance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2H</figref> illustrate cross sections of various embodiments of the inverted thread <b>240</b> for the cannulae described herein. The thread <b>240</b> comprises thread tips <b>246</b>, which define an outer diameter of the cannula, thread roots <b>248</b>, which define an outer diameter of the inverted pattern or inverted thread <b>240</b>, and sidewalls <b>242</b> defining a channel between the thread tips <b>246</b> and the thread roots <b>248</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in some embodiments, the threads <b>240</b> can have a generally square or rectangular cross section. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2H</figref>, in other embodiments the threads <b>240</b> have another cross section, for example, triangular, trapezoidal, circular, or a combination of cross sections as formed by varying the angles, radii, and lengths of certain features such as chamfers, fillets, and radii where edges of the thread tips <b>246</b> and sidewalls <b>242</b> and the thread roots <b>248</b> and sidewalls <b>242</b> of the inverted thread <b>240</b> meet. In some embodiments, the thread tips <b>246</b> have substantially the same width, TW, while in other embodiments, at least one thread tip <b>246</b> has a different width. In some embodiments, a width of at least one thread tip <b>246</b> is not constant. Similarly, in some embodiments, the thread roots <b>248</b> have substantially the same width, RW, while in other embodiments, at least one thread root <b>248</b> has a different width. In some embodiments, a width of at least one thread root <b>248</b> is not constant. In some embodiments, the width, TW, of the thread tips <b>246</b> is substantially equal to the width, RW of the thread roots <b>248</b>, while in other embodiments, the widths RW, TW can be greater than or less than one another as desired to achieve a desired insertion force and retention performance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, a height H or depth between the thread root <b>248</b> and thread tip <b>246</b> is the same over the inverted thread <b>240</b>. Other embodiments comprise a plurality of heights H. Consequently, some embodiments comprise thread roots <b>248</b> at a plurality of depths and/or thread tips <b>246</b> at a plurality of heights. In some embodiments, at least one of a height of a thread tip <b>246</b> or a depth of a thread root <b>248</b> is not constant. In some embodiments, the height H or depth is the thread root <b>248</b> is not greater than about one half of a thickness of the cannula wall <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the depth is from about one third to about one half of the thickness of the cannula wall <b>106</b>. For example, in some embodiments, for a cannula wall of from about 1.1 mm (about 0.045 inch) to about 1.3 mm (about 0.05 inch), the depth of thread root is from about 0.4 mm (about 0.015 inch) to about 0.5 mm (about 0.02 inch).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2H</figref> are combinations of fillets, chamfers, and radii on the thread tips <b>246</b> and thread roots <b>248</b>. Embodiments of chamfers have a range of angles and/or depths. Embodiments of fillets have a range of radii, eccentricities, and/or shapes. Advantageously, by varying the geometry of the fillets, chamfers, and radii, an inverted thread pattern can be configured to be retained in a particular tissue type.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, embodiments of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> comprise at least one of a helical cut, a diagonal cut, and a flat cut, thereby defining the thread root. The term &#x201c;cut&#x201d; does not necessarily refer to the process by which the inverted pattern <b>140</b> is manufactured. For example, in some embodiments, at least a portion of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> is manufactured contemporaneously with the cannula <b>100</b>, for example, by injection molding. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> is manufactured by another method, for example, by machining and/or etching.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiment of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a helical cut. Some embodiments comprise a plurality of helical cuts, angularly offset and/or longitudinally offset. Embodiments of helical cuts have varying pitches. The term &#x201c;diagonal cut&#x201d; refers to a portion of a helical cut that is less than a complete turn. The terms &#x201c;diagonal cut&#x201d; and &#x201c;helical cut&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein, and are also referred to as &#x201c;lead sections&#x201d;. A flat cut extends circumferentially, either completely around a circumference or only around a portion thereof, and is also referred to as a &#x201c;straight section&#x201d;. Some embodiments comprise sections with other shapes, for example, serpentine, zigzag, and/or longitudinal cuts. In some embodiments, one or more cuts or sections are linked end-to-end, thereby together defining a continuous groove. In some embodiments, all of the cuts or sections are linked end-to-end, thereby defining a single, continuous groove. Some embodiments of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> comprise a plurality of grooves. Some embodiments comprise intersecting grooves, for example, diamond and/or checkerboard patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, some embodiments comprise an offset inverted thread groove pattern <b>140</b> in which deeper and shallower thread roots or grooves alternate. Some embodiments comprise a combination of inverted thread patterns <b>140</b> with different pitches and/or depths.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Some embodiments of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> further comprise at least one feature that extends above the wall of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the inverted pattern <b>140</b> does not completely encircle the body <b>130</b> of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the inverted thread <b>140</b> is patterned for retention in a particular tissue layer or plane, for example, fascia, muscle, skin, and/or fat. In some embodiments the inverted thread <b>140</b> comprises a plurality of regions offset longitudinally, at least one of which is patterned for retention in a particular tissue layer.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref> are a side view and side detail view of an embodiment of a cannula <b>900</b> comprising a threaded portion <b>920</b> having an inverted pattern or thread <b>940</b> having a first plurality of thread roots <b>941</b> having first flat cuts <b>942</b> (straight sections), and a second plurality of thread roots <b>943</b> having second flat cuts (straight sections) <b>944</b><i>a </i>and angled cuts (lead sections) <b>944</b><i>b</i>, which together define a continuous groove, and positioned such that isolated first flat cuts <b>942</b> are disposed between adjacent second flat cuts <b>944</b><i>a </i>on left and right sides of the cannula <b>900</b>. Thus, the inverted pattern of the cannula <b>900</b> are similar to that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref> a first plurality of thread roots <b>941</b> is defined by the first flat cuts <b>942</b>. The first plurality of thread roots <b>941</b> extends circumferentially about a wall of the cannula <b>900</b> in a direction generally perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the cannula <b>900</b>. In some embodiments, the first plurality of thread roots <b>941</b> can be non-continuous, extending circumferentially about the cannula wall about an arc segment defining an angle less than 360 degrees. In the illustrated embodiment, the first plurality of thread roots extends circumferentially about an arc segment defining an angle less than approximately 180 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>, the second plurality of thread roots <b>943</b> has a plurality of second flat cuts <b>944</b><i>a </i>or retention segments that each extend circumferentially about the cannula wall perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the cannula <b>900</b> and a plurality of helical or angled cuts <b>944</b><i>b </i>or flow channels each extending circumferentially about the cannula wall transverse to the longitudinal axis. In the illustrated embodiment, the retention segments are joined to adjacent flow channels to define a continuous channel extending peripherally about the cannula <b>900</b> from a proximal end of the threaded portion <b>920</b> to a distal end of the threaded portion <b>920</b>. Advantageously, the transverse extent of the flow channels can allow for fluid to be vented or evacuated in a proximal direction during insertion of the cannula, thus facilitating insertion of the cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>, in some embodiments, each retention segment of the second plurality of thread roots <b>943</b> is spaced from an adjacent retention segment by at least one of the thread roots of the first plurality of thread roots <b>941</b>. In some embodiments, each retention segment is spaced from an adjacent retention segment by one of the thread roots of the first plurality of thread roots <b>941</b>. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, from a distal end to a proximal end of the threaded portion <b>920</b>, the inverted pattern can take the form of a first plurality thread roots <b>941</b> extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the cannula and having an arc length of less than 180 degrees about the cannula alternating with retention segments of the second plurality of thread roots <b>943</b> extending generally perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the cannula.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10F</figref> illustrate other embodiments of trocar having similarities to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>. For example, the trocars illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10E</figref> have a first plurality of thread roots <b>1041</b> and a second plurality of thread roots <b>1043</b> arranged substantially similar to the first and second pluralities of thread roots of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10E</figref> illustrate embodiments having variations in the widths of the thread roots and thread tips as may be desired to configure a trocar for insertion in a particular tissue type. For example, in some embodiments, the thread tip width can be substantially equal to the thread root width (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>), in other embodiments, the thread tip width can be larger than the thread root width (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B</figref>, <b>10</b>C), and in other embodiments, the thread tip width can be smaller than the thread root width (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10D</figref>, <b>10</b>E).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10E</figref>, in some embodiments, the arc length of the first plurality of thread roots <b>1041</b> can be varied from significantly less than 180 degrees (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) to approaching 180 degrees (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>). In the illustrated embodiments, the first plurality of thread roots <b>1041</b> does not intersect the flow channels of the second plurality of thread roots <b>1043</b>. Other embodiments can include intersecting thread roots.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</figref>, an embodiment of cannula is shown that is similar to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</figref>, the cannula comprises a continuous thread <b>1043</b> or groove defined by a plurality of flat cuts or retention segments that each extend circumferentially about the cannula wall perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the cannula and a plurality of cuts or flow channels each extending circumferentially about the cannula wall transverse to the longitudinal axis. Thus, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10F</figref>, unlike the cannulae illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>9</b>B, and <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>E, there are no additional flat cuts separating adjacent flat cuts of the continuous groove.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11B</figref>, another embodiment of cannula is illustrated having similarities to the cannulae of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref> and <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>E. In the illustrated embodiment, the cannula has a first plurality of thread roots <b>1141</b> and a second plurality of thread roots <b>1143</b> substantially as described above with respect to cannulae of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9B</figref>. However, the embodiment of cannula illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A-11B</figref> can include a retention region <b>1145</b> having a relatively high cannula outer diameter D<b>2</b> over the threaded portion <b>1120</b> of the cannula as compared to the outer diameter D<b>1</b> of the remainder of the cannula, such as the distal end <b>1110</b> or tip. In some embodiments, the retention region <b>1145</b> can include a corresponding region of relatively high cannula wall thickness, while in other embodiments, the outer diameter D<b>2</b> of the cannula can be increased at the retention region <b>1145</b> while the wall thickness remains substantially constant over a length of the cannula. Such a region having a relatively high outer diameter D<b>2</b> as compared to the outer diameter D<b>1</b> of the cannula at the distal end <b>1110</b> can advantageously provide enhanced retention at the incision site while having relatively low insertion force. In some embodiments, the outer diameter D<b>2</b> of the retention region <b>1145</b> of the cannula can be approximately 0.005 inches (or approximately 0.127 mm) larger than the outer diameter D<b>1</b> of the non-threaded portion of the cannula, such as the distal end <b>1110</b>.</p>
