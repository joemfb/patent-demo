<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a connector.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2010-277832 discloses a connector including a first housing and a second housing to be connected to the first housing with front surfaces of the two housings facing each other. A metal nut is embedded in the front surface of the first housing. The second housing has a support made of synthetic resin and is formed with an insertion hole that penetrates from the front surface to the rear surface of the second housing and a metal bolt penetrates through the insertion hole. The two housings are fit lightly together and the bolt is threaded into the nut and tightened so that the two housings are held in a connected state with the support held between a head of the bolt and the nut. Further, a seal ring is mounted between the rear surface of the support and the head portion of the bolt to prevent water from entering a clearance between the inner periphery of the insertion hole and the outer periphery of the bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The support and the seal ring are held strongly between the head of the bolt and the nut as the bolt is tightened. The support is made of synthetic resin and has higher rigidity than the seal ring. Thus, the seal ring is deformed and squeezed. The squeezing amount of the seal ring varies depending on bolt tightening strength. Hence, the squeezing amount of the seal ring is not constant and sealing performance by the seal ring may become unstable if a bolt tightening force varies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention was completed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to stabilize sealing performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to a connector with first and second housings that can be connected to one another with front surfaces of the housings facing one another. A support is provided at the front surface of the first housing. An insertion hole penetrates through the support and continues to the rear surface of the first housing. A metal bolt rotatably penetrates the insertion hole. A seal is mounted between the rear end surface of the support and a head of the bolt. A metal nut is retained in the second housing and is threadedly engaged with the bolt to connect the first and second housings. A stopper means is provided for preventing a threaded movement of the bolt by bringing metal parts into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The tightening amount of the bolt is specified by the contact of the metal parts in the stopper means with the bolt tightened and the two housings connected. Thus, the squeezing amount of the seal ring is stable and a stabilized sealing performance by the seal ring can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The support preferably is made of synthetic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The metal nut preferably is embedded in the front of the second housing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The stopper means preferably is formed to directly bring an end portion of an externally threaded portion formed on the bolt into contact with an end portion of an internally threaded portion formed in the nut. Thus, the bolt and the nut can be utilized effectively while remaining in existing shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An axial depth of an internally threaded portion of the nut preferably is longer than the axial length of an externally threaded portion of the bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The bolt preferably is retained at the first housing by the contact of a retaining ring and a locking surface of the housing and is allowed to rotate relative to the first housing by sliding in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the support.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first housing includes a first frame. First sub housings are assembled into the first frame and one or more terminal fittings are inserted into the first sub housings. The support is integral or unitary with the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The nut is mounted in a tubular mounting portion of the second housing with relative movements in the axial direction and/or rotation about the axial line prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent upon reading the following detailed description of preferred embodiments and accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A connector in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref> and includes first and second housings <b>10</b> and <b>30</b> that are connected using a bolt <b>20</b> and a nut <b>36</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A connecting side of the first housing <b>10</b> with the second housing <b>30</b> is referred to herein as the front.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first housing <b>10</b> includes a first frame <b>11</b> made e.g. of synthetic resin and first sub housings <b>12</b> made e.g. of synthetic resin are assembled into the first frame <b>11</b> from the front (left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Female first terminal fittings <b>13</b> are mounted in each first sub housing <b>12</b> of the first housing <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first frame <b>11</b> has a substantially square front shape, and a support <b>14</b> is formed unitarily in a central part of the first frame <b>11</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the support <b>14</b> includes a part extending forward from a rear wall <b>15</b> of the first frame <b>11</b> and a part extending rearward from the rear wall <b>15</b>. A circular insertion hole <b>16</b> penetrates from the front surface to the rear surface of the first frame <b>11</b> and a widened portion <b>17</b> is formed at the front of the insertion hole <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A bolt <b>20</b> is mounted in the support <b>14</b> while penetrating through the insertion hole <b>16</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> has a substantially cylindrical shaft <b>21</b> and a head <b>22</b> is formed unitarily at the rear end of the shaft <b>21</b>. The head <b>22</b> has a hexagonal outer periphery or any shape allowing for an operation of the bolt <b>20</b> such as a square or provided with Allen key shape (Imbuss). An externally threaded portion <b>23</b> is formed coaxially on a front portion of the shaft <b>21</b>. Further, a circumferentially extending locking groove <b>24</b> is formed at a position on the shaft <b>21</b> rearward of the externally threaded portion <b>23</b>. The head <b>22</b> has circular flange <b>25</b> substantially coaxial with the shaft <b>21</b> and having a larger diameter at the front end. The outer diameter of the flange <b>25</b> is substantially equal to the outer diameter of the support <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The bolt <b>20</b> is inserted into the insertion hole <b>16</b> from behind and a part of the shaft <b>21</b> in an area behind the locking groove <b>24</b> is accommodated in the insertion hole <b>16</b> for rotation about an axial line. A substantially U- or C-shaped retaining ring <b>26</b> is fit in the locking groove <b>24</b> near a rear part of the widened portion <b>17</b> of the insertion hole <b>16</b> and contacts a locking surface <b>28</b> at the rear end of the rear part of the widened portion <b>17</b> to prevent the bolt <b>20</b> from moving back and to retain the bolt <b>20</b> at the first housing <b>10</b>. However, the bolt <b>20</b> can rotate relative to the first housing <b>10</b> by sliding in contact with the inner peripheral surface of the support <b>14</b>. The head <b>22</b> and the flange <b>25</b> project back from the rear end of the support <b>14</b> when the bolt <b>20</b> is mounted in the support <b>24</b>, and the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> projects forward from the front surface of the first frame <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>5</b>, a seal ring <b>29</b> is mounted on a rear portion of the shaft <b>21</b> and is sandwiched between the rear surface of the support <b>14</b> and the front surface of the flange <b>25</b> in an axial direction AD. The seal ring <b>29</b> functions to prevent water from entering into a clearance between the inner periphery of the insertion hole <b>16</b> and the outer periphery of the bolt <b>20</b> from behind. In an unconnected state of the first and second housings <b>10</b> and <b>30</b>, the bolt <b>20</b> is not fastened to the nut <b>36</b> and is slightly movable in the axial direction AD relative to the support <b>14</b> between a foremost position where the flange <b>25</b> contacts and compresses the seal ring <b>29</b> and a rearmost position where the retaining ring <b>26</b> contacts the locking surface <b>28</b> of the widened portion <b>17</b> of the hole <b>16</b>. Accordingly, the seal ring <b>29</b> is neither deformed nor squeezed in the axial direction AD in the unconnected state of the housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the second housing <b>30</b> includes a second frame <b>31</b> made e.g. of synthetic resin, second sub housings <b>32</b> made e.g. of synthetic resin and assembled into the second frame <b>31</b> from the front (right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>), and a moving plate <b>33</b> mounted on the second frame <b>31</b> from the front. Male second terminal fittings <b>34</b> are mounted in each second sub housing <b>32</b>, and tabs at the leading ends of the respective second terminal fittings <b>34</b> are inserted through positioning holes of the moving plate <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second frame <b>31</b> has a substantially square front shape conforming to the front shape of the first housing <b>10</b> and a tubular mounting portion <b>35</b> penetrates from the front surface to the rear surface in a central part of the second frame <b>31</b>. The nut <b>36</b> is mounted in the tubular mounting portion <b>35</b> with relative movements in the axial direction AD and rotation about the axial line prevented. The mounted nut <b>36</b> is embedded in the front surface of the second housing <b>30</b> and may be insert molded into the second housing <b>30</b> or maintained therein by retaining means, such as splices, retaining rings or the like. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the nut <b>36</b> has a forwardly open internally threaded portion <b>37</b>. The inner diameter of the trough of the internally threaded portion <b>37</b> is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>. Further, the depth of the internally threaded portion <b>37</b> in the axial direction AD exceeds the length of the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> in the axial direction AD.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The two housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> are fit lightly together with their front surfaces facing each other and the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> threadedly engaged with the internally threaded portion <b>37</b> of the nut <b>36</b>. The bolt <b>20</b> then is rotated in a tightening direction e.g. by engaging a jig (not shown) with the head <b>22</b>. Thus, the bolt <b>20</b> moves closer to the nut <b>36</b> in the axial direction AD by the engagement of the threaded portions <b>23</b> and <b>37</b>. This movement of the bolt in the axial direction AD, causes the flange <b>25</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> to press the support <b>14</b> forward toward the second housing <b>30</b> via the seal ring <b>29</b> so that the first housing <b>10</b> moves toward the second housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A rear end <b>23</b>E of the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> contacts a front end portion <b>37</b>E of the internally threaded portion <b>37</b> of the nut <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> reach a properly connected state. The rear end <b>23</b>E is a transitional part between the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> and the a portion of the bolt <b>20</b> having no external thread and is axially in front of the retaining ring <b>26</b>. This direct contact of metal parts fixes a positional relationship of the bolt <b>20</b> and the nut <b>36</b> in the axial direction AD and prevents further tightening of the bolt <b>20</b> even if a tightening torque to the bolt <b>20</b> varies. In this way, tightening of the bolt <b>20</b> is completed and the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> are held in the connected state.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A front end <b>14</b>F of the support <b>14</b> does not contact the first frame <b>11</b> of the first housing <b>10</b> or the nut <b>36</b> when the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> are connected, and a clearance is formed between front surfaces of the nut <b>36</b> and the support <b>14</b>. That is, a pressing force acting back toward the head <b>22</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> due to the tightening of the bolt <b>20</b> is not applied to the support <b>14</b>. In this way, the squeezing amount of the seal ring <b>29</b> between the rear surface of the support <b>14</b> and the head <b>22</b> of the bolt <b>20</b> in the axial direction AD is stable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The connector includes the first housing <b>10</b> and the support <b>14</b> made e.g. of synthetic resin. The insertion hole <b>16</b> penetrates from the front surface to the rear surface of the first housing <b>10</b> and is part of the first housing <b>10</b>. The metal bolt <b>20</b> rotatably penetrates through the insertion hole <b>16</b>. The seal ring <b>29</b> is mounted between the rear surface of the support <b>14</b> and the head <b>22</b> of the bolt <b>20</b>. The second housing <b>30</b> is connected to the first housing <b>10</b> with the front surfaces of the housings facing each other. The metal nut <b>36</b> embedded in the front surface of the second housing <b>30</b> and connects the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> by being threadedly engaged with the bolt <b>20</b>. A stopper means (particularly the end of the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> and the end of the internally threaded portion <b>37</b>) are provided for preventing further threaded movement of the bolt <b>20</b> by bringing the metal parts into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to this construction, the squeezing amount of the seal ring <b>29</b> is stable since the tightening amount of the bolt <b>20</b> is specified by the contact of the metal parts in the stopper means with the bolt <b>20</b> tightened and the two housings <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> connected. In this way, stable sealing performance by the seal ring <b>29</b> is realized. Further, contacts of the metal parts are difficult to loosen due to a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion. Thus, the bolt <b>20</b> is difficult to loosen. Furthermore, the stopper means directly brings the end <b>23</b>E of the externally threaded portion <b>23</b> formed on the bolt <b>20</b> and the end <b>37</b>E of the internally threaded portion <b>37</b> formed in the nut <b>36</b> into contact, the bolt <b>20</b> and the nut <b>36</b> can be utilized effectively while remaining in existing shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention is not limited to the above described embodiment. For example, the following embodiments also are included in the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The end of the externally threaded portion of the bolt and the end of the internally threaded portion of the nut are brought into contact with each other as the stopper means in the above embodiment. However, the invention is not limited to this. A contact spaced from the externally threaded portion of the bolt and the end of the internally threaded portion of the nut may be brought into contact, or the end of the externally threaded portion of the bolt and a contact portion (such as a flange) spaced from the internally threaded portion of the nut may be brought into contact, or a contact portion formed at a distance from the externally threaded portion of the bolt and a contact portion at a distance from the internally threaded portion of the nut may be brought into contact.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The bolt and the nut directly contact as the stopper means in the above embodiment. However, the invention is not limited to this and the end of the externally threaded portion may be brought into contact with a metal part other than the nut or the end portion of the internally threaded portion (such as a metal flange on the nut) may contact a metal part other than the bolt. In this case, the ends of the externally and internally threaded portions may be brought into contact with one common metal part.</p>
