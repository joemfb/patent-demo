<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0004" num="0001">This invention relates to a device for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems. This invention relates to the aeronautical field and more particularly aircraft construction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">An aircraft fuselage usually has a structure made up of frames and stringers. The exterior shell of the fuselage is fastened onto the frames and stringers. When the aircraft is intended to fly at high altitude, considering the outside temperatures to which it is to be subjected, it is necessary to implement a thermal insulation of the fuselage. It then is known to cover the interior face of the skin forming the shell of the fuselage with insulating blankets in the form of flexible strips or panels. These blankets are called skin blankets. It also is advisable to thermally insulate each frame. There then are used blankets having a structure similar to that of the skin blankets, but the shape of which is adapted for coming to encase the frames inside the fuselage. These blankets hereinafter are called frame blankets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">The frames of the fuselage also serve as supports for various systems. By systems there is understood here equipment items of the aircraft as well as the electrical wirings, the hydraulic systems, the pneumatic systems, the air ducts for ventilation and pressurization inside the fuselage, . . . .</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">Holes then are made in the frames of the fuselage on the one hand to allow fastening of the insulating blankets and on the other hand to allow support and fastening of systems. These holes weaken the frames and sometimes must be compensated for by structural reinforcements, which thus complicates the design of the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005">Moreover, as regards the blankets, it is advisable to adapt their shape to the various fastening devices provided. Holes, cut-outs, notches, . . . must be provided in the blankets to allow passage of a fastening device, fitting to the structure of the fuselage, . . . . The holes and notches made in the blankets degrade their insulating performance and are sources of thermal (and acoustic) bridges and they thus reduce the performances of the blankets.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0006">It therefore is advisable at the same time to limit the number of holes made in the structure of the aircraft (frame and/or other structural part) as well as in the insulating blankets (skin blankets and frame blankets).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0007">The document FR-2 933 376 thus shows, for example, a device for fastening an insulating blanket and a method for installing an insulating blanket in an aircraft fuselage making it possible to limit the number of holes to be made in the frames of the aircraft. The device described in this document comprises a portion forming a hook adapted for coming to cap a flank of the frame and grip the latter by itself or in cooperation with a structural element of the aircraft so as to ensure fastening of the device to the frame. One embodiment of this device comprises a first frame-blanket clip borne by a first member intended to extend on the first side of the frame, a second frame-blanket clip borne by a second member intended to extend on the second side of the frame, a first skin-blanket clip borne by the first member and a second skin-blanket clip borne by the second member.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0008">This invention then has as a purpose to provide a system allowing on the one hand the holding of insulating blankets and on the other hand the support of systems while at the same time limiting the holes to be made in the structure of the aircraft (frame, . . . ) and on the other hand in the said insulating blankets.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0009">Advantageously, the implementation of such a system will be easy and/or at a limited cost price and/or with a mass as small as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0010">For this purpose, this invention proposes a device for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems in an aircraft, comprising a base having two ends from each of which an arm extends.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0011">According to this invention, at least one arm has a U-shaped part having two more or less parallel branches, and the said device further comprises at least one support for accommodating a system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0012">The structure comprising the base and the two arms makes it possible to mount the device on a frame and to hold an insulating blanket. As to the U-shaped part, it allows precise positioning of the device in relation to the structure on which the device is mounted by coming to cooperate with a structural element that comes to be accommodated between the branches of the U-shaped part. The latter may be either added onto the arm in question, or the arm itself may be U-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0013">In a device according to this invention, it may be provided that the base of elongated shape defines a plane, referred to as reference plane, and that the arms extend more or less perpendicular to the said reference plane.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0014">The device according to the invention may be such that the base of elongated shape, the arms and the U-shaped part form only a single part. Such an assembly then is elastic and its elastic deformation may be used for holding an insulating blanket in position on a frame.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0015">For a greater adjustability and adaptability of the device according to this invention, at least one support advantageously is a separate part equipped with assembly means, and the base and/or at least one arm comprises complementary assembly means making it possible to accommodate the said support. In such an embodiment variant, the said assembly means and the said complementary assembly means preferably allow an assembly and a reversible locking by means of elastic deformation. In this way, there is no risk of unintentional dismantling of the support.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0016">This invention also relates to an aircraft fuselage section, comprising frames, an outer skin fastened onto the frames with the aid of fastening parts called stabilizers, at least one insulating blanket, characterized in that an insulating blanket is fastened onto a frame with the aid of at least one device such as described above, so that the said frame is situated between the arms of the said device and the said insulating blanket is situated between the said frame and the said device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0017">In such an aircraft fuselage section, the branches of the U-shaped part are disposed, for example, on both sides of a wall of a stabilizer. In that way, an indexing of the position of the device in relation to the structure of the aircraft is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0018">In order to achieve a better insulation, it may be provided that the same insulating blanket covers on the one hand a surface portion of the outer skin and on the other hand, at least partially, a frame section. In this case, a skin blanket also serves as a frame blanket and that makes it possible to avoid a connection between two insulating blankets.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0019">In an aircraft fuselage section according to this invention, at least one insulating blanket may be connected to an adjoining insulating blanket with the aid of a hook-and-loop system, for example a connection system known under the trade name Velcro.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0020">Finally, this invention also relates to an aircraft, characterized in that it comprises at least one fuselage section such as described above.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show a stirrup-shaped part comprising a base <b>2</b> from which two arms extend.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0040">It will be assumed arbitrarily that base <b>2</b> extends more or less in a vertical plane and that the arms are disposed so that one has an upper arm <b>4</b> and a lower arm <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0041">Base <b>2</b> has an inner face <b>8</b> and an outer face <b>10</b>. Inner face <b>8</b>, disposed between upper arm <b>4</b> and lower arm <b>6</b>, is in the form of a tape forming a wave <b>12</b> between two recesses <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0042">Outer face <b>10</b> of base <b>2</b> is more or less plane (and vertical). It extends over all or part of the height of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0043">The part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is made, for example, of molded synthetic material and the space between inner face <b>8</b> and outer face <b>10</b> is filled, for example, with this synthetic material. As a variant, one could have a hollow part, the connection between inner face <b>8</b> and outer face <b>10</b> then being implemented with the aid of side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0044">Upper arm <b>4</b> forms only a single part with base <b>2</b>. It is assumed that it extends in a horizontal plane, perpendicular to outer face <b>10</b> of base <b>2</b>. This upper arm <b>4</b> is more or less plane and ends at its free end with a return oriented toward the inside of the part (that is to say between the two arms thereof) and directed toward base <b>2</b>, so as to form a first hook <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0045">Lower arm <b>6</b> itself also extends in a more or less horizontal plane, perpendicular to outer face <b>10</b> of base <b>2</b>. In addition, it also has a second hook <b>18</b> curved toward base <b>2</b> inside the part.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0046">Lower arm <b>6</b>, and more precisely second hook <b>18</b>, is extended by a U-shaped part having two more or less parallel branches. The presence of a relatively short first branch <b>20</b> and of a second branch <b>22</b> considerably longer than first branch <b>20</b> is seen on the Figures. The base of the U-shaped part is formed by the median zone of second hook <b>18</b>. As is apparent from the Figures, first branch <b>20</b> and second branch <b>22</b> extend from second hook <b>18</b> moving away from base <b>2</b>. The space between first branch <b>20</b> and second branch <b>22</b> forms a housing <b>24</b>. Second branch <b>22</b> extends parallel to first branch <b>20</b> in a vertical plane more or less perpendicular to outer face <b>10</b> of base <b>2</b> and bears a more or less horizontal plate <b>26</b> at its free end.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0047">The part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is intended to be equipped with supports, as illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, to allow fastening of systems onto a structure such as that shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an assembly integrating the structure shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, insulating blankets and a device for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems according to this invention and comprising the part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0048">The structure shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has a frame <b>28</b> onto which a skin <b>30</b> is fastened with the aid of parts called stabilizers <b>32</b>. Each stabilizer has a part forming bracket <b>34</b> to make it possible to connect skin <b>30</b> to frame <b>28</b> and a rib <b>36</b> which extends perpendicular to the two faces of bracket <b>34</b> and which thus makes it possible to make the connection between frame <b>28</b> and skin <b>30</b> rigid.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0049">It is seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that frame <b>28</b> is Z-shaped. Reverting to the orientation defined above, frame <b>28</b> thus has an upper flange <b>38</b>, a core <b>40</b> and a lower flange <b>42</b>. Frame <b>28</b> is a sectional piece with the shape of an arc of a circle. In a first approximation, it is assumed here, however, that it is a rectilinear sectional piece. In this approximation, it then is assumed that core <b>40</b> extends in a vertical plane (parallel to outer face <b>10</b>) and that, as to flanges <b>38</b> and <b>42</b>, they extend perpendicular to core <b>40</b> in a horizontal plane. As may be seen on the drawings, upper flange <b>38</b> extends on one side of core <b>40</b> while lower flange <b>42</b> extends on the other side of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show how the device according to the invention is positioned in relation to the structure shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Upper arm <b>4</b> passes over upper flange <b>38</b> and first hook <b>16</b> comes around the free edge of upper flange <b>38</b> of frame <b>28</b>. At the lower level, lower flange <b>42</b> of frame <b>28</b> comes to be accommodated in a recess <b>14</b> of inner face <b>8</b> of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0051">As may be seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an insulating blanket called frame blanket <b>44</b> is disposed around frame <b>28</b>, between the latter and the part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. By virtue of the elasticity of this part, frame blanket <b>44</b> is firmly held on frame <b>28</b>. The part from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> brings about a clamping at first hook <b>16</b> and wave <b>12</b>. As to the free end of second hook <b>18</b>, it comes to bear on a face of core <b>40</b>, close to lower flange <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0052">The presence of insulating blankets against outer skin <b>30</b> also is seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. These insulating blankets are in the form of strips extending between two frames <b>28</b> in each instance. Each of these blankets is called skin blanket <b>46</b>. To ensure a good continuity in the insulation, frame blanket <b>44</b> is fastened to each of skin blankets <b>46</b> situated on both sides of frame <b>28</b>. A hook-and-loop connection system, better known under the trade name Velcro, may be provided here.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0053">As may be seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, the part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> bears systems supports. Thus, outer face <b>10</b> of base <b>2</b> bears a first conduit support <b>48</b> such as that shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Mounting of first conduit support <b>48</b> is implemented on base <b>2</b> by a mortise-and-tenon type fastening. As may be seen in particular on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, outer face <b>10</b> comprises a groove <b>50</b> in which a foot <b>52</b> with shape complementary to first conduit support <b>48</b> comes to slide. It is provided that foot <b>52</b> can enter groove <b>50</b> via only one side and that when foot <b>52</b> slides into groove <b>50</b> and reaches end of travel, locking means make it possible to hold first conduit support <b>48</b> on base <b>2</b>. A tongue piece <b>54</b> provided on base <b>2</b> serves for unlocking the said locking means.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0054">First conduit support <b>48</b> further comprises a collar <b>56</b> mounted on a base <b>58</b> forming only a single part with foot <b>52</b>. Collar <b>52</b> is of a size adapted for accommodating an air duct <b>60</b> as illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0055">Electrical conduits <b>62</b> also may be fastened in relation to the structure shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with a device according to this invention. In the embodiment shown, second conduit supports <b>64</b> are provided. Such a second conduit support <b>64</b> comprises a base <b>68</b> topping a foot <b>70</b> and itself bearing two jaws <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0056">Base <b>68</b> has the shape of a curved band. Each of its two ends forms a hinge <b>74</b> onto which a jaw <b>72</b> is jointed so as to be able to pivot in relation to base <b>68</b>. Each of jaws <b>72</b> also has the overall shape of a curved band. The two jaws <b>72</b> are connected with one another by a third hinge <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0057">Second conduit support <b>64</b> is shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in closed position. In open position, jaws <b>72</b> are pivoted approximately 90&#xb0; outward in relation to the position shown on this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and thus form a W. When an electrical conduit <b>62</b> comes to rest at the center of this W, jaws <b>72</b> again close to come into the position shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and grip corresponding electrical conduit <b>62</b>. It may be seen that by virtue of the presence of an outer tongue piece <b>66</b> and a set of hooks <b>76</b>, second conduit support <b>64</b> is locked in closed position, preventing any unintentional displacement of electrical conduit <b>62</b> out of the housing provided on second conduit support <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0058">Foot <b>70</b> of second conduit support <b>64</b> comprises a circular support plate <b>78</b> from which there extends, on the side opposite base <b>68</b>, a rod having a truncated head <b>80</b>. This is made of an elastic material such as rubber or a similar synthetic material. Its vertex forms a circle with diameter smaller than the diameter of bores <b>82</b> formed on the one hand on base <b>58</b> and on the other hand on plate <b>26</b>. As to the base of truncated head <b>80</b>, it forms a circle with diameter larger than the diameter of bores <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0059">In that way, truncated head <b>80</b> may be inserted through a bore <b>82</b>, but once the base of this truncated head <b>80</b> has gone through said bore <b>82</b>, it becomes difficult to withdraw it in the other direction, the periphery of the base of truncated head <b>80</b> coming to rest flat around corresponding bore <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0060">The position of the device for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems described above is indexed by virtue of the presence of the U-shaped part and corresponding housing <b>24</b>. This housing is adapted for accommodating a rib <b>36</b> of a stabilizer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0061">The device for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems described above makes it possible, with a single device, to fasten systems on two sides of the same frame. In fact, it is seen that a part of the device passes underneath the frame to allow fastening systems on the other side of the frame. As may be seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at the site of this &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; of frames, frame blanket <b>44</b> is adapted so as to make it possible to achieve a good insulation at second branch <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment variant in which the said frame &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; is not implemented. The part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> corresponds to the part shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The only difference here is found at second branch <b>22</b>. Here, instead of second branch <b>22</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, one has a second branch <b>22</b>&#x2033; identical to first branch <b>20</b>. The U-shaped part at second hook <b>18</b> here also forms a housing <b>24</b> that serves for indexing of the device when the latter is mounted on a frame.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate a third embodiment of a device for holding a blanket and for fastening systems according to this invention. In this embodiment variant, indexing of the position of the device on the structure shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> no longer is accomplished in relation to a rib <b>36</b> of a stabilizer <b>32</b>, but in relation to a bracket <b>34</b> of such a stabilizer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0064">The structure of this new embodiment is close to that of the embodiment described above and to its variant.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0065">For this new embodiment, there thus again are found in particular a base <b>102</b> and an upper arm <b>104</b>. It is assumed here that the device is oriented in the same manner as above. Base <b>102</b> therefore extends in a more or less vertical plane, while, as to upper arm <b>104</b>, it extends more or less horizontally. Base <b>102</b> here also has an inner face <b>108</b> and an outer face <b>110</b>. In this embodiment variant, there also again is found an inner face forming a wave <b>112</b> disposed between two recesses <b>114</b>. A difference here is that inner face <b>108</b> is of limited width on the upper arm <b>104</b> side in relation to the lower end of inner face <b>108</b>. The latter has a lower edge <b>184</b>. From each of the ends of this lower edge <b>184</b>, a lower arm <b>106</b> extends in each instance. Each lower arm <b>106</b> has a horizontal part extending from base <b>102</b> and has a second hook <b>118</b> at its free end. In this way a housing <b>124</b> is defined between the two lower arms <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0066">The two lower arms <b>106</b> and lower edge <b>184</b> form a U-shaped part, the two arms <b>106</b> extending parallel. The distance between the two lower arms <b>106</b> is adapted for accommodating a bracket <b>34</b> of a stabilizer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0067">Outer face <b>110</b> itself also has a groove <b>150</b> similar in every respect to groove <b>50</b> of the embodiment from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. This groove <b>150</b> is intended to cooperate with first conduit support <b>48</b> shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Similar locking means as well as an unlocking tongue piece <b>154</b> are found again here. On <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, there has been shown a third conduit support <b>186</b> that comes to cooperate with outer face <b>110</b> of base <b>102</b> in exactly the same manner as first conduit support <b>48</b>. This third conduit support <b>186</b> therefore comprises a foot <b>152</b> similar in every respect to foot <b>52</b> described above. This foot <b>152</b> bears a collar <b>156</b> by way of a base <b>158</b>. In the embodiment shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, base <b>158</b> does not have bores such as bores <b>82</b> implemented on base <b>58</b>. An embodiment variant, however, could provide for such bores or other means for accommodating a system support.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0068">Here, in this embodiment, collar <b>156</b> of third conduit support <b>186</b> is provided for fastening an air duct. At its outer periphery, collar <b>156</b> has two housings <b>188</b> each intended to accommodate an electrical conduit, such as electrical conduits <b>62</b> shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0069">The device for holding a blanket and for fastening systems shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> may be used in an environment similar to the one shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. For the sake of clarity, the insulating blankets have not been shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Here also, a frame blanket is intended to become positioned between frame blanket <b>38</b> and the device according to the invention shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Here also, a holding of this blanket is accomplished by means of elasticity with the aid of first hook <b>116</b> mounted at the free end of upper arm <b>104</b> and by bearing of wave <b>112</b> which comes to clip the frame blanket against core <b>40</b> of frame <b>38</b>. The free end of lower arms <b>106</b> each forms a second hook <b>118</b> which comes to bear on core <b>40</b> of frame <b>38</b>. Here, indexing of the device for holding a blanket and for fastening systems is accomplished by positioning the said device in relation to a bracket <b>34</b> of a stabilizer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 14</figref> show another embodiment of a device for holding a blanket and for fastening systems according to this invention. In this embodiment, as in the preceding embodiments, there again is found a base from the ends of which two arms extend. In this embodiment, a base <b>202</b> thus is found again. Reverting to the same orientation as above, in this embodiment it then should be considered that base <b>202</b> here extends in a horizontal plane. Moreover, base <b>202</b> is disposed in a higher position in relation to the described device. Here there also is found again, as in the other embodiments described above, arms extending from the ends of the base of the device. In the embodiments described above, upper arms <b>4</b>, <b>104</b> and lower arms <b>6</b>, <b>106</b> were involved. In this embodiment, the arms extend along a more or less vertical direction. There then is a first arm <b>204</b> and a second arm <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0071">First arm <b>204</b> is more or less plane. It has means allowing fastening of a support such as, for example, a fourth conduit support <b>290</b> shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. On its outer face, that is to say its face opposite second arm <b>206</b>, first arm <b>202</b> also comprises a groove <b>250</b> so as to be able to accommodate fourth conduit support <b>290</b> and be connected thereto by a mortise-and-tenon type connection. As may be seen in particular on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, first arm <b>204</b> also bears, on both sides of groove <b>250</b>, tongue pieces <b>292</b> making it possible to bring about a locking of fourth conduit support <b>290</b> in groove <b>250</b>. It is seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> that, as to fourth conduit support <b>290</b>, it has a rib <b>294</b> with shape complementary to that of groove <b>250</b> as well as stops <b>296</b> intended to cooperate with tongue pieces <b>292</b> so as to bring about a locking of fourth conduit support <b>290</b> on first arm <b>204</b>. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the fourth conduit support comprises a collar <b>256</b> intended to accommodate an air duct.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0072">Second arm <b>206</b> has a more complex shape than first arm <b>204</b>. In a side view, the space between first arm <b>204</b> and second arm <b>206</b> forms an L, the base of the L being disposed against base <b>202</b>. Starting from base <b>202</b>, second arm <b>206</b> is therefore first of all relatively far away from first arm <b>204</b>, then draws closer thereto. Second arm <b>206</b> comprises a plane part <b>298</b> which corresponds to the close part of first arm <b>204</b>. The end of plane part <b>298</b>, opposite base <b>202</b>, bears a flange <b>300</b> that extends from plane part <b>298</b> parallel to base <b>202</b> moving away from first arm <b>204</b>. A side wall <b>302</b> extends in a plane perpendicular to plane part <b>298</b> and to flange <b>300</b>, connecting said plane part <b>298</b> and said flange <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0073">There is seen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) on side wall <b>302</b> the presence of a wall <b>304</b> parallel to said side wall <b>302</b> and connected to the latter by a connecting part <b>306</b> extending perpendicular to side wall <b>302</b> and to parallel wall <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0074">On both sides of parallel wall <b>304</b> there extends, in each instance, a rod <b>308</b> that extends from side wall <b>302</b> and perpendicular thereto. As may be seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, these toothed rods <b>308</b> are intended to accommodate a support plate <b>310</b> which, in mounted position, extends parallel to side wall <b>302</b>. For a better holding of support plate <b>310</b>, there is provided on connecting part <b>306</b> a small guiding rail <b>312</b> that comes to cooperate with a groove made in a projection <b>314</b> extending from one face of support plate <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0075">As indicated above, the device shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 14</figref> can accommodate a support such as fourth conduit support <b>290</b> shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, same then being mounted on first arm <b>204</b>. It also is seen on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> that this device bears a fifth conduit support <b>316</b>, which is shown in greater detail on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This fifth conduit support <b>315</b> is intended more particularly for fastening of an electrical conduit. For the mounting of this fifth support <b>316</b>, a groove <b>318</b> is made on the outer face of second arm <b>206</b>, in immediate proximity to base <b>202</b>. Fifth conduit support <b>316</b> has a foot <b>320</b> bearing a sectional rail <b>322</b> with section complementary to that of groove <b>318</b>. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 16</figref>, locking means also are provided to make it possible to guarantee a good holding of fifth conduit support <b>316</b> in groove <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0076">For mounting of the device, first arm <b>204</b> and second arm <b>206</b> are moved away from one another so as to come to overlap a frame <b>28</b>. As indicated above, the space between first arm <b>204</b> and second arm <b>206</b> has an L shape and in this way is adapted for accommodating on the one hand core <b>40</b> of frame <b>28</b> (between first arm <b>204</b> and second arm <b>206</b>) and on the other hand upper flange <b>38</b> of said frame <b>28</b> (close to base <b>202</b>). By means of elasticity, the described device then comes to hold a frame blanket covering frame <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> proposes an original mounting in which there no longer is a frame blanket <b>44</b> but only skin blankets <b>46</b>&#x2032;. Skin blanket <b>46</b>&#x2032; is extended on one side to cover a frame <b>28</b>. A connection between two blankets thus is avoided. In fact, it suffices to provide a connection between two successive skin blankets <b>46</b>&#x2032;. The devices for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 13</figref> allow such a mounting without a frame blanket.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0078">The device described above, when it is installed on frame <b>28</b>, is placed so that a rib <b>36</b> of a stabilizer <b>32</b> comes to be positioned in the housing situated between side wall <b>302</b> and parallel wall <b>304</b>. In that way, the position of the device for holding an insulating blanket and for fastening systems is indexed in relation to frame <b>28</b>. Since skin blanket <b>46</b>&#x2032; also comes to cover rib <b>36</b> of stabilizer <b>32</b>, support plate <b>310</b> comes to contribute to a better holding of the said blanket on the structure. This support plate <b>310</b> also allows a better fastening of the device onto the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0079">The various devices described above therefore allow holding of an insulating blanket on a frame as well as fastening of systems in relation to the structure of an aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0080">An advantage of all these devices is that they may be adapted easily in particular as regards fastening of systems. In fact, to the individual skilled in the art, the devices described will appear to be adjustable. For example, an electrical-conduit support may be arranged instead of an air-duct support. It also is possible to adapt the number of conduit/duct supports borne by the device. Moreover, it is seen that the devices described above make it possible to adapt to many solutions for the passing through of supported systems and may support all types of systems, because it suffices to adapt the supports mounted on the arms and/or the branches to the systems to be fastened.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0081">The devices according to this invention also have the great advantage of being able to provide supporting of cables and ducts/conduits without having to make holes in or modify the structure of the aircraft. Moreover, except for the first embodiment shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, it is not necessary to adapt the insulating blankets for installation and mounting of the devices according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0082">Mounting of these various devices may be accomplished without tools, or at least without specific tools. These devices also are designed for being able to be easily remounted and dismantled in the same position as prior to dismantling.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0083">Finally, the devices according to this invention are easy and quick to implement. Mounting (and dismantling) time is limited. In addition, if the devices according to the invention are made of synthetic material, it is possible to have devices with reduced weight, which of course is advantageous for a mounting in an aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0084">This invention is not limited to the embodiments described above by way of non-limitative examples, or to the indicated variants. It also relates to all the embodiment variants within the capacity of the individual skilled in the art in the context of the claims below.</p>
