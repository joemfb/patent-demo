<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A circuit for detection of an HDMI source device to an HDMI sink device through an HDMI sink connector without regard for the activity state of the HDMI source device has a pull-up resistor having first and second terminals with the first terminal coupled to a DC power source. A switching device is coupled between the pull-up resistor's second terminal and ground at a circuit node. The switching device is switched on to couple the circuit node to ground when power is applied to a control terminal thereof from the HDMI sink connector power pin, and being switched off otherwise. The circuit node is coupled to a DDC/CEC GROUND pin of the HDMI sink connector. The circuit node is readable as a binary signal to indicate the presence of a source device to the HDMI sink connector, wherein the node exhibits a logic low signal when either the node is grounded by the DDC/CEC GROUND pin connection to a source device or when the switching device is switched on. This abstract is not to be considered limiting, since other embodiments may deviate from the features described in this abstract.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As the number of inputs on a TV receiver increases, including inputs compliant with the HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) specification, the time it takes the user to toggle through all the inputs increases. Furthermore, due to the presence of digital video processing, for video scaling significant time can be required to determine the incoming video format and then to process it into a form suitable for the display device. As the user toggles through the multiple inputs, some inputs incur a further delay due to the authentication process of HDCP (High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection). The net result is that the user may incur significant and annoying delay when cycling through inputs before a video image is displayed on the display device.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail specific embodiments, with the understanding that the present disclosure of such embodiments is to be considered as an example of the principles and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described. In the description below, like reference numerals are used to describe the same, similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d;, as used herein, are defined as one or more than one. The term &#x201c;plurality&#x201d;, as used herein, is defined as two or more than two. The term &#x201c;another&#x201d;, as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms &#x201c;including&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;having&#x201d;, as used herein, are defined as comprising (i.e., open language). The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d;, as used herein, is defined as connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically. The term &#x201c;program&#x201d; or &#x201c;computer program&#x201d; or similar terms, as used herein, is defined as a sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer system. A &#x201c;program&#x201d;, or &#x201c;computer program&#x201d;, may include a subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method, an object implementation, in an executable application, an applet, a servlet, a source code, an object code, a shared library/dynamic load library and/or other sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Reference throughout this document to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;certain embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; or similar terms means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of such phrases or in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein is to be interpreted as an inclusive or meaning any one or any combination. Therefore, &#x201c;A, B or C&#x201d; means &#x201c;any of the following: A; B; C; A and B; A and C; B and C; A, B and C&#x201d;. An exception to this definition will occur only when a combination of elements, functions, steps or acts are in some way inherently mutually exclusive.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As noted above, as the number of inputs on a TV receiver increases, the time it takes the user to toggle through all the inputs increases. Furthermore, due to the presence of digital video processing, significant time can be required to determine the incoming video format and then to process it into a form suitable for the display device. As the user toggles through the multiple inputs, some inputs incur a further delay due to the authentication process of HDCP. The net result is that the user may incur significant and annoying delay when cycling through inputs before a video image is displayed on the display device. Heretofore, this problem grows as TV receiver devices have increasing numbers of inputs, yet the problem noted herein has gone unrecognized and unaddressed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In order to improve the user's experience, it is advantageous to adopt a &#x201c;plug and play&#x201d; strategy that incorporates automatic input detection. The above-referenced patent applications utilize mechanical switch detection. Embodiments consistent with the present invention utilize ground detection and power detection along with a polling arrangement to provide automatic input detection. The problem is ameliorated in a HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) display input by use of embodiments consistent with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments consistent with the present invention, ground detection at the DDC/CEC ground pin of the HDMI connector can be used as an indication of the presence of an HDMI source device connected to the HDMI connector. Additionally, the addition of a transistor and a resistor (or other electronic switching device) can allow for the detection of a source device with out having to wait for actual display of the video. The mechanism disclosed herein using a logical &#x201c;OR&#x201d; of two deterministic qualities of the HDMI interface to determine whether or not a source device is present or not.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the HDMI specification (e.g., version 1.3, a publicly available specification that is hereby incorporated by reference) a source device is supposed to output +5 V on the DDC (Display Data Channel) +5V line (pin <b>18</b>) when the source device is active, however, there is no requirement for source device to turn off or remove the +5V when the source is inactive. Hence merely detecting the presence of the DDC +5V is insufficient to determine that the source is connected, but inactive. Ideally, it is advantageous to not only discover that an HDMI input has a source connected thereto, but also to determine that the source is actually active.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is generally the case that the grounds in a HDMI cable are not tied together; but, often in either a source or sink device, the grounds are tied together. Here, the slow speed signal ground, i.e. the ground for the DDC (Display Data Channel) and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) lines, is not tied directly to ground in the TV receiver. Instead, the slow speed signal ground is connected to the collector of a transistor or the Drain of a FET. Even without the presence of the DDC +5V, the shorting of this ground lead will pull down the signal line, and the TV can detect that a device is connected to that input, albeit not necessarily active.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Once the source device becomes active it must supply +5V on the DDC +5V line in order to be compliant with the HDMI specification, so the transistor will be turned on, and it will actively pull down the ground line to ground.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment consistent with the present invention is depicted for circuitry in an HDMI sink device such as a video display. HDMI connector <b>10</b> is depicted schematically with all of its pin connections as would be present in certain embodiments of an HDMI connector for an HDMI sink.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one embodiment consistent with the present invention is depicted for circuitry in an HDMI sink device such as a video display. HDMI connector <b>10</b> is depicted schematically with all of its pin connections as would be present in certain embodiments of an HDMI connector for an HDMI sink. Other embodiments of a connector interface similar to an HDMI connector may also utilize embodiments of the present invention in the event they operate in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this embodiment, an NPN transistor <b>14</b> and a collector resistor <b>18</b> are used as a switching mechanism as described. In this example embodiment, the base of transistor <b>14</b> is coupled to the +5 volt power (pin <b>18</b>) <b>22</b> of the HDMI connector <b>10</b>. The DDC/CEC ground (pin <b>17</b>) <b>26</b> of the HDMI connector <b>10</b> is coupled to the junction of the collector of transistor <b>14</b> and resistor <b>18</b>, with the other end of resistor <b>18</b> connected to a DC power source suitable for the logic circuitry of the HDMI sink (e.g., 3.3 volts). The transistor <b>14</b> is shown to have internal base to emitter resistor and series base resistor, but these components could also be provided as external components. The emitter of transistor <b>14</b> is coupled to ground. The connector <b>10</b> also may have a ground shield <b>30</b> as depicted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Interconnection with the TMDS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) processing circuitry <b>32</b>, nonvolatile memory <b>36</b> and the Hot Plug Detection driver <b>40</b> and associated series resistor <b>42</b> are depicted for completeness.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, per the HDMI specification, when a source device outputs +5 V on the DDC (Display Data Channel) +5V line (pin <b>18</b>) at <b>22</b> when the source device is active, transistor <b>14</b> turns on and places the collector at a logic low level and establishes the DDC/CEC ground level. However, as noted above, there is no requirement for source device to turn off or remove the +5V when the source is inactive. Hence merely detecting the presence of the DDC +5V is insufficient to determine that the source is connected, but inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As also noted above, it is generally the case that the grounds in a HDMI cable are not tied together; but, often in either a source or sink device, the grounds are tied together. Here, the slow speed signal ground, i.e. the ground for the DDC (Display Data Channel) and CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) lines, is not tied directly to ground in the TV receiver. Instead, the slow speed signal ground is connected to the collector of transistor <b>14</b>. When +5V power at <b>22</b> is not present, the shorting of line <b>26</b> to ground will pull down the signal line at <b>26</b>, and the TV can detect that a device is connected to the HDMI connector. Once the source device becomes active it must supply +5V on the DDC +5V line in order to be compliant with the HDMI specification, so the transistor will be turned on, and it will actively pull down the ground line to ground. Hence, the sink ground for DDC/CEC is provided at line or node <b>26</b> only when a source is providing a path for ground at line or node <b>26</b> OR when the +5V power is applied at line <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">But, when no device is connected to the HDMI connector <b>10</b>, there is no ground at line or node <b>26</b> and line or node <b>26</b> is at a logic high state indicating no connected source at the HDMI connector <b>10</b>. In this event, when a user is cycling through inputs, a high at line or node <b>26</b> (-CONNECT) is indicative that no device is connected to the HDMI connector, and the input can be rapidly skipped. But a logic low signal, whether by virtue of transistor <b>14</b> being turned on or by virtue of DDC/CEC GROUND at pin <b>17</b> (line or node <b>26</b>) is indicative that there is a device connected to the connector. By lifting line or node <b>26</b> through resistor <b>18</b> rather than directly grounding line or node <b>26</b> at the sink device, the ground connection serves the dual function of signaling the presence of a connected device. Preferably, a capacitor <b>28</b> is provided between line <b>26</b> and ground in order to provide a low impedance AC path to ground (i.e. a high frequency ground) to help ensure signal integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the present description is provided in terms of a HDMI sink such as a television display device, it could also be implemented in an HDMI repeater, which for purposes of this document is to be construed as falling within the category of HDMI sink devices. It is also noted that the detection and pull down mechanism could be implemented in other ways, for example, instead of an NPN transistor as shown in the drawing an FET, FET based switch, a logic switch, a PNP transistor or even a relay could be utilized without departing from embodiments consistent with the present invention. It is well understood how to use these devices as switches and thus detailed schematics need not be presented for each example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts this concept in a more generic representation where transistor <b>14</b> is depicted as a switching device <b>114</b> which is controlled by an input at <b>22</b>, turns on upon application of +5V at line <b>22</b> and pulls line <b>26</b> to ground. When the switch is turned on by virtue of a signal at line <b>22</b>, node or line <b>26</b> is pulled to ground (a logic low state), but when no signal is present at line <b>22</b>, the switching device is turned off (open circuit between node <b>26</b> and ground) to cause a logic high state through pull-up resistor <b>18</b>. In this generic embodiment, it is presumed that the switching device is stable in that it will remain open circuited when there is no connection to line <b>22</b>, and hence may utilize a pull-down resistor for noise immunity as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is noted that a sink device may incorporate multiple HDMI inputs. As such, each HDMI input can be monitored in the manner disclosed. This can be done in parallel or an equivalent simultaneous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is seen that an HDMI sink device <b>46</b> can have multiple HDMI sink connectors <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B, <b>50</b>C through <b>50</b>D. Each of the HDMI sink connectors can have a corresponding plurality of circuits such as those described above shown as connection state detectors <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>54</b>C through <b>54</b>D respectively. The connection status of each of the connection state detectors <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B, <b>54</b>C through <b>54</b>D can be polled periodically or as required by a polling processor <b>58</b> with the polling results stored in a storage device such as memory <b>62</b> or logic to simply combine the connected states of the inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">One exemplary process used in accordance with the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as process <b>100</b> starting at <b>104</b>. At <b>108</b>, the sink device is powered up and a counter N is initialized to 1 at <b>112</b> in preparation for an initial polling of the sink connectors. At <b>116</b>, the Nth (first) connection state detector is polled by the polling processor <b>58</b> and the results of the polling are stored in memory <b>62</b> at <b>120</b>. If the last connector has not been polled yet at <b>124</b>, the counter is incremented by one at <b>128</b> and the process returns to <b>116</b>. If the last connector has been polled at <b>124</b>, then all of the connectors have been polled and the process introduces a wait period at <b>132</b> which can be determined to be a reasonable time period for polling the connectors. Once this wait period has expired, control returns to <b>112</b> where the process is repeated at a frequency corresponding to the wait period.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The arrangement disclosed is not an active detection mechanism, but rather a deterministic mechanism. Upon power up, the sink device can check each input for the presence of signal. The sink device can then memorize the connection status of each input. Hence, when the user makes an input selection request, the sink device can skip inputs that do not have a connection, thereby avoiding delays associated with inputs that are inactive and enhancing the speed at which the user can exercise control over his or her system and avoid the delays associated with cycling through inputs that are not connected. In order to assure that the connection state of each input is accurately memorized, each input's stored connection state should be refreshed by polling at a suitably frequent interval. The state of each input can be stored, for example, in non-volatile memory <b>36</b>, memory <b>62</b> or any other suitable storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the present embodiment uses positive logic conventions, analogous circuitry could be used to generate negative logic or to reverse the indication of a connection so that a low signal means no connection and a high signal means a connection to the sink device without deviating from embodiments consistent with the invention. Buffering or inversion of the signal at node or line <b>26</b> may be used in certain embodiments.</p>
