<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An array substrate includes a gate line, a data line, a plurality of common electrodes, a shield electrode, and a pixel electrode. The gate line is extended along a first direction, and the data line is extended along a second direction. The common electrodes are formed in a plurality of pixel areas. The common electrodes are spaced apart from each other. The shield electrode is formed below the data line and formed between the common electrodes formed in the pixel areas adjacent to each other. The pixel electrode is overlapped with the common electrodes. The pixel electrode has a plurality of openings formed thereon.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2007-115836, filed on Nov. 14, 2007 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an array substrate and a display panel having the array substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to an array substrate having an enhanced aperture ratio and enhanced light transmittance and a display panel having the array substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to realize wide viewing angles in liquid crystal display (LCD) devices, in-plane switching (IPS) mode LCD devices and fringe-field switching (FFS) mode LCD devices have been developed. In the IPS mode LCD device, a pixel electrode and a common electrode are formed on a single substrate so that a horizontal electric field (or a transverse electric field) formed between the two electrodes can control a liquid crystal director. In a IPS mode LCD device, liquid crystal molecules rotate in a plane substantially parallel to an alignment layer of a substrate. Therefore, the difference in refractive index anisotropy is small when viewed by a viewer, and a liquid crystal layer includes liquid crystal molecules having two rotation directions opposite to each other when viewed from a cross-sectional view which compensates a phase difference of light to realize a wide viewing angle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A FFS mode LCD device uses a transverse electric field and is substantially identical with a IPS mode LCD device in terms of how the liquid crystal molecules are arranged using the transverse electric field. However, the pixel electrode and the common electrode are formed on different layers in a FFS mode LCD device, so that a FFS mode LCD device arranges liquid crystal molecules using both a horizontal electric field and a vertical electric field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A FFS mode LCD device arranges liquid crystal molecules using the vertical electric field, so that the light transmittance of a FFS mode LCD device is superior to that of a IPS mode LCD device. Moreover, liquid crystal molecules of a FFS mode LCD device are moved in a substantially horizontal direction, so that the viewing angle of a FFS mode LCD device is substantially identical to that of a IPS mode LCD device. Furthermore, the aperture ratio of a FFS mode LCD device is superior to that of a IPS mode LCD device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an array substrate having an enhanced aperture ratio and enhanced light transmittance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention also provides a display panel having the above-mentioned array substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect of the present invention, an array substrate includes a gate line, a data line, a plurality of common electrodes, a shield electrode, and a pixel electrode. The gate line is extended along a first direction on a base substrate. The data line is extended along a second direction crossing the first direction. The common electrodes are formed in a plurality of pixel areas of the base substrate. The common electrodes are spaced apart from each other. The shield electrode is formed below the data line and between the common electrodes formed in the pixel areas adjacent to each other. The shield electrode receives the same voltage as the voltage applied to the common electrodes. The pixel electrode is overlapped by the common electrodes. The pixel electrode has a plurality of openings formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the present invention, a display panel includes an array substrate and an opposite substrate. The array substrate includes a gate line, a data line, a plurality of common electrodes, a shield electrode and a pixel electrode. The gate line is extended along a first direction on a base substrate. The data line is extended along a second direction crossing the first direction. The common electrodes are formed in a plurality of pixel areas of the base substrate. The common electrodes are spaced apart from each other. The shield electrode is formed below the data line and between the common electrodes formed in the pixel areas adjacent to each other. The shield electrode receives the same voltage as the voltage applied to the common electrodes. The pixel electrode is overlapped with the common electrodes. The pixel electrode has a plurality of openings formed thereon. The opposite substrate is coupled to the array substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an array substrate and a display panel having the array substrate, an electric field of a common electrode pattern may prevent coupling between a pixel electrode and a data line, so that a distance between the pixel electrode and the data line may be minimized, and thus an aperture ratio and light transmittance may be enhanced.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to Table <b>1</b>, each of the intervals (DL_PE) between the data line and the pixel electrode of the first to third samples is narrowed in comparison to that of the Comparative Sample. Moreover, each of the overlapped widths (PE_LB) between the pixel electrode and the light-blocking pattern was narrowed in comparison to that of the Comparative Sample. Therefore, each of the widths of the light-blocking patterns of the first to third samples is also smaller than that of the Comparative Sample.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In detail, the intervals (DL_PE) between the data line and the pixel electrode of the first to third samples are each about 2.0 &#x3bc;m; in contrast, the DL_PE of the Comparative Sample is about 4.0 &#x3bc;m. Moreover, the overlapped widths (PE_LB) between the pixel electrode and the light-blocking pattern of the first to third samples are each about 2.5 &#x3bc;m; in contrast, the PE_LB of the Comparative Sample is about 4.0 &#x3bc;m to about 4.5 &#x3bc;m. Accordingly, the widths of the light-blocking patterns of the first to third samples are about 13.5 &#x3bc;m; in contrast, that the width of the light blocking pattern of the Comparative Sample was about 21.0 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As a result, the widths of the light-blocking pattern of the first to third samples are narrowed in comparison to that of the Comparative Sample, so that aperture ratios of the first to third samples are greater than that of the Comparative Sample. That is, the aperture ratios of the samples are each about 56%; however, that of the Comparative Sample is about 47%. Therefore, the aperture ratios of the samples are increased by about 10% in comparison with that of the Comparative Sample.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the above described samples, the light-blocking pattern was formed on the opposite substrate. Alternatively, the light-blocking pattern may be removed from the opposite substrate. That is, when the shield electrode SDE including an optically non-transparent material is formed on the array substrate, the light-blocking pattern may be removed from the opposite substrate. In this case, the aperture ratio may be increased to be greater than about 56%.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As described above, according to the embodiments of the present invention, a common electrode pattern is formed on an array substrate to prevent coupling from being generated between a data line and a pixel electrode of the common electrode pattern, so that a distance between the pixel electrode and the data line may be minimized, and thus an aperture ratio may be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Moreover, a shield electrode including an optically non-transparent material is formed below the data line, reducing coupling between the data line and the pixel electrode. Furthermore, the shield electrode may block light incident to a channel pattern formed below the data line, preventing a waterfall phenomenon. As the shield electrode is formed on the array substrate, the light-blocking pattern may be removed in an area corresponding to the data line on an opposite substrate facing the array substrate. As a result, an aperture ratio of a display panel may be enhanced.</p>
