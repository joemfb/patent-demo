<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Taiwan application serial no. 100141040, filed on Nov. 10, 2011. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to a circuit and a method for controlling write timing of a non-volatile memory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, portable electronic products are quickly developed. Regarding a portable electronic product powered by a battery, a standby time thereof is determined by power consumption of chips therein, and power consumption of the product is a critical specification in judgement of product quality. Along with increasingly complicated functions of the electronic product and a large amount of data, demand for memory capacity is increased, and the memory occupies a larger proportion in power consumption of the whole system chips. A non-volatile memory has a characteristic of maintaining data storage without power, which is indispensable in a system of the portable electronic product.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">So far, a flash memory is mature non-volatile memory product with the smallest cell area and the largest memory capacity. However, flash memories require complicated process masks and are difficult to integrate in a system on chip (SoC) due to the low compatibility with a logic process. Moreover, the flash memory has a slow speed in a write operation, and generally requires a write voltage of more than ten volts. Due to these disadvantages, many researchers have dedicated in developing novel non-volatile memories to replace flash memories, so as to achieve high process compatibility with logic counterpart and a high-speed and low-voltage write operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A resistive random-access memory (RRAM) is a novel non-volatile memory, which can store data states through different resistance states. The RRAM has better compatibility with the logic process, and has a fast write speed and low write voltage, which meets the requirement of low power consumption of portable electronic products.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure provides a write timing control circuit of a non-volatile memory, which includes at least one memory cell, at least one resistance state monitoring unit and at least one write timing generating unit. The memory cell stores data states with different resistance states, and a write time of the memory cell is controlled by inputting a write timing to a timing control line. The resistance state monitoring unit is connected to the memory cell, and monitors the resistance state switching of the memory cell during executing a write operation to output at least one control signal. The write timing generating unit is connected to the resistance state monitoring unit and the timing control line, and generates the write timing according to a clock signal and the control signal. The write timing enables the timing control line at the beginning of a cycle of the clock signal, and disables the timing control line when the memory cell finishes the switching behaviour of resistance states.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure provides a write timing control circuit of a non-volatile memory, which includes at least one memory cell, at least one duplicate memory cell, at least one resistance state monitoring unit and at least one write timing generating unit. The memory cell stores data states with different resistance states, and a write time of the memory cell is controlled by inputting a write timing to a timing control line. The duplicate memory cell and the memory cell synchronously perform a write operation, and the duplicate memory cell has a structure the same with that of the memory cell. The resistance state monitoring unit is connected to the duplicate memory cell, and monitors a resistance state switching of the duplicate memory cell executing the write operation to output at least one control signal. The write timing generating unit is connected to the resistance state monitoring unit and the timing control line, and generates the write timing according to a clock signal and the control signal. The write timing enables the timing control line at the beginning of a cycle of the clock signal, and disables the timing control line when the duplicate memory cell finishes the resistance state switching.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure provides a method for controlling write timing of a non-volatile memory, which includes the following steps. First, a resistance state switching of at least one memory cell executing a write operation is monitored to output at least one control signal. The memory cell stores data states with different resistance states. A write time of the memory cell is controlled by inputting a write timing to a timing control line. Then the write timing is generated according to a clock signal and the control signal. The write timing enables the timing control line at the beginning of a cycle of the clock signal, and disables the timing control line when the memory cell finishes the resistance state switching.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to make the aforementioned and other objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure comprehensible, preferred embodiments accompanied with figures are described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram of a write timing control circuit <b>100</b> according to a first embodiment of the disclosure. The write timing control circuit <b>100</b> is adapted to any non-volatile memory storing data states through different resistance states, for example, a resistive memory, a magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), or a phase change memory (PCM). A memory cell of the non-volatile memory respectively stores data states of 1 and 0 through a high resistance state and a low resistance state. When a write operation is performed, the memory cell has an obvious switching in resistance. While the resistance value changed, an obvious switching of a write current can be monitored. When the write current changed, it represents that the resistance state switching caused by the write operation is completed, and the write timing control circuit <b>100</b> of the disclosure shortens a turn-on time of a timing control line such as a word line or a bit line, etc. according to such principle, so as to achieve a power saving effect.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The write timing control circuit <b>100</b> includes at least one resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b>, at least one write timing generating unit <b>160</b> and at least one memory cell <b>180</b>. The memory cell <b>180</b> executes a write operation, and a write time of the memory cell <b>180</b> is controlled by inputting a write timing WT to a timing control line thereof. The memory cell <b>180</b> can be a memory cell in a memory array.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b> is connected to the memory cell <b>180</b> and the write timing generating unit <b>160</b>, and monitors a resistance state switching of the memory cell <b>180</b> executing the write operation through a write current switching of the memory cell <b>180</b>, so as to output at least one control signal CM to the write timing generating unit <b>160</b>. The resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b> outputs a SET completing signal when the memory cell <b>180</b> switches from the high resistance state to the low resistance state, and outputs a RESET completing signal when the memory cell <b>180</b> switches from the low resistance state to the high resistance state. The control signal CM is composed of the SET completing signal or the RESET completing signal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The write timing generating unit <b>160</b> is connected to the resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b> and the timing control line of the memory cell <b>180</b>. The write timing generating unit <b>160</b> performs a predetermined logic operation according to a clock signal and either the SET completing signal or the RESET completing signal, so as to generate the write timing WT. The clock signal is used for controlling the timing of the above write operation. In brief, the write timing generating unit <b>160</b> generates the write timing WT according to the clock signal and the control signal CM.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The write timing WT can be used to disable (turn off) the timing control line of the memory cell <b>180</b> to reduce power consumption. The timing control line can be a word line or a bit line of the memory cell <b>180</b>, or other control lines related the write operation. Alternatively, the timing control line can also include both of the word line and the bit line of the memory cell <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The write timing generating unit <b>160</b> enables (starts) the write timing WT at the beginning of a cycle of the clock signal, so as to enable the timing control line through the write timing WT. When the write timing generating unit <b>160</b> receives the SET completing signal or the RESET completing signal, i.e. when the memory cell <b>180</b> completes the resistance state switching, the write timing WT is disabled (turned off), so as to disable the timing control line through the write timing WT. In this way, the write timing generating unit <b>160</b> can immediately turn off the timing control line when the write operation is completed, so as to avoid unnecessary turn-on time of the timing control line to reduce power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a block diagram of a write timing control circuit <b>100</b> according to a second embodiment of the disclosure.

The duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> can be an extra memory cell that is not in the memory array, or any unused memory cell in the memory array. In the present embodiment, the memory cell <b>180</b> is a memory cell in the non-volatile memory that is actually used to execute the write operation, and the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> is used to monitor the resistance state switching occurred when the write operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b> is connected to the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> and the write timing generating unit <b>160</b>, and monitors a resistance state switching of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> executing the write operation through a write current switching of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>, so as to output the control signal CM. The resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b> outputs the SET completing signal when the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> switches from the high resistance state to the low resistance state, and outputs the RESET completing signal when the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> switches from the low resistance state to the high resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the write timing generating unit <b>160</b> receives the SET completing signal or the RESET completing signal, i.e. when the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> finishes the resistance state switching, the write timing WT is disabled, so as to disable the timing control line of the memory cell <b>180</b> through the write timing WT.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other details of the write timing control circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> are the same as that of the write timing control circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, which are not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of the write timing control circuit <b>100</b> according to a second embodiment of the disclosure. In the present embodiment, the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> and the memory cell have to synchronously execute the write operation, so that a word line Dummy WL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> and the word line of the memory cell <b>180</b> actually executing the write operation have to be synchronously turned on.</p>

As described above, the control signal CM includes a SET completing signal CM_SET and a RESET completing signal CM_RESET. The resistance state monitoring unit <b>140</b> includes a first current monitor <b>242</b>, a second current monitor <b>248</b>, a first voltage buffer <b>244</b> and a second voltage buffer <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first voltage buffer <b>244</b> is connected to a bit line Dummy_BL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>, and the first current monitor <b>242</b> is connected to the first voltage buffer <b>244</b> and the write timing generating unit <b>160</b>. The second voltage buffer <b>246</b> is connected to a source line Dummy_SL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>, and the second current monitor <b>248</b> is connected to the second voltage buffer <b>246</b> and the write timing generating unit <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first voltage buffer <b>244</b> receives a SET voltage VSET through the first current monitor <b>242</b>, and when the write operation is a SET operation, the SET voltage VSET is provided to the bit line Dummy_BL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> to serve as an analog voltage used by the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> executing the SET operation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the first voltage buffer <b>244</b> provides the SET voltage VSET to the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>, a current enters the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> through the bit line Dummy_BL, which is a write current monitored by the first current monitor <b>242</b>. The first current monitor <b>242</b> monitors the resistance state switching of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> through an inbuilt current comparison mechanism and switching of the aforementioned write current, and outputs the SET completing signal CM_SET when the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> switches from the high resistance state to the low resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the other hand, the second voltage buffer <b>246</b> receives a RESET voltage VRESET through the second current monitor <b>248</b>, and when the write operation is a RESET operation, the RESET voltage VRESET is provided to the source line Dummy_SL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> to serve as an analog voltage used by the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> executing the RESET operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the second voltage buffer <b>246</b> provides the RESET voltage VRESET to the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>, a current enters the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> through the source line Dummy_SL, which is a write current monitored by the second current monitor <b>248</b>. The second current monitor <b>248</b> monitors the resistance state switching of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> through an inbuilt current comparison mechanism and the switching of the write current, and outputs the RESET completing signal CM_RESET when the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> switches from the low resistance state to the high resistance state.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit schematic diagram of a current monitor and a voltage buffer according to an embodiment of the disclosure. In the present embodiment, the current monitor <b>320</b> is the aforementioned current comparison mechanism, and the voltage buffer <b>340</b> is a level shifter. The current monitor <b>320</b> and the voltage buffer <b>340</b> are coupled to the bit line Dummy_BL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> to serve as the first current monitor <b>242</b> and the first voltage buffer <b>244</b>. Now, the current monitor <b>320</b> receives the SET voltage VSET, and an output signal CM thereof is the SET completing signal CM_SET, and an output voltage Vout of the voltage buffer <b>340</b> is supplied to the bit line Dummy_BL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The current monitor <b>320</b> and the voltage buffer <b>340</b> can also be coupled to the source line Dummy_SL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> to serve as the second current monitor <b>248</b> and the second voltage buffer <b>246</b>. Now, the current monitor <b>320</b> receives the RESET voltage VRESET, and the output signal CM thereof is the RESET completing signal CM_RESET, and the output voltage Vout of the voltage buffer <b>340</b> is supplied to the source line Dummy_SL of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Two input signals IN and INB of the voltage buffer <b>340</b> are inverted to each other. If the input signal IN is 0, the output voltage Vout is 0V of a ground line, and if the input signal IN is 1, the output voltage Vout is the SET voltage VSET or the RESET voltage VRESET received by the current monitor <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A P-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effective (PMOS) transistor P<b>1</b> of the current monitor <b>320</b> monitors the write current flowing into the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>. The PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> and a PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> form a current mirror, so that the write current is duplicated to the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b>. A bias voltage VB makes an N-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effective (NMOS) transistor N<b>1</b> to be a fixed current source, and the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> can be replaced by other circuits capable of generating a fixed current source.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A difference between the write current of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> and a fixed current of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> determines a voltage level of the output signal CM. When the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> enters the low resistance state, the write current of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is greater than the fixed current of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>, and the output signal CM is pulled up to logic 1.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> enters the high resistance state, the write current of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is smaller than the fixed current of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>, and the output signal CM is pulled down to logic 0, and this is the inbuilt current comparison mechanism of the current monitor <b>320</b>. In this way, the current monitor <b>320</b> sends the signal CM when the resistance state of the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b> switches.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A function of the voltage buffer <b>340</b> is to transmit a voltage of 0V or one of the SET voltage VSET and the RESET voltage VRESET to the duplicate memory cell <b>120</b>. In the present embodiment, although the voltage buffer <b>340</b> is a level shifter, in other embodiments, it can be replaced by a unit gain buffer or other circuits with the same function.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The voltage buffer <b>340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> receives the SET voltage VSET or the RESET voltage VRESET from the current monitor <b>320</b>. However, in other embodiments, as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first voltage buffer <b>244</b> and the second voltage buffer <b>246</b> can receive the SET voltage VSET and the RESET voltage VRESET from other circuits, and the first current monitor <b>242</b> and the second current monitor <b>248</b> can only monitor the write currents without supplying the voltages required for the write operations.</p>

The first inverter <b>262</b> is connected to the first current monitor <b>242</b> and receives the SET completing signal CM_SET. The first switch unit <b>270</b> receives the inverted SET completing signal CM_SET from the first inverter <b>262</b> through the first switch <b>264</b>, and receives the RESET completing signal CM_RESET through the second switch <b>266</b>.

Each of the memory cells corresponds to one of the word lines and one of the bit lines, for example, a memory cell <b>720</b> corresponds to the word line WL[<b>0</b>] and the bit line BL[<b>1</b>].</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The fourth current monitor <b>762</b> and the fourth voltage buffer <b>764</b> are equivalent to the first current monitor <b>242</b> and the first voltage buffer <b>244</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The fourth voltage buffer <b>764</b> provides the SET voltage VSET to the memory cell in the memory array <b>740</b> that is selected for executing the write operation, for example, the memory cell <b>720</b>. The fourth current monitor <b>762</b> monitors the write current of the aforementioned memory cell, and sends the SET completing signal CM_SET when the resistance state of the memory cell switches. The non-volatile memory <b>700</b> further has another set of current monitor and voltage buffer, which are equivalent to the second current monitor <b>248</b> and the second voltage buffer <b>246</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, though they are not illustrated for simplicity's sake.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The write timing generating unit <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is merged into the timing controller <b>768</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and generates the write timing WT. The word line decoding driver <b>766</b> is connected to timing control lines of all of the memory cells for decoding a memory address, and turns on or turns off the timing control line corresponding to the above memory address according to the write timing WT, so as to designate the timing control line of one of the memory cells to execute the write operation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Besides generating the write timing WT, the timing controller <b>768</b> also controls an operation timing of the non-volatile memory <b>700</b>. The peripheral circuit <b>770</b> is in charge of other functions, for example, the peripheral circuit <b>770</b> receives a command from a host, or outputs data stored in the memory array <b>740</b> in response to the command.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The word line decoding driver <b>766</b> controls to turn on/off the word lines WL[<b>0</b>] to WL[n] according to the write timing WT, so as to turn on/off the word line corresponding to the memory address of the write operation. The write timing WT can also be used to control other timing control lines. For example, each of the bit lines of the memory array <b>740</b> corresponds to a bit line selector <b>750</b>, for example, the bit line BL[<b>1</b>] corresponds a bit line selector <b>755</b>. By turning on/off a bit line selector <b>750</b>, the corresponding bit line is turned on/off. When the write operation is executed, only the bit line of the selected memory cell is turned on for transmitting the voltage VSET or VRESET required by the write operation, and the other bit lines are all turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The word line decoding driver <b>766</b> can also control the bit line selectors of the bit lines BL[<b>0</b>] to BL[k] according to the write timing WT for turning on/off the bit line corresponding to the memory address of the write operation, so as to save power. Moreover, the write timing WT can be used to turn off one or a plurality of the timing control lines of the non-volatile memory <b>700</b> through the timing controller <b>768</b> after the write operation is completed, so as to reduce power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The non-volatile memory <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be a resistive memory or a magnetoresistive memory. Moreover, the non-volatile memory <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can also be a phase change memory.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The write timing control circuit of the non-volatile memory of the aforementioned embodiments only uses one duplicate memory cell or one memory cell to monitor whether the write operation is completed. In other embodiments, the single duplicate memory cell or memory cell can be changed to other circuit combinations capable of tracking whether the write operation of the actual memory cell is completed, for example, a combination of a plurality of duplicate memory cells or memory cells connected in series or parallel. In this case, a set of corresponding resistance state monitoring unit and write timing generating unit is configured for each of the monitored duplicate memory cell or memory cell. Alternatively, one set of the resistance state monitoring unit and write timing generating unit can be used to monitor a plurality of the duplicate memory cells or memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Besides the aforementioned write timing control circuits, the disclosure further provides a method for controlling the write timing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for controlling write timing of a non-volatile memory according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The method for controlling the write timing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be executed by the aforementioned write timing control circuits, or executed by other control devices.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">First, a resistance state switching of at least one memory cell of the non-volatile memory executing a write operation is monitored to output at least one control signal (step S<b>820</b>). Then, a write timing is generated according to a clock signal and the control signal (step S<b>840</b>). The write timing enables a timing control line at the beginning of a cycle of the clock signal, and disables the timing control line when the memory cell finishes the resistance state switching. The method for controlling the write timing has been described in detail in the aforementioned embodiments, and details thereof are not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In summary, the circuit and the method for controlling write timing of the non-volatile memory of the disclosure can monitor whether a write operation of a memory cell is completed through a write current, and can immediately turn of the timing control lines in the non-volatile memory when the write operation is completed, so as to avoid unnecessary power consumption to save power.</p>
