<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ink jet printing apparatus and an ink jet printing method that print images using a print head capable of ejecting ink from a plurality of nozzle lines.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In printing apparatus, particularly those using an ink jet print head capable of ejecting ink (ink jet printing apparatus), improvements in a printing speed during color image printing and in a printed image quality have become an important subject.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a so-called serial scan type printing apparatus, commonly used methods for improving the printing speed include increasing a drive frequency of the print head (ink ejection frequency) and adopting a bidirectional printing system. The bidirectional printing system performs a printing scan while the print head is moving in both a forward and a backward direction. In the serial scan type printing apparatus, images are formed on a print medium successively by repetitively executing a printing scan of the print head in a main scan direction and a print medium transport operation in a subscan direction. The bidirectional printing system as a total system has a cost advantage over a one-way printing system that executes the printing scan as the print head moves only in one of the forward and backward directions because the bidirectional printing system can distribute an energy required to get the same throughput over a period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the bidirectional printing system, however, when a color image is formed by ejecting a plurality of color inks from the print heads, an order of ejecting color inks onto a print medium during the forward movement of the print head differs from that during the backward movement of the print head, giving rise to a possibility that bands of color variations may show on a printed image. Since such color variations are caused by different color ink ejection orders between the forward and backward scans of the print heads, even a slight overlapping of different color ink dots that may occur on a print medium can result in color variations to some degree.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To prevent color variations caused by the color ink ejection order difference, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. S58-179653 (1983) discloses a print head provided with forward scan nozzles and backward scan nozzles for the same color ink. These two groups of nozzles are selectively used according to the direction of movement of the print head so that the color ink ejection order remains the same in whatever direction the print head is moving. The print head is constructed to eject, for example, Y (yellow), M (magenta), C (cyan) and Bk (black) inks.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When an ink droplet is ejected from a nozzle in response to a print signal, very fine ink droplets may also be ejected trailing a main ink droplet. Also when a main ink droplet lands on a print medium, it may bounce back from the print medium, giving rise to a possibility of very minute ink droplets being formed in a space between the print head and the print medium. Such minute ink droplets (referred to also as &#x201c;ink mist&#x201d;), when formed, may adhere to an ejection face of the print head (the surface of the print head formed with ejection openings), forming drops of ink on the print head. These ink drops may make the ejection of ink droplets from ejection openings unstable or cause ink ejection failures.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One method for minimizing the formation of such ink drops is by applying a water-repellent finishing to the ejection face of the print head to form a water-repellent film over the entire ejection face. In a print head with the water-repellent film, the amount of ink accumulating around the ejection openings decreases. However, where two or more nozzle lines ejecting different color inks are driven simultaneously to operate the print head at high drive frequency continuously for a long period and at high speed to form an image with high print duty, the amount of ink mist produced increases. As a result, ink drops may gradually accumulate on the ejection face of the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The relation between ink mist adhering to the ejection face of the print head and an ink ejection state will be explained in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. S58-179653 (1983), color variations that may occur during a bidirectional printing can be minimized by selectively using the forward scan nozzle line and the backward scan nozzle line so that the color ink ejection order remains unchanged in whichever of the forward and backward direction the print head executes the printing scan. In the print head the forward scan nozzle line and the backward scan nozzle line are arranged symmetrically for each of different color inks.</p>

As the ink droplets I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b> are ejected from the ejection openings N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b> at high frequency and fly through air, nearby viscous air is pulled by the ink droplets, with the result that the proximity of the ejection face of the print head tends to be depressurized compared with the proximity of the print medium P. This causes surrounding air to flow toward the depressurized region as indicated by arrows in the figure. This air flow has been found to draw minute ink droplets, smaller than the ink droplets I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b> (main droplets), toward the print head. These minute ink droplets include satellites (not shown) accompanying the ink droplets I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b> as they are ejected and mist formed by the ink droplets I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b> bouncing back when they land on the print medium P.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Studies by the inventors of this invention have produced the following findings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">There is a correlation between the distance L between simultaneously driven nozzle lines and the amount of mist adhering the ejection face of a print head. It is found that as the distance L increases, the amount of mist adhering to the ejection face decreases. Particularly where the distance L between the simultaneously driven nozzle lines is short, there tends to be a greater depressurization than when the distance L is longer, because ink droplets ejected at high frequency falls onto a very narrow print area between the nozzle lines. This makes it more likely for satellites and bouncing mist to reach the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The research conducted by the inventors has found that when a water-repellent finish is applied to an almost entire surface of the ejection face of a print head, ink mist tends to adhere in greater amount to areas remote from the ejection openings. For example, in areas about 500 &#x3bc;m to 1 mm from the ejection openings there are many large aggregates of ink mist grown to between 300 &#x3bc;m and 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter. The water-repellent area has a large contact angle with a liquid (link) and therefore a large fluidity. When its contact angle with ink exceeds 80 degrees, this tendency becomes more conspicuous. Thus, the ink mist aggregates grown to a large size become easily movable by an inertia of the print head during its reciprocal movement or by its own weight and may reach the ejection openings. An ink mist, when drawn into one or more ejection openings, may cause ink ejection failures. Particularly when a bubble-through type print head capable of ejecting small-volume ink droplets of 10 picoliters or less at high frequency in one ejection operation is used, with its nozzle line interval set narrow, the possibility of ejection failure increases dramatically.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One possible method for removing ink mist may involve increasing the frequency of cleaning the ejection face of the print head. For example, the cleaning may be done frequently each time one line, rather than one page, of image is printed. However, increasing the cleaning frequency can result in a reduction in the printing speed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To deal with this problem Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-186610 describes a method which, in a multi-pass printing system using a print head formed with a plurality of nozzle lines, reduces influences of air flows that occur when high print duty nozzle lines are put side by side. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-186610 discloses a nozzle line arrangement for each ink color that comprises an array of nozzles (odd-numbered nozzle line) to print odd-numbered columns of dots and an array of nozzles (even-numbered nozzle line) to print even-numbered columns of dots. The odd- and even-numbered nozzle lines are placed side by side. For example, in a first pass, print data smaller in volume than that of second pass is equally allocated to the odd- and even-numbered nozzle lines. In a second pass, print data greater in volume than that of the first pass is equally allocated to the odd- and even numbered nozzle lines.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">That is, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-186610, the two nozzle lines (odd- and even-numbered nozzle lines) of each ink color are set to have equally allocated print data in each printing scan. Because of this print data assignment relationship, there is limitation on how the print data is allocated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This invention provides an ink jet printing apparatus and a printing method that can optimally allocate print data to a plurality of ink ejecting nozzle lines to reduce influences of air flows occurring near high print duty nozzle lines.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ink jet printing apparatus to print an image by moving a print head in a main scan direction, wherein the print head has a plurality of nozzle lines capable of ejecting ink, the plurality of nozzle lines are arrayed side by side, and the main scan direction crosses a longitudinal direction of each nozzle line, the ink jet printing apparatus comprising: allocation unit that allocates multivalued data representing gradation values corresponding to the number of dots to be printed in one pixel to the plurality of nozzle lines at different data allocation ratios; and control unit that ejects the ink from the print head according to the multivalued data allocated by the allocation unit, wherein the allocation unit sets the data allocation ratios for the plurality of nozzle lines to different ratios so that the nozzle lines with high data allocation ratio do not concentrate in position in the main scan direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided an ink jet printing apparatus to print an image by moving a print head in a main scan direction, wherein the print head has a plurality of nozzle lines capable of ejecting ink, the plurality of nozzle lines are arrayed side by side, and the main scan direction crosses a longitudinal direction of each nozzle line, the ink jet printing apparatus comprising: allocation unit that allocates print data representing a dot print action or a non-print action to each of the plurality of nozzle lines at different data allocation ratios; and control unit that ejects the ink from the print head according to the multivalued data allocated by the allocation unit, wherein the allocation unit sets the data allocation ratios for the plurality of nozzle lines to different ratios so that the nozzle lines with high data allocation ratio do not concentrate in position in the main scan direction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a third aspect of the present invention, there is provide an ink jet printing method to print an image by moving a print head in a main scan direction, wherein the print head has a plurality of nozzle lines capable of ejecting ink, the plurality of nozzle lines are arrayed side by side, and the main scan direction crosses a longitudinal direction of each nozzle line, the ink jet printing method comprising: an allocation step to allocate multivalued data representing gradation values corresponding to the number of dots to be printed in one pixel to the plurality of nozzle lines at different data allocation ratios; and a control step to eject the ink from the print head according to the multivalued data allocated by the allocation step, wherein the allocation step sets the data allocation ratios for the plurality of nozzle lines to different ratios so that the nozzle lines with high data allocation ratio do not concentrate in position in the main scan direction.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In distributing ink ejection data among a plurality of nozzle lines, this invention changes a data allocation ratio between the nozzle lines according to the nozzle line positions. This can prevent the nozzle lines with high allocation ratio from being concentrated and thereby reduce influences of air flows that occur near high print duty nozzle lines. As a result, the amount of ink mist adhering to the print head can be reduced even when the nozzle line density or pitch is high or ink ejection frequency is high, thus minimizing ink ejection failures that would otherwise be caused by the ink mist clogging the nozzles.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Embodiments of this invention will be described by referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a construction of main components of the ink jet printing apparatus applicable to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a head cartridge <b>1</b> is replaceably mounted on a carriage <b>2</b>. The head cartridge <b>1</b> has a print head and an ink tank separably or integrally incorporated therein and also has a connector (not shown) for receiving and transmitting print head drive signals. The carriage <b>2</b> is provided with a connector holder (electric connecting unit) to transmit drive signals to the head cartridge <b>1</b> through the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The print head in the head cartridge <b>1</b> has a heater (electrothermal converter) as a means of generating an energy to eject ink. The thermal energy of the heater causes a film boiling in ink, producing a bubble that in turn expels an ink droplet from an ink ejection opening. In a system that uses a bubble formed in ink by the heat of the heater to eject ink droplets, a bubble-through method may be adopted which communicates the bubble growing in ink to the open air through the ejection opening. As to the ink ejection method, various methods are available, such as one using a piezoelectric element as the ejection energy generation means, as well as the heater type. Ink droplets ejected from ejection openings may be set smaller than 10 picoliters. A structure consisting of the ejection energy generation means and the ejection opening may also be called a &#x201c;nozzle&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The carriage <b>2</b> is supported reciprocally movable on guide shafts <b>3</b> extending in a main scan direction represented by an arrow X. The carriage <b>2</b> is driven by a main scan motor <b>4</b> through a drive mechanism including a motor pulley <b>5</b>, a follower pulley <b>6</b> and a timing belt <b>7</b>, and its moving position and speed are controlled. The carriage <b>2</b> is provided with a home position sensor <b>30</b>, the moving position of the carriage <b>2</b> can be detected by using as a reference a moving position at which the home position sensor detects a shield plate <b>36</b> installed at a predetermined position in the printing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A print medium <b>8</b>, such as print paper and plastic thin sheet, is fed one sheet at a time from an auto sheet feeder (ASF) <b>32</b> by a paper supply motor <b>35</b> rotating a pickup roller <b>31</b> through gears. The print medium <b>8</b> is further fed by a transport roller <b>9</b> in a subscan direction of arrow Y to pass over a printing position facing an ejection face (ejection opening formation surface) of the print head. The subscan direction crosses the main scan direction (in this case, at right angles). The transport roller <b>9</b> is rotated by a subscan motor <b>34</b> through gears. A check on whether the print medium <b>8</b> has been fed and a determination of the head position of the print medium <b>8</b> are done by using as a reference the instant when the print medium <b>8</b> has passed a paper end sensor <b>33</b>. The paper end sensor <b>33</b> is also used to determine the rear end position of the print medium <b>8</b> and the current printing position from the rear end of the print medium <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The print medium <b>8</b> is supported at its back on a platen (not shown) so that it forms a flat print surface at the printing position. The head cartridge <b>1</b> mounted on the carriage <b>2</b> is supported so that an ejection face of the print head protruding down from the carriage <b>2</b> is parallel with the print medium <b>8</b> between the two guide shafts <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a block diagram showing a control configuration in the printing apparatus. Denoted <b>200</b> is a controller that performs an overall control of the entire apparatus by retrieving information from various units in the apparatus and sending commands. The controller <b>200</b> has, in addition to a CPU <b>201</b>, a ROM <b>203</b> in which to store a variety of programs, and a RAM <b>205</b> used as a work area for the CPU <b>201</b> and as a buffer area to store pre-print data for each ink color. The ROM <b>203</b> also stores tables and fixed data necessary for print control, in addition to the above programs.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A host device <b>210</b> externally connected to the printing apparatus is an image data supply source and may for example be a computer for generating and processing image data to be printed or an image reader. The image data, other commands and status signals are transferred between the host device <b>210</b> and the controller <b>200</b> through an interface (I/F) <b>212</b>. The image data transferred from the host device <b>210</b> to the controller <b>200</b> is a 600-ppi (pixels/inch; reference value) multivalued signal while the image data that the print head H1000 prints on the print medium is a 200-dpi binary signal. That is, in performing the print operation, the controller <b>200</b> converts the 600-ppi multivalued signal into the 1200-dpi binary signal. This conversion operation will be detailed later.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A head driver <b>240</b> drives electrothermal converters (ejection heaters) <b>25</b> of the print head H1000 according to the binary print data. The print head H1000 also has a subheater <b>242</b> to heat the print head to an appropriate temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A carriage motor driver <b>250</b> drives the carriage motor <b>4</b> to move the carriage <b>2</b>. A transport motor driver <b>270</b> drives the paper feed motor <b>34</b> to feed the print medium in a subscan direction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a configuration of a data buffer <b>205</b> for each ink color under the control of the CPU <b>201</b> of the controller <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a sequence of image processing executed by the CPU <b>201</b>. In this example, as described later, cyan ink nozzle lines include two nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>; magenta ink nozzle lines include two nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>; and yellow ink nozzle lines include two nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>. These nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> are arranged along the main scan direction with each nozzle line laid lengthwise in a direction crossing the main scan direction, as described later. Reference numbers <b>205</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>205</b>M<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>M<b>2</b>, <b>205</b>Y<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>Y<b>2</b> are buffers corresponding to the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the printer driver <b>211</b> is software installed in the host device <b>210</b> and supplies desired image data as the 600-ppi (pixels/inch) multivalued brightness data for red (R), green (G) and blue (B) to the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the CPU <b>201</b> in the controller <b>200</b> that has received the multivalued brightness data RGB performs a color separation process in a color separation unit <b>206</b> and converts these data into multivalued gradation data CMY for each ink color used in the printing apparatus. Further, the CPU <b>201</b> performs a data allocation process in allocation units <b>207</b>C, <b>207</b>M, <b>207</b>Y to allocate multivalued gradation data (also referred to simply as &#x201c;multivalued data&#x201d;) for cyan (C), magenta (M) and yellow (Y) to the two nozzle lines for each color.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows an example of data allocation ratios between the two nozzle lines (C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>; M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>; Y<b>1</b> and Y<b>2</b>) for each color in the data allocation process. A vertical axis represents multivalued gradation data value (gradation value), which roughly corresponds to the number of ink ejections in each pixel. In this example, gradation data is 8-bit 256-level gradation data. A gradation level range 0-64 corresponds to a print density obtained when no ink droplet is ejected to a 600-dpi pixel. A gradation level range 65-192 corresponds to a print density in which one ink dot is formed in a 600-dpi pixel. A gradation level range 193-255 corresponds to a print density in which two ink dots are formed in a 600-dpi pixel. Such an allocation ratio table is stored in the ROM <b>203</b> of the controller <b>200</b> in advance. The CPU <b>201</b> detects multivalued data (image gradation) values for all pixels in an image area and, according to the detected value and the printing scan direction (forward or backward direction) in which the pixel of interest is being printed, references the above table to determine a data allocation ratio for each nozzle line.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For example, when the cyan ink multivalued data (gradation level) value for a pixel of interest is 120, the CPU <b>201</b> divides the multivalued data of the pixel at a ratio of 1:2. When the pixel of interest is printed in the forward scan, a gradation data value of 80 (=120&#xd7;2/3) is put in the multivalued data buffer <b>208</b>C<b>1</b> corresponding to the nozzle line C<b>1</b> situated at the front in the scan direction. In the multivalued data buffer <b>208</b>C<b>2</b> corresponding to the nozzle line C<b>2</b> situated at the rear in the scan direction, a gradation data value of 40 (=120&#xd7;1/3) is placed. When on the other hand the pixel of interest is printed in the backward scan, a data value of 40 (=120&#xd7;1/3) is entered into the multivalued data buffer <b>208</b>C<b>1</b> corresponding to the nozzle line C<b>1</b> and a data value of 80 (=120&#xd7;2/3) is entered into the multivalued data buffer <b>208</b>C<b>2</b> corresponding to the nozzle line C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, when the multivalued data has been written into the multivalued data buffers <b>208</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>208</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>208</b>M<b>1</b>, <b>208</b>M<b>2</b>, <b>208</b>Y<b>1</b>, <b>208</b>Y<b>2</b>, the CPU <b>201</b> performs an error diffusion process on these multivalued data. That is, the CPU <b>201</b> performs the error diffusion process on individual multivalued data stored in the multivalued data buffers for the nozzle lines by using error diffusion units <b>209</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>209</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>209</b>M<b>1</b>, <b>209</b>M<b>2</b>, <b>209</b>Y<b>1</b>, <b>209</b>Y<b>2</b> and converts them to binary data. Then, individual binary data is stored in buffers <b>205</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>205</b>M<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>M<b>2</b>, <b>205</b>Y<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>Y<b>2</b>. In this example, these binary data is 1200-dpi 1-bit signal. The binary data stored in the buffers is transferred by the CPU <b>201</b> to the head driver <b>240</b> for each printing scan. Then, based on the binary data, the ejection heaters as ejection energy generation means are driven to execute the ink ejection operation in each printing scan.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Designated <b>110</b> are nozzles in the nozzle line C<b>1</b> for ejecting a cyan ink. Designated <b>111</b> are nozzles in the nozzle line C<b>2</b> for ejecting a cyan ink. Denoted <b>112</b> are nozzles in the nozzle line M<b>1</b> for ejecting a magenta ink. Denoted <b>113</b> are nozzles in the nozzle line M<b>2</b> for ejecting a magenta ink. Denoted <b>114</b> are nozzles in the nozzle line Y<b>1</b> for ejecting a yellow ink. Denoted <b>115</b> are nozzles in the nozzle line Y<b>2</b> for ejecting a yellow ink.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Nozzles in each of the nozzle lines are arrayed in a direction crossing (in this example, at right angles to) the main scan direction. These nozzles may be arrayed somewhat at an angle to the main scan direction according to the ejection timing. The nozzle lines are arranged side by side in the main scan direction at an interval of 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this example, each of the nozzle lines has 256 nozzles arrayed at a pitch of 600 dpi, and ejects an ink volume of 5 pl from each nozzle for a print resolution of 1200 dpi in the scan direction. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> only eight nozzles are shown representatively. A carriage scan speed is 25 inches/sec and a print head drive frequency (ink droplet ejection frequency) is 15 kHz. Horizontal broken lines L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are main scan lines, or lines of pixels or raster of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this example, the amount of ink applied to a unit print area, i.e., a print duty, is an ink volume applied to unit print areas printed by one scan of the print head (also referred to as a &#x201c;one-scan print area&#x201d;). Such a print duty can be calculated based on print data for each ink&#x2014;cyan, magenta and yellow. For example, the number of dots formed (ink droplets ejected) is counted in each of a plurality of unit areas making up a one-scan print area and the printed dot count values in unit areas are summed up to determine a total number of dots printed in each scan. Then, a percentage of the total number of dots actually formed with respect to the number of dots that can be formed in the one-scan print area can be defined as a print duty. For example, a unit area may be defined as an area equivalent to 600&#xd7;600 dpi (42.3 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;42.3 &#x3bc;m) in which two dots may be formed. In that case, when two dots are formed in all unit areas of the one-scan print area, the print duty is 100% for the ink forming these dots.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">During a 1-pass printing, such a print duty is used as is. During a 2-pass printing, one-half the print duty of 1-pass printing is used as the print duty. That is, in a multipass print mode in which an image in a predetermined area is printed in two or more (N) scans, a print duty per scan during an N-pass printing is 1/N the print duty of 1-pass printing.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this embodiment, by considering the positional relation among the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, C<b>2</b>, multivalued data corresponding to cyan, magenta and yellow ink is allocated to the individual nozzle lines according the allocation table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. In this embodiment, considering the fact that ink mist is more likely to adhere to the print head by increasing the influences of air flows as the paired nozzle lines are closer, the allocation ratio is so set that a difference between the divided data values progressively increases in the order of cyan, magenta and yellow. It is noted, however, that this invention is not limited to this method and that the allocation ratios for all colors may be equal.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart explaining the allocation of multivalued data.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, based on data to be printed in the next scan, print duties DC, DM, DY for cyan, magenta and yellow inks are calculated (S<b>101</b>). Next, a check is made to see if there is any of the calculated print duties for three colors that exceeds a predetermined threshold (S<b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the result of step S<b>102</b> is &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, another check is made to see if the number of print duties in excess of the predetermined threshold is two or more (S<b>103</b>). Then, if the step S<b>103</b> decides that there are two or more of them, the processing proceeds to step S<b>105</b> where it allocates according to the allocation table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> the multivalued data for the print duties that exceed the predetermined threshold. For example, when the print duties of cyan and magenta ink are in excess of the predetermined threshold, the cyan multivalued data is divided and allocated to the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> at a ratio of 2:1 or 1:2 for pixels whose data values are more than 65. But for pixels whose data values are lower than 65, the data value is divided and allocated to the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> at a ratio of 1:1 because the influence of air flows is not so great.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At step S<b>103</b>, if it is not decided that the number of print duties that have exceeded the predetermined threshold is two or more, the processing proceeds to step S<b>104</b> where it checks if the print duty of yellow (Y) ink exceeds the predetermined threshold. If it is decided that the print duty of yellow (Y) ink exceeds the predetermined threshold, the processing proceeds to step S<b>106</b> where it divides and allocates only the multivalued data of yellow ink according to the allocation table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. As a result, the influences that air flows have on mist of yellow ink because of short distance between the nozzle lines can be alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the result of step S<b>104</b> is &#x201c;no&#x201d;, the processing proceeds to step S<b>107</b>, where it fixes the multivalued data allocation ratios for all inks at 1:1. With the data value allocation ratios set by step S<b>105</b>, S<b>106</b>, S<b>107</b>, the multivalued data is divided and allocated by step S<b>108</b> according to the set allocation ratio. After this, the allocated multivalued data is transformed into binary data, according to which ink is ejected from respective nozzle lines to perform printing. Then, step S<b>109</b> checks if there is a band to be printed next. If the check result is &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, the processing returns to step S<b>101</b>. If &#x201c;no&#x201d;, the processing stops.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the step S<b>102</b> finds that no print duties exceed the predetermined threshold, the processing proceeds to step S<b>107</b> where it fixes the data allocation ratios for all inks to 1:1.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, C<b>2</b>, the allocation of multivalued data as described above results in one of two adjoining nozzle lines being assigned the greater of the data allocation ratios and the other the smaller of the data allocation ratios. That is, the data value allocation ratios for the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are large while the data value allocation ratios for the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>, C<b>2</b> are small. It is also possible to provide three or more (M) nozzle lines for each ink color C, M, Y.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, a first and a second example of control of the print head will be explained as follows.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Example of Control</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows how, in a 2-pass bidirectional printing operation, nozzles of the print head are activated to print an image when print duties for cyan, magenta and yellow ink are 75%, 50% and 25%. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows a state of nozzle activation during a forward scan and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> a state of nozzle activation during a backward scan. Solid black circles in the figures represent driven nozzles. In the 2-pass bidirectional printing operation, an image in a predetermined print area is completed by two scans (two passes)&#x2014;forward scan and backward scan. In this 2-pass printing, the print duties DC, DM, DY are 37.5% (=75/2%), 25% (=50/2%) and 12.5% (=25/2%), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, C<b>2</b> are arranged so that ink colors are ejected symmetrically, i.e., in the order of cyan, magenta, yellow, yellow, magenta and cyan. With this arrangement, even when secondary colors are printed, the ink ejection order remains unchanged during the forward and backward scans, producing no color variations which would otherwise be caused by a difference in the ink ejection order.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this example, the print duties of cyan and magenta inks are higher than the predetermined threshold and the print duty of yellow ink is lower than the predetermined threshold. Therefore, during the forward scan, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the multivalued data for cyan ink is divided and allocated to the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> at a ratio of 2:1 for the pixels whose data value is large. As a result, the print duty for the nozzle line C<b>1</b> is approximately 25% and that of the nozzle line C<b>2</b> is about 12.5%. Similarly, the multivalued data for magenta ink is divided and allocated to the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> at a ratio of 1:3 for the pixels whose data value is large. The multivalued data for yellow ink is allocated to the nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> at a fixed ratio of 1:1 to distribute the data evenly among all pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the number of nozzles in each column that are driven in the unit print area is particularly large with the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>. Therefore, near the ejection opening in the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> there is an increased tendency for depressurization. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> explained earlier shows how air flows are generated when the print duties of the nozzle lines L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> are the same as that of the nozzle line M<b>2</b>. In this example, too, near the ejection openings in the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> whose print duties are high because of high data allocation ratio, wrapping air flows are formed that rise from the print medium side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">However, since the distance between the nozzle lines C<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> with high print duties is as large as 4 mm, air flow escape paths are formed between the nozzles. As a result, satellites <b>12</b> ejected from the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) and mist formed by a part of the main droplet <b>11</b> bouncing from the print medium <b>8</b> are less likely to adhere to the ejection face of the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">During a backward scan, the allocation ratios of the multivalued data between the nozzle lines C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, between the nozzle lines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> and between the nozzle lines Y<b>1</b> and Y<b>2</b> are reversed. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, for the pixels whose data value is large, the multivalued data for cyan ink is divided and allocated to the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> at a ratio of 1:2 and the multivalued data for magenta ink is allocated to the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> at a ratio of 3:1. The multivalued data for yellow ink is divided between the nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> at a fixed ratio of 1:1 to distribute the data uniformly among all pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the number of nozzles in each column that are driven in the unit print area is particularly large with the nozzle lines C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Therefore, during the backward scan, near the ejection openings in the nozzle lines C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b>, there is an increased depressurization. However, since the distance between the nozzle lines C<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> with high print duties is as large as 4 mm, air flow escape paths are formed between these nozzle lines. As a result, satellites <b>12</b> ejected from the nozzle lines C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) and mist formed by a part of the main droplet <b>11</b> bouncing from the print medium <b>8</b> are less likely to adhere to the ejection face of the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">By allocating the multivalued data as the ink ejection data as described above, the distance between the nozzle lines with high print duties can be set large to minimize the amount of mist adhering to the ejection face of the print head, as with the cases of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref>. This in turn can reduce the possibility of ink ejection failure that would otherwise be caused by mist and its aggregates clogging the ejection openings.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Although reversing the multivalued data allocation ratio for the nozzle lines of each color between the forward scan and the backward scan is not essential, the reversing can help reduce deviations in a frequency of use of the nozzle lines.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">While in the above example the multivalued data has been described to be divided and allocated among a plurality of nozzle line of the same color, it is possible to allocate binary data obtained by the binarization process. In that case, the binary data for each ink color needs only to be divided and allocated among the nozzle lines at an allocation ratio that is determined for each group of pixels according to the data value (equivalent to the number of dots) and the direction of scan.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As for the multivalued data whose print duty exceeds the predetermined threshold, the multivalued data allocation ratio is set to other than 1:1 for those pixels whose data value is large (pixels with data value of 65 or higher) and, for those pixels whose data value is 64 or lower, the multivalued data allocation ratio is set to 1:1. As described above, by focusing on the pixels that are particularly vulnerable to the influences of air flows and using different nozzle line data allocation ratios for pixels with high data value and for pixels with low data value, deviations in the frequency of use among different nozzles can be minimized to reduce the chance of mist adhering to the ejection face of the print head. However, the multivalued data whose print duty exceeds the predetermined threshold may also be divided and allocated at different ratios for all pixels regardless of their data values.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Example of Control</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> show a nozzle activation state when an image is formed by a 2-pass bidirectional printing with 100% print duties for magenta and yellow inks. The print duties DM, DY are 50% (=100/2%).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this example, during the forward scan, multivalued data for magenta ink is allocated to the magenta nozzle line M<b>1</b> according to an allocation table (not shown) designed to make only the nozzle line M<b>1</b> of nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> perform printing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Similarly, the multivalued data for yellow ink is allocated according to an allocation table (not shown) designed to have only the nozzle line Y<b>2</b> of nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> to perform printing. The number of nozzles driven in each column within the unit print area or one-scan print area is 256 nozzles, all nozzles of each column, when the print duty is 50%. So, during the forward scan, there tends to be an increased depressurization near the ejection openings of the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> which have high data allocation ratios and therefore high print duties, generating wrapping air flows that rise from the print medium side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">However, since the distance between the nozzle lines M<b>1</b> and Y<b>2</b> is as large as 2 mm, air flow escape paths are formed between these nozzle lines. As a result, satellites <b>12</b> ejected from the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) and mist formed by a part of the main droplet <b>11</b> bouncing from the print medium <b>8</b> are less likely to adhere to the ejection face of the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">During a backward scan, on the other hand, the allocation ratios of the multivalued data between the nozzle lines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> and between the nozzle lines Y<b>1</b> and Y<b>2</b> are reversed. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the multivalued data for magenta ink is allocated according to an allocation table (not shown) designed to have only the nozzle line M<b>2</b> of nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> perform printing. Similarly, the multivalued data for yellow ink is allocated according to an allocation table (not shown) designed to have only the nozzle line Y<b>1</b> of nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> perform printing.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Therefore, during the backward scan, there tends to be an increased depressurization near the ejection openings in the nozzle lines M<b>2</b>, Y<b>1</b>, generating wrapping air flows that rise from the print medium side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">However, since the distance between the nozzle lines M<b>2</b> and Y<b>1</b> is as large as 2 mm, air flow escape paths are formed between these nozzle lines.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">By allocating the multivalued data as described above, the distance between the nozzle lines with high print duties can be so large to minimize the amount of mist adhering to the ejection face of the print head, as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>. This in turn can prevent ink ejection failures that would otherwise be caused by mist and its aggregates clogging the ejection openings. In addition, the magenta and yellow inks are ejected in the order of yellow ink followed by magenta ink during both the forward scan of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and backward scan of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, producing no color variations which would otherwise be caused by a difference in the ink ejection order.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Nozzles in a print head of this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, are arrayed at a pitch of 600 dpi. Nozzles of nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b> are shifted one-half pitch from those of nozzle lines C<b>2</b>, M<b>2</b>, Y<b>2</b> in the subscan direction.

The nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b> also combine to produce a subscan direction print density of 1200 dpi. The distances between these nozzle lines are 1 mm. In each nozzle line there are 256 nozzles, ejecting ink droplets of 5 pl each. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, only eight nozzles are representatively shown in each nozzle line. A maximum possible drive frequency (ink droplet ejection frequency) is 30 kHz. Horizontal broken lines L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> represent main scan lines, along which image pixels are formed, i.e., rasters of the image. In this example, a dot can be formed in a 1200&#xd7;1200-dpi unit area according to print data. Further, the printing apparatus in this embodiment, unlike the first embodiment, has a two-step quantization process.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a procedure of image processing executed by the CPU <b>201</b> in the controller <b>200</b>. The CPU <b>201</b> in the controller <b>200</b> that has received the multivalued brightness data RGB performs a color separation process on the brightness data RGB at 600 ppi by using the color separation unit <b>206</b> to produce 600-ppi multivalued gradation data CMY for the associated ink color used in the printing apparatus. Then, a multivalued quantization process is performed on the multivalued gradation data CMY by quantization units <b>213</b>C, <b>213</b>M, <b>213</b>Y for the associated ink colors to convert the 256-level gradation data into 600-ppi 3-level (0-2) gradation data. Then, index development units <b>214</b>C, <b>214</b>M, <b>214</b>Y for three ink colors are activated to perform an index development process to convert the 600-ppi 3-level gradation data into 1200-dpi binary data. After this, these binary data is stored in the buffers <b>205</b>C<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>C<b>2</b>, <b>205</b>M<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>M<b>2</b>, <b>205</b>Y<b>1</b>, <b>205</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">This embodiment is characterized by an index pattern that is referenced when the above index development process is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref> show index patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">An index C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref> represents an index pattern used when a print duty is low. The values of 0-2 shown to the left of the figure are input values to the index development unit, i.e., levels of output values of the multivalued quantization process. The pattern to the right of the figure represents four (2&#xd7;2) 1200-dpi pixels corresponding to one 600-ppi pixel region. A circle in individual 1200-dpi pixels indicates that the pixels marked with the circle are print pixels that to be formed with a dot by ink ejection. Pixels not marked with a circle are no-print pixels to which no ink droplet is to be ejected. The number of print pixels marked with the circle increases with the level.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the index C, when the level is 0, there is only one method of arranging dots in 2&#xd7;2 pixels (<b>0</b>A). When the level is 1, there are two methods of arranging dots (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B). When the level is 2, there is only one method of arranging dots in 2&#xd7;2 pixels (<b>2</b>B). In this embodiment, when the level is 1, the two dot arrangement patterns (<b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B) are sequentially or randomly used.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The index A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref> and the index B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref> represent index patterns used when the print duty is high. In these indexes A and B, the dot arrangement pattern for level 0 is the same as that of index C whereas, for level 1 and level 2, the indexes A and B, unlike index C, provide only one dot arrangement pattern each. In the 2&#xd7;2 pixel pattern with an upper tier taken as an even row and a lower tier as an odd row, the index A is designed to have print pixels concentrate in the odd row. The index B on the other hand is designed to have print pixels concentrate in the even row. These indexes A, B and C are stored in ROM <b>203</b> of the printing apparatus and the CPU <b>201</b> selects an appropriate pattern from the ROM <b>203</b> according to various conditions and level values.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the nozzle line C<b>1</b> prints the even row and the nozzle line C<b>2</b> prints the odd row. Therefore, when the number of ink ejections from the nozzle line C<b>1</b> is increased, it is better to select the index B, and when the number of ink ejections from the nozzle line C<b>2</b> is increased, it is better to select the index A. This step allows the number of ejections in each nozzle line to be practically adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In each printing scan, the index A and index B are selectively used according to the direction of scan. More specifically, when the printing is done during the forward scan, the index development process is performed according to the index B to suppress the print duty of the nozzle line C<b>2</b> moving at the front. When the printing is done during the backward scan, the index development process is performed according to the index A to suppress the print duty of the nozzle line C<b>1</b> moving at the front.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the binary data for each ink color that has been binarized by the index development process is separated for individual nozzle lines and stored in the corresponding buffers <b>205</b>C<b>1</b>-<b>205</b>Y<b>2</b> in the RAM <b>205</b>. The stored binary data is transferred by the CPU <b>201</b> to the head driver (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) for each printing scan. Based on the binary data, the ejection heaters as ejection energy generation means are energized to execute the ink ejection operation during each printing scan.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As described above, this embodiment provides a plurality of index patterns, one of which is chosen according to the direction of scan (forward or backward scan). The above process makes this embodiment simpler in construction than the first embodiment that detects the value of multivalued gradation data and divides and allocates the data value to the two nozzle lines.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> show a nozzle activation state when the print duty of cyan and magenta inks is 100%, i.e., when a secondary color is formed of these inks at a maximum gradation level. Images are formed by a 2-pass bidirectional printing, as in the preceding embodiment. Print duties DC, DM of these nozzle lines are both 50% (100/2%).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In this example, during the forward scan, the index patterns used for processing cyan and magenta ink ejection data are <b>2</b>A in index B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25B and 2C</figref> in index A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, respectively. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the print duties of the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are high and the print duties of the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> are low. Therefore, during the forward scan there tends to be an increased depressurization near the ejection openings of the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> with high print duties, which in turn forms wrapping air flows rising from the print medium side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">However, since the distance between the nozzle lines C<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> is as large as 4 mm, air flow escape paths are formed between these nozzle lines. As a result, satellites <b>12</b> ejected from the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) and mist formed by a part of the main droplet <b>11</b> bouncing from the print medium <b>8</b> are less likely to adhere to the ejection face of the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">During a backward scan, on the other hand, the index patterns used for processing the cyan and magenta ink ejection data are <b>2</b>C in index A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 2A</figref> in index B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, respectively. The print pixel allocation ratios between the nozzle lines C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> and between the nozzle lines M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are reversed. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the print duties of the nozzle lines C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b> are high and print duties of the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are low. Therefore, during the backward scan, near the ejection openings of the nozzle lines C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b> with high print duties, there tends to be an increased depressurization which in turn forms wrapping air flows rising from the print medium, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">However, since the distance between the nozzle lines C<b>2</b> and M<b>1</b> is as large as 4 mm, air flow escape paths are formed between these nozzle lines.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">By selecting an index pattern for each nozzle line as described above, the distance between the nozzle lines with high print duties can be so large to minimize the amount of mist adhering to the ejection face of the print head, as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>. This in turn prevents ink ejection failures that would otherwise be caused by mist and its aggregates clogging the ejection openings.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, the cyan and magenta inks are ejected in the order of magenta ink followed by cyan ink during both the forward scan of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and backward scan of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, producing no color variations which would otherwise be caused by a difference in the ink ejection order.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Contrary to what is described above, a secondary color based on cyan and magenta inks may be formed by using the nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> during the forward scan and the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> during the backward scan.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">It is also possible to form a secondary color based on magenta and yellow inks by using nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> during the forward scan and nozzle lines Y<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b> during the backward scan, thereby minimizing the amount of mist adhering to the ejection face of the print head, preventing ink ejection failures. Conversely, nozzle lines Y<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b> may also be used during the forward scan and nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> during the backward scan.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Third Comparison Example</heading>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">This comparison example represents a case where the same print head as used in the second embodiment is used and in which the print duty of cyan and magenta inks is 100%, i.e., a secondary color is formed of these inks at a maximum gradation level. Images are formed by a 2-pass bidirectional printing, as in the preceding embodiment. Print duties DC, DM are both 50% (100/2%).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In this example, the index patterns used for processing cyan and magenta ink ejection data are <b>2</b>B and <b>0</b>A in index C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref> in both the forward and backward scans and the nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are used evenly.

Thus, there tends to be an increased depressurization near the ejection openings of these nozzle lines, forming wrapping air flows that rise from the print medium side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Since the distance between the nozzle lines C<b>1</b> and M<b>1</b> and the distance between the nozzle lines C<b>2</b> and M<b>2</b> are as short as 1 mm, air flow escape paths are unlikely to be formed between the paired nozzle lines. As a result, satellites <b>12</b> ejected from these nozzle lines (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>) and mist formed by a part of the main droplet <b>11</b> bouncing from the print medium <b>8</b> may adhere in large quantities to the ejection face of the print head.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Similarly, during the backward scan as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the print duties of all nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> are somewhat high.

<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The large quantity of mist and its aggregates, once they adhere to the ejection face of the print head, are likely to clog the ejection openings causing ink ejection failures.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In this example, each nozzle line has nozzles arrayed at a pitch of 600 dpi.

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The present invention can be applied to a wide range of ink jet printing apparatus of a so-called serial scan type. The printing apparatus need only be able to print an image on a print medium by moving a print head&#x2014;which has a plurality of ink ejecting nozzle lines arranged side by side&#x2014;in a main scan direction crossing the nozzle lines.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">This invention needs only to be able to divide and allocate the multivalued data or the binary data to a plurality of nozzle lines for the same ink color at different allocation ratios and, based on the allocated data, eject ink from the print head. At least a part of these functions may be assigned to a host device connected to the printing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">This invention needs to be able to use different data allocation ratios according to the positions in the main scan direction of a plurality of nozzle lines so that the nozzle lines with high data allocation ratio do not concentrate in position in the main scan direction. Concentration of nozzle lines with high allocation ratio includes a case where nozzle lines with high allocation ratio are arranged at adjoining positions and a case where a percentage of those nozzle lines having high allocation ratio with respect to all nozzle lines arranged in a predetermined area is higher than a predetermined value. The only requirement is that air flow escape paths can be formed near the nozzle lines with high allocation ratio to minimize adverse effects of the air flows.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Further, since the data value (gradation value) of multivalued gradation data and the number of print dots of binary data are in a one-to-one relation, a print duty can be determined from the multivalued gradation data as a percentage of pixels printed with dots with respect to all pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Inks to be ejected from a plurality of nozzle lines may be one and the same ink, or two or more different inks as in the preceding embodiments. In the latter case, for each ink there is provided a plurality of nozzle lines or a nozzle line group. At least one of these nozzle line groups may include a plurality of nozzle lines ejecting different ink volumes or at least one of a plurality of nozzle lines that are arranged shifted in nozzle pitch. The only requirement is that the data allocation ratios for a plurality of nozzle lines in each nozzle line group can be set to different ratios according to the positions in the main scan direction of the nozzle lines so that the nozzle lines with high allocation ratio in each group do not concentrate in position in the main scan direction.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">These nozzle line groups may, for example, include a first nozzle line group comprising a first and a second nozzle line capable of ejecting a first ink and a second nozzle line group comprising a third and a fourth nozzle line capable of ejecting a second ink. In the preceding embodiments, two of cyan, magenta and yellow inks correspond to the first and second ink. Of a group of nozzle lines C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, a group of nozzle lines M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and a group of nozzle lines Y<b>1</b>, Y<b>2</b>, two groups correspond to the first and second nozzle line group.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In that case, the multivalued data for first ink ejection is allocated to the first and second nozzle lines and the multivalued data for second ink ejection is allocated to the third and fourth nozzle lines. For example, the allocation ratio between the first and second nozzle lines is changed and the allocation ratio between the third and fourth nozzle lines is also changed so that one of the first and second nozzle lines with high allocation ratio and one of the third and fourth nozzle lines with high allocation ratio do not adjoin each other. More specifically, where one of the first and second nozzle lines adjoins one of the third and fourth nozzle lines, the allocation ratio for one of the first and second nozzle lines and/or the allocation ratio for one of the third and fourth nozzle lines needs to be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Where an image is printed in a bidirectional print mode by scanning the print head in a forward and a backward direction, the allocation ratio between the nozzle lines is changed according to the direction of scan. In this case, when the print head is moved along the scan direction, it is desired that the first, second, third and fourth nozzle line be arrayed so that the ejection order of the first and second ink from these nozzle lines remains the same in both the forward and backward directions. For example, when one of the first and second nozzle lines adjoins one of the third and fourth nozzle lines, the allocation ratio between the first and second nozzle line is reversed and the allocation ratio between the third and fourth nozzle line are also reversed according to the scan direction of the print head. That is, when the print head scans in one direction, the allocation ratio of one of the first and second nozzle lines is set high and the allocation ratio of the other set low; and the allocation ratio of one of the third and fourth nozzle lines is set low and the allocation ratio of the other set high. When the print head scans in the opposite direction, the allocation ratio of one of the first and second nozzle lines is set low and the allocation ratio of the other set high; and the allocation ratio of one of the third and fourth nozzle lines is set high and the allocation ratio of the other set low.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
