<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of German Patent Application No. 10 2008 044 240.2, filed Dec. 1, 2008, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The basic measuring component of a gas sensor is an electrochemical cell, which includes at least two electrodes in contact with one another via an electrolyte (that is, an ionic conductor). On the side of the cell which is open to the atmosphere, gas can flow to one of the electrodes (the working or sensing electrode), at which it is electrochemically converted. The current generated by the conversion is proportional to the quantity of gas present. A signal, which can, for example, be used to provide an alarm, is generated from the current. A variety of electrolyte systems are described in the literature. Sulfuric acid is one of the most commonly used electrolytes, and is used in sensors for common gases, such as, for example, CO, H<sub>2</sub>S, or O<sub>2</sub>. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,328,277.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As some analyte gases are sufficiently reactive only in neutral electrochemical media, aqueous electrolytes including a neutral or a basic inorganic salt as a conducting salt have also been described. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,648 and German Patent No DE 4238337.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electrolytes described therein are hygroscopic (that is, they can absorb water from the surround environment). A hydroscopic electrolyte can be desirable for use in dry or low-humidity environments to delay drying of the cell. In high-humidity environments, however, a hydroscopic electrolyte can absorb so much water that electrolyte leaks from the cell. To prevent this leakage of electrolyte, a sensor cell typically includes an extra or reserve volume of approximately five times to seven times its electrolyte filling volume. Inclusion of such a substantial reserve volume cuts against a general aim of reducing the overall size of sensor cells.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a number of sensors, organic liquids, which include conducting salts admixed therein to ensure ionic conductivity, are used as electrolytes to limit water absorption in high-humidity environments. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,779. The advantage at high relative humidity, however, becomes a disadvantage at low humidity and/or high ambient temperatures, as vaporized solvent cannot be reabsorbed from the atmosphere and is thus irrecoverably lost from the sensor cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Ionic liquids (IL) have also been used as electrolytes. Ionic liquids are defined as liquid salts with a melting point below 100&#xb0; C. The salt-like structure of certain ionic liquids results in the absence of a measurable vapor pressure. The properties of ionic liquids vary substantially and are dependent, for example, upon the type and the number of organic side chains present in the ionic liquid, as well as the anions and cations thereof. Ionic liquids are available having melting points below &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. Many ionic liquids are both chemically and electrochemically stable and exhibit high ionic conductivity. A number of ionic liquids are not measurably hygroscopic. Such properties make ionic liquids good electrolytes in electrochemical gas sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of ionic liquids in gas sensors was first described for use in connection with high sulfur dioxide concentrations. Cai et al., Journal of East China Normal University (Natural Science), article number 1000-5641(2001)03-0057-04. The use of ionic liquids as electrolytes in gas sensors is also disclosed, for example, in Great Britain Patent No. GB 2395564, U.S. Pat. No. 7,060,169 and published German patent application DE 102005020719. GB 2395564 describes the use of ionic liquids as electrolytes generally. U.S. Pat. No. 7,060,169 discloses the use of pure imidazolium and pyridinium salts as ionic liquid electrolytes. Published German patent application DE 102005020719 discloses the possibility of forming an open gas sensor without a diffusion membrane. The potential for the use of such technology in miniaturizing sensors is described in published German patent application DE 102004037312.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although ionic liquids are used in a number of gas sensors as a replacement for classic (aqueous) electrolytes, the chemical processes in ionic liquids differ fundamentally from those in aqueous and organic systems, and the chemical processes in ionic liquids are not well characterized. See, for example, P. Wasserscheid, Angew. Chem. 2000, 112, 3926-3945 and K. R. Seddon, Pure Appl. Chem. Vol. 72, No. 7, pp. 1391-1398, 2000.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;an additive&#x201d; includes a plurality of such additives and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth, and reference to &#x201c;the additive&#x201d; is a reference to one or more such additives and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain sensors in which ionic liquids or mixtures thereof are used as electrolytes, the performance of the gas sensors with regard to sensitivity, response time, selectivity, and robustness suffers as compared to analogous sensors using classic (aqueous) electrolyte system. Furthermore, many ionic liquid electrolytes exhibit relatively high viscosities and tend to form gels, for example, if one attempts to incorporate one or more additives. For example, ionic liquids based on imidazole form gels when lithium salts are incorporated therein. Such gelling lowers the conductivity of the electrolyte and results in longer response times for the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In several representative embodiments of electrochemical gas sensor described herein, the sensor includes an ionic liquid as an electrolyte. The ionic liquid includes at least one cation selected from the group of a monoalkylammonium cation, a dialkylammonium cation, and a trialkylammonium cation. In several embodiments, the individual alkyl groups of the cation can be branched or unbranched and can have 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The individual alkyl groups of the cation are independently, the same or different, in case of a dialkylammonium cation and a trialkylammonium cation. In a number of embodiments, the individual alkyl groups have 2 to 4 carbon atoms. In several embodiments, the at least one cation is ethylammonium.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although alkylammonium compounds are known as ionic liquids, a number of such compounds are also known to exhibit properties undesirable in electrolytes. For example, alkylammonium compounds including lower alkyl groups, such as methylammonium nitrate, are known to be oxidizing substances. Methylammonium nitrate is used in combination with hydrocarbons as a military explosive. For example, dimethylammonium nitrate has been used as a substitute explosive for TNT. See, for example, R. Haas, J. Thieme, Bestandsaufnahme von R&#xfc;stungsalt-lastverdachtsstandorten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Volume 2, Explosivstofflexikon, 2nd Expanded Edition, UBA Texts 26/96, German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) Berlin 1996.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Surprisingly, when incorporated into an electrochemical sensor, monoalkylammonium, dialkylammonium, and trialkylammonium ionic liquids do not exhibit those negative properties. For example, methylammonium nitrate incorporated in a sensor as an electrolyte does not react with the components of the sensor (for example, with highly catalytic platinum black), and can be handled without danger. Moreover, it was surprising that the ionic liquids have good fluidity, and do not gel (or gel very little) even if additives are added thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In several embodiments, the ionic liquid of the electrolyte includes at least one anion from the group of a nitrate anion, a nitrite anion, a tetrafluoroborate anion, a hexafluorophosphate anion, a polyfluoroalkanesulfonate anion, a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion, an alkyl sulfate anion, an alkanesulfonate anion, an acetate anion, and an anion of a fluoroalkanoic acid (for example trifluoroacetate). In a number of embodiments, the ionic liquid is ethylammonium nitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In several embodiments, the electrolyte includes a mixture of different ionic liquids. A mixture of different ionic liquids can, for example, be used to achieve different polarities in the electrolyte. Controlling or adjusting polarity can aid in dissolving certain additives, and can also be helpful in controlling hygroscopicity and water absorption by the electrolyte. The hygroscopicity of the electrolyte influences the three-phase boundary at the working electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The electrochemical gas sensor includes at least two electrodes, which are in contact with the ionic liquid electrolyte and which are electrically isolated from one another (for example, by separators or by space). Two-electrode, three-electrode, and multi-electrode sensor systems can be formed. In a number of representative embodiments, two- or three-electrode systems are formed. In a two-electrode system, there is one working electrode (WE) and one counter electrode (CE). In case of a three-electrode system, there is also a reference electrode (RE). In a multi-electrode system, the sensor may include a protective electrode or more than one working electrode. The electrodes can, for example, include a metal selected from the group of Cu, Ni, Ti, Pt, Ir, Au, Pd, Ag, Ru, Rh, oxides of such metals, mixtures of such metals and/or metal oxides, or carbon. The materials of the individual electrodes can be the same or different. The electrodes can have any suitable shape. In a number of representative studies, the potential of the working electrode was maintained to be generally constant. However, the potential of the working electrode can also be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electrolytes are well suited for use in electrochemical gas sensors for gases such as F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, ClO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, HCl, HBr, HF, HCN, PH<sub>3</sub>, AsH<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>, and SiH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a number of embodiments, the electrolyte or electrolyte system includes an additive portion including at least one of an organic additive (for example, an organic compound), an organometallic additive (for example, an organometallic compound) and/or an inorganic additive (for example, an inorganic compound). The additive(s) can, for example, improve the performance of the gas sensors with regard to sensitivity, response time, selectivity, and robustness.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a number of embodiments, an additive or additives as described above is/are mixed with the ionic liquid electrolyte and can be at least partially solubilized therein and/or at least partially suspended therein. In other embodiments, the additives can be immobilized upon a solid support or otherwise incorporated in, or form a part of, a solid support and placed in contact with the ionic liquid electrolyte. As used herein, the term &#x201c;immobilized&#x201d; refers to entities that are attached to a separate solid support, as well as to entities that form a portion or all of a solid support.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An additive can, for example, be immobilized upon a solid support by reacting the additive or a precursor thereof (for example, to form a covalent bond or an ionic bond) with a solid support such that the additive or an active residue of the additive is immobilized upon or within the solid support. An additive or a precursor thereof can also be immobilized upon a support by absorption, adsorption, chelation, hydrogen bonding, entrapment and/or other techniques known for immobilization of chemical entities. The method of immobilization should leave the immobilized additive or additives available for interaction with, for example, the electrolyte, the analyte and/or other entities.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An immobilized additive can, for example, be placed in close proximity to a specific area (for example, an inlet of the sensor, the working electrode and/or other electrode) to improve the efficacy of the immobilized additive (for example, via interaction or reaction with the analyte gas or another entity). A plurality of solid supports can be used to immobilize an additive or additives. An additive or additive can be immobilized upon or within a porous matrix. In a number of embodiments, an additive or additives is/are immobilized upon a solid material within or upon which the electrolyte is absorbed as described herein. An additive or additives can also or alternatively be immobilized upon the working electrode and/or other electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The additive portion (that is, the organic, organometallic and/or inorganic additive(s)) can, for example, be included in quantities of 0.05 to 15% by weight. In a number of embodiments, an organic additive or additives are included in a quantity of 0.05 to 5.0% by weight. More particularly, in a number of embodiments, an organic additive or additives are included in a quantity of 0.05 to 1.5% by weight. In a number of embodiments, an inorganic additive or additives are included in a quantity of 1 to 12% by weight. In a number of embodiments, an organometallic additive or additives are included in a quantity of 0.05 to 5.0% by weight. More particularly, in a number of embodiments, an organometallic additive or additives are included in a quantity of 0.05 to 1% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In several embodiments, the at least one organic additive is selected from the group of imidazole, pyridine, pyrrole, pyrazole, pyrimidine, guanine (each of which can be unsubstituted or substituted with at least one C1 to C4 alkyl group), uric acid, benzoic acid, a porphyrine and a derivative of a porphyrine. The effect of organic additives may be based on a stabilization of the reference potential and/or the pH. Such stabilization provides advantages with, for example, acid gas analytes.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In several embodiments, the at least one organometallic additive is selected from the group of metal phthalocyanines and derivatives thereof with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+/3+</sup>, or Pb<sup>2+ </sup>as the metal cation. Upon addition of metal phthalocyanines, the selectivity of the sensors to certain gases such as, for example, carbon monoxide can be substantially increased. Increased selectivity has been demonstrated in semiconductor gas sensors upon doping with phthalocyanine derivatives, resulting in increased conductivity at the working electrode. In the present case, the increase in sensitivity of the sensors cannot be explained by an increase in conductivity since graphite (carbon) or noble metal electrodes are used, not oxidic semiconductors.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A known problem in the field of electrochemical gas sensors is the strong cross sensitivity of sensors including platinum electrodes to CO. Because hydrogen sensors include platinum electrodes in classical sensor technology, it is de facto impossible to measure hydrogen in the presence of carbon monoxide. The use of a metal phthalocyanine additive can aid in increasing the selectivity of a sensor by increasing the specific solubility of gases in the ionic liquid of the electrolyte.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For Cl<sub>2 </sub>sensors, addition of an additive to the ionic liquid electrolyte system results in greater sensitivity to the Cl<sub>2 </sub>analyte gas as compared to sensors identical in construction, but including an ionic liquid electrolyte system without the additive(s).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Increasing sensitivity using additives such as inorganic additives provides the possibility to generate a specific test reaction for the target gas. By combining different additives, cross-sensitivity patterns can be generated that are not possible in classical (non-ionic liquid) sensor systems or with the use of pure ionic liquids as the electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Mixtures of various additives can be used in the electrolyte. The additive mixture can be a mixture of additives of the same group (for example a mixture of different organic additives). The mixture of different additives can also include additives from different groups (for example, a mixture of organic and inorganic additives). Using mixtures of different additives, cross-sensitivity patterns of sensors can be adapted to specific requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additives can be added to the ionic liquids in the form of an aqueous solution, fused together with the ionic liquids, or suspended therein. The manner of addition depends on the water solubility of the additive, the hygroscopicity of the ionic liquid, and any expected secondary reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Ionic liquids, either alone or including one or more additives from the group of organic compounds, organometallic compounds and/or inorganic compounds, function as ionic conductors in gas sensors in the classical sense of a Clark cell. The working electrode (WE) and counter electrode (CE) surfaces can, for example, include noble metal catalysts or carbon as described above for a two-electrode system. The electrolytes likewise function as ionic conductors in the case of a sensor including a reference electrode (RE) (that is, in three-electrode operation), or in the case that the sensor includes additional electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Two different embodiments of an electrochemical gas sensor were studied. In one embodiment, a quasi-solid electrolyte was used. In the case of embodiments of sensors including a quasi-sold electrolyte, the liquid electrolyte was absorbed in a powdered and/or fibrous nonwoven solid material (for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>). In other embodiments, no absorbent was used. In such &#x201c;absorbent-free&#x201d; embodiments, the electrolyte is present, for example, in liquid, solid, or glass-like form.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The sensor can include a housing which includes at least one opening through which the gas to be detected enters the sensor. In another embodiment, electrodes can be imprinted upon a circuit board or upon flexible materials such as, for example, fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In quasi-solid electrolyte embodiments, the electrolyte is substantially absorbed in a solid material (for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>) as described above. As used herein in connection with absorption of the electrolyte, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; indicates that the ionic liquid is present and is absorbed to an extent of at least 90%. The electrolyte can also be absorbed to an extend of at least 95%, or even at least 99%. In several such embodiments, the electrochemical gas sensor included a housing with at least one inlet as described above. The at least two electrodes were arranged in the housing and were ionically interconnected via the electrolyte system, which included, for example, the quasi-solid electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Position or orientation independence of the sensor performance is, among other things, important for an electrochemical gas sensor. Immobilizing liquid electrolytes using, for example, glass fibers or silicate structures to form a quasi-solid electrolyte improves position independence. With a quasi-solid electrolyte, reaction products and electrolytes are prevented from migrating through the sensor, and they cannot deposit on sensitive sites (for example, upon the working electrode or the reference electrode). Furthermore, there is no depletion as a result of leaching processes between the electrodes, which facilitates miniaturization of the sensor cells. Quasi-solid electrolyte systems are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,145,561, 7,147,761, 5,565,075 and 5,667,653. The systems described therein provide a good response time and allow for a compact design with the use conventional electrolytes.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The advantages of using a quasi-solid electrolyte with ionic liquid electrolytes is discussed in Published PCT International Patent Application WO 2008/110830 A1, which discloses an electrochemical sensor having an ionic liquid immobilized in a support material. A number of anions and cations are described for the ionic liquid. The cations disclosed include imidazolium, pyridinium, tetraalkylammonium, and tetraalkylphosphonium cations. The sensor is used for the detection of gases in the air exhaled by a patient to, for example, enable diagnosis of asthma. The sensor is operated in a cyclic voltammetric mode of operation. In cyclic voltammetry, the potential of the working electrode is varied between preset potential limits at a constant rate.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In several embodiments in which a quasi-solid electrolyte is used herein, the electrode materials are applied to a membrane permeable to gases or are directly mixed in the form of a powder with the electrolyte (that is, with the powdered solid material including the absorbed the ionic liquid). In the case that the electrode materials are directly applied to the quasi-solid electrolyte, care must be taken that electrolyte powder separates the electrode materials to prevent a short circuit between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The housing can be formed of metal or any other suitable material. Because ionic liquids, unlike conventional electrolytes such as sulfuric acid, are not highly corrosive, there are few if any problems with regard to corrosion of metallic housings. Polymers or plastics are also suitable as material for the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a number of representative embodiments, the powdered solid material used in forming the quasi-solid electrolyte is a silicate having an average particle size of at least 5 &#x3bc;m, at least 50 &#x3bc;m, or at least 75 &#x3bc;m; a specific surface area of at least 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or at least 150 m<sup>2</sup>/g; and a SiO<sub>2 </sub>content of at least 95% by weight. The term &#x201c;silicate&#x201d; includes variants of SiO<sub>2 </sub>such as silica gels and silicates (for example, SIPERNAT&#xae; silica particles and SIDENT&#xae; silica, available from Evonik Degussa GMBH of Essen, Germany). In several embodiments, the silicate is pure SiO<sub>2 </sub>or alumosilicates and calcium silicates. The specific surface area can vary widely. For example, a specific surface area in the range of 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g is suitable. In several embodiments, a silicate having an average particle size of 100 &#x3bc;m, a specific surface area of 190 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and a SiO<sub>2 </sub>content of at least 98% by weight is used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other embodiments of sensors including an absorbed electrolyte, the liquid electrolyte was absorbed upon a fibrous nonwoven solid material (for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>) in the form of a glass fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The solid material in which the liquid electrolyte is substantially absorbed can be present within the sensor as a bed, in a layered arrangement or in a compressed form. A bed or layered arrangement provides flexibility in the design of the sensors. Compression can take place in several steps. Compression to form as pellet provides advantages in production. The sensor can be assembled so that the pellet can be positioned between two electrodes. The entire assembly can be compressed by the sensor housing.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Electrodes can be compressed together with the compressed SiO<sub>2 </sub>before being placed within the sensor to reduce assembly steps.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The ratio of electrolyte to the solid material (for example, SiO<sub>2</sub>) can vary over a wide range. A ratio of electrolyte to solid SiO<sub>2 </sub>material in the range of one to two parts to one to one part by weight is, for example, suitable. Even in the case of excess electrolyte, an almost dry powder is achieved (that is, the electrolyte is substantially absorbed to at least 90%, to at least 95%, and even to at least 99%). The resultant pellet can, for example, have a weight of approximately 200 mg, in which &#xbd; to &#x2154; of the weight is electrolyte and &#xbd; to &#x2153; of the weight is the solid material.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Sensor designs incorporating a quasi-solid electrolyte are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,145,561, 5,565,075, 7,147,761, and 5,667,653. The design and material of the housing as well as the arrangement and design of the quasi-solid electrolyte of those references can be adapted for use herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In all embodiments described above, the electrochemical gas sensors can be operated in different measuring modes such as, for example, an amperometric measuring mode. Analyte gases that can be sensed include acid gases, basic gases, neutral gases, oxidizing gases, reducing gases, halogen gases and vapors, and hydridic gases. The sensors can both qualitatively detect that an analyte gas is present and quantify the amount of gas present.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sensors can, for example, be used for the detection and/or measurement of F<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, ClO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, HCl, HBr, HF, HCN, PH<sub>3</sub>, AsH<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, GeH<sub>4</sub>, or SiH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
