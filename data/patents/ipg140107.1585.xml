<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to electrical cable connectors. More particularly, the invention relates to connectors with an interconnection interface with capacitive coupling between signal conducting portions of the connection interface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Coaxial cables are commonly utilized in RF communications systems. Coaxial cable connectors may be applied to terminate coaxial cables, for example, in communication systems requiring a high level of precision and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Connector interfaces provide a connect and disconnect functionality between a cable terminated with a connector bearing the desired connector interface and a corresponding connector with a mating connector interface mounted on an apparatus or a further cable. Prior coaxial connector interfaces typically utilize a retainer provided as a threaded coupling nut which draws the connector interface pair into secure electro-mechanical engagement as the coupling nut, rotatably retained upon one connector, is threaded upon the other connector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Passive Intermodulation Distortion (PIM) is a form of electrical interference/signal transmission degradation that may occur with less than symmetrical interconnections and/or as electro-mechanical interconnections shift or degrade over time, for example due to mechanical stress, vibration, thermal cycling, and/or material degradation. PIM is an important interconnection quality characteristic as PIM generated by a single low quality interconnection may degrade the electrical performance of an entire RF system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recent developments in RF coaxial connector design have focused upon reducing PIM by improving interconnections between the conductors of coaxial cables and the connector body and/or inner contact, for example by applying a molecular bond instead of an electro-mechanical interconnection, as disclosed in commonly owned US Patent Application Publication 2012/0129391, titled &#x201c;Connector and Coaxial Cable with Molecular Bond Interconnection&#x201d;, by Kendrick Van Swearingen and James P. Fleming, published on 24 May 2012 and hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Competition in the cable connector market has focused attention on improving interconnection performance and long term reliability of the interconnection. Further, reduction of overall costs, including materials, training and installation costs, is a significant factor for commercial success.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a coaxial connector and method of interconnection that overcomes deficiencies in the prior art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The inventor has recognized that PIM may be generated at, in addition to the interconnections between the inner and outer conductors of a coaxial cable and each coaxial connector, the electrical interconnections between the connector interfaces of mating coaxial connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, threaded interconnection interfaces may be difficult to connect in high density/close proximity connector situations as a basin-type wrench <b>2</b> is required to access the connector <b>4</b>, the wrench handle spaced away from the connector <b>4</b> along the longitudinal axis of the connector <b>4</b>, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Although it is possible to thread the connector bodies/coupling nuts together, starting the threading may be difficult as the access to control how the connector bodies are aligning/seating together is frustrated and the repeated rotation required during the threading typically interferes with the cable <b>6</b> extending from the connector <b>4</b> and/or the cables <b>6</b> of adjacent connectors <b>4</b>. Even where smaller diameter cables <b>6</b> are utilized, standard quick connection interfaces such as BNC-type interconnections may provide unsatisfactory electrical performance with respect to PIM, as the connector body may pivot laterally along the opposed dual retaining pins and internal spring element, due to the spring contact applied between the male and female portions, according to the BNC interface specification.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An exemplary embodiment of a tabbed connector interface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-17</figref>, demonstrates a rigid connector interface where the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> seat together interlocked by sets of symmetrically meshed and interlocking tabs, demonstrated in the present embodiment as sets of three tabs each.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a male portion <b>8</b> has, for example, three outer diameter radial projecting connector tabs <b>10</b> and a male outer conductor coupling surface <b>9</b> provided as a conical outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> at an interface end <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">One skilled in the art will appreciate that interface end <b>14</b> and cable end <b>15</b> are applied herein as identifiers for respective ends of both the connector and also of discrete elements of the connector described herein, to identify same and their respective interconnecting surfaces according to their alignment along a longitudinal axis of the connector between an interface end <b>14</b> and a cable end <b>15</b> of each of the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b>. When interconnected by the connector interface, the interface end <b>14</b> of the male portion <b>8</b> is coupled to the interface end <b>14</b> of the female portion <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a releasable retainer <b>18</b> is provided with a stop shoulder <b>20</b> and radially inward coupling tabs <b>22</b> proximate the interface end <b>14</b>. The number of coupling tabs <b>22</b> corresponds to the number of connector tabs <b>10</b> applied to the male portion <b>8</b>. The releasable retainer <b>18</b> is dimensioned to seat around the male portion <b>8</b>, the stop shoulder <b>20</b> abutting the cable end <b>15</b> of the connector tabs <b>10</b>. A tab seat <b>24</b> is provided between the coupling tabs <b>22</b> and the stop shoulder <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the releasable retainer <b>18</b> may be seated by aligning the coupling tabs <b>22</b> with spaces between each of the connector tabs <b>10</b> so that the coupling tabs <b>22</b> extend below the connector tabs <b>10</b> when the stop shoulder <b>20</b> is seated against the cable end <b>15</b> of the connector tabs <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the releasable retainer <b>18</b> may then be rotated so that the coupling tabs <b>22</b> are in a shadow of the connector tabs <b>10</b>, ready for insertion of the male portion <b>8</b> into the female portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the female portion <b>16</b> is provided with a plurality of radially projecting base tabs <b>26</b>, corresponding to the number of connector tabs <b>10</b>, and an annular groove <b>28</b> open to the interface end <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref> demonstrate engagement details as the male portion <b>8</b> is seated within the female portion <b>16</b> and the releasable retainer <b>18</b> rotated to secure the interconnection. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an outer sidewall <b>30</b> of the annular groove <b>28</b> is dimensioned to mate with the male outer conductor coupling surface <b>9</b>, here provided as a conical outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> enabling self-aligning conical surface to conical surface mutual seating between the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The base tabs <b>26</b> are dimensioned to engage the coupling tabs <b>22</b> when the base tabs <b>26</b> are inserted into the tab seat <b>24</b> as the releasable retainer <b>18</b> is rotated, retaining the outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> against the outer sidewall <b>30</b> to form a rigid interconnection of the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The initial alignment of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> upon the male portion <b>8</b>, for ease of male portion <b>8</b> insertion into and seating with the female portion <b>16</b>, and/or rotatability characteristics of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> upon interconnection, may be controlled by interlock features of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> and the outer diameter surfaces of the base and/or connector tabs <b>26</b>, <b>10</b>, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A rotation lock of the releasable retainer <b>18</b>, retaining the releasable retainer <b>18</b> in the engaged position, may be created by providing a tab seat lock <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) on a sidewall of the tab seat <b>24</b> that meshes with a base tab lock <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) provided on an outer diameter of the base tab <b>26</b>, when the releasable retainer <b>18</b> is rotated into the engaged position. The tab seat lock <b>32</b> may be formed, for example, as a pair of radially inward protrusions <b>36</b> which the base tab lock <b>34</b>, formed as a radial outward protrusion <b>38</b>, seats between.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, circumferential alignment of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> on the male portion <b>8</b> during initial insertion may be assisted by an outer diameter insertion surface <b>40</b> dimensioned to engage the tab seat lock <b>32</b> in an interference fit, retaining the releasable retainer <b>18</b> aligned in an in-line insertion position with respect to the connector tabs <b>10</b> so that the base tabs <b>26</b> can mesh with the connector tabs <b>10</b> as the outer sidewall <b>30</b> of the annular groove <b>28</b> is mated with the conical outer sidewall <b>30</b>, without interference from the coupling tabs <b>22</b> retained in the shadow of the connector tabs <b>10</b>. The interference fit between the tab seat lock <b>32</b> and the insertion surface <b>40</b> may be provided at a level of interference which retains the releasable retainer <b>18</b> in place as the male portion <b>8</b> is inserted through adjacent connectors and/or cables towards the female portion <b>16</b>, but which allows rotation of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> to slide the tab seat lock <b>32</b> away from the insertion surface <b>40</b> upon application of torque to begin the rotation of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> with respect to the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> as the releasable retainer <b>18</b> is rotated to the engaged position during final interconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> may be visually obscured by the adjacent apparatus and/or cables during interconnection, a tactile feedback that the engagement position has been reached may be provided by a click action as the base tab lock <b>34</b> drops into engagement with the tab seat lock <b>32</b>. Further feedback that the engagement position has been reached may be provided by dimensioning the connector tab <b>10</b> with an outer diameter stop surface <b>42</b> dimensioned to provide a positive stop with respect to rotation of the tab seat lock <b>32</b> past the base tab lock <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Thereby, the installer is unable to over-rotate the releasable retainer <b>18</b> past the engagement position.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The cable end <b>15</b> of the base tabs <b>26</b> and/or coupling tabs <b>22</b> may be provided with an angled engagement surface <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) for ease of initial engagement therebetween. Thereby, as the releasable retainer <b>18</b> is rotated, the coupling tab <b>22</b> is driven against the angled engagement surface <b>52</b> and the coupling tab <b>22</b> is progressively drawn toward the cable end <b>15</b> as the coupling tab <b>22</b> advances along the engagement surface <b>52</b>, driving the male portion <b>8</b> into engagement with the female portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One skilled in the art will appreciate that the connector tabs <b>10</b> mesh with the base tabs <b>26</b> as the outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> is seated against the outer sidewall <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), inhibiting rotation of the male portion <b>8</b> with respect to the female portion <b>16</b>, allowing the releasable retainer <b>18</b> to be rotated without requiring an additional tool to inhibit rotation of the male portion <b>8</b>, for example where the female portion <b>16</b> is configured for panel surface mounting via a mounting flange <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stop shoulder <b>20</b> of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> may be formed with a retention lip <b>54</b> that projects radially inward (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Thereby, the retention lip <b>54</b> may engage a corresponding radially outward protruding retention spur <b>56</b> of the male portion <b>8</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), retaining the releasable retainer <b>18</b> upon the male portion <b>8</b> at the cable end <b>15</b>. The retention spur <b>56</b> may be formed directly in the outer diameter of the male portion <b>8</b> or alternatively on an overbody <b>58</b> covering an outer diameter of the male portion <b>8</b> between the cable end <b>15</b> and the connector tabs <b>10</b>. The overbody <b>58</b> may be sealed against a jacket of the cable <b>6</b> to provide both an environmental seal for the cable end of the interconnection and a structural reinforcement of the cable <b>6</b> to male portion <b>8</b> interconnection.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a further environmental seal may be formed by applying an annular seal groove <b>60</b> in the outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b>, in which a seal <b>62</b> such as an elastometric o-ring or the like may be seated. Because of the conical mating between the outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> and the outer side wall <b>30</b>, the seal <b>62</b> may experience reduced insertion friction compared to that encountered when seals are applied between telescoping cylindrical surfaces, enabling the seal <b>62</b> to be slightly over-sized, which may result in an improved environmental seal between the outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> and the outer side wall <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present embodiment demonstrates a coaxial cable outer conductor <b>44</b> to connector <b>4</b> interconnection in the male portion <b>8</b> which passes the outer conductor <b>44</b> through the male portion <b>8</b> into direct contact with the female portion <b>16</b>, circumferentially clamped at the interconnection therebetween. Thereby, the several additional connector elements and/or internal connections common in conventional coaxial connectors with a cable to connector retention based upon interconnection with the outer conductor <b>44</b> may be eliminated. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an inner sidewall <b>46</b> of the annular groove <b>28</b> is dimensioned to seat against a flared end of the outer conductor <b>44</b> of the coaxial cable <b>6</b> inserted through a bore <b>48</b> of the male portion <b>8</b>, clamping the outer conductor <b>44</b> between the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> when the outer diameter seat surface <b>12</b> is seated against the outer sidewall <b>30</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a direct pass through of the outer conductor <b>44</b> eliminates potential PIM sources present between each additional surface/contact point present in a conventional coaxial cable connector termination.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, the seat surface <b>12</b> may be applied dimensioned to seat at the annular groove <b>28</b> as the primary contact of the interconnection, and the flared end of the outer conductor <b>44</b> coupled to the inner sidewall <b>46</b> as further described herebelow. Although an intimate contact may occur between the flared end of the outer conductor <b>44</b> and the outer sidewall <b>30</b>, because the outer conductor <b>44</b> is already coupled (preferably molecular bond coupled) to the male portion <b>8</b>, in this embodiment a high level &#x201c;clamping force&#x201d; is not required to secure the interconnection. Thereby, the strength requirements of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> and the interconnecting portions of the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> it engages may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The inventor has recognized that, in contrast to traditional mechanical, solder and/or conductive adhesive interconnections, a molecular bond type interconnection may reduce aluminum oxide surface coating issues, PIM generation and improves long term interconnection reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A &#x201c;molecular bond&#x201d; as utilized herein is defined as an interconnection in which the bonding interface between two elements utilizes exchange, intermingling, fusion or the like of material from each of two elements bonded together. The exchange, intermingling, fusion or the like of material from each of two elements generates an interface layer where the comingled materials combine into a composite material comprising material from each of the two elements being bonded together.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">One skilled in the art will recognize that a molecular bond may be generated by application of heat sufficient to melt the bonding surfaces of each of two elements to be bonded together, such that the interface layer becomes molten and the two melted surfaces exchange material with one another. Then, the two elements are retained stationary with respect to one another, until the molten interface layer cools enough to solidify.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The resulting interconnection is contiguous across the interface layer, eliminating interconnection quality and/or degradation issues such as material creep, oxidation, galvanic corrosion, moisture infiltration and/or interconnection surface shift.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A molecular bond between the outer conductor <b>44</b> of the cable <b>6</b> and the male portion <b>8</b> may be generated via application of heat to the desired interconnection surfaces between the outer conductor <b>44</b> and the male portion <b>8</b>, for example via laser or friction welding. Friction welding may be applied, for example, as spin and/or ultrasonic type welding.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A molecular bond between the male portion <b>8</b> and outer conductor <b>44</b> may be formed by inserting the prepared end of the cable <b>6</b> into the bore <b>48</b> so that the outer conductor <b>44</b> is flush with the interface end <b>14</b> of the bore <b>48</b>, enabling application of a laser to the circumferential joint between the outer diameter of the outer conductor <b>44</b> and the inner diameter of the bore <b>48</b> at the interface end <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Alternatively, a molecular bond may be formed via ultrasonic welding by applying ultrasonic vibrations under pressure in a join zone between two parts desired to be welded together, resulting in local heat sufficient to plasticize adjacent surfaces that are then held in contact with one another until the interflowed surfaces cool, completing the molecular bond. An ultrasonic weld may be applied with high precision via a sonotrode and/or simultaneous sonotrode ends to a point and/or extended surface. Where a point ultrasonic weld is applied, successive overlapping point welds may be applied to generate a continuous ultrasonic weld. Ultrasonic vibrations may be applied, for example, in a linear direction and/or reciprocating along an arc segment, known as torsional vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An outer conductor molecular bond with the male portion <b>8</b> via ultrasonic welding is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A flare surface <b>50</b> angled radially outward from the bore <b>6</b> toward the interface end <b>14</b> of the male portion <b>8</b> is open to the interface end <b>14</b> of the male portion <b>8</b>, providing a mating surface to which a leading end flare of the outer conductor <b>44</b> may be ultrasonically welded by an outer conductor sonotrode of an ultrasonic welder inserted to contact the leading end flare from the interface end <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In alternative embodiments the interconnection between the cable <b>6</b> and the male and/or female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> may be applied more conventionally, for example utilizing clamp-type and/or soldered interconnections well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Prior to interconnection, the leading end of the cable <b>6</b> may be prepared by cutting the cable <b>6</b> so that inner conductor(s) <b>63</b> extend from the outer conductor <b>44</b>. Also, a dielectric material that may be present between the inner conductor(s) <b>63</b> and outer conductor <b>44</b> may be stripped back and a length of the outer jacket removed to expose desired lengths of each. The inner conductor <b>63</b> may be dimensioned to extend through the attached coaxial connector for direct interconnection with the female portion <b>16</b> as a male inner conductor coupling surface <b>65</b> part of the connection interface. Alternatively, for example where the connection interface selected requires an inner conductor profile that is not compatible with the inner conductor <b>63</b> of the selected cable <b>6</b> and/or where the material of the inner conductor <b>63</b> is an undesired inner conductor connector interface material, such as aluminum, the inner conductor <b>63</b> may be terminated by applying an inner conductor cap <b>64</b> operative as the male inner conductor coupling surface <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The inner conductor cap <b>64</b>, for example formed from a metal such as brass, bronze or other desired metal, may be applied with a molecular bond to the end of the inner conductor <b>63</b>, also by friction welding such as spin or ultrasonic welding. The inner conductor cap <b>64</b> may be provided with an inner conductor socket at the cable end <b>15</b> and a desired inner conductor interface at the interface end <b>14</b>. The inner conductor socket may be dimensioned to mate with a prepared end of an inner conductor of the cable <b>6</b>. To apply the inner conductor cap <b>64</b>, the end of the inner conductor <b>63</b> may be prepared to provide a pin profile corresponding to the selected socket geometry of the inner conductor cap <b>64</b>. To allow material inter-flow during welding attachment, the socket geometry of the inner conductor cap <b>64</b> and/or the end of the inner conductor <b>63</b> may be formed to provide a material gap when the inner conductor cap <b>64</b> is seated upon the prepared end of the inner conductor <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A rotation key may be provided upon the inner conductor cap <b>64</b>, the rotation key dimensioned to mate with a spin tool or a sonotrode for rotating and/or torsionally reciprocating the inner conductor cap <b>64</b>, for molecular bond interconnection via spin or ultrasonic friction welding.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Alternatively, the inner conductor cap <b>64</b> may be applied via laser welding applied to a seam between the outer diameter of the inner conductor <b>63</b> and an outer diameter of the cable end <b>15</b> of the inner conductor cap <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To further eliminate PIM generation also with respect to the connection interface between the coaxial connectors, the outer conductor <b>44</b> may be coupled to the male portion <b>8</b> (preferably by molecular bond interconnection) and the connection interface modified to apply capacitive coupling, instead of conventional &#x201c;physical contact&#x201d; galvanic electro-mechanical coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Capacitive coupling may be obtained by applying a dielectric spacer between the inner and/or outer conductor contacting surfaces of the connector interface. Capacitive coupling between spaced apart conductor surfaces eliminates the direct electrical current interconnection between these surfaces that is otherwise subject to PIM generation/degradation as described herein above with respect to cable conductor to connector interconnections.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">One skilled in the art will appreciate that a capacitive coupling interconnection may be optimized for a specific operating frequency band. For example, the level of capacitive coupling between separated conductor surfaces is a function of the desired frequency band(s) of the electrical signal(s), the surface area of the separated conductor surfaces, the dielectric constant of a dielectric spacer and the thickness of the dielectric spacer (distance between the separated conductor surfaces).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The dielectric spacer may be applied, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>. with respect to the outer conductor <b>44</b> as an outer conductor dielectric spacer <b>66</b> by providing at least the connector end of the male portion (the seating surface <b>12</b>) with a dielectric coating, demonstrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Where a tabbed connector interface is applied, the outer conductor dielectric spacer <b>66</b> may be applied covering the base tabs <b>26</b>. Similarly, the inner conductor cap <b>64</b> may be covered at the interface end <b>14</b> and/or outer diameter with a dielectric coating to form an inner conductor dielectric spacer <b>68</b>. Thereby, when the male portion <b>8</b> is secured within a corresponding female portion <b>16</b>, an entirely capacitively coupled interconnection interface is formed. That is, there is no direct galvanic interconnection between the inner conductor or outer conductor electrical pathways across the connection interface.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The dielectric coatings of the outer and inner conductor dielectric spacers <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> may be provided, for example, as a ceramic or polymer dielectric material. One example of a dielectric coating with suitable compression and thermal resistance characteristics that may be applied with high precision at very thin thicknesses is ceramic coatings. Ceramic coatings may be applied directly to the desired surfaces via a range of deposition processes, such as Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) or the like. Ceramic coatings have a further benefit of a high hardness characteristic, thereby protecting the coated surfaces from damage prior to interconnection and/or resisting thickness variation due to compressive forces present upon interconnection. The ability to apply extremely thin dielectric coatings, for example as thin as 0.5 microns, may reduce the surface area requirement of the separated conductor surfaces, enabling the overall dimensions of the connection interface to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The inner conductor dielectric spacer <b>68</b> covering the inner conductor cap <b>64</b> is demonstrated as a conical surface in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>. The conical surface, for example applied at a cone angle corresponding to the cone angle of the male outer conductor coupling surface (conical seat surface <b>12</b>), may provide an increased range of initial insertion angles for ease of initiating the interconnection and protection of these inner and outer conductor dielectric spacers <b>68</b>,<b>66</b> during initial mating for interconnection. Alternatively, the inner conductor cap <b>64</b> and corresponding female inner conductor coupling surfaces <b>69</b> of the inner conductor contact <b>71</b> may be formed, for example, in a configuration that is cylindrical (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>), spherical (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>), planar normal to the longitudinal axis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>) or corrugated normal to the longitudinal axis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>) to satisfy specific surface area, thickness and/or dielectric strength requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, capacitive coupling may be applied to connection interfaces with conventional releasable retainer <b>18</b> configurations. For example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-32</figref>, a variation of a standard DIN connector interface applies telescopic mating between the seating surface <b>12</b> and the annular groove <b>28</b>, wherein the outer conductor dielectric spacer <b>66</b> is applied between a male outer seating surface <b>9</b> provided on an inner diameter of the interface end <b>14</b> of the male portion <b>8</b> and the inner sidewall <b>46</b> of the annular groove <b>28</b> of the female portion <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The releasable retainer <b>18</b> has been demonstrated formed from a dielectric material, for example a fiber reinforced polymer. Therefore, the releasable retainer <b>18</b> does not create a galvanic electro-mechanical coupling between the male portion <b>8</b> and the female portion <b>16</b>. Where the additional wear and/or strength characteristics of a metal material releasable retainer <b>18</b> are desired, for example where the releasable retainer <b>18</b> is a conventional threaded lock ring that couples with threads <b>72</b> of the female portion <b>16</b> to draw the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> together and secure them in the interconnected position, a retainer dielectric spacer <b>70</b> may be applied, between seating surfaces of the releasable retainer <b>18</b> and the male portion <b>8</b>, to electrically isolate the releasable retainer <b>18</b> from the male portion <b>8</b>, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The exemplary embodiments are demonstrated with respect to a cable <b>6</b> that is an RF-type coaxial cable. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the connection interface may be similarly applied to any desired cable <b>6</b>, for example multiple conductor cables, power cables and/or optical cables, by applying suitable conductor mating surfaces/individual conductor interconnections aligned within the bore <b>48</b> of the male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Exemplary embodiments have been herein demonstrated with three connector tabs <b>10</b>, coupling tabs <b>22</b> and base tabs <b>26</b>. A three tab configuration provides a sixty degree rotation engagement characteristic. That is, the interconnection may be fully engaged by rotating the releasable retainer <b>18</b> sixty degrees with respect to the female portion <b>16</b>. Further, the symmetrical distribution of the tabs provides symmetrical support to the interconnection along the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">One skilled in the art will appreciate that the number of tabs may be increased, resulting in a proportional decrease in the angular rotation engagement characteristic. As the number of tabs is increased a tradeoff may apply in that the area available on the base tabs <b>26</b> for an engagement surface <b>52</b> decreases, which may require a steeper engagement surface angle to be applied and/or otherwise complicate initial engagement characteristics. Further, as the dimensions of the individual tabs decrease, materials with increased strength characteristics may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">One skilled in the art will further appreciate that the tabbed connector interface provides a quick connect rigid interconnection with a reduced number of discrete elements, which may simplify manufacturing and/or assembly requirements. Contrary to conventional connection interfaces featuring threads, the conical aspect of the seat surface <b>12</b> is generally self-aligning, allowing interconnection to be initiated without precise initial male to female portion <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> alignment along the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The application of capacitive coupling to male and female portions <b>8</b>, <b>16</b> which are themselves provided with molecular bond interconnections with continuing conductors, enables a quick connectable RF circuit that may be entirely without PIM.</p>
