<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to nonvolatile memory devices and, more particularly, to arrangements of nonvolatile memory devices with each memory level stacked level by level above a semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A nonvolatile semiconductor memory device is typically designed to securely hold data even when power is lost or removed from the memory device. Several types of nonvolatile memory devices have been proposed in the related art, examples of which include U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,478 (the '478 patent) to Sakurai, U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,907 (the '907 patent) to Sung et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,968 to Crafts et al. (the '968 patent), U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,703 to Chang (the '703 patent), U.S. Pat. No. 5,835,396 (the '396 patent) to Zhang, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,882 (the '882 patent) to Johnson et al.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The nonvolatile memory devices taught by the '907 and '968 patents appear to suffer from a disadvantage wherein the number of nonvolatile devices per unit area of semiconductor substrate is limited by their arrangement in a two-dimensional structure. The device taught by the '907 patent does not appear to be electrically programmable. Furthermore, the polysilicon fuse array structure disclosed in the '968 patent has the disadvantage that the fuse arrays appear to require relatively large separations between adjacent elements, and the vertical anti-fuse structures described in the '703, 396 and '882 patents appear to require substantial areas of the semiconductor floor plan.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Needs thus exist in the related art for nonvolatile memory devices that can be implemented with an increased number of nonvolatile memory devices per unit area of semiconductor substrate, that are electrically programmable at sufficiently high programming rates and that occupy a reduced area of semiconductor floor plan.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention addresses these needs by providing, in accordance with one aspect, nonvolatile memory devices and methods for making the same that can be implemented to provide increased numbers of nonvolatile memory cell devices per unit area of semiconductor substrate. An arrangement of the nonvolatile memory devices of the present invention can have a plurality of memory levels stacked level by level above a semiconductor substrate, programmable on both positive and negative swings of a programming current pulse cycle, having a reduced requirement for semiconductor floor plan, and being able to store at least one data bit per cell.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention disclosed may comprise an arrangement of nonvolatile memory devices having a plurality of memory levels stacked level by level above a semiconductor substrate, wherein each memory level comprises a semiconductor substrate, an oxide layer disposed substantially above the semiconductor substrate, pairs of word lines disposed substantially above the semiconductor substrate, a plurality of bit lines disposed substantially above the semiconductor substrate, an anti-fuse dielectric material disposed on side walls substantially beside the bit lines and substantially in contact with the bit lines and a plurality of via plugs substantially in electrical contact with the word lines. The present invention may include word lines arranged, according to one embodiment, singly, or, according to another embodiment, in pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the presently preferred embodiment, a nonvolatile memory device is fabricated by providing a semiconductor substrate, forming an oxide layer disposed substantially above the semiconductor substrate, forming a pair of word lines disposed substantially above the oxide layer, forming a plurality of bit lines disposed substantially above the oxide layer, forming an anti-fuse dielectric material substantially disposed beside the plurality of bit lines and substantially in contact with the plurality of bit lines, etching a plurality of via between the plurality of word lines and the plurality of bit lines and, forming a plurality of via plugs substantially in electrical contact with the plurality of word lines.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one aspect of the present invention, an arrangement of nonvolatile memory devices, having at least one memory device level stacked level by level above a semiconductor substrate, is provided. Each memory level comprises an oxide layer substantially disposed above a semiconductor substrate, a pair of word lines substantially disposed above the oxide layer, a plurality of bit lines substantially disposed above the oxide layer, a plurality of via plugs substantially in electrical contact with the word lines, and anti-fuse dielectric materials substantially disposed on side walls beside the bit lines and substantially in contact with the anti-fuse dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Any feature or combination of features described herein are included within the scope of the present invention, provided that the features included in any such combination are not mutually inconsistent as will be apparent from the context, this specification, and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Additional advantages and aspects of the present invention are apparent in the following detailed description and claims.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A first anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a </i>formed of, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) may be substantially disposed on side walls beside first via plug <b>40</b><i>a</i>, which is substantially disposed between bit lines <b>20</b> and a first word line <b>10</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Via etched between the word lines <b>10</b> and the bit lines <b>20</b> formed from polysilicon having a first type of background impurity are substantially filled by first and second via plugs (represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>and second via plug <b>40</b><i>b</i>) formed from polysilicon doped with a background impurity of a second type opposite to the first type. For example, the bit lines <b>20</b> may be formed from polysilicon having an N-type background impurity type, and the first and second via plugs and may be formed from polysilicon having a P-type background impurity type.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each bit line of the first bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the second bit lines <b>20</b><i>b </i>is coupled between one of the first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>and one of the second word lines <b>10</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates an exemplary spatial relationship between first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>and second word lines <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Second word line <b>10</b><i>b </i>in the illustrated embodiment comprises a &#x201c;shelf&#x201d; portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>that extends over first word line <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The relative position of the shelf portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>and first word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is depicted graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by a &#x201c;shadow&#x201d; <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the shelf portion <b>15</b><i>b </i>on the first word line <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The shadow <b>16</b><i>b</i>, which is shown only for purposes of clarifying a portion of the geometry of the nonvolatile memory device <b>5</b>, demonstrates that, e.g., first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>and second via plug <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in substantial linear alignment along a length dimension of one of the plurality of first word lines <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a pictorial diagram illustrating, in a frontal view, an exemplary interconnection of a stack of bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a first via plug <b>40</b><i>a</i>, and a first word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>configured according to the present invention. The first word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>in the diagram connects to a first bit line <b>20</b><i>a </i>through a first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>and anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, first word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>connects to a second bit line <b>20</b><i>b </i>through the first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>and anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Detail of the interconnection of, e.g., first bit line <b>20</b><i>a</i>, anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>, and first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>associated with an exemplary memory cell is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>. Anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>is shown disposed substantially beside first bit line <b>20</b><i>a </i>and between first bit line <b>20</b><i>a </i>and first via plug <b>40</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, substantially no electrical current can pass between first bit line <b>20</b><i>a </i>and first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>as long as anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>remains intact. The intact form of anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>may represent a default configuration for an exemplary memory cell, the default configuration corresponding, for example, to a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019; program state for the memory cell. It should be understood that additional bit lines (not shown) may connect to the first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The additional bit lines may contact the first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>through additional first anti-fuse dielectric material <b>31</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that may form additional memory cells. This concept is explained more fully in discussion below related to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 9</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b </i>illustrates one modified configuration of the exemplary memory cell, the modified configuration corresponding to a logic &#x2018;1&#x2019; program state for the exemplary memory cell. The diagram shows a region <b>25</b><i>a </i>comprising a breakdown of the anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>, a condition that may be induced, for example, by applying a relatively high voltage (i.e., a voltage higher than the breakdown voltage of the anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>) between word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and bit line <b>20</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows detail of the breakdown region <b>25</b><i>a </i>for an example wherein the bit line <b>20</b><i>a </i>is formed of N-type material and the via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>is formed of P-type material. In that instance, a PN diode forms that exhibits, for example, a depletion region <b>45</b> at a boundary between the P and N areas. Such a PN diode may be capable of allowing current in a P-to-N direction while not supporting current in an N-to-P direction. A cell having intact anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>), on the other hand, supports current in neither direction. Detection of the programmed state (i.e. &#x2018;0&#x2019; or &#x2018;1&#x2019;) of a memory cell can be accomplished by applying an external voltage to a bit line and a word line associated (through a via plug) with a given memory cell and sensing a current magnitude. For example, if a voltage greater than a threshold voltage of the PN diode (e.g., greater than about 0.7 volts) is applied to a word line that is positive with respect to a chosen bit line, then a substantially zero value of sensed current indicates that a corresponding memory cell is programmed to a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019; state. If a current that exceeds a given threshold is sensed, then it may be determined that the memory cell is programmed to a logic &#x2018;1&#x2019; state. Bit line (e.g., N-type) material <b>20</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> &#x201c;punches through&#x201d; the anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>causing breakdown of the anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>. In another embodiment (not illustrated), via plug (e.g., P-type) material <b>40</b><i>a </i>may punch through the anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Either phenomenon can form a PN diode consistent with programming the memory cell to a logic &#x2018;1&#x2019; state as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified diagram illustrating a top view of placement of first word lines according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Conversely, the memory cell disposed between via plug <b>40</b><i>b </i>and bit line <b>20</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>, the memory cell disposed between via plug <b>40</b><i>b </i>and bit line <b>20</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, and the memory cell disposed between via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>and bit line <b>20</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> are programmed to a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a stacked bit line dual word line nonvolatile memory device including circuitry that may be employed to address memory elements in the device. For purposes of illustration, bit lines in the diagram are denoted by Bx<b>0</b>, Bx<b>1</b>, . . . , Bx<b>4</b> where &#x2018;x&#x2019; denotes a layer of a bit line. That is, bit lines on a first layer (e.g., bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>) may be denoted by B<b>10</b>, B<b>11</b>, . . . , B<b>14</b>; bit lines on a second layer (e.g., bit lines <b>20</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>) may be denoted by B<b>20</b>, B<b>21</b>, . . . , B<b>24</b>, and so on for layers more than two. Word lines in the diagram are similarly identified, with first word lines being denoted by W<b>10</b>, W<b>11</b>, . . . , W<b>15</b>, and second word lines being denoted by W<b>20</b>, W<b>21</b>, and W<b>22</b>. Addressed memory elements may be programmed, or their program state determined using circuitry similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Correspondences among reference numbers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b> should be noted in the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> includes a bit line decoder and sense amplifiers <b>55</b> that connect to bit lines through a layer selection decoder <b>65</b>. The layer selection decoder <b>65</b> may select from one of a plurality of layers of bit lines. For example, using two selection lines <b>60</b>, the layer selection decoder <b>65</b> may select between two layers of bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>as illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>. For embodiments having more than two, i.e. three or more, layers of bit lines, additional selection lines may be employed in addition to the two selection lines <b>60</b> shown in the diagram. The layer selection decoder <b>65</b> operates by selecting a layer &#x2018;x&#x2019; of bit lines and by providing an electrical connection between the selected layer &#x2018;x&#x2019; of bit lines and the bit line decoder and sense amplifiers <b>55</b>. Accordingly, bit lines as observed by the bit line decoder and sense amplifiers <b>55</b> are denoted as B<b>0</b>, B<b>1</b>, . . . , B<b>4</b> in the diagram, it being understood that layer selection is transparent to the bit line decoder and sense amplifiers <b>55</b>. Word lines may be accessed by a first word line decoder and word line drive <b>70</b> and by a second word line decoder and word line drive <b>75</b>. First word line decoder and word line drive <b>70</b> is electrically connected to and is capable of accessing first word lines W<b>10</b>, W<b>11</b>, . . . , W<b>15</b> (denoted as <b>10</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, for example). Second word line decoder and word line drive <b>75</b> is electrically connected to and is capable of accessing second word lines W<b>20</b>, W<b>21</b>, and W<b>22</b> (denoted as <b>10</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Bit lines in the embodiment shown in the diagram are fabricated of N-type material; via plugs are fabricated of P-type material. Consider, for example, the via plug <b>80</b><i>a </i>in the diagram. Comparison with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> confirms that via plug <b>80</b><i>a </i>is a first via plug (e.g., first via plug <b>40</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that is disposed on a first word line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, specifically, first word line W<b>10</b> in the diagram. Via plug <b>80</b><i>a </i>has disposed on both sides thereof, anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a </i>that makes contact with respective sets of bit lines Bx<b>0</b> and Bx<b>1</b>. For example, with two layers of bit lines, via plug <b>80</b><i>a </i>connects through anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b><i>a </i>to bit lines B<b>10</b> and B<b>11</b> on the first level and to bit lines B<b>20</b> and B<b>21</b> on the second level. Each of the contacts may be in a broken-down or an intact state according to a programmed state for a memory cell associated with each contact.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A program state, i.e., logic &#x2018;0&#x2019; or logic &#x2018;1&#x2019; as described above, of a memory cell in the illustrated memory device can be determined in general, according to an implementation of a method of the present invention as illustrated in a flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The illustrated implementation comprises choosing a memory cell at step <b>100</b>. Each memory cell has connected thereto a unique bit line, which is selected at step <b>105</b>. The selected bit line should be grounded through a sense amplifier. Referring, for example, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, memory cell <b>51</b><i>b </i>may be selected. A chosen memory cell further has connected thereto a unique via plug that connects, in turn, to a unique word line, which is selected at step <b>110</b>. For example, word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>is selected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> as the word line that is connected to memory cell <b>51</b><i>b </i>(through a via plug <b>40</b><i>a</i>). A negative read voltage is then applied to the selected word line at step <b>115</b>, and a current is sensed in the selected bit line <b>120</b>, which should be connected to ground through a low-impedance path. Typical values for a read voltage may range from about 1 volts to about 2 volts, about 1.5 volts in a preferred embodiment. A test of current magnitude is performed at step <b>125</b> by comparing the magnitude of the sensed current with a current threshold. If the magnitude of the sensed current exceeds the current threshold, then it may be inferred that the anti-fuse dielectric material in the memory cell has broken down, and the program state of the memory cell is decided to be logic &#x2018;1&#x2019; at step <b>130</b>. If the magnitude of the sensed current does not exceed the current threshold, then the program state of the memory cell may be decided to be a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;, assuming that the anti-fuse dielectric material in the memory cell is intact.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to another implementation of the method (not illustrated), a plurality of memory cells in a chosen level may be read simultaneously. In that instance, a level of memory cells may be chosen at step <b>100</b> using, e.g., selection lines <b>60</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. A plurality of bit lines adjacent to the memory cells is then grounded through sense amplifiers (e.g. bit line decoder and sense amplifiers <b>55</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) at step <b>105</b>. Remaining steps of this implementation of the method may follow the steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A method of the present invention for fabricating an arrangement of nonvolatile memory devices is illustrated, according to an exemplary implementation in a flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-22</figref> illustrate results of applying steps of the method. The implementation of the method may comprise providing a semiconductor substrate <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) at step <b>200</b>. An insulating layer <b>405</b>, which may comprise SiO<sub>2</sub>, may be formed substantially above the semiconductor substrate <b>400</b> at step <b>205</b>, after which a layer of first word line material <b>410</b> may be deposited at step <b>210</b>. The layer of first word line material <b>410</b>, which may be formed, for example, of tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), platinum (Pt), polycide plus polysilicon, or the like may be deposited to a thickness ranging from about 200 nm to about 400 nm, preferably about 250 nm. The layer of first word line material <b>410</b> may be patterned at step <b>215</b> to create a substantially parallel plurality of first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>substantially disposed above the insulating layer <b>405</b> as illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Spaces between the first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>may then be filled in with high density plasma (HDP) oxide at step <b>220</b> after which a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) step is performed, stopping when the layer of first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>is reached. Another layer of insulating material <b>415</b>, e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, may then be deposited at step <b>230</b> to a thickness ranging from about 100 nm to about 200 nm, preferably about 150 nm. A reference line <b>416</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref> illustrating an example of an upper limit of the layer <b>415</b> of insulating material. A second layer of word line material may be deposited at step <b>235</b>. to a thickness of between about 200 nm and about 400 nm, preferably about 250 nm. The second layer of word line material may be patterned at step <b>240</b> to form second word lines <b>10</b><i>b </i>according to a layout illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As embodied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, second word lines <b>10</b><i>b </i>comprise shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b </i>that may be disposed above first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>as already described. An exemplary result of performing step <b>240</b> of the method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view taken along a line <b>14</b>-<b>14</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> after performing a fill-in of additional insulating material <b>420</b>, e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, at step <b>245</b>. One implementation of the method performs CMP after step <b>245</b>, stopping on the layer of second word lines <b>10</b><i>b</i>, which layer is also occupied by the shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. A reference line <b>421</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> is included to illustrate an example of a position of an upper surface of the layer of second word lines <b>10</b><i>b </i>(including shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another layer of insulating material <b>425</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, is then deposited on the layer of second word lines <b>10</b><i>b </i>(not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) at step <b>250</b> to a thickness of between about 60 nm and about 100 nm, preferably about 80 nm. A first layer of bit line material <b>430</b>, which may comprise, for example, N-type polysilicon, is then deposited at step <b>255</b>. The first layer of bit line material <b>430</b> may be patterned at step <b>260</b> to form a first plurality of bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>substantially disposed above the layer of insulating material <b>425</b> and extending longitudinally into the plane of the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The patterning may provide for a nominally uniform spacing <b>22</b> between adjacent bit lines. After performing a fill-in step with, e.g., HDP oxide at step <b>265</b>, CMP performed at step <b>270</b> may be used to form a flat upper surface of the first plurality of bit lines <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Steps <b>250</b>-<b>270</b> of the method may be repeated according to a chosen number of layers of bit lines as represented by step <b>275</b> of the implementation of the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. For example, as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, another layer of insulating material, e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, may be deposited at step <b>250</b>, and a second layer of bit line material <b>440</b> may be deposited at step <b>255</b>. The second layer of bit line material <b>440</b> may be patterned at step <b>260</b>, HDP oxide may be used in a fill-in step <b>265</b>, and CMP may be performed at step <b>270</b>. These steps may yield a result as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> showing two layers of bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>separated by a layer <b>435</b> of insulating material. Although insulating material such as oxide is not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, it should be understood that white areas of the diagram typically are filled with insulating material as already described.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A self-aligned deep etch may be performed at step <b>280</b> to form a plurality of via. The deep etch, which may employ an etchant having a higher selectivity for oxide than for polysilicon or metal, may remove oxide in order to form substantially vertical via. The via may extend from first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>and from shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b </i>of second word lines <b>10</b><i>b </i>beside and between first and second bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. In particular, first via <b>450</b> may extend from first word lines <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and second via <b>455</b> may extend from shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b </i>of second word lines <b>10</b><i>b</i>. A mask <b>460</b> comprising open areas <b>465</b> that may define the pattern of the etch is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Photolithographic techniques well known in the art may cause etching to occur in open areas not occupied by polysilicon or metal according to a placement of the mask <b>460</b> on an upper surface of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The mask <b>460</b> may be oriented with length dimensions of the plurality of open areas <b>465</b> oriented parallel to first and second word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>and orthogonal to the layers of bit lines (e.g. bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). Horizontal extents of the via <b>450</b> and <b>455</b> are therefore determined in a first direction nominally parallel to the bit lines by a width dimension <b>23</b> of the plurality of open areas <b>465</b> and in a second direction substantially orthogonal to the bit lines by the spacing <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A sidewell oxide <b>470</b>, e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, may be deposited on sidewalls and bottom surfaces of the via <b>450</b> and <b>455</b> at step <b>285</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The oxide may be deposited to a thickness of about 1 nm to about 5 nm, nominally 2 nm. A non-isotropic etch then may be performed at step <b>290</b> with the etch directed in a substantially vertical direction to remove oxide at bottoms of the via <b>450</b> and <b>455</b>. The non-isotropic etch thereby creates first oxide openings <b>475</b> that expose first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The etch further creates second oxide openings <b>480</b> that expose shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b </i>of second word lines <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Contacts with first word lines <b>10</b><i>a </i>and second word lines <b>10</b><i>b </i>(through shelf portions <b>15</b><i>b</i>) then may be formed by depositing material to form respective first and second via plugs <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>at step <b>295</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. It should be noted that first and second via plugs <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b</i>, which, in a typical embodiment, may formed of P-type polysilicon, have formed on sidewalls thereof, oxide strips that may constitute anti-fuse dielectric material <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and <b>31</b><i>b </i>that also is disposed beside bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The structure depicted in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> should be compared with the perspective view of the memory device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Bit lines may be connected to, for example, a metal layer on a surface of the structure at step <b>300</b> of the implementation of the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">One technique for providing connection of the bit lines is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> taken along a line <b>23</b>-<b>23</b>&#x2032;. In the diagram, a first bit line <b>20</b><i>a</i>, which may represent a plurality of first bit lines <b>20</b><i>a</i>, is fabricated with a somewhat longer length than the length of a second bit line <b>20</b><i>b</i>, likewise representing a plurality of second bit lines <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The difference in lengths of the first bit line <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the second bit line <b>20</b><i>b </i>permits respective first and second via plugs <b>485</b><i>a </i>and <b>485</b><i>b </i>to be formed. First and second via plugs <b>485</b><i>a </i>and <b>485</b><i>b </i>may connect respective first and second bit lines <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>to connections in a metal layer <b>490</b>, for example. In a typical embodiment, first and second via plugs <b>485</b><i>a </i>and <b>485</b><i>b </i>are formed of one of N+ polysilicon, tungsten, or other conducting material. A third bit line <b>20</b><i>c</i>, which may represent a third plurality of bit lines <b>20</b><i>c </i>and an associated third via plug <b>485</b><i>c </i>are shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, emphasizing that, although the examples disclosed herein, generally, comprise two layers of bit lines, the invention contemplates memory devices comprising three or more layers of bit lines.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A method of operation of the present invention may include programming memory cells in the stacked bit line dual word line nonvolatile memory device. One implementation of a programming method may be illustrated by a flow diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. This implementation of the method comprises receiving a program state (i.e. logic &#x2018;0&#x2019; or logic &#x2018;1&#x2019;) at step <b>305</b>. A memory cell to be programmed is chosen at step <b>310</b>. As an illustrative example, memory cell <b>51</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may be chosen at step <b>310</b>. At step <b>315</b> a bit line connected (through anti-fuse dielectric material) to the chosen memory cell is selected. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it should be clear that only one of the second bit lines <b>20</b><i>b </i>lies adjacent to and is connected at step <b>315</b> (through anti-fuse dielectric material) to the selected memory cell. A word line connected (through a via plug) to the chosen memory cell is selected at step <b>320</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, word line <b>10</b><i>a</i>, which connects to memory cell <b>51</b><i>b</i>, is selected at step <b>320</b>. According to a value of the program state received at step <b>305</b>, a test is performed at step <b>325</b>. If the received program state is logic &#x2018;1&#x2019;, then the selected bit line is grounded at step <b>330</b>. All unselected word lines are allowed to float, and, if the received program state is determined at step <b>325</b> to be logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;, then the selected bit line also is allowed to float. A programming voltage (e.g., clock pulses) is applied directly to the selected word line. In general, values are programmed into selected memory cells by blowing the anti-fuse dielectric material for logical 1's but not logical 0's on positive swings, negative swings or both positive and negative swings of the programming voltage pulse cycles. While the implementation of the programming method described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> applies to the programming of a single memory cell, it should be appreciated that all memory cells connected to a chosen word line may be programmed simultaneously according to a straightforward modification of the implementation as described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As an alternative example, in another embodiment of the present invention, a first cell <b>51</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may be programmed by grounding the first word line <b>10</b><i>a </i>to which it is coupled at 0V reference voltage and applying about 5V to 15V programming voltage to the second bit line <b>20</b><i>b </i>to which it is coupled, with other bit and word lines allowed to assume a floating voltage. A second cell <b>50</b><i>b </i>may be programmed by grounding the second word line <b>10</b><i>b </i>(invisible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) to which it is coupled at 0V reference voltage and applying about +5V to 15V programming voltage to the second bit line <b>20</b><i>b </i>to which it is coupled with other bit and word lines allowed to assume a floating voltage.</p>
