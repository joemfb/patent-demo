<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system and in particular to a two-part modular radio frequency (RF) coil array for cardiac and thoracic magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging modality that can create pictures of the inside of a human body without using x-rays or other ionizing radiation. MRI uses a powerful magnet to create a strong, uniform, static magnetic field (i.e., the &#x201c;main magnetic field&#x201d;). When a human body, or part of a human body, is placed in the main magnetic field, the nuclear spins that are associated with the hydrogen nuclei in tissue water become polarized. This means that the magnetic moments that are associated with these spins become preferentially aligned along the direction of the main magnetic field, resulting in a small net tissue magnetization along that axis (the &#x201c;z axis,&#x201d; by convention). An MRI system also comprises components called gradient coils that produce smaller amplitude, spatially varying magnetic fields when a current is applied to them. Typically, gradient coils are designed to produce a magnetic field component that is aligned along the z axis, and that varies linearly in amplitude with position along one of the x, y or z axes. The effect of a gradient coil is to create a small ramp on the magnetic field strength, and concomitantly on the resonant frequency of the nuclear spins, along a single axis. Three gradient coils with orthogonal axes are used to &#x201c;spatially encode&#x201d; the MR signal by creating a signature resonance frequency at each location in the body. Radio frequency (RF) coils are used to create pulses of RF energy at or near the resonance frequency of the hydrogen nuclei. The RF coils are used to add energy to the nuclear spin system in a controlled fashion. As the nuclear spins then relax back to their rest energy state, they give up energy in the form of an RF signal. This signal is detected by the MRI system and is transformed into an image using a computer and known reconstruction algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As mentioned, RF coils are used in an MRI system to transmit RF excitation signals and to receive MR signals emitted by an imaging subject. Various types of RF coils may be utilized in an MRI system such as a whole-body coil and RF surface (or local) coils. Typically, the whole-body RF coil is used for transmitting RF excitation signals, although a whole-body RF coil may also be configured to receive MRI signals. One or more (e.g., an array) surface coils can be used as receive coils to detect MRI signals or, in certain applications, to transmit RF excitation signals. Surface coils may be placed in close proximity to a region of interest in a subject and, for reception, typically yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than a whole-body RF coil.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An array of surface RF coils can be used for &#x201c;parallel imaging,&#x201d; a technique developed to accelerate MR data acquisition. In parallel imaging, multiple receive RF coils acquire (or receive) data from a region or volume of interest. For example, to perform parallel imaging for the human spine and torso, a three-dimensional (3D) RF coil array is used. A 3D RF coil array typically consists of an anterior two-dimensional (2D) RF coil array and a posterior 2D RF coil array.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cardiac imaging and thoracic (e.g., vascular, other regions/structures in the thoracic cavity than the heart) imaging typically require different field of view and other imaging parameter requirements to achieve the best imaging performance. For example, cardiac imaging typically requires a field of view of 30 cm by 30 cm to cover the heart and cardiovascular imaging typically requires a field of view of 48 cm by 48 cm. RF coil arrays have been developed for cardiac and cardiac/thoracic imaging, however, such RF coil arrays can be heavy and bulky and therefore difficult for a technician to use and uncomfortable for a patient. Lightweight cardiac-only designs have been developed but cannot typically be used for vascular imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would be desirable to provide an RF coil array for cardiac and thoracic imaging that is a modular design and that provides a high channel count and high SNR performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>

The RF coil array also includes a second coil section mechanically coupled to the first coil section and having a plurality of loop coils arranged around at least a portion of a perimeter of the first coil section.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an exemplary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system in accordance with an embodiment. The operation of MRI system <b>10</b> is controlled from an operator console <b>12</b> that includes a keyboard or other input device <b>13</b>, a control panel <b>14</b>, and a display <b>16</b>. The console <b>12</b> communicates through a link <b>18</b> with a computer system <b>20</b> and provides an interface for an operator to prescribe MRI scans, display resultant images, perform image processing on the images, and archive data and images. The computer system <b>20</b> includes a number of modules that communicate with each other through electrical and/or data connections, for example, such as are provided by using a backplane <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Data connections may be direct wired links or may be fiber optic connections or wireless communication links or the like. The modules of the computer system <b>20</b> include an image processor module <b>22</b>, a CPU module <b>24</b> and a memory module <b>26</b> which may include a frame buffer for storing image data arrays. In an alternative embodiment, the image processor module <b>22</b> may be replaced by image processing functionality on the CPU module <b>24</b>. The computer system <b>20</b> is linked to archival media devices, permanent or back-up memory storage or a network. Computer system <b>20</b> may also communicate with a separate system control computer <b>32</b> through a link <b>34</b>. The input device <b>13</b> can include a mouse, joystick, keyboard, track ball, touch activated screen, light wand, voice control, or any similar or equivalent input device, and may be used for interactive geometry prescription.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The system control computer <b>32</b> includes a set of modules in communication with each other via electrical and/or data connections <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Data connections <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be direct wired links, or may be fiber optic connections or wireless communication links or the like. In alternative embodiments, the modules of computer system <b>20</b> and system control computer <b>32</b> may be implemented on the same computer system or a plurality of computer systems. The modules of system control computer <b>32</b> include a CPU module <b>36</b> and a pulse generator module <b>38</b> that connects to the operator console <b>12</b> through a communications link <b>40</b>. The pulse generator module <b>38</b> may alternatively be integrated into the scanner equipment (e.g., resonance assembly <b>52</b>). It is through link <b>40</b> that the system control computer <b>32</b> receives commands from the operator to indicate the scan sequence that is to be performed. The pulse generator module <b>38</b> operates the system components that play out (i.e., perform) the desired pulse sequence by sending instructions, commands and/or requests describing the timing, strength and shape of the RF pulses and pulse sequences to be produced and the timing and length of the data acquisition window. The pulse generator module <b>38</b> connects to a gradient amplifier system <b>42</b> and produces data called gradient waveforms that control the timing and shape of the gradient pulses that are to be used during the scan. The pulse generator module <b>38</b> may also receive patient data from a physiological acquisition controller <b>44</b> that receives signals from a number of different sensors connected to the patient, such as ECG signals from electrodes attached to the patient. The pulse generator module <b>38</b> connects to a scan room interface circuit <b>46</b> that receives signals from various sensors associated with the condition of the patient and the magnet system. It is also through the scan room interface circuit <b>46</b> that a patient positioning system <b>48</b> receives commands to move the patient table to the desired position for the scan.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The gradient waveforms produced by the pulse generator module <b>38</b> are applied to gradient amplifier system <b>42</b> which is comprised of G<sub>x</sub>, G<sub>y </sub>and G<sub>z </sub>amplifiers. Each gradient amplifier excites a corresponding physical gradient coil in a gradient coil assembly generally designated <b>50</b> to produce the magnetic field gradient pulses used for spatially encoding acquired signals. The gradient coil assembly <b>50</b> forms part of a resonance assembly <b>52</b> that includes a polarizing superconducting magnet with superconducting main coils <b>54</b>. Resonance assembly <b>52</b> may include a whole-body RF coil <b>56</b>, surface or parallel imaging coils <b>76</b> or both. The coils <b>56</b>, <b>76</b> of the RF coil assembly may be configured for both transmitting and receiving or for transmit-only or receive-only. A patient or imaging subject <b>70</b> may be positioned within a cylindrical patient imaging volume <b>72</b> of the resonance assembly <b>52</b>. A transceiver module <b>58</b> in the system control computer <b>32</b> produces pulses that are amplified by an RF amplifier <b>60</b> and coupled to the RF coils <b>56</b>, <b>76</b> by a transmit/receive switch <b>62</b>. The resulting signals emitted by the excited nuclei in the patient may be sensed by the same RF coil <b>56</b> and coupled through the transmit/receive switch <b>62</b> to a preamplifier <b>64</b>. Alternatively, the signals emitted by the excited nuclei may be sensed by separate receive coils such as parallel coils or surface coils <b>76</b>. The amplified MR signals are demodulated, filtered and digitized in the receiver section of the transceiver <b>58</b>. The transmit/receive switch <b>62</b> is controlled by a signal from the pulse generator module <b>38</b> to electrically connect the RF amplifier <b>60</b> to the RF coil <b>56</b> during the transmit mode and to connect the preamplifier <b>64</b> to the RF coil <b>56</b> during the receive mode. The transmit/receive switch <b>62</b> can also enable a separate RF coil (for example, a parallel or surface coil <b>76</b>) to be used in either the transmit or receive mode.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The MR signals sensed by the RF coil <b>56</b> or parallel or surface coil <b>76</b> are digitized by the transceiver module <b>58</b> and transferred to a memory module <b>66</b> in the system control computer <b>32</b>. Typically, frames of data corresponding to MR signals are stored temporarily in the memory module <b>66</b> until they are subsequently transformed to create images. An array processor <b>68</b> uses a known transformation method, most commonly a Fourier transform, to create images from the MR signals. These images are communicated through the link <b>34</b> to the computer system <b>20</b> where it is stored in memory. In response to commands received from the operator console <b>12</b>, this image data may be archived in long-term storage or it may be further processed by the image processor <b>22</b> and conveyed to the operator console <b>12</b> and presented on display <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As mentioned, RF coils (for example, RF body coil <b>56</b> and a surface coil or coils <b>76</b>) may be used to transmit RF excitation pulses and/or to receive MR signals. An array of RF surface coils <b>76</b> may be used, for example, for parallel imaging applications to receive data from a region or volume of interest. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an RF coil array in accordance with an embodiment. RF coil array <b>200</b> consists of a first coil array section <b>202</b> and a second coil array section <b>204</b>. As shown, RF coil array <b>200</b> has sixteen (16) channels. The first coil array section <b>202</b> provides eight (8) channels and the second coil array section <b>204</b> provides eight (8) channels. The elements (e.g., the coils) of RF coil array <b>200</b> are arranged (e.g., overlapped) so that the elements are magnetically decoupled. In a preferred embodiment, RF coil array <b>200</b> is a modular design where the second coil array section <b>204</b> may be detached from the first coil array section <b>202</b>. In this embodiment, the second coil array section <b>204</b> is attached to the first coil array section <b>202</b> using mechanical and electrical connections as described further below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first coil array section <b>202</b> consists of four double asymmetric saddle (DAS) coil pairs <b>206</b> arranged in two rows <b>207</b>, <b>209</b> in the superior-inferior direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a first coil section of the RF coil array <b>200</b> in accordance with an embodiment. Each row <b>307</b>, <b>309</b> of the first coil array section <b>302</b> consists of two double asymmetric saddle coil pairs <b>306</b> arranged in the left-right direction. In alternative embodiments, more than two double asymmetric saddle coil pairs <b>306</b> may be used in each row <b>307</b>, <b>309</b>. The DAS coil pairs <b>306</b> are formed together on a former such as, for example, a rigid former or a foam former as known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the first coil array section <b>202</b>, <b>302</b> is configured for and dedicated to cardiac imaging. The DAS coil pairs <b>306</b> generate a high SNR and resolution at a relatively shallow depth of structures in the central thoracic region, such as the heart. The DAS coil pairs <b>306</b> allow the RF coil array to have high SNR for imaging within the cardiac region.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Each DAS coil pair <b>206</b>, <b>306</b> consists of two highly overlapped asymmetric saddle coils. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a double a double asymmetric saddle coil pair in accordance with an embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a double asymmetric saddle (DAS) coil pair <b>406</b> includes a first asymmetric saddle coil <b>410</b> and a second asymmetric saddle coil <b>412</b>. Each asymmetric saddle coil <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> has a small wing <b>414</b> and a large wing <b>416</b>. The width (D<b>1</b>) of the large wing <b>416</b> is lamer than the width (D<b>3</b>) of the small wing <b>414</b> (e.g., D<b>1</b>/D<b>3</b>&#x3e;1). Each wing <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is shown having an exemplary length, L, the shape of the two wings <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> for each asymmetric saddle coil <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> can be arbitrary. As the ratio of the size of the large wing <b>416</b> over that of the small wing <b>414</b> becomes much larger than unity, the MRI efficiency of the asymmetric saddle coil will approach to that of a loop coil of similar size and therefore the performance will be better than that of a conventional saddle coil. Accordingly, each of the asymmetric saddle coils <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> behaves very much like a loop coil and has similar efficiency for MRI as a loop coil. The direction of the magnetic flux produced in one wing of an asymmetric saddle coil is opposite to that produced in the other wing, for example, if the magnetic flux in the first wing of an asymmetric saddle coil is pointing out of the surface of the first wing, then the magnetic flux in the second wing will be pointing into the surface of the second wing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first asymmetric saddle coil <b>410</b> and the second asymmetric saddle coil <b>412</b> are overlapped to form the DAS coil pair <b>406</b>. The overlap, for example, the overlap region D<b>4</b> (<b>418</b>) of the large wing of the first asymmetric saddle coil <b>410</b> and the large wing of the second asymmetric saddle coil <b>412</b>, increases the signal sensitivity of the coil array <b>200</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example, at the middle of the coil array. In addition, the quadrature nature between the two asymmetric saddle coils <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> keeps the correlated noise low. This results in significant SNR improvement for, for example, sine imaging. The asymmetric design of the two wings <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> of each asymmetric saddle coil <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> allows an increase in the overlap area (or region) <b>418</b> between them, for example, the exemplary overlap area <b>418</b> of the large wings <b>416</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is about 45% of the large wing <b>416</b> area of each of the asymmetric saddle coils <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>. The large overlap area <b>418</b> is due to the quadrature nature between the two asymmetric saddle coils <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> and, as mentioned, increases the signal while keeping the correlated noise low to achieve significant SNR improvement. A double asymmetric saddle coil pair <b>406</b> may be used in a large RF coil array to further increase the SNR of the RF coil array.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second coil array section <b>204</b> consists of eight (8) loop coils <b>208</b> arranged around a portion of the perimeter of the first coil array section <b>202</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a second coil array section of the RF coil array in accordance with an embodiment. The loop coils <b>508</b> of the second coil array section <b>504</b> are arranged in a U-shape. Loop coils <b>508</b> are formed together on a former such as, for example, a rigid former or a foam former as known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the second coil array section <b>204</b>, <b>504</b> is configured for thoracic imaging and, in particular, the regions and structures of the thoracic cavity other than the heart. The loop coils <b>508</b> provide the depth of penetration and sensitivity needed to image deeper structures (for example, deep vasculature) and structures outside of the central thoracic region.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, RF coil array <b>200</b> may be used for an anterior coil array and/or for a posterior coil array. In an embodiment, a 32 channel phased array coil system may be provided by using an anterior coil array (configured as RF coil array <b>200</b>) and a posterior coil array (configured as RF coil array <b>200</b>) together. In such a system, 16 channels (eight channels in the anterior array and eight channels in the posterior array) may be dedicated to cardiac imaging and 16 channels (eight channels in the anterior array and eight channels in the posterior array) may be dedicated to thoracic imaging. RF coil <b>200</b> may also be used for parallel imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned above, in RF coil array <b>200</b> the first coil array section <b>202</b> can be used for cardiac imaging and the second coil array section can be used for thoracic imaging. The combination of the two sections <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> provides a large field-of-view and allows the sensitive volume to be tailored to that of the thorax without issues of noise and sensitivity to artifacts. The design of RF coil array <b>200</b> allows the generation of high resolution and high SNR images. In addition, as mentioned, in an embodiment RF coil array <b>200</b> may be configured so that the second coil array section <b>204</b> can be removed from the first coil array section <b>202</b>. Accordingly, if cardiac-only imaging is desired, the peripheral loop coils <b>208</b> can be removed leaving just the first coil array section <b>202</b> for the cardiac-only imaging. This can reduce the weight of the RF coil system and be more comfortable for a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Various known mechanical connections such as clips, latch/pin pairs, etc. may be used to attach (and detach) the first coil array section <b>202</b> and the second coil array section <b>204</b> and various known electrical connectors may be used to provide electrical interconnections between the first coil array section <b>202</b> and the second coil array section <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a top view of an anterior coil showing exemplary mechanical and electrical connections for the sections of the RF coil array of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with an embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first coil array section <b>602</b> and the second coil array section <b>604</b> are shown in a disconnected condition. A set of latch and pin pairs may be used to attach and permit mechanical locking of the first coil array section <b>602</b> and the second coil array section <b>604</b>. The second coil array section <b>604</b> includes six pins <b>618</b> and the first coil array section <b>602</b> includes six latches (only three shown) <b>620</b>. The pins <b>618</b> of the second coil array section <b>604</b> may be pushed down into the latches <b>620</b> and lock into place. A set of face contacting, spring loaded pin or bar connectors <b>622</b>, <b>624</b> may be used to provide electrical interconnections between the first coil array section <b>602</b> and the second coil array section <b>604</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show an exemplary latch and pin mechanical locking system in accordance with an embodiment. A slot <b>726</b> in the first coil array section <b>602</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is used to permit the locking pin <b>818</b> to move downward into the latch <b>720</b>, <b>820</b> and become locked into place. A cam surface on the top of the latch <b>720</b> allows the pin <b>818</b> to force the latch pair <b>720</b>, <b>820</b> apart (e.g., by cam action) as the pin <b>818</b> is pushed down to allow entry of the pin <b>818</b> into the latch pair <b>720</b>, <b>820</b>. The latch pair <b>720</b> may be spring-loaded (e.g., using composite (e.g., G<b>10</b>) springs) and grasp a round shaft <b>828</b> of the pin once the pin is set in place. The latch pair <b>720</b> may be released by pulling them apart using a release mechanism (not shown) such as, for example, an internal bell-crank mechanism and release handles. The pins <b>818</b> and latches <b>720</b>, <b>820</b> may be made from an engineering plastic such as, a polyimide, a polyether-ether-ketone, a polycarbonate, or fiber reinforced thermoset resin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show an exemplary electrical connector pair in accordance with an embodiment. One coil array section, for example, first coil array section <b>602</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) includes a first connector <b>924</b> of the electrical connector pair and the other coil array section, for example, second coil array section <b>604</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) includes a second connector <b>1022</b> of the electrical connector pair. The connectors may be, for example made of spring loaded bars or pins constructed from gold or silver-plated copper alloy (such as phosphor bronze, Elkonite CuW, UNS 17400 BECU, etc.). Preferably, the pins are designed to slide past one another to permit easy connection and disconnection and to be tolerant of considerable misalignment (angular and translational) while maintaining adequate current carrying capacity. The electrical connector <b>924</b>, <b>1002</b> is designed to pass both RF and DC signals. In certain embodiments, a balun (not shown) may also be used to facilitate the passage of RF signals.</p>
