<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-283320, filed Dec. 14, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a touch panel, and more particularly, it relates to a resistive touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a touch panel of a resistive film type comprises a press-side resistive film and a rear resistive film which are respectively provided on the opposite surfaces of a press-side substrate and a rear substrate arranged to face each other with a gap. When pressed from the side opposite to the surface in which the press-side resistive film is formed, the press-side substrate bends, resulting in that press-side resistive film and the rear resistive film come into local contact. As a result, electrical conduction is permitted between the press-side resistive film and the rear resistive film at their contact point. In the resistive touch panel, a voltage is alternately applied across both ends of the press-side resistive film and across both ends of the rear resistive film, and the position of the contact point is detected on the basis of the conduction at the contact point.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the resistive touch panel, as disclosed in, for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2006-506708, the gap between the press-side resistive film and the rear resistive film are regulated by a plurality of spacers or an insulating liquid is hermetically contained in the gap between the press-side resistive film and the rear resistive film in order to prevent contact between the press-side resistive film and the rear resistive film when there is no input, i.e., when there is no pressing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the invention, a touch panel includes a first transparent substrate; a second transparent substrate facing the first transparent substrate; protrusions formed on a protrusion formation surface, the protrusion formation surface being one of a surface of the first transparent substrate facing the second transparent substrate and a surface of the second transparent substrate facing the first transparent substrate; a first resistive film formed on the protrusion formation surface, the first resistive film covering the protrusions; a second resistive film formed on a protrusion facing surface, the protrusion facing surface being the other of the surface of the first transparent substrate facing the second transparent substrate and the surface of the second transparent substrate facing the first transparent substrate; insulating spacers which regulate a given distance between first contact regions and second contact regions to set a gap between the first contact regions and the second contact regions when the first transparent substrate is not pressed, and to allow the first contact regions and the second contact regions to be in contact with each other when the first transparent substrate is pressed, the first contact regions being parts of the first resistive film and including tops of the protrusions, the second contact regions being parts of the second resistive film and facing the first contact regions; a frame-shaped seal member which circumferentially bonds the first transparent substrate and the second transparent substrate together; and an insulating liquid contained in a space surrounded by the first transparent substrate, the second transparent substrate and the seal member, wherein at least one of the first resistive film and the second resistive film has a lattice shape such that the corresponding one of the protrusion formation surface and the protrusion facing surface, on which said lattice-shaped resistive film is formed, includes a void region in which said lattice-shaped resistive film is not formed, the protrusions and the insulating spacers are located only at intersections of the lattice of said lattice-shaped resistive film, and the void region is neither the first contact region nor the second contact region, and is surrounded by said lattice-shaped resistive film.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out hereinafter.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the drawings. As shown in a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a touch-panel-equipped display device including a touch panel according to the embodiment comprises a display panel <b>1</b> for image display, and a resistive touch panel <b>10</b> disposed on the observation side of the display panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The display panel <b>1</b> is, for example, a liquid crystal display panel. The display panel <b>1</b> includes an observation side transparent substrate <b>2</b> and a rear substrate <b>3</b> which are arranged to face each other with a predetermined gap and which are joined together via a frame-shaped seal member <b>4</b> on their peripheral edges. An unshown transparent common electrode is formed on the surface of the observation side transparent substrate <b>2</b> facing the rear substrate <b>3</b>. Transparent electrodes for forming a plurality of unshown pixels are provided on the surface of the rear substrate <b>3</b> facing the observation side transparent substrate <b>2</b>. Unshown liquid crystal is hermetically contained in a region which is a gap between the observation side transparent substrate <b>2</b> and the rear substrate <b>3</b> and which is surrounded by the seal member <b>4</b>. The display panel <b>1</b> also includes an observation side polarizing plate <b>5</b> and a rear polarizing plate <b>6</b> arranged on the outer surfaces of the observation side transparent substrate <b>2</b> and the rear substrate <b>3</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">This liquid crystal display panel may be a twisted nematic type, super-twisted nematic type, nontwisted homogeneous type, homeotropic alignment type, bend alignment type, ferroelectric or antiferroelectric liquid crystal display panel. Moreover, the display panel is not exclusively provided with the electrodes for forming a plurality of pixels on each of the opposite surfaces of a pair of substrates. The display panel may be an in-plane electric field control display panel. This type of display panel is provided with a first electrode for forming a plurality of pixels on the surface of one of a pair of substrates, and a plurality of second electrodes formed to be insulated from the first electrode. An in-plane electric field (electric field directed along the surface of the substrate) is produced across the electrodes to change the alignment of liquid crystal molecules. In addition, the display panel <b>1</b> is not exclusively the liquid crystal display panel, and may be, for example, an organic electroluminescent (EL) display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The touch panel <b>10</b> includes a detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> as a first transparent substrate, and a rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> as a second transparent substrate. The observation side polarizing plate <b>5</b> of the display panel <b>1</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> of the touch panel <b>10</b> are bonded together by a bonding layer <b>7</b> made of a transparent adhesive material or resin.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The configuration of the touch panel <b>10</b> is further described. The detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> is, for example, a glass plate or resin film formed into a rectangular shape. The rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> is, for example, a glass plate formed into a rectangular shape having the same size as the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in a sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a rear resistive film <b>14</b> as a second resistive film is formed on the surface of the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> of the touch panel <b>10</b> facing the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>. A plurality of protrusions <b>15</b> are formed on the surface of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> facing the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>. The protrusions <b>15</b> are made of a transparent insulator, and arranged with a pitch P<b>1</b> in perpendicular two directions within a plane. All of the protrusions <b>15</b> are equal in height (vertical length in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A detection side resistive film <b>13</b> as a first resistive film is formed on the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> to cover the protrusions <b>15</b>. The detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> are formed over a wider range than a touch area for touch input. Although not shown, SiO<sub>2 </sub>films are formed on the entire surfaces of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>, the surfaces facing each other. On the SiO<sub>2 </sub>films, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> are formed. The detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> are made of, for example, indium tin oxide (ITO).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, with a pitch P<b>2</b>, the protrusions <b>15</b> on the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> are not formed. Instead, transparent insulating spacers <b>17</b> are formed at these positions on the detection side resistive film <b>13</b>. All of the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are equal in height (vertical length in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Here, the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are greater in height than the protrusions <b>15</b>. Therefore, when the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> are superposed on each other so that the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> face each other, the tops of the insulating spacers <b>17</b> come into contact with the rear resistive film <b>14</b>, and the two substrates are set parallel to each other. A gap &#x394;d corresponding to the difference of height between the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> is formed between the rear resistive film <b>14</b> and the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> formed on the tops of the protrusions <b>15</b>. The gap &#x394;d is, for example, about 1 &#x3bc;m. As will be described later in detail, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> are bonded together by a seal member applied to the circumferences of the two substrates in a frame shape. A space formed by being surrounded by the detection side resistive film <b>13</b>, the rear resistive film <b>14</b> and the seal member is filled with an insulating liquid <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are formed by applying a transparent light-curing resin with a predetermined thickness and exposing and developing the resin film. Thus, in order to develop the exposed resin film, the side of the resin film that is closer to the film surface is exposed to a developing solution for a longer time. Accordingly, both of the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are formed into a shape that decreases in diameter from the base portions toward the protruding ends.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are shown to be emphasized in height in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the inclination angle (the angle to the surface of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>) of the circumferential surfaces of the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> is, for example, 40 to 50&#xb0;. Thus, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> can be formed to cover the protrusions <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The tops of the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are circular, and the surfaces of the tops are parallel to the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>. The diameter of the base portion of the protrusion <b>15</b> is, for example, 15 or 30 &#x3bc;m. The height of the protrusion <b>15</b> is, for example, 2.0 &#x3bc;m. The diameter of the base portion of the insulating spacer <b>17</b> is, for example, 30 &#x3bc;m. The height of the insulating spacer <b>17</b> is, for example, 2.5, 3.0 or 4.0 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An example of the arrangement of the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> in the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> of the touch panel <b>10</b> having the configuration described above is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the protrusions <b>15</b> are shown in white circles and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are shown in black circles so that the protrusions <b>15</b> can be easily differentiated from the insulating spacers <b>17</b>. As shown in this figure, the protrusions <b>15</b> are arranged with the predetermined pitch P<b>1</b> in the horizontal and vertical directions in a touch area <b>29</b> for touch input, and the protrusions <b>15</b> are replaced with the insulating spacers <b>17</b> with the predetermined pitch P<b>2</b>. Pitch P<b>1</b> of the protrusions <b>15</b> is, for example, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 mm. Pitch P<b>2</b> of the insulating spacers <b>17</b> is, for example, 2 or 4 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for the sake of simplicity, there are five protrusions <b>15</b> between the insulating spacers <b>17</b> in the horizontal and vertical directions. However, when P<b>1</b>=0.05 mm and P<b>2</b>=2 mm, one insulating spacer <b>17</b> is disposed for 39 protrusions <b>15</b>. When P<b>1</b>=0.2 mm and P<b>2</b>=4 mm, one insulating spacer <b>17</b> is disposed for 19 protrusions <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the touch panel <b>10</b> is pressed from the side of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> bends, and the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> on the top of the protrusion <b>15</b> comes into contact with the rear resistive film <b>14</b> on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>. As a result, electrical conduction is permitted between the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> at their contact portions. The touch panel <b>10</b> detects the pressed position on the basis of the electrical conduction as will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the horizontal direction of the touch area <b>29</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is defined as an X-direction, and the vertical direction is a Y-direction. A stripe-shaped upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a </i>and lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b </i>are formed on the edges at both ends in the Y-direction of the rear resistive film <b>14</b> formed in the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>. The length of the upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b </i>in the X-direction is coincident with the width of the rear resistive film <b>14</b> in the X-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A stripe-shaped left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>are formed on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> at positions corresponding to edges at both ends in the X-direction of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> formed in the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>. The length of the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>in the Y-direction is coincident with the width of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> in the Y-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>are connected to an upper-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>21</b><i>a</i>, a lower-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a left-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a right-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>20</b><i>b</i>, respectively, via an upper-end electrode interconnect <b>23</b><i>a</i>, a lower-end electrode interconnect <b>23</b><i>b</i>, a left-end electrode interconnect <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a right-end electrode interconnect <b>22</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The upper-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>21</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>21</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>20</b><i>b </i>are provided in a overhang <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> that stretches outward when the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> are bonded together. These terminals serve to connect to a later-described touch panel drive circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>described above has a continuous stripe. Alternatively, each of these electrodes may be discontinuous. In this case, the upper-end electrode interconnect <b>23</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode interconnect <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode interconnect <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode interconnect <b>22</b><i>b </i>are respectively connected to the upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>that are discontinuous.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a</i>, the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b</i>, the upper-end electrode interconnect <b>23</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode interconnect <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode interconnect <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the right-end electrode interconnect <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the upper-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>21</b><i>a</i>, the lower-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>21</b><i>b</i>, the left-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>20</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode drive circuit connecting terminal <b>20</b><i>b </i>are formed on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> or the rear resistive film <b>14</b> by stacking and patterning, for example, a first layer made of molybdenum, a second layer made of an aluminum alloy and a third layer made of molybdenum.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A portion on the edge of the touch panel <b>10</b> in which the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> are bonded together is described. The detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> are bonded together by a seal member <b>24</b>. This bonding portion is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a planar view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a sectional view of portion VB-VB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. The seal member <b>24</b> includes spherical conducting particles <b>25</b> having a diameter corresponding to the height of the insulating spacer <b>17</b>. The seal member <b>24</b> including the conducting particles <b>25</b> is located to edge the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>. A liquid injection opening <b>26</b> is made in a part of the side that faces the overhang <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The gap between the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> when bonded together is regulated by the height of the insulating spacers <b>17</b> and the diameter of the conducting particles <b>25</b>. As a result, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> are bonded together in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sides at both ends of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> on the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> in the X-direction are located to overlap the seal member <b>24</b>. The sides at both ends of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> in the Y-direction are located inside a seal portion where the seal member <b>24</b> is present (on the side of the touch area <b>29</b>). The left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>that respectively face the sides at both ends of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> in the X-direction are Provided in the seal portion. As a result of such location, the sides at both ends of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> in the X-direction are electrically connected to the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>via the conducting particles <b>25</b> in the seal member <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the conducting particles <b>25</b> described above are spherical particles, the conducting particles <b>25</b> may be replaced with columnar conducting members having a height corresponding to the height of the insulating spacer <b>17</b>. In this case, the columnar conducting members are formed in the sides at both ends of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> in the X-direction or in the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b </i>so that the sides at both ends of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> in the X-direction may be electrically connected to the left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sides at both ends of the rear resistive film <b>14</b> on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> in the X-direction are located inside the seal portion (on the side of the touch area <b>29</b>). The upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b </i>formed on the sides at both ends in the Y-direction are formed in the vicinity of the seal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The gap between the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> and surrounded by the seal member <b>24</b> is filled with the insulating liquid <b>28</b>. To fill the gap with the insulating liquid, first, the liquid injection opening <b>26</b> is immersed in the bath of the insulating liquid <b>28</b> in a vacuum chamber. Next, the inside of the chamber is returned to atmospheric pressure. As a result, a produced pressure difference between inside and outside of the gap is used to fill the gap with the insulating liquid <b>28</b>. The liquid injection opening <b>26</b> is sealed with a sealing resin <b>27</b> after the gap is filled with the insulating liquid <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The insulating liquid <b>28</b> is a transparent liquid have a light refractive index which is almost same as that of transparent substrate <b>11</b>, the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b>. The difference of refractive index is desirably, for example, 0.1 or less. For example, when the refractive index of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>, the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> is about 1.5, the refractive index of the insulating liquid <b>28</b> ranges, for example, between 1.4 and 1.5.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Specifically, liquid crystal optically isotropic at room temperature, such as liquid crystal showing an isotropic phase at a temperature of 5&#xb0; C. or more (nematic liquid crystal having an N-I point below 5&#xb0; C.) is used as the insulating liquid <b>28</b>. More specifically, an example of liquid crystal having such characteristics is a liquid crystal material which has two to three cyclohexane or benzene rings, and an alkyl group at both ends thereof and which does not have dielectric constant anisotropy.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As the insulating liquid <b>28</b>, an organic or inorganic insulating liquid substance having a boiling point of 100&#xb0; C. or more can also be used. Specifically, it is possible to use an organic liquid substance such as butanol, toluene, xylene, isobutyl alcohol, isopentyl alcohol, isobutyl acetate, butyl acetate, tetrachlorethylene, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, ethylene glycol monoether, ethylene glycol monoether acetate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or turpentine oil. Alternatively, it is possible to use an inorganic liquid substance such as silicone oil.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The shape of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is further described in detail here. As has been briefly described above, when the touch panel <b>10</b> is pressed from the side of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> bends, and the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> on the top of the protrusion <b>15</b> comes into contact with the rear resistive film <b>14</b> on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> at the pressed portion. On the basis of the resulting electrical conduction, the pressed position is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Here, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> the shape of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the relation between the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> regarding the positions on a plane when the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> are formed all over the surface. A sectional view of the portion of the touch panel indicated by VIB-VIB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In the case of the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, if there is a conducting foreign object <b>50</b> between the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> cause an electrical short circuit in this part, leading to an erroneous detection of pressing at this short-circuited position. Moreover, because of a later-described position detection principle, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> need to have a relatively high resistance to improve the resolving power. Therefore, when, for example, ITO films are used as these resistive films, the thickness of these films may have to be 100 &#x212b; or less. When the thickness is significantly small as described above, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> or the rear resistive film <b>14</b> may be damaged during a manufacturing process or during the use of the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Thus, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is lattice-shaped so that the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is present on the protrusions <b>15</b> and under the insulating spacers <b>17</b> and has void regions in parts of other areas where the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is absent. In other words, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> has square void regions. The rear resistive film <b>14</b> on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> is formed all over the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In such a configuration as well, since the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is formed on the protrusions <b>15</b>, when the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> is pressed from the outer side and bends, conduction is permitted between the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b>, and the pressed position can be detected. On the other hand, even if the conducting foreign object <b>50</b> is present between the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is no electrical conduction, resulting in that the probability of erroneous detection is lower. For example, when the area where the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is formed accounts for 50 percent of the total, the probability of erroneous detection is reduced by half.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, since the area where the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is absent is provided in part of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>, electrical resistance is increased accordingly. Thus, the thickness of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> that need to be highly resistive to improve the resolving power for position detection as described above can be greater than when the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is formed all over the surface. For example, when the area where the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is formed accounts for <b>50</b> percent of the total, the thickness of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> can be two times. Therefore, the probability of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> or the rear resistive film <b>14</b> being damaged during a manufacturing process or during the use of the touch panel can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is lattice-shaped, so that the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> are located at the intersections of the lattice, and the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> has the square void regions therein. However, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is not limited to such a configuration. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the void regions can be polygonal. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the void regions can be shaped to have a curve (e.g., circle). Moreover, instead of being arrayed in the vertical and horizontal directions, the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> may be arranged to alternate in the vertical direction to provide triangular void regions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The triangle of the void region may be an equilateral triangle. Moreover, the protrusions <b>15</b> and the insulating spacers <b>17</b> may be located at any positions other than intersections of the lattice of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> by way of example as long as the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> is formed at such positions. In each case, the advantage is that the probability of erroneous detection is reduced and the probability of the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> or the rear resistive film <b>14</b> being damaged is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>, for example, functions as the first transparent substrate which is pressed and thereby bends. The rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>, for example, functions as the second transparent substrate facing the first transparent substrate. The protrusion <b>15</b>, for example, functions as a protrusion formed in a protrusion formation surface. The detection side resistive film <b>13</b>, for example, functions as the first resistive film formed in the protrusion formation surface. The rear resistive film <b>14</b>, for example, functions as the second resistive film in a protrusion facing surface. The insulating spacers <b>17</b>, for example, functions as insulating spacers which set a given distance between first contact regions and second contact regions to set a gap between the first contact regions and the second contact regions when the first transparent substrate is not pressed, and to allow the first contact regions and the second contact regions to be in contact with each other when the first transparent substrate is pressed. The seal member <b>24</b>, for example, functions as a frame-shaped seal member for circumferentially bonding the first transparent substrate and the second transparent substrate together. The insulating liquid <b>28</b>, for example, functions as an insulating liquid hermetically contained in the space surrounded by the first transparent substrate, the second transparent substrate and the seal member.

The left-end electrode <b>18</b><i>a </i>and the right-end electrode <b>18</b><i>b</i>, for example, function as a plurality of first connection electrodes that face both sides at both ends of the first resistive film in the first axial direction, respectively. The upper-end electrode <b>19</b><i>a </i>and the lower-end electrode <b>19</b><i>b</i>, for example, function as a plurality of second connection electrodes that are formed on both sides at both ends of the second resistive film in the second axial direction, respectively. The conducting particles <b>25</b>, for example, functions as the conducting members or conducting particles for electrically connecting the first connection electrodes to the first resistive film.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Now, the operation of the touch panel <b>10</b> according to this embodiment is described. When the touch panel <b>10</b> is pressed by, for example, a fingertip <b>30</b> from the side of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> bends toward the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Accordingly, the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> on the top of the protrusion <b>15</b> located in the bent part comes into contact with the rear resistive film <b>14</b> on the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>. As a result, electrical conduction is permitted in the part where the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> are in contact. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the scales of the protrusion <b>15</b> and the like are emphasized and greater than actual scales for the sake of simplicity, and the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> on one protrusion <b>15</b> comes into contact with the rear resistive film <b>14</b> when the touch panel is pressed by the fingertip from the side of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the touch panel <b>10</b>, the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> is pressed from the outer side and thereby bends so that local conduction is permitted between the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> inside the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b> in a part corresponding to the pressed point via the top of the protrusion <b>15</b>. Therefore, the bending amount of the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> necessary for the local conduction between the detection side resistive film <b>13</b> and the rear resistive film <b>14</b> can be sufficiently smaller than the gap between the detection side transparent substrate <b>11</b> and the rear transparent substrate <b>12</b>.
