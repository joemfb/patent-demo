<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the production of light olefins from paraffins. Specifically, the invention is directed at propane dehydrogenation in the production of propylene.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Continuous catalyst conversion processes in the petrochemical industry. The fluidized catalyst cracking of hydrocarbons is an important process for the production of lighter hydrocarbon components, and it is an important process for the production of ethylene and propylene. The fluidized catalytic cracking process continuously circulates a fluidized catalyst between a reactor and a regenerator.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another route for the production of propylene can be obtained by the dehydrogenation of propane through catalytic dehydrogenation. The dehydrogenation catalysts generally comprise noble metal catalysts on acidic supports, such as alumina, or silica alumina, or zeolitic materials. However, the reaction is strongly endothermic, and requires a high temperature for the reaction to proceed at a satisfactory rate. At the same time, the reactions need to be controlled to limit the degradation of the propane to form methane and ethylene, and where the ethylene can be hydrogenated by the hydrogen released through the dehydrogenation of the propane. The process also leads to coking of the catalyst, and deactivates the catalyst. The catalyst therefore needs to be regenerated on a regular basis after relatively short periods of operation, or residence, in the dehydrogenation reactor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is a process for the dehydrogenation of paraffins. In particular, the process is for the dehydrogenation of propane for the production of propylene. The process comprises passing a preheated propane feedstream to a dehydrogenation reactor. The reactor is operated at conditions to mix and contact the propane with a fluidized catalyst to generate a product stream comprising propylene. The operation of the reactor is designed to continuously supply catalyst and remove catalyst from the dehydrogenation reactor at a rate to provide a residence time of the catalyst in the reactor between 15 and 45 minutes. The reactor is a fast fluidizing reactor to provide well mixed reactants and feedstream and to provide a uniform temperature over the reactor. The effluent stream from the reactor is separated into a spent catalyst stream and a product stream comprising propylene. The spent catalyst is passed to a catalyst regeneration unit, thereby generating a regenerated catalyst stream. The catalyst is processed in the regeneration unit under conditions to limit the average residence time in the regeneration unit to 30 minutes or less. The regenerated catalyst is passed to the dehydrogenation reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The high cycling rate of catalyst through the reactor and regenerator allow for increasing the overall flow through of reactants, and increases the productivity of a dehydrogenation reactor.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is important for producing olefins. The olefins are important for a variety of products, such as polymer plastics, or the use of olefins in the formation of alkylaryl compounds. A process for the dehydrogenation of propane is presented. The process comprises passing a preheated propane feedstream to a dehydrogenation reactor. The feedstream is contacted with a fluidized catalyst in the dehydrogenation reactor, thereby generating a product stream comprising propylene. The reactor is a fast fluidizing reactor, where the reactor is operated in a flow regime to turbulently mix the catalyst and feedstream. The catalyst and product stream are carried up through the reactor and separated in a separation section, whereby a product stream comprising propylene is passed out of the reactor. A spent catalyst is passed to a catalyst regeneration unit, to regenerate the catalyst for return to the dehydrogenation reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The process of the fast fluidizing reactor is operated at conditions to back-mix the catalyst and reactants. The mixing moderates the temperature to maintain a more uniform temperature during reaction, while limiting local temperature drops that adversely affect the reaction rate. The reaction conditions include operation of the reactor at a temperature between 600&#xb0; C. and 700&#xb0; C. The mixing is to provide a more uniform temperature, and it is preferred to sufficiently mix the catalyst and feed to operate at a temperature between 630&#xb0; C. and 650&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The reaction conditions include a pressure at the reactor outlet in the rage from 108 kPa to 170 kPa (1 to 10 psig). The preferred operation controls the pressure at the reactor outlet in the range from 122 kPa to 136 kPa (3 to 5 psig). The reaction operates under an atmosphere comprising hydrogen, in addition to the hydrogen generated. The operation of the reactor includes a hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio at the reactor inlet in the range between 0.2 and 1, with a preferred hydrogen to hydrocarbon mole ratio at approximately 0.6. The feedstream of the hydrogen and hydrocarbon is preheated to provide some of the heat needed for the endothermic reaction. Hydrogen is generated in the dehydrogenation process, and is recovered and recycled to the feedstream. The hydrogen is recycled to maintain a hydrogen level in all regions of the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The process utilizes relatively short residence times for the catalyst, and also includes rapid regeneration of the catalyst. The process allows for an average catalyst residence time in the reactor of between 15 and 45 minutes, with a preferred average residence time between 15 and 30 minutes. The short cycle time allows for maintaining a more uniform temperature across the reactor to achieve better conversion and selectivity. New catalysts that are useful in this process include non-metal catalysts. The term non-metal catalysts refers to catalysts that do not have metal in its base state, but is meant to refer to catalysts comprising metal oxides, such as zirconia and chromia.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To this extent, the flow of the catalyst during regeneration is limited to an average residence time of less than 30 minutes. The regeneration unit is preferably a riser reactor, which allows for mixing of the catalyst during the regeneration. The regeneration is typically operated under conditions to burn off a portion of the carbon accumulated on the catalyst. Additional fuel is passed to the regeneration unit for combustion and heating of the catalyst. The combustion burns off carbon accumulated on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The process is shown in the FIGURE. A hydrocarbon feedstream <b>10</b> is passed with a hydrogen stream <b>12</b> to a combined feed heat exchanger <b>20</b>, generating a preheated mixed feedstream <b>22</b>. The mixed feedstream <b>22</b> is further heated in a heater <b>30</b> to being the heated feedstream <b>32</b> to the reactor <b>40</b> inlet temperature. The feedstream <b>32</b> passed through the reactor <b>40</b> and generates a product stream <b>42</b> comprising dehydrogenated hydrocarbons. The product stream <b>42</b> is used to preheat the hydrogen <b>12</b> and hydrocarbon feedstream <b>10</b>, and produces a partially cooled product stream <b>24</b>. In the present invention, the preferred feedstock is propane, which is dehydrogenated to form a propylene product stream <b>42</b>. The catalyst in the reactor flows upward through the reactor <b>40</b> and the reactor <b>40</b> is operated to provide an average catalyst residence time between 15 and 45 minutes. The catalyst is passed out of the reactor <b>44</b> to a regenerator <b>50</b>. Fuel <b>46</b> is added to the regenerator <b>50</b> to provide the energy to combust carbon on the catalyst and to heat the catalyst. Air <b>48</b> is compressed and heated before being mixed with the fuel <b>46</b>, and is then passed to the regenerator <b>50</b>. Additional air and/or fuel <b>56</b> can be added to increase the temperature in the regenerator. The regenerator <b>50</b> is operated to reheat the catalyst, and to pass the catalyst through the regenerator <b>50</b> with an averaged residence time of less than 30 minutes. Hot regenerated catalyst <b>52</b> is passed to the dehydrogenation reactor <b>40</b></p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The catalyst is circulated at a rapid rate between the reactor <b>40</b> and the regenerator <b>50</b>. The rapid rate of cycling of the catalyst provides heated catalyst on a continuous basis to maintain the endothermic reaction. The rapid cycling generates a low coke amount on the catalyst, and the coke is readily and rapidly removed during the regeneration stage. In addition, excess heat leaving the regenerator in the flue gas <b>54</b> can be recovered in steam generation <b>60</b>. Water <b>62</b> is passed to the steam generator to produce steam <b>64</b>, and a cooled flue gas <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is estimated that the flowscheme will allow for scale up of propylene production to higher flowrates. Current propylene production in a reactor system is limited to around 500 KMTA. The new flowscheme is estimated to increase the production to a flow rate of about 1000 KMTA. For such a system, it is estimated that the catalyst is circulated at a rate in the range of 10 to 12 million kg/hr.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">While the invention has been described with what are presently considered the preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but it is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
