<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many electronic devices, such tablet computers, mobile phones, and various other devices, include a housing and a display panel. The display panel is often fixed to the housing via a plurality of screws. However, disassembling or assembling of the electronic device is troublesome. In addition, the overall aesthetic appearance of the electronic device will not be very good because of the visible screws. The display panel is also often adhered to the housing via adhesive, which may damage the display panel due to the amount of force needed to disassemble the display panel from the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, an embodiment of an electronic device <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>10</b>, a display panel <b>20</b>, a connecting sheet <b>30</b>, and a fixing module <b>40</b>. The display panel <b>20</b> is adhered on the connecting sheet <b>30</b> via adhesive. The connecting sheet <b>30</b> is sandwiched between the housing <b>10</b> and the display panel <b>20</b>. The fixing module <b>40</b> detachably fixes the connecting sheet <b>30</b> to the housing <b>10</b>, and the connecting sheet <b>30</b> and the display panel <b>20</b> thereby can be detached from the housing <b>10</b> as a whole. The electronic device <b>100</b> includes other various functional modules (not shown). Other various functional modules are used to implement a variety of appropriate functions such as telephony, audio playback, or others. However, for simplicity, only the components related to the fixing module <b>40</b> are described.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The housing <b>10</b> is substantially rectangular, and includes a bottom housing <b>11</b> and a support frame <b>12</b>. The support frame <b>12</b> is fixed in the bottom housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The bottom housing <b>11</b> includes a base <b>111</b> and a sidewall <b>112</b> extending from a periphery of the base <b>111</b>. The base <b>111</b> and the sidewall <b>112</b> cooperatively define a receiving space <b>113</b> to receive the support frame <b>12</b> and the other various functional modules.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The support frame <b>12</b> is securely received in the receiving space <b>113</b> to support the connecting sheet <b>30</b> and the display panel <b>20</b>. The support frame <b>12</b> is substantially a rectangular frame, and includes four support walls <b>121</b>. A stepped surface <b>122</b> is formed along an inner part of the top surfaces of the four support walls <b>121</b>, such that the stepped surface <b>122</b> and the support walls <b>121</b> cooperatively define a space to receive and support the connecting sheet <b>30</b> and the display panel <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the support frame <b>12</b> is fixed in the bottom housing <b>11</b> via adhesive. It should be noted that the support frame <b>12</b> can also be fixed in the bottom housing <b>11</b> via welding, or be integrally formed with the bottom housing <b>11</b>. It should be appreciated that the outer sides of the support walls <b>121</b> contact tightly with the inner sides of the sidewall <b>112</b>, and the structural strength and shock resistance of the housing <b>10</b> thereby is increased. The top surfaces of the support walls <b>121</b> are coplanar with the top surface of the sidewall <b>112</b>, which adds to the overall aesthetic appearance of the electronic device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The connecting sheet <b>30</b> is substantially sheet-like and made of metal. A through hole <b>32</b> is defined in the center of the connecting sheet <b>30</b>. The connecting sheet <b>30</b> is about the same size as the stepped surface <b>122</b>. The connecting sheet <b>30</b> includes four rim portions <b>31</b> connected to each other. Each rim portion <b>31</b> includes a bottom surface <b>311</b> away from the display panel <b>20</b> and a top surface <b>312</b> opposite to the bottom surface <b>311</b>. The four rim portions <b>31</b> are positioned securely on the stepped surface <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The display panel <b>20</b> can be a touch panel. The display panel <b>20</b> is securely fixed on the top surface <b>312</b> via adhesive or glue. A top surface of the display panel <b>20</b> is approximately coplanar with the top surface of the support wall <b>121</b>, which maintains the overall aesthetical appearance of the electronic device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>, the fixing module <b>40</b> includes a first latching member <b>41</b> and a second latching member <b>42</b>. The first latching member <b>41</b> is formed on the housing <b>10</b>. The second latching member <b>42</b> is formed on the connecting sheet <b>30</b>. The first latching member <b>41</b> is engaged with the second latching member <b>42</b> to detachably fix the connecting sheet <b>30</b> to the housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the illustrated embodiment, the first latching member <b>41</b> is formed on one support wall <b>121</b>. The first latching member <b>41</b> includes a latching slot <b>411</b> defined in the step surface <b>122</b> and two first latching portions <b>412</b> extending from the step surface <b>122</b> toward the base <b>111</b> and around the latching slot <b>411</b>. The two first latching portions <b>412</b> are aligned opposite each other. Each first latching portion <b>412</b> employs a cantilever structure. Each first latching portion <b>412</b> includes a base body <b>4121</b>, and a latching arm <b>4122</b> extending from one end of the base body <b>4121</b> and toward the base <b>111</b>. The latching arm <b>4122</b> is elastic.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second latching member <b>42</b> is made of metal, and is substantially a projection formed by punching. The second latching member <b>42</b> is engaged in the latching slot <b>411</b>. The second latching member <b>42</b> includes two connecting ends <b>421</b>, two second latching portions <b>422</b>, and a guide portion <b>423</b>. Each connecting end <b>421</b> is connected to the bottom surface <b>311</b> of one rim portion <b>31</b> via welding or adhesive. The two second latching portions <b>422</b> extend from one end of the two connecting ends <b>421</b>, respectively. The guide portion <b>423</b> is substantially V-Shaped to guide in the latching and detaching of the first latching member <b>41</b>. Two ends of the guide portion <b>423</b> are respectively connected to the free ends of the two second latching portions <b>422</b>. The second latching member <b>42</b> is substantially rounded to benefit the latching process. If the second latching member <b>42</b> is engaged in the latching slot <b>411</b>, an elastic force is generated to bias the second latching member <b>42</b> to the first latching member <b>41</b>, and thereby the connecting sheet <b>30</b> is fixed to the support frame <b>12</b>. Each first latching portion <b>412</b> is rounded to guide in the latching and detaching of the first latching member <b>41</b>, and prevent the fixing module <b>40</b> from detachment failure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the illustrated embodiment, the first latching member <b>41</b> defines a narrow opening between the latching arms <b>4122</b>. The second latching member <b>42</b> is bulbous and flexible, and latches in the narrow opening between the latching arms <b>4122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the illustrated embodiment, one fixing module <b>40</b> is presented, but more fixing modules <b>40</b> can be used as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The fixing module <b>40</b> detachably fixes the connecting sheet <b>30</b> to the housing <b>10</b>. In addition, the connecting sheet <b>30</b> is adhered to the display panel <b>20</b>, and thereby the display panel <b>20</b> and the connecting sheet <b>30</b> can be easily detached from the housing <b>10</b> as a whole. Because the connecting sheet <b>30</b> is very thin, the electronic device <b>100</b> is not noticeably affected. In disassembly, a suction cup may be used to detach the display panel <b>20</b>, which thereby deforms and unlocks the fixing module <b>40</b>, such that the display panel <b>20</b> and the connecting sheet <b>30</b> can be detached from the housing <b>10</b> as a whole without damaging the display panel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is believed that the present embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure or sacrificing all of its material advantages.</p>
