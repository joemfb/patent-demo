<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Asymmetric switching is defined for magnetic bit cell elements. A magnetic bit cell for memory and other devices includes a transistor coupled to an MTJ structure. A bit line is coupled at one terminal of the bit cell to the MTJ structure. At another terminal of the bit cell, a source line is coupled to the source/drain terminal of the transistor. The bit line is driven by a bit line driver that provides a first voltage. The source line is driven by a source line driver that provides a second voltage. The second voltage is larger than the first voltage. The switching characteristics of the bit cell and MTJ structure are improved and made more reliable by one or a combination of applying the higher second voltage to the source line and/or reducing the overall parasitic resistance in the magnetic bit cell element.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present teachings relate, in general, to magnetic memory and, in particular, to an asymmetric write scheme in magnetic bit cell elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The progress and development of magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology has increased the viability of selecting MRAM for various embedded &#x26; standalone nonvolatile memory applications. Instead of storing data as an electric charge, MRAM stores data as magnetic moment. MRAM sensing exploits the magnetoresistive effect that occurs in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) <b>10</b>. The MTJ <b>10</b> includes a magnetic layer <b>101</b>, an insulator layer <b>103</b>, and a magnetic layer <b>102</b>, an upper contact <b>104</b> and a lower contact <b>105</b> coupled to a substrate <b>100</b>. The magnetic layers <b>101</b>-<b>102</b> may be constructed from a variety of transitional-metal ferromagnets and other magnetic materials, including cobalt-iron, or the like, or also from combinational layers of various synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) layers. The insulator layer <b>103</b> may also be constructed from a variety of insulating materials, such as magnesium oxide or the like. The current or voltage level applied to the MTJ <b>10</b> will control the relative magnetic orientations of the magnetic layers <b>101</b>-<b>102</b>. In one instance, applying a particular current or voltage level will cause the magnetic orientation in the magnetic layer <b>101</b> to be anti-parallel to the magnetic orientation of the magnetic layer <b>102</b>. Similarly, another current or voltage level will cause the magnetic orientations of the magnetic layers <b>101</b>-<b>102</b> to be the same or parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When the magnetic orientations of the magnetic layers <b>101</b>-<b>102</b> are parallel, electrons will be more likely to tunnel through the insulator layer <b>103</b> than when the magnetic orientations are anti-parallel. This magnetoresistive effect causes the resistance of the MTJ <b>10</b> to be high when the magnetic orientations of the magnetic layers <b>101</b>-<b>102</b> are anti-parallel and low when the magnetic orientations are parallel. By measuring this resistance, the value of the data stored by the MTJ <b>10</b> can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the configuration of many MTJ memories, such as the MTJ <b>10</b>, one of the magnetic layers usually has a fixed magnetic orientation while the other layer is a free floating layer which is capable of having its magnetic orientation change according to the application of the particular current or voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a programmable spin-logic device <b>11</b> based on a single MTJ element <b>106</b>. A spin-logic device, such as programmable spin-logic device <b>11</b>, is a configuration of one or more magnetoresistive devices into various logic elements, such as logic gates. The logic functionality is often obtained by manipulating the switching thresholds of the magnetoresistive devices and places such devices in a particular configuration. The illustrated programmable spin-logic device <b>11</b> is merely one example of such a spin-logic device that may be configured as various logic gates, such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the core of the programmable spin-logic device <b>11</b> is the MTJ element <b>106</b>. The MTJ element <b>106</b> is made up of magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> with an insulation layer <b>109</b> placed between the two magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b>. The operation of the MTJ element <b>106</b> as a programmable element is similar to the operation described with respect to the MTJ <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The relative magnetic orientations of the magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> determine the data stored in the MTJ element <b>106</b>. Writing the data to the MTJ element <b>106</b> involves application of sufficient current or voltage to switch the magnetic orientation of the free magnetic layer. In order to create a programmable logic element, three input contacts <b>110</b>-<b>112</b> are provided coupled to the magnetic layer <b>107</b> with an output contact <b>113</b> coupled to the magnetic layer <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In practice, the input contacts <b>110</b>-<b>112</b> are operated with positive or negative currents, &#xb1;I<sub>A</sub>, &#xb1;I<sub>B</sub>, and &#xb1;I<sub>C</sub>, of equal magnitude. The magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> have a magnetism, &#xb1;M<sub>1 </sub>and &#xb1;M<sub>2</sub>, respectively, where the &#xb1; reflects the magnetic orientation of either of the magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b>. The magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b> also have different coercive fields, H<sub>C1 </sub>and H<sub>C2</sub>, respectively, where H<sub>C2 </sub>is greater than H<sub>C1</sub>. Individually, application of any of the currents I<sub>A</sub>, I<sub>B</sub>, and I<sub>C </sub>is insufficient to generate enough of a magnetic field to reverse either M<sub>1 </sub>or M<sub>2 </sub>However, when I<sub>A </sub>and I<sub>B </sub>are applied together, enough of a magnetic field is generated to reverse M<sub>1 </sub>of the magnetic layer <b>107</b>, while the coercive field, H<sub>C2</sub>, is still large enough to resist reversal. When all three currents are applied together, the combined magnetic field is sufficient to reverse both M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, by manipulating the initial set-up relationship between the magnetic layers <b>107</b> and <b>108</b>, AND and OR gates may be configured using the MTJ element <b>106</b> and only the input contacts <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, and, if the third input contact <b>112</b>, is used, NAND and NOR gates may be configured.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the circuit equivalent of a spin torque transfer (STT) MTJ device <b>20</b>. The STT MTJ device <b>20</b> may be implemented as a memory, such as an MRAM, or as some other type of spin-logic device, such as an AND gate. STT technology uses spin-aligned or polarized electrons to directly torque the physical system. Specifically, as electrons flow into a pinned thick magnetic layer, they become polarized. When these polarized electrons come near to the free layer, they will exert a torque tending to change the magnetic orientation of the nearby layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Because of its inherent resistance, the MTJ <b>200</b> is represented by a resistor in the schematic diagram. This resistance will cause a voltage drop, V<sub>MTJ</sub>, over the MTJ <b>200</b>. The MTJ <b>200</b> is coupled on one side to a bit line <b>202</b> and on the other side to the drain contact of the transistor <b>201</b>. The transistor <b>201</b> is coupled at its source contact to a source line <b>203</b> and at its gate contact to a word line <b>204</b>. In order to write data to the STT MTJ device <b>20</b>, a voltage, V<sub>WL</sub>, is applied to the word line <b>204</b>. V<sub>WL </sub>is designed to be sufficient to turn on the transistor <b>201</b> in operational conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The value written to the MTJ <b>200</b> will depend on how the STT MTJ device <b>20</b> loads the transistor <b>201</b>. When there is a voltage, V<sub>BL</sub>, on the bit line <b>202</b> as the word line <b>204</b> is activated, and the source line <b>203</b> has a relative low voltage, a logical &#x2018;1&#x2019; will be written to the MTJ <b>200</b>. The current direction in the STT MTJ device <b>20</b> with this biasing arrangement produces a current flow from the bit line <b>202</b> toward the source line <b>203</b>. This current direction through the MTJ <b>200</b> sets up the appropriate relative magnetic layer magnetic orientations that represent a logical &#x2018;1&#x2019;. In contrast, when a voltage, V<sub>SL</sub>, is applied to the source line <b>203</b> as the word line <b>204</b> is activated, and the bit line <b>202</b> has a relatively low voltage, the current flow in the STT MTJ device <b>20</b> is in the opposite direction (i.e., from the source line <b>203</b> toward the bit line <b>202</b>). This current direction establishes the appropriate magnetic layer magnetic orientations to reflect a logical &#x2018;0&#x2019; in the MTJ <b>200</b>. Because the inherent resistance in the MTJ <b>200</b> causes a source loading effect in the write &#x2018;0&#x2019; process, it is more difficult to write a &#x2018;0&#x2019; in this type of configuration. Moreover, power is wasted because the voltages will be applied to the STT MTJ device <b>20</b> longer in order to trigger the state change in the MTJ <b>200</b> that produces the &#x2018;0&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be noted that the MTJ <b>200</b> may be coupled into the STT MTJ device <b>20</b> in various different ways. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, one of the magnetic layers in an MTJ, such as MTJ <b>200</b>, will often have a fixed magnetic orientation, while the other magnetic layer has a free floating magnetic orientation. The current flow direction that will generally yield the highest resistance in the MTJ <b>200</b> is when the current flow travels from the fixed or reference magnetic orientation layer to the free layer. Thus, in the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the free floating magnetic layer side of the MTJ <b>200</b> is connected to the transistor <b>201</b>, while the fixed magnetic layer side of the MTJ <b>200</b> is coupled to the bit line <b>202</b>. Thus, in the write &#x2018;0&#x2019; process when the bit line <b>202</b> is biased with a relatively low or zero voltage with respect to the source line <b>203</b>, the current flows in the direction from the source line <b>203</b> to the bit line <b>202</b>. The higher resistance with this direction of current flowing from the free magnetic layer to the fixed or reference magnetic layer results in a higher voltage drop, V<sub>MTJ</sub>, across the MTJ <b>200</b>, which increases the source loading affect on the transistor <b>201</b>, which makes it more difficult to actually write the &#x2018;0&#x2019; to the MTJ <b>200</b>. In alternative configurations, where the free magnetic layer is coupled to the bit line <b>202</b> and the reference magnetic layer is coupled to the transistor <b>201</b>, the process for writing a &#x2018;1&#x2019; would be more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a magnetic memory <b>30</b>. The magnetic memory <b>30</b> includes an array <b>300</b> of multiple MTJ memory units <b>301</b>. The multiple MTJ memory units <b>301</b> are arranged in columns <b>302</b> within the array <b>300</b>. The ellipsis <b>306</b> in the lines of the columns <b>302</b> represent the existence of multiple additional MTJ memory units <b>301</b> within the columns <b>302</b>.

The multiple MTJ memory units <b>301</b> are also coupled to word lines <b>305</b> that trigger a write operation when a sufficient voltage is applied. In order to select the particular memory cell on which to write data, a series of column switches <b>304</b> are in place for each of the columns <b>302</b>. A single set of source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> are used to drive each of the source lines <b>307</b> and bit lines <b>308</b> of the array <b>300</b>. When a write command is received, an address is received along with it, which, when decoded, allows the magnetic memory <b>30</b> to open or close the appropriate ones of the column switches <b>304</b>.

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various embodiments of the present teachings are directed to an asynchronous switching scheme for magnetic bit cell devices. Example magnetic bit cells include a transistor coupled to an STT MTJ structure. At one terminal of the bit cell, a bit line is coupled to the STT MTJ structure. At another terminal of the bit cell, a source line is coupled to the source/drain terminal of the transistor. The bit line is driven by a bit line driver that provides a first voltage to the bit line. The source line is driven by a source line driver that provides a second voltage to the source line. The second voltage is larger than the first voltage. In an MRAM array configuration, the switching characteristics of the bit cell and STT MTJ structure are improved and made more reliable by one or a combination of applying the higher second voltage to the source line and/or reducing the overall bit line and source line parasitic resistance.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Magnetic bit cell elements, such as those used in MRAM, spin-logic devices or the like, may be used in systems that maintain multiple internal networks for power saving purposes. These systems include devices such as mobile devices, mobile phones, and the like. The core network of such a device is generally considered the circuitry that operates the core functionality of the device. The device may also have an input/output (I/O) network, which handles all external communication between the device and external components or devices. The core network will communicate with the I/O network in order to transmit or receive signals external to the device. Often times, the I/O network will operate at a different, higher voltage level than the core network. The higher voltage may be used to drive the components that consume more power, such as transmitters, receivers, and the like. In such instances, the core network communicates with the I/O network through multiple level shifters which shift the voltage levels between the two networks.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In such devices, an MRAM or possibly a spin-logic device is often part of the core network. Thus, the voltage provided to these elements is based on the lower core voltage. As noted above, the source loading effect in an STT MTJ device often makes it more difficult to write a &#x2018;0&#x2019; to the memory or programmable part of the cell (when the fixed or reference magnetic layer or magnetic layer having the higher coercive field is coupled to the bit line). In operation, because these STT MTJ devices are also generally powered with the lower core voltages, the write &#x2018;0&#x2019; difficulties can become even more acute.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an MTJ column circuit equivalent <b>40</b> of a column <b>302</b> in the magnetic memory <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In order to ensure proper operation of a memory cell, such as MTJ memory unit <b>301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), certain voltage drops will be maintained across the MTJ structure <b>309</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The specific voltage drops will control the MTJ structure <b>309</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) switching between parallel and anti-parallel magnetic orientations, thus, switching memory values. However, in operation, parasitic resistances may cause insufficient voltages to be applied at each terminal of the MTJ structure <b>309</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and, even before that, at the terminals of the transistor <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). These parasitic resistances are illustrated in the MTJ column circuit equivalent <b>40</b>. In the entire length of the column <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), there is an equivalent parasitic resistance resulting from the source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>)&#x2014;a driver resistance <b>400</b>, from column switches <b>304</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>)&#x2014;a switch resistance <b>401</b>, from the inherent resistance in the conducting traces of the magnetic memory <b>30</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>)&#x2014;a conducting trace resistance <b>402</b>, from the transistor <b>310</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>)&#x2014;an XTOR resistance <b>403</b>, and then from the MTJ structure <b>309</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) itself&#x2014;an MTJ resistance <b>404</b>. Therefore, the voltages seen at each terminal of the MTJ structure <b>309</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) will be reduced by the voltage drops caused by each of the effective resistances. The resulting switching conditions on the MTJ structure <b>309</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may, at various times, be inadequate to ensure proper operation, which affects the overall operation of the MTJ memory unit <b>301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Moreover, the voltage applied at the terminals of the transistor <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may also not be sufficient to activate the transistor <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Because the proper operation is not guaranteed with this configuration, operation of the magnetic memory <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) will not be reliable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a hysteresis graph <b>50</b> illustrating a current flow <b>500</b> through an STT MRAM memory cell as a function of the bit cell biasing voltage <b>501</b>. The hysteresis graph <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents the current flow <b>500</b> in the STT MRAM in which the MTJ free layer is coupled to the source line of the STT MRAM transistor, while the MTJ reference layer is coupled to the bit line. The bit cell biasing voltage <b>501</b> is represented by the source line voltage (V<sub>SL</sub>) minus the bit line voltage (V<sub>BL</sub>). At point <b>503</b>, the current flowing through the MTJ jumps from approximately 90 &#x3bc;A to approximately 130 &#x3bc;A at point <b>502</b>. Thus, resistance has decreased in the MTJ indicating the MTJ switching from the higher resistance state to the lower resistance state. This switching point corresponds to a voltage of approximately 1.4 V at the source line and 0 V at the bit line.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As the bit cell bias voltage <b>501</b> decreases, the current flowing through the MTJ eventually reverses direction. At point <b>505</b>, the current flowing through the MTJ reaches approximately &#x2212;130 &#x3bc;A. It then drops to approximately &#x2212;90 &#x3bc;A at point <b>504</b>. Therefore, the MTJ switches from its low resistance state to its higher resistance state at points <b>505</b>/<b>504</b>. The bit cell bias voltage <b>501</b> at points <b>504</b>/<b>505</b> is approximately &#x2212;700 mV on the bit line with 0 V on the source line.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In analyzing the switching characteristics of the MTJ, it can be seen from the hysteresis graph <b>50</b> that MTJ switching occurs at asymmetric voltages. Thus, for MTJ switching to be completed, V<sub>BL </sub>may be lower than 1 V and V<sub>SL </sub>should be larger than 1.4 V. In many applications, it is less complex to provide symmetric biasing than asymmetric biasing. However, the limitations of MTJ structures would prevent such configurations. Certainly, if V<sub>BL </sub>and V<sub>SL </sub>were both biased at a value of 700 mV (&#x2212;/+), the MTJ may switch from the lower resistance state to the higher resistance state, but it will not switch from the high resistance state to the lower resistance state. Conversely, if V<sub>BL </sub>and V<sub>SL </sub>were both biased at 1.4 V, the MTJ may switch from the high resistance state, but, at the other end of the spectrum, the MTJ structure may breakdown after switching states from low to high resistance. The point <b>506</b> represents the point at which the MTJ structure begins to breakdown. The voltage drop across the MTJ bit cell structure at point <b>506</b> is approximately &#x2212;1.4 V. These operating conditions may get even worse, with breakdown occurring earlier or switching occurring at different voltage drops with variations in the process corners. Therefore, in order to maintain reliable operation, symmetric biasing mechanism may not be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a hysteresis graph <b>60</b> illustrating a voltage drop across the MTJ structure (V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b>) as a function of the bit cell bias voltage <b>601</b>. The switching of the MTJ structure is shown to occur at points <b>602</b>/<b>603</b> and at points <b>604</b>/<b>605</b>. Again, as reflected in hysteresis graph <b>60</b>, the switch at points <b>602</b>/<b>603</b> occurs with V<sub>SL </sub>at approximately 1.4 V with V<sub>BL </sub>at 0 V, and the switch at points <b>604</b>/<b>605</b> occurs with V<sub>BL </sub>at approximately &#x2212;700 mV with V<sub>SL </sub>at 0 V. The V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b> at the points <b>602</b>/<b>603</b> switch is approximately &#x2212;450 mV, at point <b>602</b>, and approximately &#x2212;520 mV, at point <b>603</b>. As the bit cell bias voltage <b>601</b> increases beyond 1.5 V, the trend in the hysteresis graph <b>60</b> suggests that the V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b> only slowly increases, with the slope of the curve appearing to approach zero before reaching a voltage drop of &#x2212;600 mV.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Considering the switch at points <b>604</b>/<b>605</b>, the V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b> is approximately 520 mV at point <b>604</b>, and approximately 450 mV at point <b>605</b>. Beyond this switch at points <b>604</b>/<b>605</b>, as a larger voltage is applied at V<sub>BL</sub>, the corresponding value of the V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b> continues to increase at a steady rate. However, once the V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b> reaches approximately 1 V, at point <b>606</b>, the danger of the MTJ structure breaking down increases dramatically. When the MTJ structure breaks down, it may no longer reliably be used as a memory circuit until the structure exits the break down conditions. Therefore, in analyzing the switching characteristics for an MTJ in the context of the V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b>, the circuit should attempt to limit V<sub>MTJ </sub><b>600</b> to an amount lower than approximately 1 V.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be noted that the voltage and current values disclosed with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> and each of the other FIGURES provided for in this application are merely examples and are not intended to limit the scope and application of the present teachings to any such values or materials which might reflect those values. The various embodiments of the present teachings may operate with any various types of material that reflect other values and still fall within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to address the switching issues experienced with MTJs, a new memory configuration is presented that provides an asymmetric switching scheme in which one of the bit/source lines is coupled to the core network voltage, while the other source/bit line is coupled to the I/O network voltage. In this configuration, the I/O voltage provides a higher voltage than the core network voltage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a representative schematic diagram of a memory cell <b>70</b> configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings. The memory cell <b>70</b> illustrates the furthest bit cell <b>700</b> in a column of a magnetic memory (not shown). The bit cell <b>700</b> includes an MTJ structure <b>701</b> (represented as a resistor) and a transistor <b>702</b>. A source line <b>703</b> is coupled to a source/drain terminal of the transistor <b>702</b>, while a bit line <b>704</b> is coupled to a terminal of the MTJ structure <b>701</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The bit line <b>704</b> is driven by a bit line driver <b>705</b>. The bit line driver <b>705</b> operates within the core network providing core voltage levels to the bit line <b>704</b>. The source line <b>703</b> is driven by a source line driver <b>706</b>. The source line driver <b>706</b> operates to provide I/O network voltage to the source line <b>703</b>. A core network buffer <b>707</b> and the source line driver <b>706</b> communicate at an interface provided by a level shifter <b>709</b>, which is capable of shifting voltage levels between the two different voltages of the core and I/O networks.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The memory cell <b>70</b> may reside in a magnetic memory such as the magnetic memory <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In such an example implementation, the source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) would be modified to conform to the configuration of the bit line driver <b>705</b> and the source line driver <b>706</b>. This would enable each of the source lines <b>307</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) with the higher I/O voltage. In the overall circuit of the memory cell <b>70</b>, a parasitic source resistance <b>711</b> and a parasitic bit line resistance <b>712</b> still exist because of the inherent resistance added by the source line driver <b>706</b>, the bit line driver <b>705</b>, the conducting trace resistance <b>402</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and the transistor <b>702</b>. However, because the higher I/O voltage is applied to the source line <b>703</b>, there will be a sufficient voltage level at the source/drain terminal of the transistor <b>702</b> to turn it on and sufficient voltage to cause the MTJ structure <b>701</b> to switch states, even with the slightly increased voltage drop across the parasitic source line resistance <b>711</b> due to the higher I/O voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a performance record <b>80</b> for an STT MRAM cell configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings. The STT MRAM cell related to the performance record <b>80</b> is configured much like the memory cell <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), with the source line being coupled to a source line driver enabled to provide a higher voltage than that provided on the bit line. The performance record <b>80</b> includes graphs of the current flowing through the MTJ structure, I(MTJ) <b>800</b>, the bit line biasing voltage, V(BL) <b>801</b>, the source line biasing voltage, V(SL) <b>802</b>, and the word line voltage, V(WL) <b>803</b>, each as a function of the same testing time line. Beginning at point <b>804</b> and throughout the testing time line, the V(WL) <b>803</b> is set to its high state. For purposes of the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the high state of the V(WL) <b>803</b> is 1.2 V.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The V(SL) <b>802</b> begins at point <b>805</b> set to its high state. For purposes of the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the high state of the V(SL) <b>802</b> is 1.8 V. This high state reflects a higher voltage level than the voltage available for the V(WL) <b>803</b>. The V(BL) <b>801</b> begins at point <b>807</b> set to its low state. For purposes of the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the low states for each of the V(WL) <b>803</b>, the V(SL) <b>802</b>, and the V(BL) <b>801</b> is 0 V. Moreover, the high state of V(BL) <b>801</b> is 1.2 V. With the V(WL) <b>803</b> activated in a write command, the source line biased at the V(SL) <b>802</b> in its high state, and the bit line biased at the V(BL) <b>801</b> in its low state, the I(MTJ) <b>800</b> is measured at the beginning point <b>809</b> to be 100 &#x3bc;A. At point <b>810</b>, the I(MTJ) <b>800</b> jumps to a current of 150 &#x3bc;A. This sudden increase in current flow at I(MTJ) <b>800</b> is a result of the resistance in the STT MTJ structure decreasing, thus, indicating the MTJ structure has switched states.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At point <b>806</b>, the V(SL) <b>802</b> switches to its low state, while the V(BL) <b>801</b> switches to its high state at point <b>808</b>. This change in bit cell biasing causes the I(MTJ) <b>800</b> to reverse current direction, but still remain at its high state at point <b>811</b>. At point <b>812</b>, the I(MTJ) <b>800</b> jumps from the high current state to a low current state. This sudden decrease in current flow at I(MTJ) <b>800</b> is a result of the resistance in the MTJ structure increasing, thus, indicating the MTJ structure has again switched states. This current signature continues in the I(MTJ) <b>800</b> for the remainder of the testing time line. In applying a higher voltage level to the V(BL) <b>802</b>, the MTJ structure may be switched more reliably. The time periods <b>813</b> and <b>814</b> represent the switching speed for switching from the high resistance, at point <b>809</b>, to the lower resistance, at point <b>810</b>, and for switching from the low resistance, at point <b>811</b>, to the higher resistance, at point <b>812</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The parasitic resistances <b>711</b> and <b>712</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) have a voltage-reducing effect, such that voltages applied at the terminals of a representative bit cell, such as the bit cell <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), will be less than the full amount provided to the source and bit lines by the source and bit line drivers. This reduction in voltage makes operation of the bit cell even more difficult. As illustrated above, a certain voltage differential is needed to cause the MTJ structure, such as MTJ structure <b>701</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), to switch states. Additionally, before the MTJ structure switches states, the voltage relationships will need to be sufficient to activate the bit cell transistor, such as transistor <b>702</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Therefore, another way to increase the voltage applied at the bit cell terminals is to reduce the overall resistance between the source and bit line drivers and the bit cell terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a magnetic memory <b>90</b> configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings. The magnetic memory <b>90</b> includes an array <b>900</b> of multiple memory bit cells <b>901</b> configured in a series of columns <b>909</b>. Each of the memory bit cells <b>901</b> includes an MTJ structure <b>902</b> and a transistor <b>903</b>, where the gate terminals of the transistors <b>903</b> are coupled to a word line <b>910</b>. The source lines <b>905</b> and the bit lines <b>906</b> couple the memory bit cells <b>901</b> to a driving location <b>904</b>. In contrast to the magnetic memory <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which includes the column switches <b>304</b> and a single, shared source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the magnetic memory <b>90</b> is configured with a high voltage driver <b>907</b> and a low voltage driver <b>908</b> for each one of the source lines <b>905</b> and the bit lines <b>906</b>, respectively. The high voltage drivers <b>907</b> are coupled to the source lines <b>905</b>, while the low voltage drivers <b>908</b> are coupled to the bit lines <b>906</b>. The high voltage drivers <b>907</b> and the low voltage drivers <b>908</b> also include selection logic, which provides the functionality previously supplied by the column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). By removing the column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the single, shared source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the net effect of the addition of the individual high voltage drivers <b>907</b> and the low voltage drivers <b>908</b> is a significant reduction in resistance between the drivers and the memory bit cells <b>901</b>. This reduction in resistance translates into a higher effective voltage applied at the terminals of the memory bit cells <b>901</b>, which results in a more reliable writing process for the memory bit cells <b>901</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that the addition of each of the high voltage drivers <b>907</b> and low voltage drivers <b>908</b> may increase the chip area used to integrate a magnetic memory, such as the magnetic memory <b>90</b>. However, the negative effects of the increased chip area are countered by the increased performance benefits realized by reducing the total resistance in the memory. The column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) provide significant resistance in the memory, not only caused by the resistance in any one switch, but, because the resistance of the column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is experienced in parallel, the total resistance in each of the columns <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is significantly higher than the resistance of a single switch. Furthermore, because of the location of the column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) need to be more robust, in order to account for the added resistance of the column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Without the column switches, each of the individual high voltage drivers <b>907</b> and low voltage drivers <b>908</b> do not need to be as robust as the source and bit line drivers <b>303</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), thus, adding less resistance and individually requiring substantially less chip area.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a performance record <b>1000</b> for an STT MRAM cell configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In considering the switching characteristics of an STT MRAM design, the switching of states follows a particular set of parameters. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a graph <b>1100</b> of the switching characteristics for an STT MRAM design. The switching characteristics follow a characteristics curve, T<sub>1</sub>, illustrated in the graph <b>1100</b>. The characteristics curve T<sub>1 </sub>addresses the critical switching current, I<sub>C </sub><b>1101</b>, as a function of the switching time, t <b>1102</b>. The memory is first designed to the characteristics at point <b>1103</b> of the characteristics curve T<sub>1</sub>. With these functional characteristics, by applying a current, I<sub>C1</sub>, to the memory design, the magnetic memory will switch after a time, t<sub>1</sub>. In order to increase the switching speed of the memory design to a time, t<sub>2</sub>, a current of I<sub>C2 </sub>will need to be applied to the memory. In designing a memory system that would provide for this new switching time of t<sub>2 </sub>according to point <b>1104</b> of the characteristics curve T<sub>1</sub>, the designers will need to address certain design trade-offs. For example, the existing devices may have power sources that are limited to supply only the current, I<sub>C1</sub>. Thus, to make the improvement in switching speed, the power supplies will be replaced. This replacement may cost more because of the higher power output requirements, or may take up more space, or will likely use more power during operation. In a mobile device that operates on battery power, power consumption is a serious consideration. Therefore, the decrease in switching time may not be cost-effective considering the additional monetary and power costs the decrease may require.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Instead of attempting to change the operation of a particular memory design, the various embodiments of the present teachings have changed the design itself. With the change in the design, the overall operational characteristics are changed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph <b>1200</b> of the switching characteristics of a first memory design represented by the characteristics curve T<sub>1 </sub>and a second memory design configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings. The characteristics curve T<sub>1 </sub>addresses the critical switching current, I<sub>C </sub><b>1201</b>, as a function of the switching time, t <b>1202</b>. The characteristics curve T<sub>1 </sub>represents the same switching characteristics illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. At point <b>1103</b>, the characteristics reflect a switching time of t<sub>1 </sub>with the application of the current, I<sub>CF</sub>. The memory design configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings has operational characteristics reflected in the characteristics curve, T<sub>2</sub>. The T<sub>2 </sub>memory design improves switching by increasing the voltage applied to the associated source line and reduces the overall parasitic resistance, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>. Because the memory design reflected by the characteristics curve T<sub>2 </sub>has created a faster switching memory, the entire characteristic curve T<sub>2 </sub>has shifted in time. Therefore, at point <b>1203</b>, by providing the same critical current I<sub>CF</sub>, the new memory design switches at time t<sub>2</sub>. By switching more quickly, the word line may shut off more quickly, which saves power for the underlying system.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In designing the high voltage driver <b>907</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of the magnetic memory <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), switching logic is added in order to perform the switching functionality previously provided by the column switches <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a logic diagram illustrating a cell selection circuit <b>1300</b> configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings. The cell selection circuit <b>1300</b> provides switching functionality for higher voltage source line drivers configured according to one embodiment of the present teachings. Three signals are used in controlling the switching functionality in the cell selection circuit <b>1300</b>. A write signal <b>1305</b> represents the signal received from the word line when a memory &#x201c;write&#x201d; is activated. The column-select (col-sel) signal <b>1306</b> is another signal that comes from the word line as address information. The address information is decoded to obtain the col-sel signal <b>1306</b>. In handling the higher voltages, level shifters <b>1301</b> provide voltage conversions from the lower voltages of the magnetic memory system. The write-data signal <b>1307</b> is a signal that represents the data that is to be written to the memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Using these three signals, the write signal <b>1305</b>, the col-sel signal <b>1306</b>, and the write-data signal <b>1307</b>, the cell selection circuit <b>1300</b> determines whether to bias its source line or not. The write signal <b>1305</b> and the col-sel signal <b>1306</b> are input into a NAND gate <b>1302</b>. The resulting signal from the NAND gate <b>1302</b> is used with the write-data signal <b>1307</b> as input to an OR gate <b>1303</b>. The resulting signal from the OR gate <b>1303</b> is then processed through an inverting buffer <b>1304</b>. The inverting buffer <b>1304</b> will bias the source line with the higher voltage level when the resulting signal from the OR gate <b>1303</b> is a logical &#x2018;0&#x2019;, or will leave the source line at 0 V when the resulting signal from the OR gate <b>1303</b> is a logical &#x2018;1&#x2019;. Thus, when attempting to write a &#x2018;0&#x2019; to the memory cell, the source line will be biased at the higher voltage level, and when attempting to write a &#x2018;1&#x2019; to the memory cell, the source line will be biased at 0 V. The entire operational characteristics of the cell selection circuit <b>1300</b> are provided below in Table 1.

For example, if the source lines are to be provided with a first voltage, and both the bit lines and word lines are to be provided with a second voltage, where the first voltage is higher than the second voltage and the voltage supplied by the external power source <b>1502</b> is different than both the first and second voltages, the charge pumps <b>1506</b> and <b>1507</b> would take the voltage from the external power source <b>1502</b> and create the first voltage (by the charge pump <b>1506</b>) and the second voltage (by the charge pump <b>1507</b>). In a separate example, if the word line was to be provided with a third voltage, then the third voltage would be created by the charge pump <b>1508</b> using the voltage supplied by the external power source <b>1502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It should be noted that in selected alternative embodiments, where the voltage to be applied to any of the source, bit, or word lines is equal to the voltage supplied by the external power source <b>1502</b>, the corresponding charge pump of the charge pumps <b>1506</b>-<b>1508</b> may not be included in the internal device section, in which case, the voltage would be supplied to the corresponding drivers, such as the SL drivers <b>1504</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>1504</b>-N, the BL drivers <b>1505</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>1505</b>-N, and/or the WL driver <b>1509</b>, directly from the external power source <b>1502</b>.</p>
