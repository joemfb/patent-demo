<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An implantable device and associated method detect anodal capture during electrical stimulation. A first pacing pulse is delivered using a first cathode and a first anode. A second pacing pulse is delivered using the first cathode and a second anode. A first response to the first pacing pulse and a second response to the second pacing pulse are measured. Anodal capture of the first pacing pulse at the first anode is detected in response to a first difference between the first response and the second response.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates generally to medical devices for delivering electrical stimulation and, in particular, to an apparatus and method for discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture in an electrical stimulation therapy device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In site-specific cardiac pacing methods, such as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), cathodal stimulation is generally desired. In some cases, an anodal capture threshold may be lower than the cathodal capture threshold. As a result, a clinician may think that capture of a particular heart chamber is occurring at the cathode electrode site when in fact the evoked response is initiated at the anode electrode site. This change in activation sequence from an expected activation sequence of the heart may result in less benefit from a delivered therapy than intended or possible. This compromised therapeutic benefit may go unrecognized since the clinician will typically not realize that anodal capture is occurring instead of cathodal capture.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, as multi-polar coronary sinus leads become commercially available for pacing and sensing in the left ventricle, anodal capture in the left ventricle can become a more common occurrence when a bipolar pair of electrodes positioned along the left ventricle is selected for pacing in the left ventricle. In CRT, anodal stimulation in the LV will result in a different activation sequence of the LV than expected. Doctors will typically select a cathode positioned at a desired pacing site, such as the near the LV base, paired with an anode that results in the lowest capture threshold to conserve pacemaker battery energy. In some cases, the selected anode may cause anodal capture only or a combination of anodal and cathodal capture. If the anode is nearer the LV apex than the base, less desired apical pacing will occur, unknown to the clinician.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following description, references are made to illustrative embodiments. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized without departing from the scope of the disclosure. As used herein, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Methods and associated circuitry are described herein for detecting and discriminating anodal stimulation during bipolar stimulation of a heart chamber. These methods may be implemented in any single, dual, or multi-chamber pacing device having at least two electrodes positioned for bipolar pacing in a heart chamber. More often, practice of the disclosed methods will be used when multiple electrodes are available in a paced heart chamber providing two or more bipolar electrode vectors to choose from for pacing in the heart chamber. In some embodiments, at least one electrode positioned away from the heart chamber is provided for use as an anode for obtaining measurements during unipolar pacing of the heart chamber that are used for discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture. The anode electrode may be in or along another heart chamber, along the housing of an associated IMD, or a subcutaneously implanted electrode such as a patch electrode. In some embodiments, which involve measuring conduction times between heart chambers, electrodes for sensing a conducted depolarization in a heart chamber other than the one being paced are needed. In other embodiments, a distant sensing bipole may be used to measure a conduction time within the same chamber being paced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following description, a dual-chamber (biventricular) pacing device is described as one illustrative embodiment of a device that may utilize the anodal capture detection methods described herein. This device is used in particular for delivering cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) by pacing in one or both ventricles. It should be recognized, however, that anodal capture detection and discrimination during bipolar pacing may be implemented in numerous device configurations that include bipolar pacing capabilities in at least one heart chamber for delivering CRT or any other pacing therapy. Furthermore, aspects of the anodal capture detection and discrimination methods may be implemented in any medical device delivering electrical stimulation to excitable body tissue and are not necessarily limited to practice in cardiac pacing applications.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an implantable medical device (IMD) <b>10</b> coupled to a patient's heart <b>8</b> by way of a right ventricular (RV) lead <b>16</b> and a coronary sinus (CS) lead <b>18</b>. The IMD <b>10</b> is embodied as a cardiac pacing device provided for restoring ventricular synchrony by delivering pacing pulses to one or more heart chambers as needed to control the heart activation sequence. The heart <b>8</b> is shown in a partially cut-away view illustrating the upper heart chambers, the right atrium (RA) and left atrium (LA), and the lower heart chambers, the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV), and the great cardiac vein <b>48</b>, which branches to form inferior cardiac veins. The great cardiac vein <b>48</b> opens into the coronary sinus (CS) in the right atrium.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The transvenous leads <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> connect IMD <b>10</b> with the RV and the LV, respectively. It is recognized that in some embodiments, additional leads and/or electrodes may be coupled to an IMD for connecting the IMD with the RA and the LA to provide sensing and/or pacing in three or all four chambers of the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each lead <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> carries pace/sense electrodes coupled to insulated, elongated conductors extending through leads <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. A remote indifferent housing electrode <b>12</b> is formed as part of the outer surface of the housing of the IMD <b>10</b>. The pace/sense electrodes and the remote indifferent housing electrode <b>12</b> can be selectively employed to provide a number of unipolar and bipolar pace/sense electrode combinations for pacing and sensing functions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">RV lead <b>16</b> is shown as a transvenous, endocardial lead passed through the RA into the RV. The RV lead <b>16</b> is formed with a proximal lead connector adapted for insertion into a connector bore of IMD connector block <b>14</b>. The lead connector (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) electrically couples electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b> carried by RV lead <b>16</b> to internal circuitry of IMD <b>10</b> via connector block <b>14</b>. RV pace/sense tip electrode <b>20</b> and proximal RV pace/sense ring electrode <b>22</b> are provided for RV pacing and sensing of RV EGM signals. RV lead <b>16</b> additionally carries an RV coil electrode <b>24</b> and a superior vena cava (SVC) coil electrode <b>26</b>, which may be used for delivering high-voltage cardioversion or defibrillation shocks. RV ring electrode <b>22</b>, RV coil electrode <b>24</b> or SVC coil electrode <b>26</b> are used in some embodiments as an anode paired with an electrode positioned along the LV for delivering unipolar pacing pulses in the LV during anodal capture analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the illustrative embodiment, a multi-polar LV CS lead <b>18</b> is passed through the RA, into the CS and further into a cardiac vein <b>48</b> to extend the distal four pace/sense electrodes <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> along the LV chamber to achieve LV pacing and sensing of LV EGM signals using any combination of electrodes <b>30</b> through <b>36</b>. The LV CS lead <b>18</b> is coupled at a proximal end lead connector (not shown) inserted into a bore of IMD connector block <b>14</b> to provide electrical coupling of electrodes <b>30</b> through <b>36</b> to IMD internal circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The depicted positions of the leads and electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in or about the right and left ventricles are approximate and merely illustrative. It is recognized that alternative leads and pace/sense electrodes that are adapted for placement at pacing or sensing sites on or in or relative to the RA, LA, RV and/or LV may be used in conjunction with the methods described herein. For example, in a three chamber pacing device, a RA lead may be positioned carrying a tip and ring electrode for pacing and sensing in the right atrial chamber. Additionally, in a four chamber embodiment, LV CS lead <b>22</b> could bear proximal LA CS pace/sense electrode(s) positioned along the lead body to lie adjacent the LA for use in pacing the LA or sensing LA EGM signals. A multi-chamber device in which anodal capture detection methods may be practiced is generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,555,336 (Sheth, et al.), hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electrodes designated above as &#x201c;pace/sense&#x201d; electrodes can generally be used for both pacing and sensing functions. These &#x201c;pace/sense&#x201d; electrodes can be selected to be used exclusively as pace or sense electrodes or to be used for both pacing and sensing in programmed combinations for sensing cardiac signals and delivering cardiac stimulation pulses along selected sensing and pacing vectors. Separate or shared indifferent pace and sense electrodes can also be designated in pacing and sensing functions, including the use of RV coil electrode <b>24</b> and/or SVC coil electrode <b>26</b> as a pacing anode.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a functional block diagram of IMD <b>10</b>. IMD <b>10</b> generally includes timing and control circuitry <b>52</b> and an operating system that may employ microprocessor <b>54</b> or a digital state machine for timing sensing and therapy delivery functions in accordance with a programmed operating mode. Microprocessor <b>54</b> and associated memory <b>56</b> are coupled to the various components of IMD <b>10</b> via a data/address bus <b>55</b>. Microprocessor <b>54</b>, memory <b>56</b>, timing and control <b>52</b>, and capture analysis module <b>80</b> may operate cooperatively as a controller for executing and controlling various functions of IMD <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">IMD <b>10</b> includes therapy delivery module <b>50</b> for delivering a therapy in response to determining a need for therapy based on sensed physiological signals. Therapy delivery module <b>50</b> provides electrical stimulation therapies, such as cardiac pacing or arrhythmia therapies, including CRT. Therapies are delivered by module <b>50</b> under the control of timing and control <b>52</b>. Therapy delivery module <b>50</b> is typically coupled to two or more electrodes <b>68</b> via an optional switch matrix <b>58</b>. Switch matrix <b>58</b> may be used for selecting which electrodes and corresponding polarities are used for delivering electrical stimulation pulses. Electrodes <b>68</b> may correspond to the electrodes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or any electrodes coupled to IMD <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Therapy delivery module <b>50</b> includes an electrical pulse generator for generating pacing pulses. Timing and control <b>52</b>, in cooperation with microprocessor <b>54</b> and capture analysis module <b>80</b>, control the delivery of pacing pulses by therapy delivery <b>50</b> according to a capture analysis algorithm for detecting and discriminating anodal capture. The detection of anodal capture is used to select which of electrodes <b>68</b> and corresponding polarities are used in delivering a cardiac pacing therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Electrodes <b>68</b> are also used for receiving cardiac electrical signals. Cardiac electrical signals may be monitored for use in diagnosing or monitoring a patient condition or may be used for determining when a therapy is needed and in controlling the timing and delivery of the therapy. When used for sensing, electrodes <b>68</b> are coupled to signal processing circuitry <b>60</b> via switch matrix <b>58</b>. Signal processor <b>60</b> includes sense amplifiers and may include other signal conditioning circuitry and an analog-to-digital converter. Cardiac EGM signals (either analog sensed event signals or digitized signals or both) may then be used by microprocessor <b>54</b> for detecting physiological events, such as detecting and discriminating cardiac arrhythmias, determining activation patterns of the patient's heart, and in performing anodal capture analysis as will be described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">IMD <b>10</b> may additionally be coupled to one or more physiological sensors <b>70</b>. Physiological sensors <b>70</b> may include pressure sensors, accelerometers, flow sensors, blood chemistry sensors, activity sensors or other physiological sensors for use with implantable devices. Physiological sensors may be carried by leads extending from IMD <b>10</b> or incorporated in or on the IMD housing <b>12</b>. Sensor interface <b>62</b> receives signals from sensors <b>70</b> and provides sensor signals to signal processing circuitry <b>60</b>. Sensor signals are used by microprocessor <b>54</b> for detecting physiological events or conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The operating system includes associated memory <b>56</b> for storing a variety of programmed-in operating mode and parameter values that are used by microprocessor <b>54</b>. The memory <b>56</b> may also be used for storing data compiled from sensed signals and/or relating to device operating history for telemetry out upon receipt of a retrieval or interrogation instruction. A capture analysis algorithm may be stored in memory <b>56</b> and executed by microprocessor <b>54</b> and/or capture analysis module <b>80</b> with input received from electrodes <b>68</b> for detecting anodal capture. Alternatively, capture analysis module <b>80</b> may be embodied as dedicated circuitry for receiving and processing signals for detecting anodal capture and generating a report or warnings pertaining to anodal capture. Microprocessor <b>54</b> may respond to capture analysis data by altering electrode selection for delivering a cardiac pacing therapy or triggering alert <b>74</b> to generate an alert signal or message to a clinician that anodal capture is occurring. Data relating to capture analysis may be stored in memory <b>56</b> for later retrieval.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">IMD <b>10</b> further includes telemetry circuitry <b>64</b> and antenna <b>65</b>. Programming commands or data are transmitted during uplink or downlink telemetry between IMD telemetry circuitry <b>64</b> and external telemetry circuitry included in a programmer or monitoring unit. Telemetry circuitry <b>64</b> may be used to transmit an alert or notification generated in response to detecting anodal capture.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart of a method for selecting electrodes for delivering a pacing therapy based at least in part on the detection of anodal capture. Flow chart <b>100</b> and other flow charts presented herein are intended to illustrate the functional operation of the device, and should not be construed as reflective of a specific form of software or hardware necessary to practice the methods described. It is believed that the particular form of software, hardware and/or firmware will be determined primarily by the particular system architecture employed in the device and by the particular detection and therapy delivery methodologies employed by the device. Providing circuitry to accomplish the described functionality in the context of any modern IMD, given the disclosure herein, is within the abilities of one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Methods described in conjunction with flow charts presented herein may be implemented in a computer-readable medium that includes instructions for causing a programmable processor to carry out the methods described. A &#x201c;computer-readable medium&#x201d; includes but is not limited to any volatile or non-volatile media, such as a RAM, ROM, CD-ROM, NVRAM, EEPROM, flash memory, and the like.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>102</b>, a bipolar pair of pacing electrodes is selected for delivering a cardiac pacing in a heart chamber. Detection of anodal capture is described herein with regard to detecting anodal capture in the left ventricle during bipolar pacing of the left ventricle. It is recognized that detection of anodal capture during bipolar pacing in another heart chamber, or in another body location, may be performed using the methods described herein. In the illustrative embodiment, a bipolar pair of electrodes is selected from a multi-polar LV CS lead such as lead <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. LV pacing is delivered at block <b>104</b> according to a capture analysis algorithm to detect whether anodal capture is occurring in the LV at block <b>106</b>. The LV pacing at block <b>104</b> may involve both unipolar and bipolar pacing in the LV for making various measurements for detecting anodal capture during bipolar pacing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If anodal capture is detected, a notification may be generated to a clinician at block <b>108</b>. The clinician, made aware that anodal capture is occurring, may program the IMD to use a different pacing electrode pair for pacing in the LV.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally or alternatively, a different LV pacing bipole may be selected automatically at block <b>110</b>. For example, a different electrode may be selected as an anode with the same cathode, located at a desired LV pacing site, in an attempt to obtain cathodal stimulation at the desired pacing site. A different anode selected at block <b>110</b> may be within the LV or in another heart chamber, for example, an RV electrode, or the housing of the IMD in order to minimize the likelihood of anodal capture in the LV. Selection of a different electrode pair may involve selecting a different anode only, a different cathode only, or a different anode and a different cathode to achieve cathodal capture at a desired pacing site. If anodal capture is not detected at block <b>106</b>, LV pacing can be delivered using the selected electrode pair at block <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a flow chart <b>200</b> of one method for detecting anodal capture in the LV. At block <b>202</b>, an anodal capture test is initiated. The anodal capture test may be performed upon command or automatically and may be performed alone or in combination with a capture threshold test. The anodal capture test may be performed automatically on a periodic basis or in response to detecting a change in a physiological signal, e.g. a worsening hemodynamic signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block <b>204</b>, an LV pacing cathode is selected and LV pacing is delivered between the LV cathode electrode and a &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode. The LV pacing cathode is a candidate pacing cathode being evaluated for the likelihood of anodal capture if the cathode were to be used for delivering a pacing therapy. The &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode is an anode electrode that will be used to measure both a control and test pacing response during evaluation of a given cathode electrode for the presence of anodal capture. A &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode may be positioned away from the LV, such as an RV ring electrode <b>22</b>, RV coil electrode <b>24</b>, SVC coil electrode <b>26</b>, or an electrode located away from the heart, such as a housing electrode <b>12</b> formed along the IMD housing, all shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For any of these anode selections, the pacing delivered at block <b>204</b> will be unipolar pacing. As used herein, the term &#x201c;unipolar pacing&#x201d; refers to pacing using one electrode positioned in or along the heart chamber to be paced and one electrode positioned away from the heart chamber being paced, either in another heart chamber or away from the heart. In one embodiment, unipolar LV pacing is delivered at block <b>204</b> between a selected LV cathode electrode and any available electrode positioned away from the LV, which may be in or along another heart chamber, the SVC, the IMD housing, any subcutaneous location, or other locations that are not in or along the LV.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment, the &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode may be another electrode in the heart chamber being paced, i.e. the same chamber as the cathode electrode. Examples measurement configurations that include a &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode located away from the paced chamber and a &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode located in the paced chamber will be described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a quadripolar LV lead such as lead <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electrodes <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>36</b> may be referred to as LV<b>1</b>, LV<b>2</b>, LV<b>3</b> and LV<b>4</b>, respectively, moving from the most distal LV<b>1</b> electrode <b>30</b> to the most proximal LV<b>4</b> electrode <b>36</b>. The most proximal LV<b>4</b> electrode <b>36</b> may be positioned along the LV base and may be the most desirable cathode electrode for delivering LV basal pacing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As such, in one example, the LV<b>4</b> electrode <b>36</b> may be selected at block <b>204</b> as a pacing cathode in a unipolar LV pacing vector using any available electrode away from the LV as the anode. For example, during the anodal capture analysis algorithm, pacing is delivered between the LV<b>4</b> electrode <b>36</b> (or other selected LV cathode electrode) and an RV electrode, such as RV coil electrode <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), serving as the anode.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The time interval between the pacing pulse and an RV depolarization sensed after the LV pacing pulse is measured at block <b>206</b> as a control conduction time (CT). Here, and in other embodiments of anodal capture analysis algorithms presently disclosed, when pacing pulses are being delivered to measure a response to the pacing pulses, the pulses are delivered at time intervals that avoid interference of intrinsic depolarizations with the measured response to a pacing pulse. For example, pacing pulses are delivered at a time interval that is shorter than intrinsic RV depolarization arising from conduction from the atria to avoid intrinsic depolarization signals from interfering with CT measurements in the RV. Additionally, premature ventricular contraction (PVC) detection may be employed to avoid measuring a conducted PVC as a conducted depolarization response to the LV pacing pulse. Methods for controlling the timing of test pulses during a capture analysis algorithm and for dealing with the occurrence of PVCs may correspond generally to methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0137935 (Parikh, et al.), hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In practice, the pacing pulse amplitude delivered at block <b>204</b> may be set to a value just above the capture threshold. The conduction time of a pacing-evoked depolarization from the LV to the RV can decrease with higher pacing voltage. To provide comparable CT intervals measured using different electrode vectors, a consistent pacing pulse amplitude and pulse width relative to a measured capture threshold for a given pacing vector may be used when measuring an LVpace to RVsense CT. For example, a fixed increment above the capture threshold such as about 0.5 V greater than a measured capture threshold, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The RV EGM signal used for sensing an RV depolarization conducted from the LV may be sensed using the RV tip and ring electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, it is assumed that cathodal capture is occurring in the LV and anodal capture is not occurring at the &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode when the control CT is measured. For example, for an LV-RVcoil pacing configuration used for measuring a control response to an LV pacing pulse, capture is occurring in the LV and is not occurring at the RV coil.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Measuring the relative time of a conducted depolarization (R-wave) relative to an LV pacing pulse may involve measuring the time to an R-wave sense amplifier output. Sensing an R-wave in the RV may be performed using a sense amplifier and auto-adjusting threshold as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,117,824 (Keimel, et al.), hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In an alternative embodiment, measuring the CT of the conducted RV depolarization relative to an LV pacing pulse may involve analog-to-digital conversion of an ventricular EGM signal and analysis of the digitized EGM signal to determine a local activation time at a sensing bipole located a distance from the pacing cathode. The local activation time may be identified as any fiducial point along the R-wave of the EGM signal, such as a maximum, minimum, peak dV/dt, zero-crossing or other signal feature.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>208</b>, a bipolar pair is selected in the LV using the same LV cathode electrode as used to measure the control CT. Any other available LV electrode is selected as the anode in a candidate bipolar pacing vector for use during subsequent therapy delivery. Bipolar LV pacing is delivered using the selected LV cathode and anode. The CT between the LV pacing pulse and a conducted depolarization is measured at block <b>210</b> as the bipolar CT. The bipolar LV pacing pulse is delivered just above the capture threshold, for example, a consistent fixed increment above the capture threshold, to provide comparable time interval measurements between pacing vectors with minimized influence of the pacing pulse amplitude on the measured conduction times. It is noted that, while it is known that some type of capture is occurring at the capture threshold, it remains unknown whether that capture is occurring at the anode, cathode, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At block <b>211</b>, the polarity of the LV anode used during bipolar LV pacing is switched to a cathode and then used to deliver LV pacing with the same &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode electrode used during measurement of the control CT. A test CT is measured at block <b>211</b> to obtain a CT corresponding to capture at the candidate bipolar LV anode site. This test CT measured during LV pacing at the candidate bipolar anode site, i.e. using the candidate bipolar anode as a cathode during pacing with the &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode, gives an estimate of the CT that would be expected if anodal capture is occurring during LV bipolar pacing using the candidate LV bipole.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At block <b>212</b>, the bipolar CT is compared to the control CT and the test CT to determine if the bipolar CT approximately matches the control CT. If cathodal capture is occurring during pacing with the candidate bipole, the bipolar CT should approximately match the control CT. If anodal is capture is occurring during pacing with the candidate bipole, the bipolar CT should approximately match the test CT. As such, in one embodiment the absolute difference between the candidate bipolar CT and the control CT is compared to the absolute difference between the candidate bipolar CT and the test CT. If the absolute difference between the candidate bipolar CT and the control CT is less than the absolute difference between the candidate bipolar CT and the test CT (a negative result at block <b>212</b>), the candidate cathode being evaluated (LV<b>4</b> in the above example) is capturing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the bipolar CT is closer to the test CT than the control CT, the anode LV<b>1</b> in this example is likely capturing. In an alternative embodiment, the test CT may not be measured if the bipolar CT closely matches the control CT within a predefined range, e.g. within approximately 10 ms of the control CT. In some cases, if the LV bipole electrodes are very close together, the conduction times from cathodal and anodal stimulation may not be separable. However, in this case, the impact of pacing from the anode vs. pacing from the cathode during bipolar pacing may have no clinical impact and therefore such discrimination may be unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If cathodal capture is occurring, the bipolar CT will be closer to the control CT as determined at decision block <b>212</b>. Cathodal capture is detected at block <b>220</b>. The selected candidate LV bipole can be used to deliver LV pacing pulses according to a programmed pacing therapy at block <b>220</b>. If the candidate bipolar CT is not closer to or does not approximately match the control CT, anodal capture is detected at block <b>214</b>. A notification of anodal capture may be generated at block <b>214</b>, and/or a different LV bipolar pair may be selected for evaluation by proceeding to block <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">If other LV electrodes are available for use as an anode, as determined at block <b>216</b>, a new candidate bipolar pair using the same cathode and a different anode may be selected at block <b>218</b>. A bipolar CT is measured again at block <b>210</b> using the same LV cathode electrode with a newly selected LV anode electrode and the process continues to block <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If all available LV electrodes have been tested as an anode paired with the currently selected LV cathode and resulted in anodal capture detection, the process may return to block <b>204</b> to select a different LV electrode as a new candidate cathode and repeat the anodal capture test until a suitable LV bipolar pair is identified that does not result in anodal capture. This process of selecting new candidate bipolar electrode pairs for testing may be a fully automated process or may be semi-automated in which a user responds to a warning of anodal capture detection and selects what actions will be taken next, for example, accept the electrode configuration, select a new anode, select a new cathode, select a new anode and new cathode, perform additional measurements or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some instances, the control CT and the test CT may be equal. In this situation, a different distant bipole may be selected for sensing a conducted depolarization for measuring the CTs in an attempt to obtain distinct control and test CTs. Alternatively, a different method for discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture may be selected, such as using a different measured response to the pacing pulse, for example evoked response timing or morphology as described below. In another embodiment, if the control and test CTs are equal, the algorithm may be stopped, and an inconclusive test may be reported.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a schematic drawing depicting one configuration <b>250</b> for making measurements during an anodal capture test algorithm. In the schematic drawing, electrodes <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b>, and <b>254</b> are positioned along or in a cardiac chamber to be paced, e.g. along the LV.

Electrodes <b>255</b> and <b>256</b> are positioned away from the paced chamber, e.g. in the RV. Electrode <b>255</b>, which may be a ring or coil electrode, is shown to be used as a universal anode with any of electrodes <b>251</b> through <b>254</b> during unipolar pacing. In an illustrative example according to the method described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a control measurement is made during unipolar pacing between electrode <b>251</b> (candidate cathode) and electrode <b>255</b> (universal anode), along pacing vector <b>260</b> (with the cathodal to anodal polarities indicated by the respective letters &#x201c;C&#x201d; and &#x201c;A&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A control measurement made during this unipolar pacing may be the CT from the pacing cathode <b>251</b> to an R-wave sensed at a local site using bipolar sensing electrodes in another heart chamber, such as electrodes <b>256</b> and <b>255</b> which may correspond to RV tip and ring electrodes. Any bipole located a distance away from the cathode electrode can be used to measure a control CT.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A bipolar measurement is made during bipolar pacing between electrode <b>251</b> (candidate cathode) and electrode <b>254</b> (anode) along vector <b>262</b>. With continued reference to the example given above, a bipolar CT may be measured by sensing a local R-wave at the bipole formed by electrodes <b>255</b> and <b>256</b>. If cathodal capture is occurring at candidate cathode <b>251</b>, the control CT and the bipolar CT are expected to be similar because the conduction time of an evoked response occurring at electrode <b>251</b> to the distant bipole electrodes <b>255</b> and <b>256</b> should be similar in both cases.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The anode electrode <b>254</b> of the pacing bipole is switched to a cathode polarity, as indicated by the &#x201c;C&#x201d; and &#x201c;A&#x201d; notations, to measure a test response during unipolar pacing between electrode <b>254</b> (now a cathode) and the universal anode <b>255</b> along vector <b>264</b>.

When the bipolar CT measured during pacing along vector <b>262</b> more closely matches the test CT measured during pacing along vector <b>264</b> than the control measurement made during pacing along vector <b>260</b>, anodal capture at electrode <b>254</b> during bipolar pacing is detected or suspected.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The measured response to a pacing pulse during the anodal capture test may be a CT between the paced heart chamber and another heart chamber as measured by determining the relative time of a locally sensed R-wave (or P-wave if pacing and sensing in the atria) and the preceding pacing pulse. The measurement of a response to a pacing pulse may include other measurements such as a capture threshold measurement, a measurement relating to an evoked response detected in the paced chamber, or any combination thereof, examples of which will be further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, another configuration <b>270</b> for measuring pacing responses for anodal capture detection is depicted schematically. The electrodes <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>253</b> and <b>254</b> are electrodes positioned in the heart chamber to be paced, such as the LV, during the anodal capture analysis algorithm. In this case, electrodes in the chamber being paced are the only electrodes used during the anodal capture analysis test. This method can be performed, for example in a single-chamber pacing application.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A bipolar measurement is made during pacing along a desired bipolar pacing vector <b>262</b> between electrode <b>251</b> (candidate cathode) and electrode <b>254</b> (anode).

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">If the response to the pacing pulses is measured as a CT, the CT is measured by determining the relative time from the delivered pacing pulse and a locally sensed R-wave at a sensing bipole in the chamber being paced.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart <b>300</b> of a method for detecting anodal capture according to an alternative embodiment. At block <b>302</b>, an anodal capture test is initiated. An LV cathode electrode is selected at block <b>304</b>, and LV pacing is delivered using the candidate LV cathode electrode and a universal anode electrode, which may be located away from the LV, such as the RV coil electrode, such that the pacing is delivered in a unipolar manner. At block <b>306</b>, the capture threshold for the selected LV cathode and anode is determined. The pacing pulse amplitude is varied until the capture threshold is identified according to a capture threshold test. A capture threshold test is generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,873,898 (Hemming, et al.), hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, however other capture threshold measurement methods may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The control CT is measured at block <b>308</b> as described previously. This process of measuring a capture threshold and a control CT is repeated for all available LV electrodes evaluated as candidate LV cathodes paired one at a time with a universal anode positioned away from the LV as indicated by blocks <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>. The capture threshold data for each candidate LV electrode used as a cathode with an anode located outside the LV is stored in memory along with the corresponding control CT. This &#x201c;control&#x201d; data associated with LV cathodal capture during unipolar LV pacing is used in detecting LV anodal capture during LV bipolar pacing using the candidate LV cathodes and various LV anodes.</p>

In one embodiment, a candidate LV bipole is selected based on a desired pacing site during therapy delivery and/or the lowest capture threshold measured at block <b>306</b>. During LV bipolar pacing only (i.e., no pacing in the RV), the bipolar CT is measured at block <b>320</b>. The bipolar CT is measured during bipolar pacing using the candidate bipole at the same distant sensing bipole as used to measure the control CT.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The bipolar CT is compared to the control CT at block <b>322</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the bipolar CT does not approximately match the control CT, anodal capture is suspected as indicated at block <b>326</b>. The measured bipolar CT may be substantially longer or shorter than the control CT.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In Table I, example capture threshold test results are listed for LV pacing electrode pairs.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The capture threshold for LV<b>1</b> to LV<b>4</b> is 0.8 V.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Anodal capture thresholds will typically be significantly higher than cathodal capture thresholds. However, even if the threshold<b>1</b> is not much less than the control capture threshold or is closer to the control threshold than the test threshold <b>2</b>, anodal capture may still be occurring when the bipolar CT is much shorter than the control CT. For example simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture may be occurring when the bipolar CT does not approximately match the control CT but the capture threshold data does not provide strong evidence for anodal capture. Suspected anodal stimulation, in such cases, can be reported at block <b>340</b>. A clinician may decide whether to select a different electrode pair at block <b>338</b> or accept the tested bipole. In some cases, simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture may be acceptable, for example based on an analysis hemodynamic parameters.</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At block <b>406</b>, a control LV evoked response (ER) measurement is made. The control ER signal is measured from an EGM signal obtained at the pacing cathode electrode and another sensing electrode. An ER measurement may relate to a time interval from the pacing pulse to a point along the ER signal, a measurement of a morphological feature of the ER signal, or a template of the morphology of the ER signal waveform. ER sensing is generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,123,963 (Sawchuk et al.), hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

At block <b>411</b>, the LV anode used during bipolar pacing is switched to a cathode and LV pacing is delivered using the &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode that was also used for measuring the control ER. A test ER measurement is performed when the candidate bipole anode is switched to a cathode to obtain a test ER measurement corresponding to capture occurring at the anode site of the candidate LV bipole.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">At block <b>412</b>, the bipolar ER measurement is compared to the control ER measurement and the test ER measurement.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart <b>500</b> of a method for performing anodal capture analysis and reporting according to one embodiment. In the above-described embodiments, it is assumed that LV pacing delivered to obtain control measurements does not result in anodal capture. In other words it is assumed that anodal capture does not occur at a &#x201c;universal&#x201d; anode used to measure control responses and sometimes test responses to pacing pulses. In some cases, anodal capture may be occurring at the universal anode, when located in the same or another heart chamber. This anodal capture will produce confounding results when discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture during bipolar pacing in a heart chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">When the universal anode is selected away from the heart, such as a housing electrode along the IMD housing or a subcutaneous large surface area electrode, capture at the universal anode can be avoided. When in the heart, such as the RV, anodal capture without cathodal capture in the LV or a combination of anodal and cathodal capture simultaneously in both the RV and LV could occur. The method shown in flow chart <b>500</b> is used to test all available bipole combinations in a heart chamber and discriminate between anodal and cathodal capture, even when a control measurement may represent anodal capture at the universal anode rather than capture at the candidate cathode. A report can be generated indicating under what conditions anodal capture is detected or suspected providing a clinician with valuable information for selecting pacing vectors for achieving a desired therapeutic benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">At block <b>502</b>, an anodal capture test is started. The test may be initiated upon user command, upon implant detection or other triggering event. In some embodiments, the anodal capture evaluation is performed in conjunction with capture threshold testing such that both capture thresholds and any detected or suspected anodal capture may be reported together. As such, at block <b>504</b>, capture thresholds are measured for each candidate cathode, paired with a universal anode to obtain control capture thresholds and in candidate bipolar pairs with each available anode to obtain bipolar capture thresholds with all possible bipoles.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At block <b>506</b>, the associated CTs for each pacing combination are measured during the capture threshold tests. For example, during LV pacing, the control CT is measured for each candidate LV cathode paired with the universal anode, e.g. the RV coil electrode. These control CTs are stored for each respective candidate cathode. Additionally, during capture threshold measurements for each candidate bipole, an associated bipolar CT is measured. Each candidate LV cathode is paired with all available LV anode electrodes one at a time such that all possible bipolar LV pacing vectors are used to deliver bipolar LV pacing and measure a corresponding bipolar CT at a distant sensing site.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At block <b>508</b>, a candidate cathode is selected for evaluation for potential anodal capture. The control CT measured for the candidate cathode (during pacing with the universal anode) is compared to a minimum expected CT at block <b>510</b>. A physiological minimum CT is previously established and stored in IMD memory. An established minimum CT and may be based on clinical data or individual patient data as an expected conduction time from the cathode pacing site to a distant bipole sensing a local R-wave. The distant bipole sensing a conducted depolarization signal typically but not necessarily including the universal anode as one of the sensing electrodes. The sensing bipole may be in the paced heart chamber or the opposite heart chamber. In one embodiment, the control CT is measured using a sensing electrode pair in the RV, e.g. RV tip to RV ring. A minimum CT from LV pace to RV sense is defined as approximately 60 ms. If the control CT measured for the candidate cathode paired with a universal anode positioned in the RV is less than the minimum CT, anodal capture is likely to be occurring in the RV because conduction from the LV to the RV is not expected to occur faster than the minimum CT.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the control CT is not less than a minimum physiological CT (negative result at decision block <b>510</b>), cathodal capture is likely occurring in the LV during pacing using the universal anode. This result of the control CT being greater than the minimum CT indicates that the control CT is a reliable measure for use in discriminating anodal capture during bipolar pacing. At block <b>511</b> the control CT is classified as normal, and at block <b>512</b> each bipolar CT measured for the cathode under evaluation is compared to the normal control CT.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If all bipolar CTs measured for the candidate cathode are within a previously established threshold range of the control CT at block <b>512</b>, all bipolar pacing vectors using the candidate cathode under evaluation are labeled as having normal CTs at block <b>514</b>. The threshold range used at block <b>512</b> may be defined, for example, as approximately 10 ms. The &#x201c;normal&#x201d; CTs that are within a threshold range of the control CT are likely to be associated with cathodal capture. If additional candidate cathodes remain to be evaluated, as determined at block <b>516</b>, the next candidate cathode is selected for evaluation at block <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Returning to block <b>512</b>, if any bipolar CT is outside a threshold range of the control CT, that bipolar CT is classified as abnormal at block <b>528</b>. Any bipolar CTs using the candidate cathode that are within the threshold range of the control CT are classified as normal at block <b>528</b>. As such, for a given cathode electrode, some bipolar CTs may be classified as abnormal and some may be classified as normal depending whether the associated CT falls within a predefined range of the normal control CT.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At block <b>530</b>, a mean CT is computed for each electrode being tested. A mean CT is computed using only CTs classified as normal for a given cathode.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">At block <b>532</b>, a bipolar CT classified as abnormal is compared to the mean CT for the candidate cathode and to the mean CT computed for the electrode used as an anode in the candidate bipole, when the abnormal bipolar CT was measured.

If an abnormal bipolar CT is closer to the mean CT computed for the candidate bipole anode, as determined at block <b>534</b>, a warning of anodal capture for the associated bipole is generated at block <b>536</b>. If all of the abnormal CTs are closer to the mean CT computed for the candidate cathode, then no warning of anodal capture is generated. The process advances to block <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Returning to block <b>510</b>, if a control CT is less than the minimum CT, a warning of anodal capture is generated at block <b>518</b> for the candidate cathode and universal anode pair.

In this case, the control CT is not deemed reliable for discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture during bipolar pacing.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In this situation, each bipolar CT measured for the candidate cathode is compared to each of the other bipolar CTs measured for that cathode at block <b>520</b>.

A warning of anodal capture using the candidate cathode is generated. The process proceeds to block <b>516</b> to evaluate the next candidate cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If any bipolar CTs are within a predefined range of another bipolar CT for the same candidate cathode as determined at decision block <b>520</b>, all bipolar CTs within a threshold range of another bipolar CT are classified as normal at block <b>524</b>. All &#x201c;outliers&#x201d; that are not within an established threshold range of at least one other bipolar CT are classified as abnormal CTs at block <b>524</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At block <b>530</b>, a mean CT is computed for each electrode using all normal CTs measured for the given electrode. When arriving at block <b>530</b> from block <b>524</b>, the control CT is excluded from computing a mean CT for the candidate cathode because the control CT has been classified as abnormal. All bipolar CTs falling within an established range of at least one other bipolar CT and therefore classified as normal are used to compute the mean CT for a given electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Any bipolar CTs classified as abnormal for the candidate cathode are compared to the mean CT for the candidate cathode at block <b>532</b>. An abnormal bipolar CT is additionally compared to a mean CT computed for the electrode being used as the anode in the candidate bipole resulting in the abnormal CT. If an abnormal bipolar CT is closer to the mean CT determined for the electrode now being used as an anode, anodal capture is likely occurring. If the abnormal CT is closer to the mean CT determined for the candidate cathode, cathodal capture is likely to be occurring. In this way, if the cathode being evaluated results in cathodal capture for some lead vectors, these can be identified as bipolar vectors having close CT measurements, whereas outliers can be identified as &#x201c;abnormal&#x201d; and separated from normal bipolar CT measurements, even when the control CT measurement is classified as abnormal.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">If there are any bipolar CT measurements that are closer to the mean CT for the anode electrode than to the mean CT for the cathode electrode as determined at decision block <b>534</b>, then a warning of anodal capture for the associated bipole(s) is generated at block <b>536</b>. If all abnormal CTs are closer to the mean CT computed for the candidate cathode than the mean CT for the associated anode, no warning of anodal capture is generated. The process returns to block <b>516</b>. In this way, anodal capture is detected and discriminated from cathodal capture during bipolar pacing even when a control response using a universal anode results in suspected anodal capture.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">After evaluating all candidate cathodes, an anodal capture report is generated at block <b>530</b>. The report may be an on-screen display, printable report or other format including text, tables, or graphs of data determined during the anodal capture test. The anodal capture report may additionally include capture threshold data and/or evoked response measurement data. The anodal capture report will warn of anodal capture for any cathode found to have all abnormal CTs associated with every possible bipolar pacing pair tested. The report may further warn of possible anodal capture for any specific bipolar vectors found to have abnormal CTs closer to a mean CT computed for the anode of the bipolar vector than to a mean CT computed for the cathode of the bipolar vector. Any candidate cathode having all normal CTs for every bipolar vector tested may be indicated as a recommended cathode for therapy delivery and avoidance of anodal capture.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram of a configuration <b>600</b> for detecting anodal capture during bipolar pacing using evoked response sensing. Bipolar pacing is delivered along a vector <b>610</b> between a candidate cathode electrode <b>601</b> and candidate anode electrode <b>603</b>. ER sensing is performed at both the cathode <b>601</b> and the anode <b>603</b> using a third indifferent electrode <b>602</b>. In other embodiments, ER sensing performed at the cathode <b>601</b> and at the anode <b>603</b> may use separate indifferent electrodes for sensing the local ER at the respective electrode <b>601</b> or <b>603</b>, rather than a shared indifferent electrode as shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart <b>700</b> of a method for detecting anodal capture during bipolar pacing using ER sensing at both the candidate cathode and anode as generally depicted in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At <b>702</b>, the anodal capture test is initiated. A candidate bipole is selected at block <b>704</b>, and bipolar pacing is delivered at block <b>706</b>. An ER is sensed at both the cathode electrode and the anode electrode at block <b>708</b>. A time interval to the ER signals is determined at block <b>710</b>. The timing of the evoked responses relative to a delivered pacing pulse can be the timing of a sense amplifier output or the timing of a feature in the digitized EGM signal, such as the maximum amplitude or slope or other features listed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">At block <b>712</b>, the anodal ER time is compared to the cathodal ER time. If an ER is sensed at the anode earlier than at the cathode, anodal capture is detected at block <b>720</b>. If the ER signals are sensed substantially simultaneously, as determined at block <b>714</b>, simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture is detected at block <b>718</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">If the ER is sensed earlier at the cathode than at the anode, cathodal capture is detected at block <b>716</b>. Anodal capture is not detected. The candidate bipole may be selected as a bipolar pacing pair for therapy delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">If simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture is detected and/or if anodal capture is detected, the anodal and cathodal capture thresholds may be determined at block <b>722</b> and <b>724</b>, respectively. In one embodiment, the pacing pulse amplitude is adjusted until an ER signal within a predetermined time interval of the pacing pulse disappears. The lowest pacing pulse amplitude at which the ER occurs at a given electrode within a predetermined time interval is determined as the capture threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">If the cathodal capture threshold is within a narrow range of the anodal capture threshold, such as within a pacing safety margin, as determined at block <b>726</b>, an anodal capture warning is withheld at block <b>730</b>. Since pacing will generally occur at a pacing safety margin above a capture threshold, anodal and cathodal capture thresholds falling within a safety margin of each other will generally result in simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture. Simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture may be acceptable in many pacing therapies making an anodal capture warning unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If the capture threshold is substantially higher at the cathode than at the anode, anodal stimulation only may occur for a range of pacing pulse amplitudes. An anodal capture warning is generated at block <b>728</b> if the cathodal capture threshold is not within a predetermined narrow range, for example within a pacing safety margin, of the anodal capture thresholds as determined at block <b>726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart <b>800</b> of a method for detecting and discriminating anodal, cathodal and simultaneous anodal and cathodal capture during bipolar pacing. At block <b>802</b> the anodal capture test is started for a selected bipole and begins by performing an analysis of CT at block <b>804</b> by measuring a control, bipolar and test CT as described previously. If anodal capture is not suspected based on the CT measurements, as determined at decision block <b>806</b>, cathodal capture is detected at block <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">If anodal capture is suspected at block <b>806</b>, the ER is measured at the anode and the cathode of the candidate bipole during bipolar pacing at block <b>812</b>. If an ER is sensed earlier at the anode than at the cathode, as determined at decision block <b>814</b>, the suspected anodal capture is confirmed and a warning is generated at block <b>818</b>. If the ER does not occur earlier at the anode than at the cathode, an abnormal CT may be reported at block <b>816</b>. The ER measurements do not support anodal capture detection, but an unexpected bipolar CT may be reported to allow a clinician to further evaluate the candidate bipole or alternative pacing bipoles.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the flow charts presented herein, it is recognized that all blocks shown may not be performed in some embodiments or may be performed in a different order than the order shown. For example, in some embodiments, CT, capture threshold data, and/or ER data, alone or in any combination, may be measured for all available electrode vectors to allow an optimal bipolar pacing vector to be selected. In other embodiments, anodal capture analysis data may be acquired for a desired bipolar vector and if anodal capture is not suspected based on the anodal capture analysis data, the bipolar vector may be selected without further testing. The various measurements described herein for discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture, such as CT measurements, capture threshold measurements, and ER time or morphology measurements may be performed in any combination.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Thus, an apparatus and method for discriminating between anodal and cathodal capture during bipolar pacing have been presented in the foregoing description with reference to specific embodiments. It is appreciated that various modifications to the referenced embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure as set forth in the following claims.</p>

<claim-text>delivering a second pacing pulse using the first cathode and a second anode;</claim-text>
<claim-text>measuring a first response to the first pacing pulse;</claim-text>
<claim-text>measuring a second response to the second pacing pulse;</claim-text>
<claim-text>detecting anodal capture of the heart chamber by the first pacing pulse at the first anode in response to a first difference between the first response and the second response;</claim-text>
<claim-text>switching the polarity of the first anode to a cathode;</claim-text>
<claim-text>delivering a third pacing pulse between the first anode switched to the cathode polarity and the second anode;</claim-text>
<claim-text>measuring a third response to the third pacing pulse; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>detecting anodal capture in response to the first difference being greater than a second difference between the first response and the third response.</claim-text>
