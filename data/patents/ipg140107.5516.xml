<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/341,538, filed Apr. 1, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to solar arrays and, in particular, to automatically obtaining information pertaining to a solar array.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Solar arrays generally comprise a plurality of photovoltaic (PV) modules deployed in a grid-style configuration, where one or more of the PV modules are coupled to one or more power converters, such as an inverter for inverting DC power from the PV modules to AC power. Information pertaining to the placement of each component within the array is required for efficient operation of the array, for example for generating a graphical depiction of the array for monitoring purposes or for dispatching a technician to address a problem with a particular PV module or inverter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">During installation and commissioning of solar arrays, installers often manually document required information for identifying the locations of the array components (e.g., PV modules, DC/DC converters, DC/AC inverters, DC/AC wiring connections, or solar trackers). For example, an installer may manually enter an identification (ID) number for a component into a chart that depicts the layout of the array; place a sticker with an ID number on a component and place a corresponding sticker indicating the ID number onto a sheet of paper arranged in the same layout as the array; or perform similar techniques for collecting and documenting the array layout information. Such methods of obtaining data pertaining to the physical arrangement of components in an array are tedious and prone to human error.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for efficiently managing data pertaining to an installation layout.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a method and apparatus for managing installation information. In one embodiment the method comprises obtaining, via an installation application on a mobile device comprising at least one processor, identification information for at least one component of an installation; obtaining, via the installation application, position information for the at least one component; and generating, via the installation application, a template for indicating a physical layout of at least a portion of the installation based on the identification information and the position information.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step <b>410</b>, the installation application automatically logs into a central website for solar array management (e.g., the website <b>122</b>) based on the user profile information. In some alternative embodiments, the installation application may perform such login at any time during execution of the method <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The method proceeds to step <b>414</b>, where a determination is made whether the solar array installation is a new installation. In some embodiments, the installation application may make such a determination based on an input entered by the installer (e.g., a project number), site information pertaining to the location of the solar array (e.g., an address entered by the installer or GPS coordinates obtained automatically by the mobile device), or the like. If at step <b>414</b> it is determined that the installation is a new installation, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At step <b>418</b>, a determination is made whether to document solar system information utilizing a predefined array layout template or whether to create a new array layout template. In some alternative embodiments, an array layout template is not utilized at all and the obtained solar system information may just be stored, for example, in a list format. In other alternative embodiments, the installation application may automatically build the array layout template based on position information obtained during scanning of the solar array components; in some such embodiments, the installer may select whether the template should be portrait or landscape, whether the template pattern should be aligned or brick, or similar criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As previously described, the array layout template depicts the physical layout of solar array components; for example, the template may have a grid format where each cell within the grid represents a position of a PV module/inverter within the solar array. If, at step <b>418</b>, it is determined that a new array layout template is to be created, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>420</b> to create the array layout template, for example by specifying planned and/or existing characteristics of the physical layout of the solar array, such as number of rows and columns, portrait or landscape, whether the solar array pattern is aligned or brick, PV module make and/or model, PV module physical size and/or aspect ratio, or the like. The array layout template may be viewed on a display screen of the mobile device (e.g., in portrait or landscape mode). The method <b>400</b> proceeds from step <b>420</b> to step <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If, at step <b>418</b>, it is determined that a predefined array layout template should be utilized, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>422</b>. At step <b>422</b>, predefined array layout templates, or indicia for such templates, may be displayed on the mobile device and, at step <b>424</b>, a particular layout is selected. Different template layouts may comprise different numbers of rows and/or columns; different alignments, such as portrait or landscape; different patterns, such as aligned or brick; different PV module characteristics, such as make, model, physical size, aspect ratio, and the like; or other information and/or characteristics pertaining to a solar array layout. Alternative to steps <b>422</b> and <b>424</b>, a predefined array layout template specific to the solar array installation may be retrieved (e.g., from a database of the mobile device or downloaded from the central website). Such a predefined array layout template may have been previously created, for example during a site evaluation of the solar array site, and may be retrieved, for example, based on data the installer manually enters into the mobile device (e.g., a project number, an address), GPS coordinates automatically determined by the mobile device (i.e., when the installer is at the site), or similar information. The method <b>400</b> proceeds from step <b>424</b> to step <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If, at step <b>414</b>, it is determined that the solar array installation is not a new installation, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>416</b>. At step <b>416</b>, existing information pertaining to the solar array installation is obtained, for example, from a database of the mobile device or downloaded from the central website. Such existing solar array installation information may include a partially populated solar array layout template, site information, or the like. The installation application may retrieve the existing solar array installation information based on an input entered by the installer (e.g., a project number, an address, or the like), GPS coordinates automatically determined by the mobile device (i.e., when the installer is at the site), or similar information. The method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At step <b>426</b>, a determination is made whether components for the solar array installation (e.g., PV modules, inverters, an array controller, or the like) are to be scanned to obtain corresponding identification information. If the result of such determination is yes, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>428</b> where the components are scanned to obtain the identification information. Such identification information may include serial numbers, part numbers, assigned identification (ID) numbers, or similar information, and is utilized to populate the array layout template for identifying specific components within the array. In some polyphase embodiments where one or more inverters are each coupled to one or more phases of AC power, phase information may additionally be obtained for identifying those phases to which each inverter is coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, a PV module, inverter, or array controller may be scanned by using the mobile device to optically read an identification tag, such as a label on the component; for example, a barcode label may be read by a barcode reader of the mobile device, or a label having identification characters may be read by an ID reader of the mobile device. Alternatively, an identification tag (e.g., a radio frequency identification, or RFID, tag) may be coupled to a component to wirelessly communicate the identification information to the installation application when the mobile device is proximate the component. Identification tags for conveying the identification information may be previously placed on/coupled to the solar array components (e.g., during manufacturing) or placed on/coupled to the solar array components as part of the installation process.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, identification information obtained from an inverter may additionally comprise one or more identifiers for a PV module or modules coupled to the inverter. In some such embodiments, if an inverter is coupled to two or more PV modules, the identification information obtained may comprise identifiers for each of the coupled PV modules; alternatively, the identification information may comprise a single PV module identifier and the installation application determines that the inverter is coupled to multiple PV modules based on the PV module identifier. In other embodiments, identification information obtained from a PV module may additionally comprise one or more identifiers for an inverter coupled to the PV module.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The identification information obtained by scanning the solar array components is utilized to populate the array layout template. In some embodiments, a cell within the template is manually selected, for example by touching the cell within the template displayed on the mobile device screen, the component (or group of components, such as a PV module/inverter pair) installed at the complementary position within the solar array is scanned, and the obtained identification information populates the cell. In other embodiments, the component may be scanned first and then the corresponding cell within the template is manually selected and populated with the obtained identification information. In still other embodiments, the installation application automatically determines a cell to be populated. For example, the installation application may automatically populate a particular cell based on previously populated cells and motion data indicating a direction of motion of the mobile device (e.g., motion data obtained from an accelerometer of the mobile device). In yet other embodiments, the installation application may automatically generate and populate an array layout template subsequent to scanning the array components; for example, the installation application may create the populated template based on position information and/or motion data obtained while scanning the installed array components.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition to identification information, position information for the array components, such as an absolute position based on a fixed coordinate system, may be populated in the array layout template for identifying specific locations of the array components. For example, GPS coordinates may be obtained by a GPS module of the mobile device when the mobile device is proximate an installed component (e.g., while scanning the component), and such absolute position information may be added to the corresponding cell in the array layout template. In some alternative embodiments, identification information and absolute position information (e.g., GPS coordinates) for the solar array components are obtained and associated to one another such that a representation of the physical layout of the solar array may be determined and used to populated an array layout template at a later time.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, the populated array layout template provides a source of relative position information for the solar array components within the solar array.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, phase information may be used in populating the array layout template.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The method <b>400</b> returns from step <b>428</b> to step <b>426</b> until, at step <b>426</b>, it is determined that there are no additional solar array components to be scanned for the solar array installation. The method <b>400</b> then proceeds to step <b>432</b>, where a determination is made whether to associate the array layout template with site information pertaining to the solar array installation site. Such site information may include an address or GPS coordinates; a map; a rendered drawing, photograph or other imagery; or the like. In some embodiments, the mobile device may comprise an application for obtaining a map, photograph, or other imagery of the solar array site from a third-party website, such as a satellite imagery website.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If, at step <b>432</b>, it is determined that no association needs to be made, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>438</b>; if, at step <b>432</b>, a determination is made to associate the array layout template with the site information, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>434</b>, where the site information is obtained. In some embodiments, the site information may be manually entered into the mobile device by the installer; for example, the installer may enter an address of the site location. Additionally or alternatively, the site information may be automatically obtained by the installation application. For example, the installation application may utilize GPS coordinates of the solar array to retrieve the site information from a database of the mobile device; download the site information from the central website; or retrieve the site information from a third-party website (e.g., a satellite imagery website).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>436</b>. At step <b>436</b>, the installation application associates the array layout template with the desired site information. In some embodiments, the installer may specify which site information to associate with the array layout template. For example, an address of the solar system location and/or a project number may be associated with the solar array layout template; the solar array layout template may be overlaid onto an aerial photograph of the solar array site; or other similar associations may be created. The method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>438</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>438</b>, a determination is made whether to obtain any additional information pertaining to the solar array installation. If the result of such determination is no, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>442</b>; if the result of the determination is yes, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>440</b>, where the additional information is obtained. For example, in some embodiments the mobile device may comprise one or more sensors for determining azimuth and/or tilt information, and the installation application may determine the azimuth and/or tilt for the solar array when the mobile device is held proximately aligned with the solar array. The method <b>400</b> then proceeds to step <b>442</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>442</b>, a determination is made whether to upload data (i.e., some or all of the solar system information) to the central website. If the result of such determination is no, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>446</b>; if the result of such determination is yes, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>444</b>. At step <b>444</b>, the desired data is uploaded from the mobile device to the central website. The data may be uploaded wirelessly from the mobile device; by coupling the mobile device to a computer that is coupled (wirelessly or wired) to a communications network; or by coupling the mobile device to a master controller that comprises the central website. In some embodiments, the installer may select which data to upload. In other embodiments, all of the data collected during execution of the method <b>400</b> may be uploaded. In some alternative embodiments, data is uploaded to the central website in real-time as it is collected or periodically during the collection.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>446</b>. At step <b>446</b>, a determination is made whether to save data (i.e., some or all of the solar system information), for example at a database of the mobile device and/or at the central website. If the result of such determination is no, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>450</b>; if the result of such determination is yes, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>448</b>. At step <b>448</b>, the desired data is saved, for example, as specified by the installer. In some alternative embodiments, data is saved to the mobile device and/or central website in real-time as it is collected or periodically during the collection. The method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At step <b>450</b>, a determination is made whether to continue. If the result of such determination is yes, the method <b>400</b> returns to step <b>414</b>. If the result of such determination is no, the method <b>400</b> proceeds to step <b>460</b> where it ends.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some alternative embodiments, the steps of the method <b>400</b> may be performed in a different order. For example, site information for the solar array site may be obtained upon login to the central website; login to the central website may be performed subsequent to scanning all of the solar array components; or a predefined array layout template may have previously been associated with (e.g., overlaid on) an aerial photograph of the site.</p>
