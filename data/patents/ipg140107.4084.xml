<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">(A) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a multi-dimensional data registration integrated circuit for driving array-arrangement devices, and more particularly, to a multi-dimensional integration and multi-task chip for driving a large microelectronic array system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">(B) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a traditional two-dimensional address selection circuit for driving 25 nozzles of a printhead. A two-dimensional address selection circuit <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of address selection lines A<b>1</b>-A<b>5</b> and a plurality of data lines D<b>1</b>-D<b>5</b>. A plurality of array-arrangement control units <b>11</b> are at the intersections of the plurality of address selection lines A<b>1</b>-A<b>5</b> and the plurality of data lines D<b>1</b>-D<b>5</b>. Each of the control units <b>11</b> comprises a transistor <b>111</b> and a resistor <b>112</b> for controlling a corresponding nozzle (not shown) to shoot a micro-scale ink droplet. When a transistor <b>111</b> is turned on by its connected address selection line, the data line connected to the transistor <b>111</b> supplies the resistor <b>112</b> connected to the transistor <b>111</b> with a pulse voltage. A bubble is generated through the pulse voltage, and a microdroplet is forced out of a corresponding nozzle by the bubble. G<b>1</b>-G<b>5</b> in this figure represent ground terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The printing technology of inkjet printers is continuously improving, because the requirements for high printing quality and resolution continue to increase. As ink droplet sizes are reduced, higher printing resolution of inkjet printers becomes feasible. However, the printing speed is reduced if only the resolution is improved. Most current inkjet printheads utilize the two-dimensional address selection circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to directly drive their nozzle arrays to shoot micro ink droplets. When higher printing speed and greater resolution is needed, the driving time should be reduced and more nozzles have to be simultaneously controlled. Unfortunately, the aforesaid two-dimensional driving circuit or one-dimensional driving circuit limits the printing speed and allowable printhead number. For simultaneously improving both printing speed and resolution, more nozzles have to be provided on a single printhead chip. However, it appears that the two-dimensional driving circuit or one-dimensional driving circuit cannot satisfy such requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The aforesaid technology can also be applied to drive array-arrangement thermal-optical switches, and the thermal-optical switches can control resistors to generate heat through direct current in current development. When the current passes the resistor-type heater ring, the metal film of the ring becomes hot, and the heat distribution of the branches of the waveguide changes. Accordingly, the refraction indexes of the waveguide under the heater ring change. Therefore, the optical couple can be direct from the main of the waveguide to the destination branch of the waveguide, hence the optical switches can be specified to open or close. However, such a system of thermal-optical switches cannot satisfy the requirements for large amounts of data to be transmitted, stored, exchanged and processed at high speed. Because the number of the thermal-optical switches is great, driving the resistors through direct current causes low reliability, low switch speed and temperature instability of the resistors.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, many additional external pads are needed when the number of the thermal-optical switches arranged in an array is increased. Consequentially, the cost and failure rate of the package are increased. For example, an array comprising 300 thermal-optical switches needs 302 external pads. It is necessary for each of these external pads to have a good electrical connection with an external driving circuit board. However, if any of the external pads does not have a good electrical connection, the corresponding thermal-optical switches will fail to normally operate so that the designated paths of the waveguide cannot be heated. That is, the optical coupling effects cannot be passed from the main of the waveguide to the branch of the waveguide. If the number of external pads can be reduced and the same number of the thermal-optical switches still can be controlled, the aforesaid problems can be resolved.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following will demonstrate the present invention using the accompanying drawings to clearly present the characteristics of the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic diagram of a multi-dimensional data registration integrated circuit for driving array-arrangement devices in accordance with the present invention. In this figure, D<sub>1,1</sub>, D<sub>1,2</sub>, . . . , D<sub>N,M </sub>represent a plurality of first hierarchy sets in which a plurality of array-arrangement devices are divided. Each of the first hierarchy sets comprises partial array-arrangement devices to be driven. Referring to numeral references <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each device can be an assembly of switches such as a transistor and a resistor. In addition to the previous assembly, an alternative assembly comprises a resistor and a thermal-optical switch. S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, . . ., S<sub>N+M </sub>represent first hierarchy address selection signals, which can scan and select the plurality of first hierarchy sets D<sub>1,1</sub>, D<sub>1,2</sub>, . . ., D<sub>N,M </sub>to be activated. A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, . . . , A<sub>N+M </sub>represent second hierarchy address selection signals, which can scan and select the second hierarchy sets d<sub>1,1</sub>, d<sub>1,2</sub>, . . . , d<sub>N,M </sub>of the activated first hierarchy set. Each of the second hierarchy sets comprises fewer partial array-arrangement devices, which can also be the devices located in one row or one column. When one of the second hierarchy sets is selected by the second hierarchy address selection signal to be activated, data signals P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . , P<sub>N+M </sub>are written into the corresponding devices of the activated second hierarchy set.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Similarly, the second hierarchy set can be further divided into a plurality of third hierarchy sets. Each of the third hierarchy sets comprises partial array-arrangement devices, which can also be the devices located in one row or one column. In this embodiment, a set of third hierarchy address selection signals is needed. One of the third hierarchy sets is selected by the third hierarchy address selection signal to be activated, and data signals P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . , P<sub>N+M </sub>are written into the corresponding devices of the activated third hierarchy set.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a configuration diagram of a multi-dimensional data registration integrated circuit in accordance with the present invention. A multi-dimensional data registration integrated circuit <b>20</b> comprises a first hierarchy address selection circuit <b>22</b>, a second hierarchy address selection circuit <b>21</b>, a data supply circuit <b>23</b>, and a level shift register circuit <b>24</b>. The first hierarchy address selection circuit <b>22</b> generates the first hierarchy address selection signals S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, . . . , S<sub>N+M</sub>, the second hierarchy address selection circuit <b>21</b> generates the second hierarchy address selection signals A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, . . . , A<sub>N+M</sub>, and the data supply circuit <b>23</b> generates the data signals P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, . . . , P<sub>N+M</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If a resistor R<sub>x,y </sub>is designated to generate heat, the corresponding first hierarchy address selection signal, second hierarchy address selection signal and data signal are simultaneously at a high level or an active level. For example, when the designated resistor R<sub>x,y </sub>is R<sub>1,1</sub>, the signals S<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and P<sub>1 </sub>are at the active level. The signal S<sub>1 </sub>turns on the transistor T<sub>s1</sub>, and simultaneously a transistor <b>222</b> is turned off by an inverter <b>221</b>. When the transistor <b>222</b> is inactive, the second hierarchy address selection signal cannot pass transistors T<sub>s2</sub>, T<sub>s3</sub>, . . . , T<sub>sn </sub>even if they are turned on by the first hierarchy address selection signal. Instead, the second hierarchy address selection signals A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, . . . , A<sub>N+M </sub>are input into the level shift register circuit <b>24</b> through the transistor T<sub>s1</sub>, and the level shift register circuit <b>24</b> sequentially outputs and scans the second hierarchy sets d<sub>1,1</sub>, d<sub>1,2</sub>, . . . , d<sub>N,M </sub>of the first hierarchy set D<sub>1,1</sub>, arranged in an array. Because the signals S<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, and P<sub>1 </sub>are simultaneously at an active level and the transistor T<sub>s1 </sub>is opened, the resistor R<sub>1,1</sub>, through which the circuit of the signal P<sub>1 </sub>passes, generates heat.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention proposes an aspect of multi-dimensional data registration to reduce the number of external terminals. Data are separately and sequentially output in a multiplex manner, and a large number of microelectronic devices arranged in an array are controlled. Furthermore, asymmetric MOS (Metal Oxidation Semiconductor) devices and CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxidation Semiconductor) devices are employed, and the corresponding process technology is also introduced in fabricating such a novel circuit. The present invention utilizes asymmetric MOSFET (Metal Oxidation Semiconductor Field Emitting Transistor) devices or CMOSFET devices, and integrates such devices to form a logic sequential multi-task control circuit for address selection applied to a thermal-optical switch array device or the nozzle array of a printhead chip.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention provides a multi-dimensional data registration integrated circuit for driving array-arrangement devices. The invention utilizes multi-dimensional decoding to reduce the required number of external terminals. For example, N is designated as the number of external terminals, and Y is the number of nozzles; if the multi-dimensional data registration is employed, the number of external terminals is expressed as N=3&#xd7;&#x221a;{square root over (Y)}+1. As to the conventional two-dimensional data registration circuit, the number of external terminals is expressed as N=3&#xd7;&#x221a;{square root over (Y)}+1. The present invention can not only reduce the number of external terminals but also simplify the corresponding driving circuit. Therefore, the manufacturing cost is reduced. The following table shows the relation between the number of external terminals and the number of nozzles. If a conventional 600 dpi inkjet printhead has 1024 nozzles, at least 65 external terminals are needed using the prior art. By contrast, using the method according to the present invention, only 31 external terminals are needed. Compared to the prior art, the present invention can control a greater number of nozzles with the same number of external terminals so as to have the advantages of high resolution and fast printing speed.</p>
