<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus for applying movement to the joints of a human patient is provided. The apparatus includes an exoskeleton assembly with segments that can be secured to the patient. One or more motor modules are removably coupled to a supporting structure of the exoskeleton assembly, and each motor module includes multiple motor drives. A plurality of actuating members is operatively connected to each motor module. A first end of each actuating member is connected to one of the motor drives and a second end of each actuating member is coupled to a segment of the exoskeleton assembly. Each actuating member can be driven by a respective motor drive to impart movement in multiple degrees of freedom to individual joints.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention, in general, relates to power assisted therapeutic devices. More specifically, the invention relates to an apparatus for manipulating joints of a limb of a patient.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Healthy working joints are of utmost importance in providing functional use of limbs and ultimately independence in an individual's life. The loss of joint functions result is a severe compromise of the ability to feed and care for oneself, and limits one's participation in work, social, and family life. Several injuries, diseases, and neurological disorders causing deformations of a limb or digits of the limb may result in loss of joint functions. These include paralysis (from central or peripheral nerve injuries), swelling, joint stiffness, pain, burns, scarring or broken bones. Such deformations often inhibit muscular, structural, or neurological functions of the limb or the digits of the limb, resulting in an individual's inability in carrying out day-to-day activities. Such individuals, who are recovering from problems affecting the limb, need vigilant, appropriate and effective therapy of the limbs, to improve the outcome of the healing process significantly and the restoration of joint functions. Therefore, in order to recuperate the probability of mobility in a deformed limb including loss of joint range of motion, physicians often advise practicing Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">CPM is a form of therapy commonly prescribed for assisting the optimal healing of joints and connective tissue following damage and pathology. CPM therapy is often prescribed and used for rehabilitating larger joints such as, the knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow and hip to achieve positive results. It is easier to administer CPM therapy to singular, large joints that can be isolated. However, for rehabilitating small multiple joints of the hand, although CPM therapy has been proven beneficial, the therapy is seldom prescribed or used. Typically, CPM devices allow manipulation of the digits.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, effective control over phalanx sections of the digits, ensuring safe and consistent delivery of controlled manipulation and forces to multiple joints at the same time, is essential in order to achieve good results with CPM. Further, an individual requiring rehabilitation of limbs requires ease of attachment of CPM devices to fingers, address each joints individually, and the ability of sensing digit flexibility. Hence, the therapeutic device for manipulating the digits of the limb needs a safety feature for preventing over delivery of forces to the digits of the limb, thereby averting rupture of a digit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for an apparatus to manipulate joints of a limb of a patient in a more controlled, safe and effective manner. There is also a need for the apparatus to enable independent manipulation of each limb segment.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Pursuant to various embodiments disclosed herein, the invention provides an apparatus for manipulating joints of a limb of a patient. The limb of the patient comprises a plurality of limb segments. Each limb segment of the plurality of limb segments connects one or more joints. The apparatus includes one or more motor modules removably coupled to a supporting structure configured on the limb. Each motor module includes a plurality of motor drives.

A first end of each actuating member is operatively connected to a motor drive of a motor module and a second end is removably coupled to an exoskeleton segment of the plurality of exoskeleton segments. Each actuating member is driven by a motor drive operatively connected to each actuating member thereby transmitting push and pull forces to a limb segment associated with each actuating member. Thus, each of the plurality of limb segments is moved to independently manipulate the joints of the limb.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a disassembled view of an apparatus <b>100</b> for manipulating joints of a limb of a patient in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The limb may be for example, but not limited to a hand, a knee, a finger, an ankle, a shoulder, an elbow, a thigh, a forearm and so on. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a hand of a patient and apparatus <b>100</b> is shown as used for manipulating finger joints of the hand for purpose of ease in explanation. However, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that apparatus <b>100</b> may be utilized for manipulating any other limbs of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The limb of the patient comprises a plurality of limb segments. Each limb segment of the plurality of limb segments connects the one or more joints. For example, a limb segment i.e., a proximal phalanx of a finger or a digit connects a metacarpophalangeal joint and a proximal interphalangeal joint of the digit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Apparatus <b>100</b> is a therapeutic device used for performing tasks including, but not limited to, independently manipulating each joint of the limb of the patient according to established physiotherapeutic regimes, monitoring the patient's ability to move the limb, and providing functional power assistance to manipulate each joint of the limb to perform day-to-day activities.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Apparatus <b>100</b> includes a supporting structure configured on the limb of the patient. The supporting structure includes a splint support <b>105</b> and a splint pad <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, splint support <b>105</b> may be composed of a thermoplastic material. Further, splint pad <b>110</b> may be composed of a rubber material. The rubber material used for splint pad <b>110</b> may be for example, neoprene. However, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that splint support <b>105</b> and splint pad <b>110</b> may be composed of any other materials known in the art. Splint support <b>105</b> may be customized according to the shape of the limb. For example, splint support <b>105</b> may be formed using thermoplastic sheets. These thermoplastic sheets may be molded according to the shape of a hand, a wrist, and a forearm of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Splint pad <b>110</b> may be formed in predetermined universal sizes, for example, small, medium, and large. In an embodiment, splint pad <b>110</b> may include fastening members for securely configuring the support structure on the limb. Thus, splint pad <b>110</b> and splint support <b>105</b> may be securely configured on the limb using the fastening members.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Apparatus <b>100</b> also includes one or more motor modules such as, a motor module <b>115</b>, a plurality of manipulating exoskeleton assemblies such as, a manipulating exoskeleton assembly <b>120</b>, and a plurality of actuating members such as, an actuating member <b>125</b>. The one or more motor modules are mounted onto splint pad <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, in order to mount the one or motor modules onto splint pad <b>110</b>, a guide way <b>130</b> is provided. Guide way <b>130</b> is provided on an upper surface of splint pad <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A guide way such as, guide way <b>130</b> may be a continuous guide way as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the guide way may have different configurations such as, a guide hole. In this case, each motor module of the one or more motor modules may include a coupling member capable of coupling each motor module with guide way <b>130</b> to secure the one or more motor modules on splint pad <b>110</b>. For example, motor module <b>115</b> may be mounted on splint pad <b>110</b> by inserting a coupling member of motor module <b>115</b> into guide way <b>130</b> and moving the coupling member through guide way <b>130</b>. By moving the coupling member through guide way <b>130</b>, motor module <b>115</b> may be placed in an appropriate position on splint pad <b>110</b>. Each motor module is independent of another and mounted accordingly on splint pad <b>110</b>, thereby facilitating manipulation of each joints independently.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, a coupling member of a motor module of the one or more motor modules may be a stud arrangement (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this case, the stud arrangement of the motor module may interlock with guide way <b>130</b> to securely mount the motor module on splint pad <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the coupling member used for mounting the motor module on splint pad <b>110</b> may be a magnetic ball segment mount (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The magnetic ball segment mount provides an angular freedom for the motor module secured on splint pad <b>110</b>. The magnetic ball segment mount is explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each motor module of the one or more motor module includes a plurality of motor drives. Motor module <b>115</b> comprises a plurality of motor drives. Each motor drive independently manipulates a joint of the limb using the plurality of actuating members operatively connected to each motor module. The plurality of motor drives are set up in a stacked arrangement. In the stacked arrangement, a child motor drive is displaced by a parent motor drive thereby enabling a limb segment associated with the child motor drive to move with respect to a limb segment associated with the parent motor drive. In an embodiment, setting up the plurality of motor drives in a stacked arrangement involves arranging the plurality of motor drives in a nested fashion. The arrangement of the one or more motor drives in a nested fashion is explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In another embodiment, setting up the plurality of motor drives in a stacked arrangement involves arranging the plurality of motor drives in a pyramid fashion. The arrangement of the one or more motor drives in a pyramid fashion is explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each motor module of the one or more motor modules are connected to a manipulating exoskeleton assembly of the plurality of manipulating exoskeleton assemblies using the plurality of actuating members for manipulating a joint of the limb. Each manipulating exoskeleton assembly comprises a plurality of exoskeleton segments. Each exoskeleton segment of the plurality of exoskeleton segments is removably secured on a limb segment. For example, manipulating exoskeleton assembly <b>120</b> comprises an exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>1</b>, an exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>2</b> and an exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, an actuating member of the plurality of actuating members includes a first end and a second end. The first end of the actuating member may be connected to a motor drive of a motor module of the one or more motor modules. Whereas the second end of the actuating member may be connected to an exoskeleton segment of the plurality of exoskeleton segments.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Manipulating exoskeleton assembly <b>120</b> is connected to motor module <b>115</b> using the plurality of actuating members such as, actuating member <b>125</b>. Thus, plurality of actuating members may be operatively connected to exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>1</b>, exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>2</b> and motor module <b>115</b>. More specifically, a first end of actuating member <b>125</b> may be operatively connected to a motor drive of motor module <b>115</b>. A second end of actuating member <b>125</b> is removably coupled to an exoskeleton segment of the plurality of exoskeleton segments. The connection between a motor module, an actuating member and an exoskeleton segment is explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The actuating member of the plurality of actuating members may be a flexible thin gauge strip that transmits the push and pull forces required to manipulate each joints of the limb. In an embodiment, the actuating member may be composed of a highly pliable material with low or zero linear compressibility and linear expansion. For example, an actuating member may be composed of a metal alloy such as, Nitinol. Nitinol is composed of Nickel and Titanium. However, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that the actuating member may be composed of any other materials known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">During operation, each actuating member of the plurality of actuating members is driven by a motor module of the one or more motor modules, Thereafter, each actuating member transfers push and pull forces on a limb segment associated with each actuating member to the move the limb segment. For example, actuating member <b>125</b> may be operatively connected to exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>1</b>. Exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>1</b> may be removably secured on a distal phalanx segment of a digit of the hand. Then, actuating member <b>125</b> may apply push and pull forces on exoskeleton segment <b>135</b>-<b>1</b> upon being driven by motor module <b>115</b>. Consequently, the distal phalanx segment moves with respect to a distal interphalangeal joint of the digit based on the push and pull forces. Thus, the movement of actuating member <b>125</b> manipulates the distal interphalangeal joint. The motor module and the method of manipulating the joints of the limb using the motor module are further explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Apparatus <b>100</b> may further include a central control unit (CCU) (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for controlling the manipulation of the joints of the limb. The CCU may be mounted on splint pad <b>110</b> of the supporting structure. The CCU may be electronically coupled to each motor module of the one or more motor modules in order to control the one or more motor modules. The CCU is configured to assess and control the manipulation of a limb segment by measuring forces generated at a motor module while manipulating the limb segment and measuring displacement of the motor module while manipulating the limb segment. The CCU forces generated at the motor module may be measured using a plurality of force sensors. Further, the displacement of the motor drive during manipulation may be measured using a plurality of displacement sensors. The measurement of forces generated at a motor drive and displacement of the motor drive during manipulation using force sensors and displacement sensors, is further explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, the CCU provides a physiotherapeutic regime for manipulating the joints of the limb. The physiotherapeutic regime may be translated into a set of instructions. The CCU provides the set of instructions to each motor module such as motor module <b>115</b> for synchronously controlling movement of each joint of the limb. The movement of each joint of the limb enables flexing and extending the plurality of limb segments. The CCU is further configured to determine at least one of an absolute position, an absolute angular position, and range of manipulation associated with the limb segment during the manipulation of the limb segment. Additionally, the CCU also distributes power, sends control signals, logs data, and allows for manual intervention in manipulating the joints. Therefore, the CCU provides functional power assistance to manipulate each joint of the limb to perform day-to-day activities. In an embodiment, the CCU may incorporate a battery and a communication interface. Furthermore, apparatus <b>100</b> interacts with a computer system in order to upload and download data. For example, the CCU is connected to a personal computer for uploading a physiotherapeutic regime and downloading data associated with the patient. Thereafter, the CCU controls the one or more motor modules for manipulating the joints of the limb.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an inner view of motor module <b>115</b> including the plurality of motor drives enclosed therewithin in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Motor module <b>115</b> secured on the supporting structure delivers forces for manipulating joints of the limb of the patient. Motor module <b>115</b> includes a plurality of motor drives <b>202</b> that generates and delivers forces to each joints of the limb. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, plurality of motor drives <b>202</b> may include a motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>, a motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>2</b> and a motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b>. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that motor module <b>115</b> is shown to include three motor drives for purpose of description. However, motor module <b>115</b> may include more than three motor drives. Plurality of motor drives <b>202</b> may be arranged in different fashions for delivering the push and pull forces to each joints of the limb. This is explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each motor drive of the one or more motor drives may be operatively connected to an actuating member. The actuating member may have a first end and a second end. The actuating member may have the first end operatively connected to a motor drive of the one or more motor drives and the second end connected to an exoskeleton segment of a manipulating exoskeleton assembly. For example by considering the limb as a digit, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>1</b> may have a first end <b>204</b>-<b>1</b> operatively connected to motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> and a second end <b>206</b>-<b>1</b> connected to an exoskeleton segment disposed on a proximal phalanx of the digit. Similarly, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> may have a first end <b>204</b>-<b>2</b> (not shown) operatively connected to motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>2</b> and a second end <b>206</b>-<b>2</b> connected to an exoskeleton segment disposed on an intermediate phalanx of the digit. Further, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> may have a first end <b>204</b>-<b>3</b> (not shown) operatively connected to motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b> and a second end <b>206</b>-<b>3</b> connected to an exoskeleton segment disposed on a distal phalanx of the digit.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A motor drive of the plurality of motor drives may be operatively connected to an actuating member using a linear actuator for example. Thus, apparatus <b>100</b> may include a plurality of linear actuators. A linear actuator of the plurality of linear actuators is operatively connected to the motor drive of the plurality of motor drives. The linear actuator is also connected to the actuating member of the plurality of actuating members. The motor drive is capable of driving the linear actuator in a linear direction thereby enabling the actuating member to move in the linear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment, each motor drive of the one or more motor drives may have a linear actuator such as, a lead screw arrangement. The lead screw arrangement includes a lead screw based linear actuator and a nut operatively engaged with the lead screw based linear actuator. In an alternate embodiment, a rack and pinion type linear actuator may be used for operatively connecting a motor drive of the plurality of motor drives to an actuating member. The lead screw based linear actuator, hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;lead screw&#x201d;, is operatively connected to the motor drive at one end. Further, the actuating member is removably coupled to the nut. More specifically, a first end of the actuating member may be removably connected to the nut. When the motor drive operates, the lead screw rotates and converts the rotary motion into a linear motion. Thus, the nut linearly moves along the length of the lead screw. Consequently, the actuating member moves forward in a linear direction in response to the linear motion of the nut. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that apparatus <b>100</b> may include any other linear actuators known in the art operatively connected to the plurality of motor drives for moving the actuating members of apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, a lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> operatively connected to motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> may be driven by motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>. Lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> may rotate to move a nut <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> operatively connected to lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> in a linear direction. In response to the linear motion of nut <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>1</b> connected to nut <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> moves in a linear direction. Similarly, lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>2</b> may rotate to move a nut <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> operatively connected to lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>2</b> in a linear direction. In response to the linear motion of nut <b>210</b>-<b>2</b>, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> connected to nut <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> moves in a linear direction. Further, lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> may also rotate to move a nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> operatively connected to lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> in a linear direction. In response to the linear motion of nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b>, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> connected to nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> moves in a linear direction. During the movement of nut <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>, nut <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> and nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> in the linear direction, each of these nuts may not interfere with each other. For example, nut <b>210</b>-<b>1</b> may not interfere with nut <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> and similarly nut <b>210</b>-<b>2</b> may not interfere with nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once each of the actuating members, such as actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>1</b>, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>2</b> and actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> move in a linear direction, push and pull forces are applied on a manipulating exoskeleton assembly disposed on the respective phalanges of the digit. Thus, the digit curves or folds itself when the push and pull forces are applied on the digit. More specifically, joints of the digit, flex when the push forces are applied and extend when the pull forces are applied.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, each of the phalanges of the digit may be independently manipulated. For example, a motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b> drives lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> operatively connected to motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b>. In response, lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> rotates to move a nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> operatively connected to lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> in a linear direction. Thereafter, actuating member <b>125</b>-<b>3</b> connected to nut <b>210</b>-<b>3</b> moves in a linear direction to move the distal phalanx. Moving the distal phalanx by activating motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b>, in turn enables independent flexion and extension of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. While motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b> operates, motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>1</b> and motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>2</b> may remain idle or non-operative. Thus, the proximal phalanx or the intermediate phalanx does not move thereby achieving independent movement of the distal phalanx.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, each joint of a digit, i.e. metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint may also be manipulated independently. For example, motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>2</b> and motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b> operate together to move lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>2</b> and lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> in a linear direction. The linear movement of lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>2</b> and lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> causes the intermediate phalanx to flex, while the distal phalanx maintains a relative angle with respect to the intermediate phalanx. The movement of the intermediate phalanx, in turn enables independent flexion and extension of the PIP joint. Similarly, motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>1</b>, motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>2</b>, and motor drive <b>202</b>-<b>3</b> operate together to move lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>1</b>, lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>2</b>, and lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> in a linear direction. The linear movement of lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>1</b>, lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>2</b>, and lead screw <b>208</b>-<b>3</b> causes the proximal phalanx to flex, while the intermediate phalanx and the distal phalanx maintain a relative angle with respect to the proximal phalanx. Once the proximal phalanx moves, independent flexion and extension of the MCP joint is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While manipulating each limb segment of the limb, each motor drive of the plurality of motor drives experiences or generates forces. For example, while manipulating each phalanx segments of a digit, each motor drive associated with a phalanx segment experiences or generates forces. Therefore, each motor drive may have force sensors and displacement sensors to measure forces generated at each motor drive and displacement of each motor drive during manipulation. For example, in motor module <b>115</b>, a plurality of force sensors (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be coupled to a motor housing of a motor drive. A force sensor of the plurality of force sensors measures forces generated at the motor drive during manipulation of a limb segment associated with the motor drive. The force may be measured by determining a torque applied at the limb. For example, a strain gauge sensor may be operatively coupled to the motor housing of the motor drive using a set of sensor wires i.e., a flexible-printed-circuit. The strain gauge sensor measures forces generated at the motor drive during manipulation of the limb segment associated with the motor drive by determining a strain experienced on the motor housing by the forces generated or experienced at the motor drive. The forces measured at the strain gauge sensor are communicated to the CCU. The CCU then measures the forces generated at the motor drive to assess the manipulation of the limb segment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the plurality of displacement sensors may also be operatively coupled to the motor housing. A displacement sensor of the plurality of displacement sensors measures a linear displacement of the motor drive during manipulation of a limb segment associated with the motor drive. The linear displacement is measured to determine an angular position of the one or more joints of the limb. The linear displacement measurements determined may be communicated to the CCU. Then the CCU may determine an absolute displacement of the motor drive, an absolute force of the motor drive, an absolute angle between the joints of the limb, and an absolute torque applied at the limb using the linear displacement measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring back to motor module <b>115</b>, motor module <b>115</b> of the one or more motor modules is removably coupled to the supporting structure using a stud arrangement <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment, a magnetic ball segment mount is used for removably coupling motor module <b>115</b> to the supporting structure. Alternatively, a buckle arrangement may also be used for removably coupling motor module <b>115</b> to the supporting structure.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates motor drives of a motor module of the one or more motor modules arranged in a nested fashion as described in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a motor module <b>300</b> includes multiple motor drives configured in a nested fashion. More specifically, three motor drives such as, a motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>1</b>, a motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b>, and a motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> of motor module <b>300</b> may be arranged in a nested fashion. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that motor module <b>300</b> is shown to include three motor drives for purpose of ease of description. However, motor module <b>300</b> may include more than three motor drives or less than three motor drives depending on the requirements for manipulating the joints of the limb. Each motor drive of motor module <b>300</b> includes a linear actuator and a displacing component operatively coupled to the linear actuator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> is operatively connected to a linear actuator <b>304</b>. Further, motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> includes a linear actuator <b>306</b> and a displacing component <b>308</b> operatively connected to linear actuator <b>306</b>. Motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> includes a linear actuator <b>310</b> and a displacing component <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each motor drive in motor module <b>300</b> is displaced by a preceding motor drive in the nested arrangement of the motor drives due to a displacing component of each motor drive. For example, when motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> operates, linear actuator <b>304</b> operatively connected to motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> moves in a linear direction. Linear actuator <b>304</b> may be connected to displacing component <b>308</b> of motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b>. Thus, when linear actuator <b>304</b> moves in the linear direction, displacing component <b>308</b> moves to drive motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b>. Similarly, when motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> is driven, displacing component <b>312</b> of motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> is moved by linear actuator <b>306</b> of motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> thereby driving motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>3</b>. By way of another example, if motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>1</b> and a linear actuator <b>304</b> displace by 20 mm, a motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>2</b> and motor drive <b>302</b>-<b>3</b> may be displaced by 40 mm and 60 mm respectively, thereby all three motor drives may achieve maximum displacement. Thus, this nested arrangement of motor drives acts as a telescopic linear drive system by displacing each succeeding motor drive when a preceding motor drive is displaced.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates motor drives of a motor module <b>400</b> of the one or more motor modules arranged in a pyramid fashion as described in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.

Each motor drive of the plurality of motor drives may be cylindrically shaped and arranged in a pyramid fashion. However, it will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that each motor drive may have any other shape.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Motor module <b>400</b> further includes a linear actuator connected to each motor drive of the plurality of motor drives. In an embodiment, the linear actuator may include a lead screw and a nut. The lead screw is operatively engaged with a nut. The nut is inturn removably connected to a first end of a fluctuating member. For example, a lead screw <b>408</b> may be operatively connected to motor drive <b>402</b>. Lead screw <b>408</b> may be operatively engaged with a nut <b>410</b>. Nut <b>410</b> is removably connected to a first end of actuating member <b>125</b>. Nut <b>410</b> is guided along lead screw <b>408</b> in a linear direction in response to driving lead screw <b>408</b> by motor drive <b>402</b>. As nut <b>410</b> moves in a linear direction, actuating member <b>125</b> also moves in a linear direction. This is explained in detail in conjunction <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Nut <b>410</b> displaces a nut associated with a succeeding motor drive i.e., motor drive <b>404</b> thereby driving a lead screw <b>412</b> operatively connected to motor drive <b>404</b>. The nut connected to the lead screw is further explained in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a nut <b>500</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Nut <b>500</b> is operatively engaged with a linear actuator of the plurality of linear actuators. Nut <b>500</b> may be removably connected to an actuating member. During a linear motion of nut <b>500</b> with respect to the linear actuator, nut <b>500</b> may guide another similar nut connected to a neighboring linear actuator in apparatus <b>100</b>. In this case, each succeeding nut of apparatus <b>100</b> may be guided by a preceding nut and thus may not require any other external guidance while respective linear actuators move in the linear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Nut <b>500</b> includes a threaded hole <b>505</b> and a non-threaded hole <b>510</b>. Threaded hole <b>505</b> may be used to operatively engage the linear actuator with nut <b>500</b>. Whereas, non-threaded hole <b>510</b> acts a guide hole that receives the linear actuator operatively connected to a succeeding motor drive. Upon receiving the linear actuator, the linear actuator is slidably engaged with non-threaded hole <b>510</b>. In an embodiment, non-threaded hole <b>510</b> may include one or more entries in form of a ramp in order to provide a smooth guidance of a linear actuator of a succeeding motor drive. During operation, when a linear actuator corresponding to a motor drive drives a nut forward, the nut slides along a linear actuator corresponding to a neighboring motor drive, thereby guiding the neighboring motor drive.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Nut <b>500</b> further comprises a protruding member <b>515</b> and a screw hole <b>520</b>. Protruding member <b>515</b> and screw hole <b>520</b> enable nut <b>500</b> to be removably connected to a first end of an actuating member of the plurality of actuating members.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> illustrate a magnetic ball segment mount <b>600</b> for removably coupling a motor module of the one or more motor modules to the supporting structure. Magnetic ball segment mount <b>600</b> includes a first portion <b>605</b> and a second portion <b>610</b>. First portion <b>605</b> and second portion <b>610</b> may be composed of an Iron based material to attract magnetic force. First portion <b>605</b> is attached to a motor module of the plurality of motor modules whereas second portion <b>610</b> is removably connected to a guide way such as, guide way <b>130</b>. A magnet may be attached to a surface of first portion <b>605</b>. Magnetic ball segment <b>600</b> may further include a ball segment with an embedded magnet <b>615</b>. The ball segment may be attached to second portion <b>610</b>. The ball segment allows the motor module to have 10 degrees of freedom with respect to a center of the ball segment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, polarity of magnets in first portion <b>605</b> and second portion <b>610</b> are arranged in a manner that opposite poles face each other. For instance, north pole of a magnet attached to first portion <b>605</b> faces a south pole of a magnet attached to second portion <b>610</b>. Magnetic force between first portion <b>605</b> and second portion <b>610</b> secures the motor module to splint pad <b>110</b>. Moreover, the magnetic force between first portion <b>605</b> and second portion <b>610</b> provides a vertical holding force as well as an angular stability via surface friction. The vertical holding force and the angular stability facilitate in securing the motor module in guide way <b>130</b> provided on the surface of splint pad <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment, magnetic ball segment mount <b>600</b> provides a security release option that enables first portion <b>605</b> to detach from second portion <b>610</b> when the force experienced between first portion <b>605</b> and second portion <b>610</b> exceeds a predefined force threshold. The predefined force set for detaching first portion <b>605</b> and second portion <b>610</b> may be adjusted by altering a shape of the ball segment. In an embodiment, the predefined force threshold may be altered or set by a person using the CCU. In this case, the CCU may be equipped with a user interface and buttons for operating the CCU. Further, the predefined force threshold may be set in a time based fashion depending on a physiotherapeutic regime. Thus, the predefined force threshold may be automatically varied by the CCU based on the physiotherapeutic regime. For example, a value associated with a predefined force threshold may be set for a week and then the value may automatically change after one week.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Alternatively, the predefined threshold may automatically change based on the improvement shown in the limb movements of a patient. In this case, the CCU may assess the improvements in the limb movements and changes the predefined force threshold based on the improvements. For example, if the CCU experiences a force that exceeds the predefined force threshold force, it can either stop or reverse the direction of the force exerted by a motor drive.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an embodiment, a predefined horizontal force threshold and a predefined vertical force threshold may be set. The predefined horizontal force threshold indicates a limit associated with horizontal forces experienced at magnetic ball segment mount <b>600</b>.

In this case, first portion <b>605</b> may detach from second portion <b>610</b> upon exceeding these set thresholds. Further, the predefined horizontal force threshold and the predefined vertical force threshold may be reset to by altering the shape of the ball segment. For example, the predefined horizontal forces can be adjusted by altering the slope of the surface of the ball segment.

In an embodiment, an exoskeleton segment of the plurality of exoskeleton segments may be in a form of ringlet. However, the exoskeleton segment may have any other shape and configuration to enable the exoskeleton segment to be conveniently configured on a limb segment of the limb. Exoskeleton segment <b>705</b> includes an adhesive component <b>720</b> secured to a joint such as, a phalanx segment of the digit. Exoskeleton segment <b>705</b> is removably attached to adhesive component <b>720</b> thereby disposing exoskeleton segment <b>705</b> on the phalanx segment. Adhesive component <b>720</b> may be similar to a typical adhesive bandage secured onto a phalanx segment. Adhesive component <b>720</b> may have a rib component <b>725</b> mounted thereon.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Now referring to an exoskeleton segment of the plurality of exoskeleton segments, the exoskeleton segment may be connected to an actuating member. The actuating member may terminate at the exoskeleton segment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, an actuating member connected to exoskeleton segment <b>715</b> disposed on the phalanx segment such as, a proximal phalanx segment terminates at exoskeleton segment <b>715</b>. Whereas, an actuating member connected to exoskeleton segment <b>710</b> disposed on an intermediate phalanx segment passes through exoskeleton segment <b>715</b> and terminates at exoskeleton segment <b>710</b>. Therefore, exoskeleton segment <b>715</b> acts as guide to allow the actuating member connected to exoskeleton segment <b>710</b> to pass through. In an embodiment, exoskeleton segment <b>715</b> may include a slit to guide the actuating member to terminate at exoskeleton segment <b>710</b>.</p>

Each opposing side of flexure component <b>730</b> forms a virtual rotating axis replicating natural rotating axis of a phalanx segment of the digit. Size and position of flexure component <b>730</b> may be optimized in order for flexure component <b>730</b> to act in line with the natural rotating axis of a phalanx segment of the digit. Shape of flexure component <b>730</b> may be adapted to suit different characteristics, with respect to level of material pliability and shape to control degree of flexibility. Furthermore, flexure component <b>730</b> is soft molded to flex with zero elongation. Zero elongation in flexure component <b>730</b> is critical for precise delivery of forces to rotate a phalanx segment relative to another phalanx segment. Further, zero elongation in flexure component <b>730</b> enables delivering external rotary forces without opposing movements of external segments against the actual joints required to move.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an embodiment, parallel manipulator <b>900</b> is a triple strut drive module. Thus, parallel manipulator <b>900</b> may include three linear drives arranged in a cross link manner for facilitating the multiple degrees of freedom of movement for the metacarpal bone of the thumb. These three linear drives include a central drive <b>925</b> and two outer drives such as, a drive <b>930</b> and a drive <b>935</b>. Central drive <b>925</b> is fixed at first end <b>905</b> of parallel manipulator <b>900</b> and connected to a universal joint at second end <b>915</b> of parallel manipulator <b>900</b>. The universal joint allows central drive <b>925</b> to pitch and yaw about axis of central drive <b>925</b>. Each of the two outer drives is fixed at first end <b>905</b> and connected to a universal ball joint at second end <b>915</b>. Therefore, each of the two outer drives has 3 degrees of freedom, i.e., pitch, yaw, and roll. Further, each of the two outer drives may be linearly extendable. By controlling ratios of linear extension of each of the three linear drives, a range of angular movements is achieved at second end <b>915</b> with respect to first end <b>905</b>. Thus, the phalanx joints of the thumb can be manipulated in various angles and directions. Further, the cross-link arrangement of the three linear drives enables achieving the desired range of motion necessary for manipulating the phalanx joints of the thumb.</p>
