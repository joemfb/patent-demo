<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an electrical contact that includes a serration and a knurl pattern defined in an internal surface, more particularly, the electrical contact includes a serration that has outwardly angled sidewalls and a knurl pattern that has a plurality of recessed elements that contain an axial minor distance defined between a first pair of opposing, generally axial inner corners that is less than a major distance defined between a second pair of opposing inner corners.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known to use grooved serrations disposed in an interior surface of a terminal to enhance the mechanical and/or electrical connection between a wire cable that is attached to the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A number of conventional cross-sectional grooved serration profiles have been employed in the wiring art that include hardened teeth forms, irregular surfaces, saw tooth shapes, square or rectangular shapes, ridge-like tooth forms, and serrations with undercut sidewalls. Another type of conventional serration (<b>1</b>) defined in a terminal (<b>2</b>) used for aluminum cable wiring applications is shown in prior art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The serration (<b>1</b>) includes angular sidewalls (<b>3</b>) that respectively have a ramp angle &#x398;. The ramp angle &#x398; has an angular value of 84 degrees in relation to a plane (<b>4</b>) defined along a recessed surface (<b>5</b>) of the serration (<b>1</b>). With the ramp angle theta being 84 degrees the sidewalls (<b>2</b>) are angularly disposed at a corresponding draft angle &#x3b1; having an angular value of 6 degrees. The draft angle &#x3b1; facilitates the stamping of the serration (<b>1</b>) in the terminal (<b>2</b>) during the manufacturing process. The steep ramp angle &#x398;, however, may undesirably damage the wire strands of the aluminum cable when portions of the wire strands of the lead of the aluminum wire cable extrude into serration (<b>1</b>) when a crimp of the aluminum cable and the terminal (<b>2</b>) is formed. If a wire strand is nicked or cut while extruding in and filling the serration (<b>1</b>), this may undesirably reduce the surface area contact between the wire strand and the serration (<b>1</b>) which may undesirably increase the resistance of the crimp. Aluminum wire cable is becoming increasingly desired for use in motorized vehicular applications due to decreased weight and cost over similar copper-based wire cables. A vehicle using the aluminum wire cable may have less mass which may then desirably provide for increased fuel economy of the vehicle. A serration shape is desired that at least maintains or preferably enhances the mechanical and electrical properties in contrast to previously described conventional serrations of a crimp formed between the aluminum wire cable and the terminal that also allows for high-quality, high-speed manufacturing of the terminal from sheet metal stock.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, what is needed is an electrical contact that includes a serration having a serration shape that maintains or enhances the mechanical and electrical properties of a crimp connection formed between an aluminum wire conductor and the electrical contact that also allows for high-quality, high-speed manufacturing of the electrical contact.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the heart of the present invention is the discovery of a serration shape defined in an interior surface of an electrical contact that takes into consideration three factors in combination to allow for a high-quality, high-speed manufacturing of the electrical contact, or terminal. One factor is the desire to have a serration shape that decreases the chance for undesired nicks and cuts in the wire strands of the wire cable so there is decreased resistance within the crimp formed between the wire cable and the terminal. Less resistance means electrical current may flow more freely through the wire cable/electrical contact connection. A second factor is the desire that the serration shape be formed in a manner that allows material growth to occur to the terminal during the manufacturing process while still maintaining proper terminal alignment at downstream tooling stations during manufacture of the terminal in the terminal manufacturing die. Misalignment of the terminal in downstream tooling stations forms undesired terminal quality defects due to misalignment of other features manufactured in to the terminal. Certain cross-sectional serration shapes or a serration having too deep or too shallow of a depth may further increase the probability for misalignment in the terminal manufacturing die. A third factor is also a desire to produce a serration shape in conjunction with a desired knurl pattern that further enhances the mechanical and electrical properties of a crimp formed between the wire cable and the terminal in the same high-speed terminal manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one embodiment of the invention, then, an electrical contact includes a grooved serration defined in an interior surface of the electrical contact along at least a portion of a length of the electrical contact. The grooved serration has a depth from the interior surface to a recessed surface of the serration and further includes at least one sidewall disposed along the depth. The sidewall includes at least one section that angularly extends from the interior surface to a point on the sidewall recessed from the interior surface disposed along the depth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The angularly-sided grooved serration may also be formed in combination with a knurl pattern in the interior surface of the electrical contact. The knurl pattern includes rhomboid-shaped recessed elements. Each rhomboid-shaped recessed element in the knurl pattern has an axial minor distance.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An electrical connection system includes the electrical contact that contains the angularly-sided grooved serration and/or the knurl pattern having the rhomboid-shaped recessed elements. The electrical connection system may be associated with a cable harness used in a motorized vehicle application.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further features, uses and advantages of the invention will appear more clearly on a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, which is given by way of non-limiting example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Electrical contacts and attached wire cables are a mainstay of electrical systems disposed in motorized vehicles, trucks, boats and airplanes. As these transportation products continue to have strong market demand with consumers worldwide it is also increasingly desirable to manufacture these transportation products with less mass that may provide for desired increased fuel economy.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To this end, and in accordance with this invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a wire conductor, or wire cable <b>10</b> is disposed along a longitudinal axis A. Cable <b>10</b> has an insulative outer cover <b>12</b> and an aluminum-based inner core <b>14</b>. The term &#x201c;aluminum-based&#x201d; as used in this document herein is defined to mean pure aluminum or an aluminum alloy where aluminum is the main metal in the alloy. Outer cover <b>12</b> surrounds inner core <b>14</b>. Inner core <b>14</b> is composed of individual wire strands <b>16</b> that may be axially disposed in inner core <b>14</b> when inner core <b>14</b> is received in electrical contact <b>22</b>. Alternately, inner core may be constructed of a plurality of individual wire strands that are bundled and twisted together. When the wire strands are twisted and bundled together, the lead may be axially received into the electrical contact, but the twisted wire strands may not be axially disposed therein. Wire strands <b>16</b> are useful to provide flexation of cable <b>10</b> when cable <b>10</b> is installed in a wiring application (not shown), such as may be the case during the manufacture of a vehicle. Alternately, the inner core of the wire cable may be formed of a single, solid wire strand. An end portion (not shown) of outer cover <b>12</b> of cable <b>10</b> is removed to expose a portion of inner core <b>14</b>. Exposed portion of inner core <b>14</b> is a lead <b>18</b> of wire cable <b>10</b>. Lead <b>18</b> extends from an axial edge <b>20</b> of outer cover <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A copper-based terminal or electrical contact <b>22</b> includes a mating end <b>24</b> and an open wing end <b>28</b>. Alternately, the electrical contact may be formed from any electrically-conductive material. Wing end <b>28</b> receives lead <b>18</b> along axis A. Wing end <b>28</b> includes a pair of insulation wings <b>29</b> that are axially spaced apart from a pair of core wings <b>31</b>. Insulation wings <b>29</b> are disposed aft of core wings <b>31</b> along a base <b>21</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b> that receives wire cable <b>10</b>. The term &#x201c;copper-based&#x201d; as used in this document herein is defined to mean pure copper, or a copper alloy where copper is the main metal in the alloy. Electrical contact <b>22</b> may be received into a connector (not shown) that may include a plurality of electrical contacts (not shown) that are part of wiring harness (not shown) used in a vehicle (not shown) and the connector (not shown) may mate with a corresponding mating connector (not shown) used in the motorized vehicle. Mating end <b>24</b> contains a female box electrical contact <b>30</b> portion and as is known and used in the electrical contact and wiring arts. Female box contact <b>30</b> may be received into a corresponding male electrical contact (not shown), such as may be found in the corresponding mating connector (not shown) disposed in the vehicle (not shown). Female box contact <b>30</b> electrically joins an electrical signal carried on inner core <b>14</b> with another electrical circuit attached with the corresponding male receiving electrical contact. Alternately, the female mating end may be a male mating end and the electrical contact may comprise other additional sections disposed intermediate the wing and the mating end. Insulation wings <b>29</b> and core wings <b>31</b> respectively angularly extend outwardly away from base <b>21</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b>. Base <b>21</b> preferably has an arcuate shape in the neutral state. The neutral state of electrical contact <b>22</b> is the form of electrical contact <b>22</b> after initial construction and before a crimp connection <b>46</b> is formed, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Arcuate base <b>21</b> generally conforms to a shape of lead <b>18</b> when wire cable <b>10</b> is received in electrical contact <b>22</b>. Insulation wings <b>29</b> are configured to crimp to insulative outer cover <b>12</b> and core wings <b>31</b> are configured to crimp to lead <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Electrical contact <b>22</b> is chosen for a given electrical application such that wing end <b>28</b> is of a sufficiently large size to receive lead <b>18</b> and portion of outer cover <b>12</b> adjacent to lead <b>18</b> to allow for an effective crimp between electrical contact <b>22</b> and cable <b>10</b>. A core wing <b>31</b> is sized to sufficiently wrap around, cover, and engage against at least a portion of lead <b>18</b> when cable <b>10</b> is crimped to electrical contact <b>22</b>. Core wing <b>31</b> includes an interior surface, or abutting surface <b>36</b> that engages at least a portion of inner core <b>14</b> of lead <b>18</b> when cable <b>10</b> is crimped to electrical contact <b>22</b> to provide electrical connection between cable <b>10</b> and electrical contact <b>22</b>. Preferably, core wing <b>31</b> is sized to lead <b>18</b> so that a knurl pattern <b>44</b> engages the entire axial length of lead <b>18</b> when lead <b>18</b> is received in electrical contact <b>22</b> and a rearward edge <b>50</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b> is disposed adjacent to edge <b>20</b> of insulative outer cover <b>12</b> when crimp connection <b>46</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A fluid conformal coating <b>40</b> is disposed along at least an outer surface of lead <b>18</b> and an end <b>38</b> of lead <b>18</b>. Additionally, coating <b>40</b> is also applied over edge <b>20</b> and extends on to a portion of insulative outer cover <b>12</b> adjacent lead <b>18</b>. Thus, a seal covering <b>42</b> of fluid conformal coating <b>40</b> entombs lead <b>18</b> so as to provide a corrosion-resistant protective layer for lead <b>18</b> of cable <b>10</b> when wire cable <b>10</b> is received into wing end <b>28</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b>. &#x201c;Fluid&#x201d; is defined as &#x201c;being able to flow.&#x201d; Seal covering <b>42</b> may advantageously aid in the preventing the formation of galvanic corrosion in crimp connection <b>46</b>. The viscosity of coating <b>40</b> may be altered to allow coating <b>40</b> to properly flow onto cable <b>10</b> so as to achieve a sufficient thickness of coating <b>40</b> to completely cover at least the outside surface of lead <b>18</b>. Seal covering <b>42</b> of fluid conformal coating <b>40</b> may be applied to cable <b>10</b> by dripping, spraying, electrolytic transfer, and brush and sponge applications, and the like. One such seal covering is described in United States Publication No. 2011/0083324 entitled SEALED CRIMP CONNECTION METHODS filed on 16 Sep. 2010, which is incorporated by reference herein. Alternately, the lead may be configured to electrically and mechanically attach to the electrical contact being void of any applied fluid coating.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, electrical contact <b>22</b> includes knurl pattern <b>44</b>. Knurl pattern <b>44</b> is defined within abutting surface <b>36</b> of core wing <b>31</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b> along a portion of a length L of electrical contact <b>22</b>. Length L is axially disposed along axis A. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, when electrical contact <b>22</b> is attached to wire cable <b>10</b> to form crimp connection <b>46</b>, knurl pattern <b>44</b> engagingly contacts against at least the outer surface of lead <b>18</b>. Knurl pattern <b>44</b> may be formed, and stamped in to abutting surface <b>36</b> by using a die press, as is known in the electrical contact and wiring arts. Crimp connection <b>46</b> includes a seam <b>48</b> formed intermediate a rearward and forward edge <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> of core wing <b>31</b>. Crimp connection <b>46</b> is part of a wire assembly <b>49</b> that includes wire cable <b>10</b> and electrical contact <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Knurl pattern <b>44</b>, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, includes a plurality of elements <b>54</b> that extend along a floor <b>55</b> underlying abutting surface <b>36</b>. A recessed surface <b>60</b> of each element <b>54</b> is adjacently disposed to floor <b>55</b>. Floor <b>55</b> is spaced apart and recessed from abutting surface <b>36</b>. Raised portions <b>65</b> are disposed in-between the elements <b>54</b> and have a top planar surface <b>66</b> that is generally planar with the surrounding abutting surfaces <b>36</b>. Each of the plurality of elements <b>54</b> includes a plurality of sidewalls <b>61</b>. Edges <b>63</b> of respective elements <b>54</b> are formed at an interface between sidewalls <b>61</b> and top planar surfaces <b>66</b> of raised portions <b>65</b>. Each element <b>54</b> has a perimeter edge formed from a plurality of edges <b>63</b> that surround each element <b>54</b>. Each sidewall in the plurality of sidewalls <b>61</b> for each element in the plurality of elements <b>54</b> extends from recessed surface <b>60</b> in an inclined, angled direction towards top planar surface <b>66</b> and transition to top planar surface <b>66</b> such that edges <b>63</b> are formed. Thus, sidewalls <b>61</b> are inclined ramps when viewed in cross section, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Advantageously, plurality of inclined sidewalls <b>61</b> assist removal of the die from electrical contact <b>22</b> when knurl pattern is stamped. Preferably, the incline ramps of the sidewalls have draft angle that is an acute angle in relation to a plane defined perpendicular to floor <b>55</b>. Alternately, the plurality of sidewalls for each element in the plurality of elements may be disposed in a direction perpendicular to the floor. Recessed surface <b>60</b> for each element <b>54</b> is generally parallel with abutting surface <b>36</b> and with axis A. Raised portions <b>65</b> adjacently surround each element <b>54</b> in knurl pattern <b>44</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The top planar surfaces <b>66</b> of raised portions <b>65</b> transitionally communicate with the surrounding abutting surface <b>36</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Alternately, the planar top surfaces of the raised portions may be recessed so that the planar top surfaces are disposed intermediate the floor and the surrounding abutting surface. Edges <b>63</b> are effective to fracture the aluminum oxides disposed on lead <b>18</b> as crimp connection <b>46</b> is formed. The structure interrelationships of sidewalls <b>61</b>, edges <b>63</b>, and raised portions <b>65</b> are best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Floor <b>55</b> has a spaced, generally parallel relationship with abutting surface <b>36</b>. Each recessed surface <b>60</b> has a shape that includes a first pair of opposing, generally axial inner corners <b>56</b>. First pair of opposing inner corners <b>56</b> define a first, or axial minor distance x<sub>1 </sub>therebetween. A second pair of opposing inner corners <b>58</b> different from first pair of opposing inner corners <b>56</b> define a second, or major distance x<sub>2 </sub>therebetween. Major distance x<sub>2 </sub>has a bisecting, perpendicular relationship to minor distance x<sub>1</sub>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Axial minor distance x<sub>1 </sub>is less than major distance x<sub>2</sub>. Recessed surface <b>60</b> for each element <b>54</b> has a surface area that forms a rhombus shape. Alternately, the axial minor distance may be substantially axial with axis A and the major distance is perpendicular to the substantial axial minor distance. For each element <b>54</b>, first pair of axial opposing inner corners <b>56</b> respectively have an angular value that is greater than the angular value of the respective second pair of opposing inner corners <b>56</b>. Preferably, an inner corner of the first pair of axial opposing inner corners <b>56</b> has an obtuse angular value and an inner corner of the second pair of opposing inner corners <b>58</b> has an acute angular value, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In a further alternate embodiment, an inner corner of the first pair of axial opposing inner corners has an obtuse angular value that may be greater than 100 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>, a corresponding knurl pattern <b>70</b> is associated with a die of a die press (both not shown). The die press may be any kind of die press that is effective to produce knurl pattern <b>70</b> as is known and used in the electrical contact and wiring arts. To construct plurality of recessed elements <b>54</b> in knurl pattern <b>44</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b> raised rhomboid protrusions <b>71</b> of knurl pattern <b>70</b> are utilized on the die used in the die press. Grooves <b>72</b> surround each protrusion <b>71</b> in knurl pattern <b>70</b> disposed on the die. The die containing knurl pattern <b>70</b> is constructed from hardened metal that is harder than the electrical contact or terminal, such as using a hardened carbide steel. Grooves <b>72</b> preferably have a deeper depth than a depth of raised portions <b>65</b> of knurl pattern <b>44</b> as measured from floor <b>55</b>. Grooves <b>72</b> have a depth from the surface of the rhomboid protrusions <b>71</b> to a floor <b>73</b> in the die, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The knurl pattern <b>44</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b> is not in use when wire cable <b>10</b> is not attached, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Knurl pattern <b>44</b> of electrical contact <b>22</b> is in use when knurl pattern <b>44</b> engages lead <b>18</b> to form crimp connection <b>46</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Crimp connection <b>46</b> may be formed by a press as is known in the electrical contact and wiring arts. When crimp connection <b>46</b> is being formed, plurality of elements <b>54</b> are urged by a force as applied by the press to engage against aluminum lead <b>18</b> such that portions of aluminum lead <b>18</b> extrude into plurality of elements <b>54</b>. The edges <b>63</b> in the plurality of elements <b>54</b> in combination with the axial minor distance x<sub>1 </sub>and major distance x<sub>2 </sub>rhombus shape orientation further assist to break up the aluminum oxides along the entire outer surface of lead <b>18</b> of cable <b>10</b> so as to increase the electrical and mechanical robustness of crimp connection <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">While not limited to any particular theory, it has been observed, that using plurality of elements <b>54</b> having the orientation of axial minor distance x<sub>1 </sub>and major distance x<sub>2 </sub>assists to keep elements <b>54</b> open for a longer period of time during the crimping of electrical contact <b>22</b> to lead <b>18</b>. Portions of aluminum lead <b>18</b> extrude into elements <b>54</b> against recessed surfaces <b>60</b> so that elements <b>54</b> engagingly close against portions of the extruded aluminum lead <b>18</b> so that the voids, as previously discussed herein, do not occur. Because major axis distance x<sub>2 </sub>is perpendicular to lead <b>18</b>, a greater contact surface area for any particular wire strand <b>16</b> is more apt to have aluminum oxides disposed on individual wire strand <b>16</b> broken up and fractured while also being extruding into recessed elements <b>54</b>. A greater contact surface area of pure aluminum on at least an outer surface of lead <b>18</b> making mechanical and electrical contact with the surfaces <b>36</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>66</b> of knurl pattern <b>44</b> on core wing <b>31</b> ensures a more reliable and robust electrical connection. The greater surface area contact also results in enhanced mechanical interlock between lead <b>18</b> and core wing <b>31</b> that assists to maintain the robust electrical contact between lead <b>18</b> and electrical contact <b>22</b> in crimp connection <b>46</b>. This greater surface area contact between surfaces <b>36</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>66</b> and lead <b>18</b> is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 8</figref>. Thus, knurl pattern <b>44</b> advantageously allows for a maximum electrical and mechanical connection between lead <b>18</b> and electrical contact <b>22</b> when crimp connection <b>46</b> is formed. Moreover, it is also important that core wings <b>31</b> are crimped in a manner so that as crimp connection <b>46</b> is formed to a final state from the neutral state, core wing <b>31</b> maintains a generally arcuate form during the formation of crimp connection <b>46</b>. The final state of core wing <b>31</b> is when core wing <b>31</b> is formed in crimp connection <b>46</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Maintaining the arcuate form of core wing <b>31</b> during the crimping process allows elements <b>54</b> to bendingly remain sufficiently open for a longer time period such that portions of aluminum lead <b>18</b> extrude into elements <b>54</b> before elements <b>54</b> engagingly close partially to trap the extruded portions of aluminum lead <b>18</b> within the closed elements <b>54</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, as recessed elements <b>54</b> are formed in diagonal rows <b>67</b> when knurl pattern <b>44</b> is formed in abutting surface <b>36</b> of core wing <b>31</b>, the major distances x<sub>2 </sub>collectively cover the width of core wing <b>31</b> such that at least the entire surface area of lead <b>18</b> is impacted by plurality of elements <b>54</b> across the length and width of knurl pattern <b>44</b> on core wings <b>31</b> to ensure a robust electrical connection of wire cable <b>10</b> and electrical contact <b>22</b>. The perimeter edges of the elements <b>54</b> in knurl pattern <b>44</b> are effective to provide increased ability for knurl pattern <b>44</b> to fracture aluminum oxides on lead <b>18</b> when crimp connection <b>46</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It has been observed when crimp connection <b>46</b> is analyzed and core wings <b>31</b> are unwrapped from lead <b>18</b>, a substantial portion of knurl pattern <b>44</b> is left impressed in the outer surface of lead <b>18</b> of wire cable <b>10</b>. For many analyzed crimp connections, one hundred percent (100%) of the knurl pattern is left impressed on the leads of the respective wire cables.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternately, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a die employs pyramidal rhomboid-shaped protrusions <b>101</b> and associated adjacent grooves <b>102</b> may be utilized. Protrusions <b>101</b> each have a flattened truncated top. When the die employing pyramidal protrusions <b>101</b> and associated grooves <b>102</b> is used to stamp a recessed knurl pattern on the core wings and base of the electrical contact, a plurality of recessed pyramidal rhomboid-shaped elements is defined in the interior surface of the electrical contact. Each flattened truncated top is in each recessed pyramidal rhomboid-shaped element is disposed adjacent a floor of the interior surface of the electrical contact. The die of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is made from similar materials as the die of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> as previously discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to another alternate embodiment of the invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref>, an electrical contact <b>122</b> includes a single grooved channel <b>153</b> disposed forward of a knurl pattern <b>144</b> closer to forward edge <b>152</b> of core wing <b>131</b>. Elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref> that are similar to elements illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> have reference numerals that differ by 100. Channel <b>153</b> is disposed along a width of core wing <b>131</b> perpendicular to axis A&#x2032; similar to axis A and is defined in abutting surface <b>136</b>. Knurl pattern <b>144</b> is disposed closer to rearward edge <b>150</b> of core wing <b>131</b>. Knurl pattern <b>144</b> includes plurality of recessed elements <b>154</b>. Channel <b>153</b> includes angled sidewalls <b>157</b> that extend from abutting surface <b>136</b> to a planar recessed surface <b>159</b> of channel <b>153</b>. A plane is defined along recessed surface <b>159</b> that is parallel with abutting surface <b>136</b>. Angled sidewalls <b>157</b> form an inclined ramp from recessed surface <b>159</b> to abutting surface <b>136</b>. The inclined ramp of each sidewall <b>157</b> has a ramp angle &#x3b3; in relation to a floor <b>168</b>. Ramp angle &#x3b3; has an angular value in a range of an acute angle with a maximum value being less than 84 degrees. Having this acute angle value with a maximum value of less than 84 degrees is advantageous to minimize undesired damage to the wire strands during the crimping process for the malleable aluminum material while also ensuring a high-quality mechanical and electrical connection of the lead to the electrical contact. Preferably, the ramp angle &#x3b3; has a value that is in a range from 15 to 60 degrees. Even more preferably, the ramp angle &#x3b3; has a value that is in a range of 30 to 45 degrees. Correspondingly, the draft angle &#x3b2; has a value that is greater than 6 degrees. For any given application the fabrication of the electrical contact yields the ramp angle &#x3b3; when added or summed with the draft angle &#x3b2; totals 90 degrees in relation to floor <b>168</b>. Generally, the angular values for &#x3b3; and &#x3b2; would the same for each angular wall in the serration. Alternately, the values of &#x3b3; and &#x3b2; for each angular wall in the serration may have different values.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Channel <b>153</b> is in use when a lead of a wire conductor is received in the core wing and the aluminum wire conductor is crimped to the electrical contact as has been previously described herein for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>. Portions of the aluminum lead are pressured under the force of a die press to extrude laterally to fill channel <b>153</b>. It has been observed that the portions of aluminum lead substantially fill the grooved serration and engage against sidewalls and recessed surface when the crimp connection is formed. The inclined ramp sidewalls have been found to provide a more gradual transition for the aluminum lead extrusion into the serration to gain the desired mechanical strength for the crimp connection without damaging the wire strands of the wire conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It has been observed that the forward positioned serration, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in contrast to a rearward positioned serration, may be better suited to provide the desired growth of the terminal material when the serration and/or the serration/knurl pattern are impressed in the material stock by the stamp tooling since the growth that the stamp tooling imparts is not also further restrained by the stamp tooling. In addition, it has also been observed the combination of rhombic knurl pattern in combination with the single forward serration should cover a majority of the interior surface of the crimp wings for a maximized mechanical and electrical connection of the wire cable and the electrical contact while an amount of interior surface of the electrical contact that contains no rhombic knurl pattern and serration features should be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in another alternate embodiment, and electrical contact <b>222</b> has a serration <b>253</b> that includes sidewalls. The sidewalls include a vertical wall section <b>275</b> that transitions in to an angled wall section <b>257</b>. Angled wall portion <b>257</b> is disposed in an outbound direction from planar recessed surface <b>259</b> of serration <b>253</b>. Angled wall portion <b>257</b> extends from abutting surface <b>236</b> of electrical contact <b>222</b> downwardly to a point along a depth of serration <b>253</b>. The depth of serration <b>253</b> is measured from abutting surface <b>236</b> to planar recessed surface <b>259</b>. The point along the depth is where angled wall portion <b>257</b> transitions into vertical wall section <b>275</b>. A plane <b>270</b> is defined along these points that is perpendicular with floor <b>268</b> and abutting surface <b>236</b>. The aluminum lead fills serration <b>253</b> in a similar manner to that of channel <b>153</b> as previously described above. Alternately, the vertical wall may also be an angular wall that may have a different slope then angled wall portion <b>257</b> to at least ensure easy removal of the punch when the serration is stamped. Preferably, ramp angle &#x3c6; is less than 84 degrees and draft angle &#x3a3; is greater than 6 degrees. In other embodiments, the slope of the walls that form the vertical wall section <b>275</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may have a draft angle that is about 6 degrees. For any given application the fabrication of the electrical contact yields the ramp angle &#x3c6; when added or summed with the draft angle &#x3a3; totals 90 degrees in relation to floor <b>268</b>. Generally, the angular values for &#x3c6; and &#x3a3; would the same for each angular wall in the serration. Alternately, the values of &#x3c6; and &#x3a3; for each angular wall in the serration may have different values.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A two-piece combination die punch <b>280</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, is preferably employed to stamp channel <b>153</b> and knurl pattern <b>144</b> in the electrical contact <b>122</b>. Die punch <b>280</b> includes a top piece, or portion <b>281</b> and a bottom piece, or portion <b>282</b> that assembles together in a single tool. Die punch <b>280</b> is useful to consistently stamp a knurl pattern and serration at preferred widths and depths to ensure a high-quality terminal construction in a high-volume manufacturing process along a high-speed manufacturing line. The two piece punch is useful as portion <b>282</b> may be swapped out and substituted with another punch that may include other serration elements to produce an electrical contact that does not contain knurl pattern <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternately, the inner core of the wire cable may be constructed from a non-aluminum, electrically conductive material. More generally, the electrical contact may be constructed from any kind of suitable electrically conductive material. For example, the wire cable may have an inner core formed with a copper-based metal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Still yet alternately, the knurl pattern may be employed along any portion of the length and width of the interior surface of the electrical contact that makes contact with at least a portion of a lead of a wire cable.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another alternate embodiment, the wire assembly may be associated with an electrical connection system used in any type of electrical application that requires a robust electrical connection.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In yet another alternate embodiment, the inner core of a wire cable may include a lead that has a plurality of wire strands that are compacted or welded together. One such welded lead is described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/168,309 entitled CRIMP CONNECTION TO ALUMINUM CABLE filed on 24 Jun. 2011, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternately, the serration may be employed in the interior surface of the electrical contact without a corresponding knurl pattern also being employed. The serration also may take any patterned form on the interior surface that is different that a straight line that is perpendicular to the axis. In a further alternate embodiment, the serration may be disposed rearward of the knurl pattern closer to the rearward edge of the portion of the electrical contact. Still yet alternately, any number of serrations may be employed in the electrical contact. These multiple serrations may be defined in the interior surface at any location along the interior surface along with being employed with or without a corresponding knurl pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In yet another alternate embodiment the die press used to form the serration in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 13A</figref> may also be formed in a manner having an overall rectangular shape yet form the serration of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, an electrical contact that includes a channel that has an angled sidewall and a knurl has been presented. The angled sidewalls of the channel with a ramp angle of less than 84 degrees allow for a more gradual extrusion of the aluminum lead into the serration to engage against the sidewalls and recessed surface of the channel that assists to prevent damage to the individual wire strands that may otherwise make the wire conductor/electrical conduct connection less electrically and mechanically robust. A channel with these features allow the aluminum lead to completely extrude into the channel without a void being present that ensures a robust electrical connection with the contact element. Each recessed rhombic element of the knurl pattern has an orientation relative to a wire cable received in the electrical contact that allows for an improved electrical and mechanical connection between the electrical contact and the aluminum wire cable. Each recessed rhombic element has an axial minor distance disposed between axial inner corners. Each rhombic element further includes a major distance disposed between non-axial inner corners. The axial minor distance is less than the major distance. The recessed rhomboid elements may be disposed along any amount of the interior surfaces of the electrical contact that axially receives a lead of the wire cable. The knurl pattern extends along a width of the core wings and along an arcuate base of the electrical contact defined in an interior surface of the electrical contact. The crimping process maintains the arcuate form of the base while also crimping the core wings in an arcuate form all that way from a neutral state to a final state as the crimp connection is constructed. This crimping process allows at least a substantial portion of the recessed rhomboid elements to fill with the extruded aluminum of the lead before the recessed rhomboid elements are partially closed to ensure voids in the recessed elements do not occur when the crimp connection is formed. When a substantial portion of the recessed rhomboid elements are filled with pure aluminum where the pure aluminum makes complete contact with a substantial portion of the surface area of the recessed surface of the rhomboid elements, a greater surface contact area between the aluminum lead and electrical contact is realized that ensures an enhanced mechanical and electrical crimp connection is attained over the service life of the wire assembly. The increased perimeter distance of the summation of the edges in the plurality of elements of the knurl pattern in combination with the axial minor distance orientation of each rhomboid element ensure the aluminum oxides disposed on the lead of the wire cable are more effectively fractured and broken along at least the outer surface of the lead along the length of the lead that is encompassed by the knurl pattern when the crimp connection is formed. A fluid conformal coating that covers the lead of the wire cable ensures a further corrosion-resistant layer that further provides a robust electrical and mechanical connection when a crimp is formed between the electrical contact and the lead. A two piece combination punch allows for the rhombic knurl pattern and the serration having a ramp angle of less than 84 degrees on a terminal to be manufactured on high volume manufacturing assembly line. A serration positioned forward of the rhombic knurl pattern on the internal surface of the terminal may provide the advantage of allowing for the desired growth during the material stamping process to produce the knurl pattern and the serration without being restrained by the stamp tooling being impressed in to the material stock.</p>
