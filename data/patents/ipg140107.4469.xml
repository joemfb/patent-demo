<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Many types of devices are configured to support communication over a wireless network. Some wireless networks are configured as managed or infrastructure networks, using an access point to control communications between devices on the network.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When a user wishes to add a new device to a wireless network, she must first obtain a profile for the network and provide the profile to the device. The network profile is used by the device to identify the network and perform functions such as authentication and encryption in a manner recognized by the network. The network profile may be obtained in a number of ways. For example, the new device may be wired to another device that stores the network profile and the profile may be copied over the wire. Alternatively, the network profile may be stored on a portable computer-readable medium, such as a USB flash drive or compact disc, and then loaded onto the wireless device. The network profile also may be entered manually through a keypad or other input device. In yet another way, the network profile may be obtained using wireless communication with a network access port that supports a wireless protected setup protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless protected setup protocol, also known as a wireless provisioning technology, permits secure wireless transmission of the network profile to a wireless device. Wi-Fi Protected Setup is an example of a wireless protected setup protocol used on Wi-Fi networks. In an infrastructure network, the network profile may be transmitted wirelessly when the receiving wireless device and the supplying access point both support the wireless protected setup protocol. However, not all access points support a wireless protected setup protocol. WiMedia Association Model is another example of a protected setup protocol used for a peer-to-peer exchange of setup date in ultra-wideband (UWB) networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The usability of wireless connections may be expanded by facilitating wireless provisioning of devices even in networks with access points that do not support wireless provisioning protocols. To provision a wireless device, a computing device connected to the network is configured as an access point that is capable of performing a wireless provisioning protocol. This &#x201c;soft AP&#x201d; can perform a wireless protected setup under which the network profile for the network is transmitted to the wireless device. The setup process performed by the soft AP may include broadcasting a beacon signal including an indication that the soft AP supports a specific wireless provisioning protocol, such as standard protocols under which many wireless devices are designed to operate under.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once the wireless device obtains the network profile from the soft AP, it can then connect to the network through a &#x201c;hard AP&#x201d; using the profile. The &#x201c;soft AP&#x201d; also can be configured as a network client, allowing the computing device serving as the soft AP to access the wireless device over the network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The computing device may be triggered to operate in accordance with the provisioning protocol by a user of the computing device indicating that the user wishes to connect to a wireless device that is not on the network. The computing device may contain a user experience module that guides a user through the process of commanding the computing device to obtain the network profile, configure it as a soft AP, identify un-provisioned wireless devices, provision a selected wireless device and then connect to that device. The user interface may also prompt the user to verify the device to be provisioned to prevent accidentally provisioning the wrong device or a malicious attack. For example, a user may be prompted to enter a PIN associated with a selected wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In scenarios in which the computing device is already connected to the network, it may already have the network profile. Accordingly, obtaining the network profile for use by the soft AP, in some scenarios, may simply involve reading the profile from a profile store on the computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result of the provisioning process, the wireless device can use the network profile to connect to the network via a legacy access point or other access point that does not support a wireless provisioning protocol supported by the wireless device. Though use of the provisioning process is not limited to any specific scenario, it may provide an improved user experience particularly for users of portable electronic devices that may move from wireless network to wireless network and therefore need to be reprovisioned frequently or purchasers of wireless devices that expect their devices to seamlessly integrate with an existing network.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inventors have recognized and appreciated that though wireless protected setup protocols were developed to facilitate the use of wireless communication, the use of wireless technology is limited because many networks do not have access points that support the protocols. In this scenario, rather than delivering an intended seamless integration of a wireless device into a network, a frustrating user experience may result. For example, users may wish to provision a wireless device wirelessly for a network that uses a legacy access point without replacing the access point. The legacy access point may not support a wireless protected setup protocol that is also supported by the wireless device or, as protocols evolve, may only support an older version of a protocol that is not supported by the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An example of this situation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, which shows a wireless network <b>100</b>, Home_Net, with an access point <b>110</b>. Access point <b>110</b> is sometimes called a &#x201c;hard AP&#x201d; for the wireless network <b>100</b>. Computing device <b>120</b> is a member of the wireless network <b>100</b> and is connected to access point <b>110</b> via wireless connection <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A wireless device <b>130</b>, lacking a network profile for the network <b>100</b>, is unable to form a wireless connection <b>103</b>, and join the network <b>100</b>. The wireless device <b>130</b> supports a wireless protected setup protocol, yet cannot obtain the network profile from the access point <b>110</b>, which is a legacy device lacking support for the protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The inventors have recognized and appreciated that the network profile may be wirelessly communicated to the wireless device <b>130</b> by configuring the computing device <b>120</b> as an access point supporting the wireless protected setup protocol. In some embodiments, the computing device <b>120</b> is configured as a soft access point (&#x201c;soft AP&#x201d;) and broadcasts a signal indicating support for the wireless protected setup protocol. The wireless device <b>130</b> receives this signal and transmits a request for provisioning back to the computing device <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a wireless connection <b>105</b> is formed between the computing device <b>120</b> and the wireless device <b>130</b> so that the computing device <b>120</b> may transmit the network profile for the network <b>100</b> to the wireless device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Once the network profile has been successfully transmitted to the wireless device <b>130</b>, the wireless device <b>130</b> may use the profile to join the network <b>100</b> by forming the wireless connection <b>103</b> with the access point <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a method <b>200</b> of operating the computing device <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) for provisioning the wireless device <b>130</b> to connect to a wireless network <b>100</b> via an access point <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At step <b>201</b>, the computing device <b>120</b> is configured to connect to the network <b>100</b> via the access point <b>110</b>. The computing device may be configured to connect to the network <b>100</b> by obtaining the network profile for the network. The network profile may be obtained in any suitable way. In some embodiments, the computing device is used to configure the access point and obtains the network profile at the time the network <b>100</b> is set up.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At step <b>203</b>, the computing device <b>120</b> is configured as a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; access point. In some embodiments, the soft access point is enabled by a combination of software and hardware. For example, software modules may control a network interface to function as an access point. The term soft is used to differentiate this access point from the &#x201c;hard&#x201d; access point <b>110</b> of the infrastructure network <b>100</b> or to designate a device that may be selectively controlled to operate as an access point for provisioning. The soft access point may broadcast a wireless signal including an indication that the soft access point supports a wireless protected setup protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At step <b>205</b>, a wireless device <b>130</b> is detected. In some embodiments, the wireless device is detected because it transmits a request for provisioning to the computing device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step <b>207</b>, the computing device <b>120</b> transmits the network profile to the wireless device <b>130</b> in accordance with the wireless protected setup protocol. Once the network profile has been transmitted to the wireless device <b>130</b>, the soft access point on the computing device <b>120</b> may be deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a method <b>300</b> for provisioning a wireless device. Some of the steps of method <b>300</b> may be performed similarly as in one or more of the steps in method <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Method <b>300</b> may be performed by a computing device, such as computing device <b>120</b>, that may be configured as a soft access point.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At step <b>301</b>, a network profile is obtained. A network profile contains information for connection to a corresponding wireless network. The network profile may specify, for example, a network name, authentication type, encryption type, and encryption key. Other information may also be present in a network profile. Also, some of these specifications may be absent in some network profiles and present in others.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, in a network profile for IEEE 802.11 compliant networks (e.g., Wi-Fi), the network name is the service set identifier or SSID. Authentication types may include open (i.e., no authentication), shared, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2), and Wi-Fi Protected Access in pre-shared key (PSK) mode (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK). In open or shared mode, encryption may be performed, for example, in accordance with the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) which may require the joining device have a network key. If Wi-Fi Protected Access is used for authentication (WPA, WPA2, WPA-PSK, and WPA2-PSK), encryption may be in performed in compliance with the temporal key integrity protocol (TKIP) or the advanced encryption standard (AES). This list is illustrative of some of the options available for IEEE 802.11 type networks and is not intended to be exhaustive.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The network profile may be obtained in any suitable way and may be stored in a profile store of a computing device. In some embodiments, the network profile is obtained from a file stored on a computer-readable medium such as a USB flash drive or compact disc. The network profile may be transmitted to the computing device over a wired connection such as a wired network, USB connection, or IEEE 1394 cable. The network profile may be entered manually, for example, through a keypad or other input device. The network profile may be transmitted wirelessly using a wireless protected setup protocol or through another wireless network connection. In some embodiments, the computing device is used to form a wireless network by configuring an access point. The network profile for the network may thus be defined and obtained during setup of the access point. In some embodiments, multiple network profiles are obtained. It should be appreciated that obtaining a network profile does not require that a connection ever be formed to the corresponding wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At step <b>303</b>, a soft access point is enabled. Enabling the soft access point may comprise configuring the computing device to act as an access point. The soft access point may create a network different from any of the networks profiled in step <b>301</b>. The computing device may enable multiple soft access points, each for a different wireless communications technology. In some embodiments, the computing device is configured as a soft access point in response to a user input. The user input, may for example, indicate the user wishes to discover a wireless device for provisioning to a wireless network. In some embodiments, the computing device maintains a connection to one or more networks while the soft access point is enabled. Though in other embodiments, the computing device may disconnect from the network while acting as soft access point. If the computing device disconnects from the network, it may reconnect after the method <b>300</b> is completed. The network connection may be to the same type of network as the network created by the soft access point. For example, both the soft access point and the wireless network connection may be IEEE 802.11 compliant.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At step <b>305</b>, in some embodiments, the soft access point broadcasts a signal, using a suitable network interface, indicating that computing device is configured as an access point. Such a signal may be a beacon signal. Signals may be sent for each wireless communication technology for which an access point was enabled in step <b>303</b>. The signal may include an indication that the access point supports a suitable wireless protected setup protocol. A suitable wireless protected setup protocol may depend on the type of network the soft access point is configured for. In some embodiments, the soft access point is an IEEE 802.11 compliant access point, such as a Wi-Fi access point. Accordingly, the signal may include an indication that the access point supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup or any other suitable wireless protected setup protocol for use on an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. In some other embodiments, the computing device may be configured for ultra-wideband (UWB) communication. Accordingly, the signal may include an indication that protected setup in compliance with the WiMedia Association Model or another suitable wireless protected setup protocol is supported.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At step <b>307</b>, the computing device waits to receive a request for provisioning from a wireless device. Any suitable method may be used to determine how long to wait before continuing to step <b>309</b>. In some embodiments, the computing device waits a predetermined period of time. In some embodiments, the computing device waits until it receives a request. In some embodiments, a wait time is reset each time a new request is received and expires when no further requests have been received and the wait time expires. In some embodiments, the broadcast signal may be repeated (step <b>305</b>) while performing step <b>307</b>. Also, in some embodiments, information may be exchanged a priori to the process <b>300</b> being performed, Exchanged information may include a device identification and PIN for a device to be provisioned. This information may be exchanged, for example using a card reader and RFID token or other suitable near field communication mechanism. In such embodiments, the computing device may not wait at all for an explicit request from a device to be provisioned at block <b>307</b>. Exactly how it is determined to proceed to step <b>309</b> is not critical to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At step <b>309</b>, indications of the wireless devices from which a request was received in step <b>307</b> are provided to the user. In some embodiments, the method <b>300</b> is aborted at step <b>309</b> if no requests were received during step <b>307</b>. In some embodiments, the wireless devices requesting provisioning are presented in a user interface on a display, for example, as is shown in the user interface <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In this example, user interface <b>400</b> provides indications <b>411</b> of the wireless devices requesting provisioning are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At step <b>311</b>, a selection of a wireless device to provision is received. In some embodiments, steps <b>307</b> and <b>309</b> and performed simultaneously, with the wireless device for each new request being presented to the user in real-time, until the selection at step <b>311</b> is received. In some embodiments, a user selects a wireless device through a user interface in which all detected devices are indicated. For example, in user interface <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), a user may navigate a cursor <b>415</b> over a wireless device <b>413</b> to select it. In this example, once selected, the user may confirm the selection by similarly selecting the &#x201c;Next&#x201d; button <b>401</b>. Also shown are interface buttons such as a previous screen button <b>404</b> for returning to a previous screen, a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button <b>402</b> and close button <b>403</b> for aborting the method <b>300</b>. However, any suitable user interface may be used to receive a user indication that a device should be provisioned for connection to a network.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the illustrated method <b>300</b> may include steps that verify that the user has selected a desired device. At step <b>313</b>, the identity of the selected wireless device may be verified. This insures that the device intended for provisioning by the user corresponds to the selected wireless device. In some embodiments, verification is performed by using an identification string for the device, such as a PIN. The user may be prompted to enter a PIN that may be, for example, provided on a display of the wireless device, printed on the wireless device, or provided in materials accompanying the wireless device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an example embodiment, in which the user interface <b>400</b> prompts a user to enter a &#x201c;pairing code&#x201d; or PIN for the device into the text box <b>421</b>. The user may use a keypad or other input device to produce characters in the text box according to the position of a cursor <b>423</b>. If the PIN entered by the user fails to correspond with the selected wireless device, the user may have incorrectly entered the PIN or the wireless devices selected by the user at step <b>311</b> is not the wireless device the user intends to provision. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates an example embodiment in which the user interface <b>400</b> provides an indication <b>431</b> that the PIN is incorrect. The user is prompted to re-enter the PIN, or may return to select another device for provisioning.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>315</b>, a network selection for the selected wireless device is received. In some embodiments, available networks are presented to a user and a network is selected by a user input. The network may be chosen from among those for which network profiles were obtained in step <b>301</b>. For example, the network profile database may be read to obtain a listing of available network profiles. In some embodiments, only networks which the wireless device is capable of connecting to are available for selection. For example, a device only capable of connecting to IEEE 802.11 type networks, Ultra-Wide band (UWB) networks in the network profile database may not be presented. In some embodiments, multiple networks may be selected and connection preferences set. For example, a connection order may be specified. In some embodiments, if no such profiles exist or as an additional option, the user may be prompted to manually enter a profile or obtain it from another medium. Yet in some other embodiments, a network interface of the computing device scans for networks and includes the discovered networks as options for the user. If a network for which no network profile exists in the network profile database is selected, the user may be prompted to provide a network profile. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> illustrates an example embodiment in which the user interface <b>400</b> provides indications <b>441</b> of networks with available profiles. The user may use the cursor <b>415</b> to indicate a selected network <b>443</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>317</b>, the network profile for the selected network is transmitted to the wireless device. The network profile may be transmitted in accordance with a wireless protected setup protocol supported by the wireless device and the computing device. The wireless protected setup protocol may encrypt at least a portion of the network profile for secure transmission to the wireless device. For example, if the network profile is transmitted over a Wi-Fi connection between the devices, the network profile may be transmitted in accordance with the Wi-Fi Protected Setup standard. According to the Wi-Fi Protected Setup standard at least a portion of the network profile may be encrypted using an encryption protocol, such as Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for transmission to the wireless device. In some embodiments, multiple network profiles may be transmitted, optionally with rules for selecting a network. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> illustrates an example embodiment in which user interface <b>400</b> indicates that the network profile is being transmitted to the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the computing device confirms that the transmission was successful. For example, the computing device may attempt to identify the wireless device on the network for which the network profile was sent. That is, the computing device may connect to the network for which the wireless device was provisioned, if not already connected, and attempt to communicate with the wireless device over that network. In some embodiments, the wireless device may provide a confirmation that the transmission was successful. If the transmission was successful, the user interface <b>400</b> may provide an indication of the success, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>. Optionally, the computing device may be configured to utilize a service of the wireless device. For example, a printer driver may be installed when the wireless device is a printer. The user interface may be closed using the close button <b>403</b> or the &#x201c;Done&#x201d; button <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the transmission of the network profile fails, an error may be indicated to the user. In some embodiments, reasons for the error and/or steps for resolving the error may be suggested to the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>400</b> that may be shown when the transmission fails. User interface <b>400</b> provides a &#x201c;Retry&#x201d; button <b>406</b> for repeating the attempt to transmit the network profile.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>319</b>, the soft access point may be deactivated. Optionally, the user may be prompted to indicate if they would like to provision more wireless devices before deactivating the soft access point.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The computing device configured as a soft AP may be any suitable form.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Computing device <b>120</b> may be configured to perform a method of provisioning a wireless device <b>130</b> for connection to a wireless network via an access point <b>110</b>.
