<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to electronic circuit, more particularly, the present disclosure relates to EMI capacitor dischargers of offline power supplies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Offline power supplies comprise an EMI filter, which typically contains a capacitor coupled at the front end in any power supply unit in order to meet EMI standards. The EMI filter may contain more complicated circuit but typically they contain at least a capacitor. The EMI filter may also contain a passive bleeder resistor to shunt the residual charge when the offline power supply is removed from the utility AC source. But this passive bleeder resistor continually wastes power in the presence of a utility AC source, which reduces efficiency more particularly apparent in low power applications. Also, any unintentional wasted energy particularly due to the bleeder resistor eats up a portion of power consumption budget which makes it harder to become compliant with some energy regulatory standards.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the logic circuit <b>114</b> may comprise a latch circuit having a set terminal, a reset terminal, and a Q output terminal. In one embodiment, the set terminal acts as the first input terminal, the reset terminal acts as the second input terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the discharge unit <b>109</b> comprises a first switched transistor and a plurality of normally-ON transistors coupled in series between the first terminal and the second terminal of the discharge unit, wherein the first switched transistor has a control terminal coupled to the control terminal of the discharge unit, so that when a prolonged period of no zero crossing of the input AC signal occurs, the third switched transistor controlled to be on to discharge the EMI capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the number of the normally-ON transistors is determined by the voltage headroom which is used to maintain power supply to other circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the bridge rectifier <b>110</b> comprises the well-known 4-diode bridge rectifier.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, the regulator comprises a bypass capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During the operation of the EMI capacitor discharger <b>100</b>, in one hand, the input AC signal is delivered to the rectifier <b>110</b> to get rectified. The regulator <b>111</b> receives the rectified signal, and generates the regulated signal, which powers the timer <b>112</b> and other circuits. The regulator has a small internal bypass capacitor enough to support the regulation during near zero crossing of the rectified signal (or the valley of rectified signal). Bias requirement of internal circuits are minimized to reduce the internal bypass capacitor size. The timer <b>112</b> when powered will either keeps ramping up from zero to supply voltage or gets reset or clamps down to zero by a resetting switch (a transistor). On the other hand, the input AC signal is also delivered to the zero crossing detector <b>113</b> to get zero crossing monitored. If the input AC signal crosses zero, the zero crossing detector <b>113</b> generates a pulse logic high zero crossing logic flag signal, which resets the logic circuit <b>114</b> and the timer <b>112</b>, so that the control signal stays low and the timer <b>112</b> restarts to time from zero again. If a prolonged period of no zero crossing occurs, e.g., the input AC signal is unplugged from offline power supply which contains this EMI capacitor discharger <b>100</b>, the timer <b>112</b> generates a logical high timeout signal to trigger the logic circuit <b>114</b>. As a result, the logic circuit <b>114</b> generates a logic high control signal to the discharge unit <b>109</b> to control the discharge unit <b>109</b> to be on. Accordingly, the EMI capacitor <b>105</b> starts to be discharged through the discharge unit <b>109</b>. The discharge process will stop when the voltage across the EMI capacitor <b>105</b> is less than a predetermined value, e.g. 10V, or the EMI capacitor discharger <b>100</b> is re-plugged to the utility AC source.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, most of the components of the EMI capacitor discharger <b>100</b> may be integrated in a two-terminal smart bleeder <b>120</b>, as the dashed frame shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates an EMI capacitor discharger <b>200</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the EMI capacitor discharger <b>200</b> comprises the components in the EMI capacitor discharger <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and it further comprises a first depletion type pass transistor <b>207</b> coupled between the first input port <b>201</b> and the first input terminal <b>210</b>A of the bridge rectifier <b>210</b>; and a second depletion type pass transistor <b>208</b> coupled between the second input port <b>202</b> and the second input terminal <b>210</b>B of the bridge rectifier <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the first depletion type pass transistor <b>207</b> comprises a first JFET device, and the second depletion type pass transistor comprises a second JFET device, and wherein the first JFET device and the second JFET device both having a substrate coupled to the floating reference ground, respectively. However, one skilled in the art should realize that the first depletion type pass transistor and the second depletion type pass transistor may comprises other kind of transistors, such as depletion MOSFETs.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, both the first depletion type pass transistor <b>207</b> and the second depletion type pass transistor <b>208</b> may have a substrate connected to the floating reference ground via a ballast resistor <b>218</b>, respectively. The ballast resistor <b>218</b> minimizes substrate injection when the body and the drain, which forms as a junction parasitic diode, of either JFET get forward biased. However, one skilled in the art should realize that other techniques may be adopted to minimize the substrate injection, e.g., utilizing Schottky diodes in bridge rectifier and then limiting the operating current, placing the two JFETs as farthest as possible in the die.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the EMI capacitor discharger may further comprises bleeder resistors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates an EMI capacitor discharger <b>300</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
