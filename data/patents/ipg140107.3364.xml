<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to vehicular electrical systems. More specifically, the present invention relates to vehicular electrical systems with a split shield cable assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever-evolving tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles. One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel (or propulsion) vehicles that utilize voltage supplies, such as hybrid and battery electric vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles typically use one or more electric motors, often powered by batteries perhaps in combination with another actuator to drive the wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such vehicles often use two separate voltage sources, such as a battery and a fuel cell, to power the electric motors that drive the wheels. Power electronics (or power electronics systems), such as direct current-to-direct current (DC/DC) converters, are typically used to manage and transfer the power from the two voltage sources. Also, due to the fact that alternative fuel automobiles typically include only direct current (DC) power supplies, direct current-to-alternating current (DC/AC) inverters (or power inverters) are also provided to convert the DC power to alternating current (AC) power, which is generally required by the motors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electrical connections made between the various devices (e.g., inverters, converters, batteries, motors, etc.) are typically made using high voltage coaxial cabling that includes a center conductor for the primary current and a surrounding conductive shield (e.g., a wire braid) for electric field suppression. The magnetic field generated by the current flowing through the center conductor can result in substantial current flow through the conductive shield. This current can lead to significant power loss due to the impedance in the shield and the current along the shield generated from double-ended galvanic connections on both ends of the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved vehicular electrical system that reduces such current flow through the shield. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, by way of example only, a vehicular electrical system is provided.

The automotive propulsion system includes a source device including a plurality of power switching components, a load device, and a plurality of cable assemblies interconnecting the source device and the load device.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The conductive shield <b>78</b> surrounds the conductive core <b>74</b> and the insulating layer <b>76</b>, and is electrically insulated from the conductive core <b>74</b> by the insulating layer <b>76</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the conductive shield <b>78</b> includes a first portion <b>86</b> and a second portion <b>88</b>, both of which are approximately half of the length <b>84</b> of the cable assembly <b>66</b>. The first portion <b>86</b> of the conductive shield <b>78</b> is adjacent to the inverter <b>24</b> and electrically connected to the casing <b>70</b> of the inverter <b>24</b>, and may be considered to surround, or cover, a first portion <b>90</b> of the conductive core <b>74</b>.

The insulating body <b>82</b> is made of a dielectric material, such as a plastic, a composite, or a rubber, such that the first and second portions <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> of the conductive shield <b>78</b> are electrically separated, thus &#x201c;splitting&#x201d; the conductive shield <b>78</b> (both electrically and mechanically).

By including the insulating body <b>82</b>, the casings <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are not electrically interconnected through the conductive shield <b>78</b> due to the break between the first and second portions <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> of the conductive shield <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, during normal operation (i.e., driving), the automobile <b>10</b> is operated by providing power to the wheels <b>16</b> with the combustion engine <b>28</b> and the electric motor <b>30</b> in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion engine <b>28</b> and the electric motor <b>30</b> simultaneously. In order to power the electric motor <b>30</b>, DC power is provided from the battery <b>22</b> (and, in the case of a fuel cell automobile, a fuel cell) to the inverter <b>24</b>, which converts the DC power into AC power, before the power is sent to the electric motor <b>30</b>. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the conversion of DC power to AC power is substantially performed by operating (i.e., repeatedly switching) the transistors within the inverter <b>24</b> at an operating (or switching) frequency, such as, for example, 12 kilohertz (kHz).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, generally, the controller <b>36</b> produces a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal for controlling the switching action of the inverter <b>24</b>. The inverter <b>24</b> then converts the PWM signal to a modulated voltage waveform for operating the motor <b>30</b>. The inverter control system <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> consists of multiple operations during normal, or forward, operation including, but not limited to, receiving a torque command, converting the torque command to current commands based on present speed and available voltage, and performing regulation on such current commands. The output of the current regulator (not shown) is the output voltage needed to produce the requested currents. The PWM modulator <b>38</b> and the gate driver <b>39</b> generate the necessary gate pulses (or duty cycles) which are sent to the inverter <b>24</b> to control the electric motor <b>30</b> to the desired speed and/or torque.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the operation of the switches <b>52</b>-<b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) causes current to flow through the cable assemblies <b>66</b> (or the conductive cores <b>74</b> thereof) and the windings <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> in the motor <b>30</b>. The interaction of this current with the magnetic fields generated by the magnets <b>50</b> causes a Lorentz force to be generated, thus causing the rotor <b>42</b> to rotate relative to the stator <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">By electrically &#x201c;splitting&#x201d; the conductive shield <b>78</b> with the insulating body <b>82</b> (i.e., the insulating body <b>82</b> electrically separates the first and second portions <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> of the conductive shield <b>78</b>) substantially all current flowing through the conductive shield <b>78</b> is eliminated. That is, the insulating body <b>82</b> prevents magnetic fields generated by the current flowing through the conductive core <b>74</b> from inducing current flow through the conductive shield <b>78</b>. As a result, resistive losses (i.e., Joule heating) and radiated emissions of the system are reduced and overall system efficiency is improved. Additionally, because of the relatively small size of the insulating body <b>82</b>, the shielding benefits provided by the conductive shield <b>78</b> are only negligibly affected, if at all.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Other embodiments may utilize source devices other than DC/AC inverters, such as DC/DC power converters, and load devices other than electric motors, such as batteries (e.g., lithium ion batteries). The system described above may be implemented in systems other than automobiles, such as watercraft and aircraft. The electric motor and the power inverter may have different numbers of phases, such as two or four. Other forms of power sources may be used, such as current sources and loads including diode rectifiers, thyristor converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors, and/or any combination thereof.
