<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-224803, filed on Sep. 2, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the present application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The technique described in this specification relates to a multi-function device configured to execute a plurality of functions. More particularly, the technique relates to the multi-function device having at least a color-scanning function and a monochrome-printing function.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A multi-function device having a color-scanning function and a monochrome-printing function is widely known. This type of the multi-function device can not perform color-printing. For example, color image data obtained by color-scanning is sent to a PC. A user can input, into the PC, an instruction for making another color printer perform a color-printing of the color image data. In this manner, the color image data is sent to the color printer and the color-printing is performed thereby.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a case where the color image data created by the multi-function device is sent to the color printer via the PC, the time required to complete the color-printing becomes long. This specification provides a technique for shortening the time required to perform color-printing by another color printer based on color image data created by a multi-function device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This specification provides a multi-function device that is to be connected with a color printer capable of color-printing in a communicable manner. Note that the above term &#x201c;color printer&#x201d; refers to a concept including any device having at least a color-printing function. The &#x201c;color printer&#x201d; may be a printer having only the color-printing function or a multi-function device having the color-printing function and a scanning function. Also, note that the above term &#x201c;multi-function device&#x201d; refers to a concept including any device having at least a scanning function and a printing function. The multi-function device may comprise an identification information storage unit, a color-scanning unit, a monochrome-printing unit, an instruction input allowing unit, and an image sending unit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The identification information storage unit stores identification information of the color printer. The above term &#x201c;identification information&#x201d; refers to a concept including various types of information which can identify the color printer. For example, the identification information may be an IP address, a MAC address, or an e-mail address. The identification information storage unit may store the identification information input by a user. Alternatively, the identification information storage unit may store the identification information obtained by searching a network.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The color-scanning unit may be configured to color-scan an object to be scanned. The monochrome-printing unit may be configured to monochrome-print based on first image data representing an object scanned by the color-scanning unit. Note that the above &#x201c;first image data&#x201d; may be color image data or monochrome image data. In other words, the above &#x201c;first image data&#x201d; may be obtained by the color-scanning unit performing a color-scan or a monochrome-scan.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The instruction input allowing unit is configured to allow the user to input an instruction. The instruction input allowing unit may be, for example, an operation unit to be operated by the user. Also, for example, the multi-function device may employ a configuration which inputs the instruction output from an external device (for example, PC) that is separated from the multi-function device. In this case, the instruction input allowing unit may be, for example, an interface which inputs the instruction output from the external device. The image sending unit sends second image data representing an object color-scanned by the color-scanning unit with the identification information of the color printer as a destination, if a predetermined instruction is input in the instruction input allowing unit. The above term &#x201c;predetermined instruction&#x201d; may, for example, be put into a term &#x201c;instruction for making another color-printer perform a color-printing&#x201d;. The above term &#x201c;sends second image data . . . with the identification information of the color printer as a destination&#x201d; may be, for example, an aspect which &#x201c;the second image data is directly sent to the color printer corresponding to the identification information without going through another device&#x201d; or an aspect which &#x201c;the second image data is sent to the color printer corresponding to the identification information via another device such as a hub or a router, etc.&#x201d;.</p>

When this instruction is input, the CPU <b>12</b> executes the copy process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The user can input the copy instruction into the multi-function device <b>10</b> while selecting a monochrome copy or a color copy. The CPU <b>12</b> determines whether or not the color copy instruction is input (S<b>20</b>). If the determination is &#x201c;NO&#x201d; here (i.e. the monochrome copy is selected), the CPU <b>12</b> makes the scanning unit <b>24</b> perform monochrome-scanning (S<b>22</b>). Thus, the scanning unit <b>24</b> monochrome-scans an object such as a manuscript and creates monochrome scan data. Next, the CPU <b>12</b> makes the monochrome-printing unit <b>22</b> print based on the monochrome scan data (S<b>24</b>). Thus, the monochrome-printing unit <b>22</b> performs monochrome-printing on a print medium based on the monochrome scan data.

When the PDL data from the multi-function device <b>10</b> is received, the CPU <b>52</b> makes the color-printing unit <b>62</b> perform color-printing. Thus, the color-printing unit <b>62</b> color-prints on a print medium based on the aforementioned PDL data. The user can obtain the print medium to which the image corresponding to the object color-scanned by the multi-function device <b>10</b> is color-printed.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The multi-function device <b>10</b> can store an IP address of a color printer (for example, the color printer <b>50</b>).

The multi-function device <b>10</b> can send the PDL data corresponding to the color scan data to the color printer set by the user. As a result, the designated color printer performs color-printing, and a color-printed print medium can be provided to the user. In this embodiment, the color scan data created by the multi-function device <b>10</b> can be sent to the color printer directly. The time required to complete the color-printing can be shortened compared with a case where the color scan data is sent to the color printer via a PC. In addition, the multi-function device <b>10</b> converts the color scan data into the PDL data format that the color printer is capable of interpreting. In this configuration, a problem that the color-printing is not performed because the data that can not be interpreted by the color printer is sent to the color printer can be prevented. The performance of color-printing by the color printer based on the PDL data from the multi-function device <b>10</b> can certainly be ensured.</p>

The CPU <b>12</b> broadcasts a data format request command (S<b>130</b>). In other words, the CPU <b>12</b> sends the data format request command whose destination is unspecified. As will be described in detail later, a color printer (for example, the color printer <b>50</b>) sends a response including its own IP address, information related to one type of PDL data format which can be interpreted by itself, its own printer name, and its Printer MIB. The Printer MIB includes an identifier indicating whether or not color-printing can be performed.</p>
