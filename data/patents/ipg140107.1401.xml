<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to light fixtures and, more particularly, to street and roadway light fixtures and the like, including light fixtures for illumination of large areas. More particularly, this invention relates to such light fixtures which utilize LEDs as light source.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for various common lighting purposes has increased, and this trend has accelerated as advances have been made in LEDs and in LED-array bearing devices, often referred to as &#x201c;LED modules.&#x201d; Indeed, lighting applications which have been served by fixtures using high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps and other light sources are now increasingly beginning to be served by LED modules. Such lighting applications include, among a good many others, roadway lighting, parking lot lighting and factory lighting. Creative work continues in the field of LED module development, and also in the field of using LED modules for light fixtures in various applications. It is the latter field to which this invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">High-luminance light fixtures using LED modules as light source for roadway and similar applications present particularly challenging problems. High costs due to high complexity becomes a particularly difficult problem when high luminance, reliability, and durability are essential to product success. Keeping electronic LED drivers in a water/air-tight location may also be problematic, particularly when, as with roadway lights and the like, the light fixtures are constantly exposed to the elements and many LED modules are used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Yet another cost-related challenge is the problem of achieving a high level of adaptability in order to meet a wide variety of different luminance requirements. That is, providing a fixture which can be adapted to give significantly greater or lesser amounts of luminance as deemed appropriate for particular applications is a difficult problem. Light-fixture adaptability is an important goal for LED light fixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Dealing with heat dissipation requirements is still another problem area for high-luminance LED light fixtures. Heat dissipation is difficult in part because high-luminance LED light fixtures typically have a great many LEDs and several LED modules. Complex structures for module mounting and heat dissipation have sometimes been deemed necessary, and all of this adds to complexity and cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In short, there is a significant need in the lighting industry for improved roadway light fixtures and the like using LEDs. There is a need for fixtures that are adaptable for a wide variety of lighting situations, and that satisfy the problems associated with heat dissipation and appropriate protection of electronic LED driver components. Finally, there is a need for an improved LED-module-based light which is simple, and is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved LED light fixture that overcomes some of the problems and shortcomings of the prior art, including those referred to above.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the invention is to provide an improved LED light fixture that reduces development and manufacturing costs for LED light for applications requiring widely different luminance levels.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide an improved high-luminance LED light fixture with excellent reliability and durability, despite use in difficult outdoor environments.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved LED light fixture achieving excellent heat dissipation yet involving minimal structural complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">How these and other objects are accomplished will become apparent from the following descriptions and the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The owner of the present invention also owns a U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/860,887 which discloses an LED Floodlight Fixture that deals with some of the problems and shortcomings of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is an improvement in LED light fixtures, particularly for street and roadway lights and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inventive LED light fixture includes a housing that itself includes at least one end-portion and a single-piece extrusion secured with respect to the end-portion. The single-piece extrusion, which preferably is of aluminum or a similar metal or metal alloy, includes a base having an LED-adjacent surface, an opposite surface and a heat-dissipating section having heat-dissipating surfaces extending from the opposite surface. The inventive light fixture further includes an LED arrangement mounted to the LED-adjacent surface in non-water/air-tight condition with respect to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a highly preferred embodiment of the inventive light fixture, the housing forms at least one venting gap between the at least one end-portion and the single-piece extrusion to provide cool-air ingress to and along the heat-dissipating surfaces by upward flow of heated air therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some preferred embodiments the at least one end-portion preferably includes a first end-portion which forms a water/air-tight chamber enclosing at least one electronic LED driver and/or other electronics needed for LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some highly preferred embodiments of the invention include a second end-portion. The single-piece extrusion includes first and second ends with the first and second end-portions secured with respect to the first and second ends, respectively, of the extrusion. It is preferred that such embodiments include a venting gap between each end-portion and the single-piece extrusion. In such embodiments, the second end-portion forms an endcap.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The first end-portion at the first end of the extrusion has a lower surface and an extrusion-adjacent end surface. In highly preferred embodiments of the inventive LED light fixture, the extrusion-adjacent end surface and the lower surface form a first recess extending away from the first end of the extrusion and defining a first venting gap. The end surface along the first recess is preferably tapered such that the first venting gap is upwardly narrowed, thereby to direct and accelerate the air flow along the heat-dissipating surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In such highly preferred embodiments of the invention, the endcap at the second end of the extrusion has an inner surface and a lower edge-portion. It is further highly preferred that the inner surface and the lower edge-portion of the endcap form a second recess extending away from the second end of the extrusion and defining a second venting gap. The inner surface along the second recess is preferably tapered such that the second venting gap is upwardly narrowed, thereby to direct and accelerate the air flow along the heat-dissipating surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In preferred embodiments of this invention, the LED arrangement includes at least one LED-array module. The LED arrangement most preferably includes a plurality of LED-array modules. The LED-array modules are preferably substantially rectangular elongate modules. Examples of LED-array modules are disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/774,422, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In preferred embodiments, the LED-array modules each have a common module-width, and the LED-adjacent surface of the base of the extrusion preferably has a width which is approximately the multiple of the maximum number of LED-array modules mountable in side-by-side relationship thereon by the common module-width. For example, if the maximum number of such modules side-by-side of the LED adjacent surface is three, the width of the LED-adjacent surface is about three times the module-width.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The LED-array modules further have predetermined module-lengths preferably associated with the numbers of LEDs on the modules. In other words, if a module has 20 LED thereon it will have one predetermined module-length, and if it has 10 LEDs thereon it will have a shorter predetermined module-length. It is preferred that the LED-adjacent surface has a length which is preferably approximately a dimension selected from the predetermined module-lengths and the sum(s) of the module-lengths of pairs of the LED-array modules. In some of the highly preferred embodiments, at least one of the plurality of modules has a module-length different than the module-length of at least another of the plurality of modules. The LED-adjacent surface is preferably selected to have a dimension that approximately corresponds to a length of the LED arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The light fixture of this invention and its single-piece extrusion can easily be adapted in a wide variety of ways to satisfy a great variety of luminance requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain of the preferred embodiments, the plurality of LED-array modules includes LED-array modules in end-to-end relationship to one another. Such modules include modules proximal to the first end-portion and modules distal from the first end-portion. The first end-portion has water/air-tight wire-access(es) receiving wires from the proximal module(s).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain highly preferred embodiments, the extrusion includes water/air-tight wireway(s) receiving wires from the distal LED-array module(s), such that wires from the distal modules reach the water/air-tight chamber of the first end-portion through the wireway(s). The wireway(s) preferably extend through the heat-dissipating along the extrusion and spaced from the base. The heat-dissipating section preferably includes parallel fins along the lengths of the single-piece extrusion. The closed wireway(s) preferably extend(s) along the fin(s).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The wireway may be an enclosed tube secured with respect to the fin. Such fin preferably forms an extruded retention channel securely retaining the wireway tube therein. The wireway tube may be a jacketed cord, a separate aluminum tube or other suitable water/air-tight enclosure for wires to be passed from the distal modules to the water/air-tight chamber. The extruded retention channel may have an open &#x201c;C&#x201d; shape with an opening being smaller than the inner diameter such that the wireway tube may be secured with respect to the fin by snap fitting or sliding the wireway tube inside the retention channel.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In highly preferred embodiments in which the LED arrangement includes a plurality of LED-array modules, it is highly preferred that the base of the single-piece extrusion have at least one venting aperture therethrough to provide cool-air ingress to and along the heat-dissipating surfaces by upward flow of heated air therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The venting apertures preferably include at least one elongate aperture across at least a majority of the width of the base. It is preferred that a deflector member be secured to the base along the elongate aperture. The deflector member has at least one beveled deflector surface oriented to direct and accelerate air flow along the heat-dissipating surfaces. In some preferred embodiments, the deflector member includes a pair of oppositely-facing beveled deflector surfaces oriented to direct and accelerate air flow in opposite directions along the heat-dissipating surfaces&#x2014;i.e., along heat-dissipating surface above the different modules.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some of such embodiments, the plurality of LED-array modules preferably include LED-array modules in lengthwise relationship to one another. The venting aperture(s) include at least one aperture distal from (i.e., away from) the first and second ends of the extrusion&#x2014;an aperture in a more or less middle position.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some of such embodiments, the plurality of LED-array modules further includes at least one (and preferably two or more) proximal LED-array module(s) proximal to the first end of the extrusion and at least one (and preferably two or more) distal LED-array module(s) distal from the first end of the extrusion.

Most preferably, in such embodiments the LED-adjacent surface further has a width which is approximately the multiple of the maximum number of LED-array modules mountable in side-by-side relationship thereon by the common module-width.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In describing LED-array modules herein which are of generally rectangular configuration, the term &#x201c;end&#x201d; refers to the two opposite edges having the shortest dimension of such rectangular configuration, and the term &#x201c;side&#x201d; refers to the other two opposite edges, which typically have the longest dimension of such rectangular configuration (although a rectangular configuration which is square would, of course, have four edges of equal dimension).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;common module-width,&#x201d; as used herein with reference to rectangular LED-array modules, means that each of the LED-array modules mounted to the LED-adjacent surface has substantially the same width as the other modules.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Floodlight fixture <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>10</b> that has a first end-portion <b>11</b> and a second end-portion <b>12</b> and a single-piece extrusion <b>20</b> that has first and second ends <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>, respectively, with first and second end-portions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> secured with respect to first and second ends <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>, respectively. Single-piece extrusion <b>20</b> includes a substantially planar base <b>22</b> extending between first and second ends <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. Base <b>22</b> has an LED-adjacent surface <b>220</b> and an opposite surface <b>221</b>. Single-piece extrusion <b>20</b> further has a heat-dissipating section <b>24</b> having heat-dissipating surfaces <b>241</b> extending from opposite surface <b>221</b>. Light fixture <b>100</b> further includes an LED arrangement <b>30</b> mounted to LED-adjacent surface <b>220</b> in non-water/air-tight condition with respect to housing <b>10</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>31</b>) In these embodiments, second end portion <b>12</b> forms an endcap <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As best seen at least in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>30</b>, housing <b>10</b> forms a venting gap <b>14</b> between each end-portion <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and single-piece extrusion <b>20</b> to provide ingress of cool air <b>3</b> to and along the heat-dissipating surfaces <b>241</b> by upward flow of heated air <b>5</b> therefrom. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> illustrate the flow of air through heat-dissipating section <b>24</b> of extrusion <b>20</b>. The upward flow of heated air <b>5</b> draws coll air <b>3</b> into heat-dissipating section <b>24</b> and along heat-dissipating surfaces <b>241</b> without any aid from mechanical devices such as fans or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, first end-portion <b>11</b> forms a water/air-tight chamber <b>110</b> enclosing an electronic LED driver <b>16</b> and/or other electronic and electrical components needed for LED light fixtures.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First end-portion <b>11</b> at first end <b>201</b> of extrusion <b>20</b> has a lower surface <b>111</b> and an extrusion-adjacent end surface <b>112</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>27</b> and <b>30</b>, extrusion-adjacent end surface <b>112</b> and lower surface <b>111</b> form a first recess <b>114</b> which extends away from first end <b>201</b> of extrusion <b>20</b> and defines a first venting gap <b>141</b>. End surface <b>112</b> along first recess <b>114</b> is tapered such that first venting gap <b>141</b> is upwardly narrowed, thereby to direct and accelerate the air flow along heat-dissipating surfaces <b>241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Endcap <b>120</b> at second end <b>202</b> of extrusion <b>20</b> has an inner surface <b>121</b> and a lower edge-portion <b>122</b>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>31</b>, LED arrangement <b>30</b> is secured outside water/air-tight chamber <b>110</b> and is free from fixture enclosures. LED arrangement <b>30</b> includes a plurality of LED-array modules <b>31</b> or <b>32</b>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">LED-array modules <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> each have a common module-width <b>310</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-31</figref>).

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-26</figref> show an LED light fixture <b>100</b>D with LED-adjacent surface <b>220</b>D supporting a plurality of modules of different module-lengths&#x2014;both modules <b>31</b> (ten LEDs <b>18</b>) with module-length <b>311</b> and modules <b>32</b> (twenty LEDs <b>18</b>) with module-length <b>312</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-26</figref> illustrate fixtures <b>100</b>C and <b>100</b>D with the plurality of LED-array modules <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> in end-to-end relationship to one another. In such arrangement, the modules are positioned as modules <b>33</b> which are proximal to first end-portion <b>11</b>, and modules <b>34</b> which are distal from first end-portion <b>11</b>. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>27</b> and <b>30</b>, modules <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> include wireways <b>13</b> that connect to water/air-tight wire-accesses <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> of first and second end-portions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Extrusion <b>20</b> includes a water/air-tight wireway <b>26</b> for receiving wires <b>19</b> from distal LED-array modules <b>34</b>. Wireway <b>26</b> is connected to housing <b>10</b> through wire-accesses <b>115</b> and <b>125</b> of first and second end-portions <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, respectively. Wires <b>19</b> from distal modules <b>34</b> reach water/air-tight chamber <b>110</b> of first end-portion <b>11</b> through wireway <b>26</b> connected to water/air-tight wire-access <b>115</b>. Wireway <b>26</b> extends along and trough heat-dissipating section <b>24</b> and is spaced from base <b>22</b>. Heat-dissipating section <b>24</b> includes parallel fins <b>242</b> along the lengths of single-piece extrusion <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate wireway <b>26</b> as formed of and along fin <b>242</b>. Fin <b>242</b> is a middle fin positioned at longitudinal axis of extrusion <b>20</b>. However, wireway <b>26</b> may be formed along any other fin. Such choice depends on the fixture configuration and in no way limited to the shown embodiments. Wireway <b>26</b> may be positioned along fin <b>242</b> at any distance from base <b>22</b> that provides safe temperatures for wires <b>19</b>. It should, therefore, be appreciated that wireway <b>26</b> may be positioned at a tip of fin <b>242</b> with the farthest distance from base <b>22</b>. Alternatively, if temperature characteristics allow, wireway <b>26</b> may be positioned near the middle of fin <b>242</b> and closer to base <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> shows wireway <b>26</b>A as an enclosed tube <b>27</b> secured with respect to fin <b>242</b>. As can be seen in FIGS. <b>37</b> and <b>39</b>-<b>41</b>, fin <b>242</b> forms an extruded retention channel <b>25</b> securely retaining wireway tube <b>27</b> therein. Wireway <b>26</b>A may have a jacketed cord or rigid tube which is made of aluminum or other suitable material. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, extruded retention channel <b>25</b> has an open &#x201c;C&#x201d; shape with an opening being smaller than the largest inner diameter. When jacketed cord is secured with respect to fin <b>242</b> by snap fitting or the rigid tube is slid inside retention channel <b>25</b>, retention channel <b>25</b> securely holds wireway tube <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Wire-accesses <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> and wireway <b>26</b> provide small surfaces between water/air-tight chamber and non-water/air-tight environment.
