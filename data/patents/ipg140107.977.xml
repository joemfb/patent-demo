<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A transport apparatus for use in the field of building construction, specifically an apparatus for safely transporting and off-loading modular building components.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Modular building is a popular building method by which multiple modules are manufactured off-site and subsequently transported and put together on-site. Modular building can have many advantages over traditional construction, such as being less expensive and more durable. However, the transport process is a critical and often problematic step in modular construction, since each unit must travel to the building site without suffering structural or cosmetic damage. Moreover, once on-site, the units must be carefully and precisely attached to each other, which requires placement on either a foundation or on top of another module.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current transport and off-load methods are ineffective at adequately preventing damage to payloads. What is needed is a modular transport and placement apparatus that can safely and effectively deliver and position modular units. The apparatus should have a plurality of track-drive assemblies, which can move independently or in concert to adapt to uneven terrain. It is desirable to have a multi-deck configuration, wherein each deck can remain in a substantially horizontal and stable position during transport. The upper deck of a multi-deck apparatus should be adapted to rise above lower decks such that off-load can occur safely and within inches of a foundation or second floor level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The apparatus should have an elevation-changing track drive for traversing complex topology contours having indifferent angles relative to each track drive assembly. The apparatus should have the ability to adapt and traverse complex terrains directed by geometry and telemetry computerization, and should be capable of terrain mapping. Most importantly, it is desirable to have an apparatus that won't twist or otherwise damage its payload while traversing 3-D terrains that vary in elevation.</p>

In some embodiments, a drive assembly <b>112</b> can comprise at least one surface scanner <b>1304</b> that can detect surface conditions, such as wet or dry soil or clay, loose gravel, or any other desired surface condition parameter. Once a surface scanner <b>1304</b> provides feedback, a leveling system <b>1204</b> can instruct leg and/or drive assemblies <b>110</b> <b>112</b> accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a schematic of one embodiment of the process by which a leveling system <b>1204</b> can operate. A proportional integral differential control <b>1401</b> can collect feedback from sensors and scanners coupled with front and rear leg and drive assemblies <b>110</b> <b>112</b>. This feedback can then be transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU) <b>1402</b>. A master sensor <b>1206</b> and torsion control sensors <b>1208</b> can also provide feedback to a CPU <b>1402</b>. Once a CPU <b>1402</b> collects necessary data, it can then process it and send the result to a variable valve control interface <b>1404</b>, which in turn can determine desired XYZ plane positioning and instruct leg or other hydraulics to modify their positions accordingly. Appropriate actuation instructions can control deck lift assemblies <b>106</b>, tilting of drive assemblies <b>112</b>, outrigger <b>114</b> extension and rotation, and any other known and/or convenient component or assembly of an apparatus <b>100</b>. This process can ensure proper leveling of upper and lower decks <b>104</b> <b>102</b> of an apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Data from a master sensor <b>1206</b>, torsion control sensors <b>1208</b>, sensors <b>1301</b> <b>1302</b>, and surface condition scanners <b>1304</b>, can be collected in real-time to provide immediate processing and commands. In some embodiments, an apparatus <b>100</b> can be equipped with global positioning system capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">An alternate embodiment of a transport apparatus <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-22</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a transport apparatus <b>100</b> in a raised configuration and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a transport apparatus <b>100</b> in a retracted configuration. This embodiment of a transport apparatus <b>100</b> can utilize an over-the-road assembly comprising a lower deck <b>102</b>, an upper deck <b>104</b>, and a wheel assembly <b>1502</b>. The over-the-road assembly can be disconnected from a tractor truck via a tongue assembly <b>908</b> and a small track drive unit. This unit can manipulate the over-the-road assembly into tighter spots than possible with a tractor truck.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A lower deck <b>102</b> can be limited in height for purposes of over-the-road transport. Foundations can vary in elevation from a few inches to as much as five feet, thus a transport apparatus <b>100</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-16</figref> can be designed to deliver payload to foundations given those limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A bridge assembly <b>1702</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, a lower deck <b>102</b> is coupled with a bridge assembly <b>1702</b>, which is hidden within the framework of a lower deck <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, a bridge assembly <b>1702</b> can be coupled with an upper deck <b>104</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, a bridge assembly <b>1702</b> is shown in an extended position and comprises a hinge mechanism <b>1704</b>, telescoping rail extension <b>1706</b>, a foundation coupling <b>1708</b>, and at least one vertical support member <b>1710</b>. Telescoping rail extensions <b>1706</b> can be adapted to couple with a foundation if lower than a transport apparatus <b>100</b>, or to a wall should the foundation be higher than a transport apparatus <b>100</b>. An upper deck <b>104</b> can traverse a lower deck <b>102</b> onto telescoping rail extensions <b>1706</b> and thus onto a foundation. A lateral positive track drive can push a payload unit from a transport apparatus <b>100</b> onto a foundation. As a transport apparatus <b>100</b> retracts, a payload can be stationary by friction, onsite cables, or any other known and/or convenient mechanism or method. The payload can oscillate laterally until it has departed from the limitation of an upper deck <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the upper deck <b>104</b> of a transport apparatus <b>100</b> can further comprise at least one payload drive <b>1802</b>, at least one deck lift assembly <b>106</b>, and at least one set of locking pins <b>1804</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-20</figref> show details of a payload drive <b>1802</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a payload drive <b>1802</b> can comprise a hydraulic lift <b>1902</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>), a scissor lift mechanism <b>1904</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>), or any other known and/or convenient lift mechanism. The track drive assembly <b>1906</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. A track drive assembly <b>1906</b> can comprise a track <b>2002</b> and a drive shaft <b>2004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> depicts an embodiment of a deck lift assembly <b>106</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref> shows the deck lift assembly <b>106</b> in a retracted position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref> shows the deck lift assembly <b>106</b> in a raised position. A deck lift assembly <b>106</b> coupled with upper and lower decks <b>104</b> <b>102</b> can comprise a lift drive <b>2102</b>, at least one pivot arm <b>2104</b>, and a wheel assembly <b>2106</b>. A lift drive <b>2102</b> can be a hydraulic, worm drive, or any other known and/or convenient drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A transport apparatus <b>100</b> can further comprise at least one set of locking pins <b>1804</b> adapted to secure lower and upper decks <b>102</b> <b>104</b> together. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> depicts one embodiment of a set of locking pins <b>1804</b>, however in alternate embodiments locking pins <b>1804</b> can have any other known and/or convenient configuration.</p>
