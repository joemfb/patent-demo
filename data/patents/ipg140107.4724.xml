<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain aspects of the present disclosure generally relate to a wireless communication and, more particularly, to fast denoising of a received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ultra-Wideband (UWB) communications are radio communications that use a frequency bandwidth larger than 500 MHz. In comparison to narrow-band communications which rely on modulation of a carrier frequency, the large bandwidth of UWB communications allows sending signals with features well-localized in time. If a signal is more localized in time, then it is more spread in frequency. This allows communications based on pulses, while information can be encoded in a distance between pulses (i.e., a Pulse Position Modulation: PPM), in a pulse amplitude (i.e., a Pulse Amplitude Modulation: PAM) or in a pulse width (i.e., Pulse Width Modulation: PWM). One of the key advantages of pulse-based communication is ability to precisely localize time of arrival of the information (i.e., arrival of the pulse).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A signal at the UWB receiver is typically based on a pulse signal corrupted by stationary and non-stationary noise and by various channel effects, wherein the pulse signal can be different than a periodic sinc (i.e., Dirichlet kernel) shaped pulse signal. On the other hand, a parametric Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) processing technique that can be applied after the UWB processing requires an input signal based on the periodic-sinc signal. Therefore, the received UWB pulse signal needs to be properly adjusted (i.e., equalized) before being processed by the FRI module. However, the equalized pulse signal at the input of the FRI module can still be corrupted by a prohibitively high level of noise.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The well-known Cadzow iterative algorithm can be used as an integral part of the FRI processing for denoising of the input signal of the FRI receiving module. The standard Cadzow algorithm provides, given a Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N associated with the noisy signal, a Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of the same dimension with rank K, where K&#x3c;&#x3c;N . In order to achieve this low-rank approximation (i.e., signal de-noising), the standard Cadzow algorithm performs eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N, and reconstructs the &#x201c;best&#x201d; rank K approximation by keeping only the K principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The reconstructed rank-K matrix is made Toeplitz by averaging its diagonals. This process is iterated until convergence. However, the standard iterative Cadzow algorithm is slow and computationally complex.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method is proposed in the present disclosure to speed up the standard Cadzow denoising algorithm and to lower its computational complexity.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although particular aspects are described herein, many variations and permutations of these aspects fall within the scope of the disclosure. Although some benefits and advantages of the preferred aspects are mentioned, the scope of the disclosure is not intended to be limited to particular benefits, uses or objectives. Rather, aspects of the disclosure are intended to be broadly applicable to different wireless technologies, system configurations, networks, and transmission protocols, some of which are illustrated by way of example in the figures and in the following description of the preferred aspects. The detailed description and drawings are merely illustrative of the disclosure rather than limiting, the scope of the disclosure being defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">An Example Wireless Communication System</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The techniques described herein may be used for various broadband wireless communication systems, including communication systems that are based on a single carrier transmission. Aspects disclosed herein may be advantageous to systems employing Ultra-Wideband (UWB) signals including millimeter-wave signals. However, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to such systems, as other coded signals may benefit from similar advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The teachings herein may be incorporated into (e.g., implemented within or performed by) a variety of wired or wireless apparatuses (e.g., nodes). In some aspects, a node implemented in accordance with the teachings herein may comprise an access point or an access terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An access terminal (&#x201c;AT&#x201d;) may comprise, be implemented as, or known as an access terminal, a subscriber station, a subscriber unit, a mobile station, a remote station, a remote terminal, a user terminal, a user agent, a user device, user equipment, or some other terminology. In some implementations an access terminal may comprise a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (&#x201c;SIP&#x201d;) phone, a wireless local loop (&#x201c;WLL&#x201d;) station, a personal digital assistant (&#x201c;PDA&#x201d;), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, or some other suitable processing device connected to a wireless modem. Accordingly, one or more aspects taught herein may be incorporated into a phone (e.g., a cellular phone or smart phone), a computer (e.g., a laptop), a portable communication device, a portable computing device (e.g., a personal data assistant), an entertainment device (e.g., a music or video device, or a satellite radio), a global positioning system device, a headset, a sensor or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless or wired medium. In some aspects the node is a wireless node. Such wireless node may provide, for example, connectivity for or to a network (e.g., a wide area network such as the Internet or a cellular network) via a wired or wireless communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communication system <b>100</b> (i.e., a Piconet 1) in which aspects of the present disclosure may be employed. As illustrated, Piconet 1 may include a number of wireless devices <b>102</b> or &#x201c;terminals&#x201d; <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>E that can communicate with one another using relatively short-range wireless links <b>104</b>. In the illustrated example, terminal <b>1</b>E acts as a PNC for Piconet 1. Although illustrated with five devices, it should be appreciated that any number of devices (i.e., two or more) may form a wireless personal area network.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the terminals <b>102</b> in the Piconet 1 may include, among other things, a wireless transceiver to support wireless communication and controller functionality to manage communication with the network. The controller functionality may be implemented within one or more digital processing devices. The wireless transceiver may be coupled to one or more antennas to facilitate the transmission of signals into and the reception of signals from a wireless channel. Any type of antennas may be used including, for example, dipoles, patches, helical antennas, antenna arrays, and/or others.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The devices in the Piconet 1 may include any of a wide variety of different device types including, for example, laptop, desktop, palmtop, or tablet computers having wireless networking functionality, computer peripherals having wireless networking capability, personal digital assistants (PDAs) having wireless networking capability, cellular telephones and other handheld wireless communicators, pagers, wireless network interface modules (e.g., wireless network interface cards, etc.) incorporated into larger systems, multimedia devices having wireless networking capability, audio/visual devices having wireless networking capability, home appliances having wireless networking capability, jewelry or other wearable items having wireless networking capability, wireless universal serial bus (USB) devices, wireless digital imaging devices (e.g., digital cameras, camcorders, etc.), wireless printers, wireless home entertainment systems (e.g., DVD/CD players, televisions, MP3 players, audio devices, etc.), and/or others. In one configuration, for example, a wireless personal area network may include a user's laptop computer that is wirelessly communicating with the user's personal digital assistant (PDA) and the user's printer in a short-range network. In another possible configuration, a wireless personal area network may be formed between various audio/visual devices in, for example, a user's living room. In yet another configuration, a user's laptop computer may communicate with terminals associated with other users in a vicinity of the user. Many other scenarios are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Standards have been developed, and are currently in development, to provide a framework to support development of interoperable products that are capable of operating as part of a wireless personal area network (e.g., the Bluetooth standard (Specification of the Bluetooth System, Version 3.0, Bluetooth SIG, Inc., April 2009), the IEEE 802.15 standards, etc.). The IEEE 802.15.3c standard, for example, is a high data rate wireless personal area network standard. In accordance with the IEEE 802.15.3c standard, one of the terminals within a piconet is selected as a Piconet Coordinator (PNC) to coordinate the operation of the network. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the device PNC <b>1</b>E represents a PNC for the Piconet 1 in an IEEE 802.15.3c implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated, PNC <b>1</b>E may transmit a beacon signal <b>110</b> (or simply &#x201c;beacon&#x201d;) to other devices of Piconet 1, which may help the other terminals within Piconet 1 synchronize their timing with PNC <b>1</b>E. Thus, the beacon, typically sent at the beginning of every superframe, contains information that may be used to time-synchronize the terminals in the piconet. Each terminal in the piconet, including the PNC, may reset its superframe clock to zero at the beginning of the beacon preamble. If a terminal does not hear a beacon, it may reset its superframe clock to zero at the instant where it expected to hear the beginning of the beacon preamble (e.g., based on previous superframe timing).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, terminals <b>102</b> can be communicating with one another in a peer-to-peer configuration. For example, the device DEV <b>1</b>C may be in communication with the device DEV <b>1</b>D using the link <b>104</b>. In peer-to-peer ad hoc networks, devices (nodes) within range of each other, such as the devices DEV <b>1</b>C and DEV <b>1</b>D in the network <b>100</b>, can communicate directly with each other without an access point, such as the PNC <b>1</b>E, and/or a wired infrastructure to relay their communication. Additionally, peer devices or nodes can relay traffic. The devices <b>102</b> within the network <b>100</b> communicating in a peer-to-peer manner can function similar to base stations and relay traffic or communications to other devices, functioning similar to base stations, until the traffic reaches its ultimate destination. The devices can also transmit control channels, which carry information that can be utilized to manage the data transmission between peer nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The communication network <b>100</b> can include any number of devices or nodes that are in wireless (or wired) communication. Each node can be within range of one or more other nodes and can communicate with the other nodes or through utilization of the other nodes, such as in a multi-hop topography (e.g., communications can hop from node to node until reaching a final destination). For example, a sender node may wish to communicate with a receiver node. To enable packet transfer between sender node and receiver node, one or more intermediate nodes can be utilized. It should be understood that any node can be a sender node and/or a receiver node and can perform functions of either sending and/or receiving information at substantially the same time (e.g., can broadcast or communicate information at about the same time as receiving information) or at different times.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates various components that may be utilized in a wireless device <b>202</b> that may be employed within the wireless communication system <b>100</b>. The wireless device <b>202</b> is an example of a device that may be configured to implement the various methods described herein. The wireless device <b>202</b> may be the PNC <b>1</b>E or a terminal <b>102</b> in the Piconet 1.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The wireless device <b>202</b> may include a processor <b>204</b> which controls operation of the wireless device <b>202</b>. The processor <b>204</b> may also be referred to as a central processing unit (CPU). Memory <b>206</b>, which may include both read-only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM), provides instructions and data to the processor <b>204</b>. A portion of the memory <b>206</b> may also include non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM). The processor <b>204</b> typically performs logical and arithmetic operations based on program instructions stored within the memory <b>206</b>. The instructions in the memory <b>206</b> may be executable to implement the methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The wireless device <b>202</b> may also include a housing <b>208</b> that may include a transmitter <b>210</b> and a receiver <b>212</b> to allow transmission and reception of data between the wireless device <b>202</b> and a remote location. The transmitter <b>210</b> and receiver <b>212</b> may be combined into a transceiver <b>214</b>. An antenna <b>216</b> may be attached to the housing <b>208</b> and electrically coupled to the transceiver <b>214</b>. The wireless device <b>202</b> may also include (not shown) multiple transmitters, multiple receivers, multiple transceivers, and/or multiple antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The wireless device <b>202</b> may also include a signal detector <b>218</b> that may be used in an effort to detect and quantify the level of signals received by the transceiver <b>214</b>. The signal detector <b>218</b> may detect such signals as total energy, energy per subcarrier per symbol, power spectral density and other signals. The wireless device <b>202</b> may also include a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>220</b> for use in processing signals.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The various components of the wireless device <b>202</b> may be coupled together by a bus system <b>222</b>, which may include a power bus, a control signal bus, and a status signal bus in addition to a data bus.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Ultra-Wideband (UWB) communications performed by the wireless system <b>100</b> comprise radio communications that use a frequency bandwidth larger than 500 MHz. In comparison to narrow-band communications which rely on modulation of a carrier frequency, the large bandwidth of UWB communications allows sending signals with features well-localized in time. If a signal is more localized in time, then it is more spread in frequency. This allows communications based on pulses, while information can be encoded in a distance between pulses (i.e., a Pulse Position Modulation: PPM), in a pulse amplitude (i.e., a Pulse Amplitude Modulation: PAM) or in a pulse width (i.e., Pulse Width Modulation: PWM). One of the key advantages of pulse-based communication is ability to precisely localize time of arrival of the information (i.e., arrival of the pulse).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) is a parametric processing approach that may be applied on signals received by a typical Ultra-Wideband (UWB) device, such as the device <b>202</b>. The FRI processing may require an input signal based on the periodic-sinc function, while the received UWB signal is based on different types of pulses. Because of that, the received UWB signal may need to be properly adjusted (i.e., equalized) before being input into an FRI module. However, the equalized pulse signal at the input of the FRI module can still be corrupted by a prohibitively high level of noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Fast Cadzow Denoising Algorithm</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The Cadzow iterative algorithm can be utilized as a part of the FRI processing for denoising of the input signal. In the Cadzow denoising procedure, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of N input samples may be arranged in a Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N. If the original signal (i.e., the signal without noise) comprises K distinct samples, where K&#x3c;&#x3c;N, the Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix may be eventually of rank K. Therefore, each denoising iteration may consist of finding a preferred low-rank approximation of the original Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix, i.e., given the Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N, a Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of the same dimension with rank K may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The standard Cadzow algorithm performs eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the Toeplitz Hermitian square matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N, and reconstructs the preferred rank-K approximation by keeping only the K principal eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The reconstructed rank-K matrix is made Toeplitz by averaging its diagonals. This process can be iterated until convergence. However, the standard Cadzow iterative algorithm can be slow and computationally complex. Certain aspects of the present disclosure support speeding up the Cadzow denoising algorithm and reducing its computational complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It can be observed that the Cadzow algorithm requires a relatively small number of eigenpairs (i.e., eigenvalues and eigenvectors). Therefore, instead of applying the full EVD algorithm, the signal matrix may be denoised based on a partial EVD approach. At each iteration, the signal matrix to be denoised may be projected into a Krylov subspace of a smaller dimension, which saves computations. Then, a particular structure of the projected signal may be used to extract only relevant eigenpairs, which saves additional computations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example block diagram of the proposed partial EVD algorithm in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an overview of matrix computations involved in the low-rank approximation using the regular full EVD algorithm and the proposed partial EVD algorithm. It can be observed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the computational complexity of the proposed partial EVD approach may be substantially reduced compared to the conventional full EVD algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates example operations <b>500</b> for performing the proposed partial EVD algorithm in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure. The DFT coefficients of the noisy signal may be arranged in a first matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N. At <b>510</b>, the first matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N may be provided for processing. The first matrix may be a Toeplitz Hermitian matrix, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At <b>520</b>, a second matrix of dimension M&#xd7;M may be generated from the first matrix, wherein M&#x3c;N. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the generation of the second matrix may be based on an iterative partial Lanczos tridiagonalization that may also produce a unitary matrix of dimension N&#xd7;M which spans an M-dimensional Krylov subspace of the first matrix. The generated second matrix may be a real, symmetric and tridiagonal matrix, and may represent a projection of the first matrix in the M-dimensional Krylov subspace. This particular structure of the second matrix may simplify following computations.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that the partial Lanczos tridiagonalization procedure may be numerically unstable, i.e., orthogonality between basis vectors may be lost after a few iterations. The most conservative treatment is to orthogonalize each new basis vector against already obtained ones. This approach is known in the art as the full orthogonalization (or the Gram-Schmidt procedure). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is proposed in the present disclosure to employ a faster and less complex partial re-orthogonalization (PRO) approach. The PRO estimates the loss of orthogonality at each iteration and re-orthogonalize the new basis vector against the ones with an inner-product crossing a defined threshold and their adjacent basis vectors. Another approach that simplifies the full orthogonalization is known in the art is the selective orthogonalization (SO). In the preferred aspect of the present disclosure, the PRO is chosen over the SO for its relative simplicity, while being sufficiently effective against the loss of orthogonality during the iterative Lanczos procedure. In other aspects of the present disclosure, the Gram-Schmidt procedure or the SO may be employed instead of the PRO.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at <b>530</b>, the generated second matrix of dimension M&#xd7;M may be processed in order to obtain K eigenvalues {&#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, . . . , &#x3bb;<sub>K</sub>} and K eigenvectors {&#x3be;<sub>1</sub>, . . . , &#x3be;<sub>K</sub>}, wherein K&#x3c;M. The generated K eigenvectors may be related to K principal eigenvectors of the first matrix, and may represent the projection of the eigenvectors of the first matrix in the Krylov subspace. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the generated second matrix of dimension M&#xd7;M may be processed by utilizing the bisection search algorithm and the fast rooting Brent algorithm to generate K eigenvalues {&#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, . . . , &#x3bb;<sub>K</sub>}. Recovery of the eigenvectors {&#x3be;<sub>1</sub>, . . . , &#x3be;<sub>K</sub>} may be performed in a fast and stable manner by using a Fernando's double factorization applied on the second matrix, while also utilizing the eigenvalues {&#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, . . . , &#x3bb;<sub>K</sub>}.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At <b>540</b>, a rank-K matrix may be obtained, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, using the previously generated K eigenvalues, the K eigenvectors and the unitary matrix, wherein the rank-K matrix may represent a lower-rank approximation of the first matrix. This low-rank approximation is possible because the principal eigenpairs of the first matrix of dimension N&#xd7;N may belong to the M-dimensional Krylov subspace, wherein M&#x3c;N.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The value of M (i.e., the size of Krylov subspace) may be determined as follows. In one aspect of the present disclosure, the K<sup>th </sup>eigenvalue may be monitored at each iteration of the Lanczos tridiagonalization procedure. Once this particular eigenvalue is converged (i.e., stopped moving), it is likely that the K principal eigenpairs of the subspace projection may be mapped to the original K principal eigenpairs by using an inverse projection. Then, the value of M may correspond to the number of iterations of the Lanczos procedure. In another aspect of the present disclosure, the value of M may be set beforehand, and then it may be required to empirically confirm that an obtained K<sup>th </sup>eigenvalue has converged for this particular M.</p>
