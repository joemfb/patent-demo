<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. The figures are not necessarily to scale; some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, except where otherwise expressly indicated, all numerical quantities in the description and in the claims are to be understood as modified by the word &#x201c;about&#x201d; in describing the broader scope of this invention. Also, unless expressly stated to the contrary, the description of a group or class of material as suitable or preferred for a given purpose in connection with the invention implies that mixtures of any two or more members of the group or class may be equally suitable or preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Fuel cells have been pursued as a source of power for transportation because of their high energy efficiency and potential for fuel flexibility. However, broad commercialization of the fuel cells has been limited due to the high cost of the fuel cell catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One source of the high cost of fuel cell catalyst is due to the insufficient use of the catalyst itself. By way of example, conventional fuel cells employ catalyst nano-particles supported on porous carbon support. These catalyst nano-particles may include several hundred or more atoms of catalyst metals. In these catalyst nano-particles, only a few surface atomic layers of the nano-particles are accessible to fuel cell reactants and remain active for electrochemical reaction, while majority of the catalyst atoms toward the center of the nano-particle remain inaccessible and hence essentially inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, insufficient use of the conventional catalyst may also be due to catalyst degradation inherent in these catalyst nano-particles. The catalyst degradation may proceed through one or more of these mechanisms: catalyst dissolution and re-deposition via the Oswald ripening process; coalescence and agglomeration of catalyst nano-particles via catalyst nano-crystallite migration on carbon support; catalyst detachment and de-activation triggered by corrosion of carbon support such as detachment of catalyst particles from the carbon support; and/or catalyst agglomeration due to high-end operation of fuel cells particularly under high temperatures. Because catalyst nano-particles, depending on their sizes, may have a melting point about a fraction of that for the corresponding catalyst bulk, and therefore catalyst nano-particles are relatively more prone to agglomeration and dissolution. These mechanisms may result in loss of electrochemically active area and degradation of the performance of the electrochemical cells. Without wanting to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the degradation mechanisms may have roots in high surface energy associated with the relatively small sizes of the nano-particles, as nano-particles tend to aggregate among themselves and form larger particles to attain a lower (and more stable) level of energy.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another limitation associated with certain conventional fuel cell systems is ineffective flooding control. By way of example, certain reactants including oxygen/hydrogen gas, water, and protons cannot easily move across the catalyst sheet and as a result, little or no electrochemical reaction happens. Moreover, even if some oxygen gas, hydrogen gas, and proton do move across the catalyst sheet, resultant water molecules cannot easily move across the catalyst sheet and therefore water flooding often happens.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One or more embodiments of the present invention, as will be described in more detail below, alleviate some of the above-identified issues associated with the conventional fuel cell catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one aspect of the present invention, an electrode assembly is provided. In one embodiment, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electrode assembly can be configured for use as a catalyst coated membrane <b>100</b> including a proton exchange membrane <b>102</b> and a catalyst layer <b>104</b>. Alternatively, the electrode assembly can be used as a gas diffusion electrode <b>100</b>&#x2032; including a gas diffusion layer <b>106</b> and the catalyst layer <b>104</b>. It is noted that the electrode assembly <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032; is equally applicable to the other side of the proton exchange membrane <b>102</b>, for instance to include a catalyst layer <b>104</b>&#x2032; and a gas diffusion layer <b>106</b>&#x2032; for use as the other electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> depicts an enlarged view of a portion of the catalyst layer <b>104</b>, including first spaced apart strands <b>202</b> extending longitudinally in a first direction AA&#x2032; and second spaced apart strands <b>204</b> extending longitudinally in a second direction BB&#x2032;, forming a mesh <b>200</b> defining a number of openings <b>206</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> depicts an enlarged view of a section &#x201c;aa&#x201d; of the mesh <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, showing a number of substrate hairs <b>210</b> projecting from the mesh <b>200</b>. At least a portion of the number of substrate hairs <b>210</b> may be in a third direction CC&#x2032; different from the direction AA&#x2032; or BB&#x2032;. In certain instances, the substrate hairs <b>210</b> extend radially from a surface <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The substrate hairs <b>210</b> can be grown on any suitable surface of the mesh <b>200</b> to provide additional catalytic surface area. In certain instances, two or more planar layers of the mesh substrate <b>200</b> can be aligned next to each other to provide additional catalytic surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In yet another embodiment, the openings <b>206</b> have an average planar linear dimension of 10 to 70 micrometers, wherein the planar linear dimension is the largest linear distance between any two points on the perimeter of each of the openings <b>206</b>. Without being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the openings thus sized further improves water management by limiting water accumulation in and around the openings <b>206</b> and thereby reducing the propagation of the water flooding into neighboring openings <b>206</b>. Furthermore, any accumulated water can be wicked out through GDL to further enhance water management.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The openings <b>206</b> may be provided for passing certain fuel cell reactants including gases and liquids ordinarily involved in a fuel cell electrochemical reaction. Fuel cell reactants include many species depending upon the fuel cell type. Non-limiting examples of the hydrogen fuel cell reactants include oxygen gas, hydrogen gas, oxygen ions, hydrogen ions, and water molecules. The openings <b>206</b> may take any suitable geometric shapes. Non-limiting examples of the shapes include cones and pyramids.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In yet another embodiment, the openings <b>206</b> may be filled with ionomers to provide additional protonic or ionic connectivity, to assist proton transfer or can be left empty for gases to diffuse down to reach the membrane. When the openings are filled with ionomers, ionic charge carriers or protons can be carried out to the gas diffusion layer side of the catalyst layer (the mesh layer) where the electrochemical reaction takes place. If the openings are not filled with ionomers, the reactant gases must instead travel down towards the membrane adjacent to the catalyst layer to meet with ionic charge carriers or protons for reaction. In yet another embodiment, the openings <b>206</b> may be filled with a mixture of ionomer and porous carbon to provide additional ionic, electronic conductivity and to assist with water management and reactant transport.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Whether the openings <b>206</b> should be filled with ionomers is a matter of design. If the openings <b>206</b> are filled with ionomer, the ionic charge carriers and/or protons may be carried out to the catalyst layer adjacent to GDL layer where the electrochemical reaction can happen. This design may be appropriate if the mesh substrate <b>200</b> is relatively thick wherein the presence of ionomers can offset the relatively longer passage the ionic charge carriers and/or protons are to travel from one side of the mesh substrate <b>200</b> to the other. This design may also be more appropriate for low temperature fuel cells where the product water can form droplets that can be removed through GDL. If the openings are not filled with ionomer, the reactive gases must diffuse down the hole to reach the ionic charge carrier- and/or proton-rich membrane in order for the reaction to happen.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In yet another embodiment, the mesh <b>200</b> is provided with a porosity of from 25 to 75 percent, or more particularly from 35 to 65 percent. The term &#x201c;porosity&#x201d; may refer to a percentage of the openings <b>206</b> relative to the planar area of the catalyst layer <b>104</b>. The porosity may be a function of size, shape and numbers of openings and grids, and thickness of the mesh substrate <b>200</b>. As a combination parameter, the porosity may be adjusted to accommodate a particular catalyst loading requirement suitable for certain applications. In addition, when the mesh substrate <b>200</b> is relatively thick, an effective catalytic active area of the catalyst layer may be further increased by growing or depositing catalyst on the inside walls (e.g., perpendicular to the plane of the mesh substrate <b>200</b>) of the openings without having to necessarily increase or decrease the porosity of the mesh substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the catalyst layer <b>104</b> further includes a catalyst film <b>208</b> in overlaying contact with at least one of the mesh <b>200</b> and the number of substrate hairs <b>210</b>. In certain particular instances, the catalyst film <b>208</b> contacts at least a portion of the first and second spaced apart strands <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and at least a portion of the number of substrate hairs <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The catalyst <b>208</b> may be in direct contact with the mesh <b>200</b>, the substrate hairs <b>210</b>, or likely both. In either scenario, the catalyst <b>208</b> may be extensive in two-dimensions (2-D). As depicted in FIGS. <b>2</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>C<b>2</b>, the catalyst <b>208</b> may include a first atomic layer of the catalyst atoms <b>220</b> generally shown at <b>208</b><i>a</i>, a second exposed atomic layer of the catalyst atoms <b>220</b> generally shown at <b>208</b><i>c</i>, and a number of intermediate atomic layers of the catalyst atoms <b>220</b> generally shown at <b>208</b><i>b </i>between the first and second atomic layers <b>208</b><i>a </i>and <b>208</b><i>c</i>, the total number of the atomic layers <b>208</b><i>a </i>to <b>208</b><i>c </i>being 2 to 50 atomic layers, 2 to 25 atomic layers, 2 to 20 atomic layers. At least a portion of the atomic layers <b>208</b><i>a </i>to <b>208</b><i>c </i>are each in at least one of a (111) crystalline arrangement, a (110) arrangement and a (001) crystalline arrangement. Within each of the atomic layers <b>208</b><i>a </i>to <b>208</b><i>c</i>, the catalyst atoms <b>220</b> are positioned next to each other in an organized crystalline structure. In this connection, a dimension along which the catalyst atoms <b>220</b> extend laterally, for instance in the directions of X and Y, is greater than a thickness dimension Z. The lateral dimension such as dimensions X and Y may be of at least 10 nanometers, 20 nanometers, 30 nanometers, 40 nanometers, 50 nanometers. By way of example, Pt atoms when closely packed are of about 0.27 nm in atom-to-atom distance. Therefore, 10 atomic layers of Pt atoms are of about 2.7 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring back to FIGS. <b>2</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>2</b>C<b>2</b>, the 2-D extensive catalyst <b>208</b> is presented in a pseudo-bulk configuration such that the catalytic metals behave, relative to conventional nano-particles, more like bulk metals. In this pseudo-bulk configuration, the catalyst <b>208</b> is presented as being x-axis and y-axis extensive relative to the z-axis. In certain instances, the thickness dimension along the z-axis may be in a range of 1 to 20 atomic layers, 2 to 16 atomic layers, or 4 to 10 atomic layers.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The substrate hairs <b>210</b> may have any suitable cross-sectional shapes, including the shapes of a round and a polygon such as triangles or rectangles. The substrate hairs <b>210</b> may have any suitable aspect ratios between an average length dimension and an average cross-sectional dimension. The aspect ratios of average length to cross-sectional dimensions may be no less than 1, 10, 50, 100, 150, or 200, and no greater than 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, or 500. The substrate hairs may be spaced apart from each other with an average distance in between an adjacent pair of the substrate hairs. The average distance may be no less than 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, or 150 nanometers, and no greater than 10,000, 5,000, 1,000, 500 or 250 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The substrate hairs <b>210</b> may be formed via thermal oxidation. A suitable method of thermal oxidation may be found in &#x201c;Formation of niobium oxide nanowires by thermal oxidation&#x201d; by Lim et al., Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry 15 (2009) 860-864. This illustrative method can be readily used to grow substrate hairs <b>210</b>. To the extent of providing technical support in forming the substrate hairs by thermal oxidation, relevant contents of the Lim et al. are incorporated herein by reference. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in relation to Example 1 depicts a non-limiting example of the thermal oxidation process by which the substrate hairs may be generated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4F</figref> depict, in various degrees of magnification, the shape and dimension of the substrate hairs generated from the thermal oxidation process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this connection, a corrosion-resistive and economically efficient metal or metal alloy material can be selected to form the substrate <b>200</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> can be thermal-oxidized in its entirety or partially to have hairs of metal oxides directly formed on the substrate <b>200</b>. The type and nature of the metal oxides can be varied according to the metal or metal alloy material selected for the substrate <b>200</b>. In addition, the pattern of growth and the length and width of the hairs <b>210</b>, and the spacing between the hairs <b>210</b> may further be adjustable based on the oxidation parameters chosen for the thermal oxidation.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one or more embodiments, the present invention is advantageous in that thermal oxidation is a versatile and simple method for generating substrate hairs in the enhancement of substrate surface areas. Thus, thermal oxidation process may provide a facile route to develop nano-structures on any suitable substrates. In addition, nano-structures dimensions, growth density, and other properties may be adjusted through oxidation parameters such that particular surface area values may be obtained. Non-limiting oxidation process parameters may include: temperature profile/history, substrate material and surface finishing, type and rate of gas flow over the substrate, and extent of humidification. For instance, substrate hairs of different dimensions may be obtained through the adjustment of oxidation duration.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one or more embodiments, the present invention is advantageous in that thermal oxidation may be used to generate nano-structures of metal oxides that are resistive to the corrosive environment typical of most electrochemical devices including fuel cells. In this connection, certain metals and their corresponding oxides are relatively more particularly suitable for providing additional catalytic areas in the fuel cells. Non-limiting examples of these metals include Silicon (Si), Iron (Fe), Tungsten (W), Niobium (Nb); and non-limiting samples of their corresponding oxides include SiO<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, WO<sub>x</sub>, NbO, NbO<sub>2</sub>, and Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>The availability of a wide range of metals and semi-conductor materials amenable to the thermal oxidation for growing nano-structures, the present invention is believed to be effective in widening design windows for catalytic surface area enhancement. For instance, niobium may be thermal oxidized to form niobium oxide substrate hairs. Niobium oxide is believed to be very stable in electrochemical environments and is largely corrosion resistive.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one or more embodiments, the present invention is advantageous in that thermal oxidation may help effect desirable catalyst and substrate interactions. Using the thermal oxidation method described herein, one can employ the oxide and catalyst support interaction to generate high surface area substrates; to generate more active catalysts through, for instance, electronic structure and lattice mismatch interactions between support and catalyst, or through promotion of the growth of favorable crystalline facets of the catalyst due to interaction between catalyst and support. By using higher surface energy support metal oxide materials, one can generate a more conformal coating of catalyst on the support as opposed to nucleating the catalyst on the support. As a result, conformal coating of the catalyst on support leads to a true thin film with minimal and uniform thickness thereby reducing the requisite catalyst loading.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one or more embodiments, the present invention is advantageous in that the nano-structures so formed can further be subject to one or more treatment coatings to enhance catalyst/substrate interactions and/or to promote catalyst growth. For instance, the nano-structures can be coated with a polymer or other suitable materials such as niobium oxide to provide enhanced resistance to corrosion. One or more of the treatment coatings may include polymers, metals, metal oxides, and/or semi-conductors to enhance durability/corrosion resistivity or promote formation of desirable facets on the catalyst. The treatment coating can be thick enough, for instance, 10 or more atomic layers, to reduce any potential electronic and structure effects of the oxide under-layer. Likewise, the treatment coating can be thin enough, for instance, less than 10 atomic layers, to facilitate interactions with the underlying oxide.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The thermal oxidation methods described herein will be detailed in relation to substrate hairs of copper oxide. However, it is appreciated that the methods are applicable to the production of other species of nano-substrate hairs and may be based on any other suitable metal and oxide materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For illustration purposes, only one substrate of copper is used and the air is used as the inlet gas. Effects of the inlet gas humidity and temperature on the configuration of the Cu on substrate hairs are examined. Examined also are two types of mesh substrates onto which the nano-wires are grown. Mesh #1, or a relatively coarse mesh, is a copper woven wire cloth mesh supplied by McMaster Carr, having the size of 100&#xd7;100 with a square size of 0.006&#x2033;, a wire diameter of 0.0045&#x2033;, and an open area percentage of 30%. Mesh #2, a relatively fine mesh, is a copper mesh supplied by e-forming having the size of 750&#xd7;750, with a wire diameter of 0.00034&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For this test, temperature is set at 400&#xb0; C., oxidation time is 4 hours, mesh #1 is used. The mesh is acid washed and cleaned with distilled water prior to the test. Lab air is used, which is not dry, and no external humidification is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">High oxygen pressure and/or the presence of water vapor in air may induce the formation of an oxidative environment, which may be attributable to the formation of Cu oxide substrate hairs. Vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) and/or vapor-solid (VS) may be used to facilitate the growth of substrate hairs in the gas phase.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4F</figref>, the grown substrate hairs appear to be about 50-100 nm in diameter with center to center (c/c) distances of 200-300 nm and up to 5 micron in length. A hexagonally grown array of substrate hairs being 100 nm in diameter, 200 nm in c/c distances, and 5 micron in length would generate a surface area of 40.25 cm<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>of the planar area. Assuming a linear growth of Cu on substrate hairs over time, the oxidation time may be shortened to be about 1.2 hours to grow substrate hairs of 1.5 micron in length corresponding to 12.8 cm<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>in planar area. To obtain a higher surface area, the substrate hairs may be grown to a length of 6.5 micron corresponding to 52 cm<sup>2</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>planar area and oxidation time may be extended to be around 5.2 hours. Given that the substrate hairs grown in the test are not necessarily grown in a hexagonal fashion, this surface area analysis can provide only an approximate. In general, this approximation analysis shows that with the diameter and density of the substrate hairs grown, the requisite surface area enhancements are achievable.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a second test, the temperature is raised up to 550&#xb0; C., and oxidation time is reduced to be about 2 hours. Mesh #2 is used. The mesh is acid washed and cleaned with distilled water prior to the testing. External humidification is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Base on the tests, it appears that increasing temperatures, reduced requisite oxidation duration, and/or the use of external humidification help facilitate the growth of finer CuO substrate hairs. Without wanting to be limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the CuO substrate hairs may have grown based on the Vapor Solid (VS) mechanism, wherein water molecules help affect the adsorption and break-up of oxygen molecules on the metal surface during oxidation. The formation of water molecules may also be affected by the presence of nitrogen and other gases in the oxidative environment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">While exemplary embodiments are described above, it is not intended that these embodiments describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation, and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Additionally, the features of various implementing embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments of the invention.</p>
