<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to telecommunications, and more particularly to enhancing the scalability of an Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) in Voice over IP (VoIP), Service over IP (SoIP), and the like, deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), in theory, is a traffic-independent scalable architecture. Various Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers can be deployed dynamically to users and such servers are distributed such that the capacity is extensible. However, SIP is a text-based signaling protocol and has a large message size. In some instances, the SIP response message may exceed that allowed for User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is typically the underlying protocol for layer 3 (i.e. the network layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model), thereby causing the fragmentation of the response message. Due to the large message size combined with the typical large number of SIP nodes/servers in IMS, a large number of messages are produced and complicated message flows must be processed, all of which reduces the scalability of IMS in, for example, an enterprise/business VoIP deployment. In addition, it should be noted that the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) (standard TS-23.228 V8.8.0. (2009-03) IMS System Architecture) does not specify how Quality of Service (QoS) within IMS is realized.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Setting up a multimedia communication session in IMS conventionally involves a two round procedure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In a first round, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a signal path is determined from a calling party to a called party. In a second round, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, resources for supporting the communication are negotiated and reserved. As illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each request to initiate a communications session requires multiple SIP messages to be transmitted. The number of messages transmitted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> multiplied by the number of communications sessions requested typically results in a large number of SIP messages transmitted which often results in messages being truncated and/or lost during transmission. What is needed is a way to initiate communications sessions with less signaling messages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a method and apparatus for establishing IMS communication sessions using a one round procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment of the present invention is a method for establishing an Internet Protocol Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) communication session having a predetermined Quality of Service. A request to establish an IMS communications session between a calling and a called party is received. Resources are then allocated for the communication session based on predetermined configuration information related to the parties and a signal path between the parties is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another embodiment of the present invention, resources associated with a called party are allocated in response to an indication that the called party accepts the request to establish the IMS communication session. According to another embodiment of the present invention, resources associated with a calling party network are allocated based on information contained in a request from the user equipment associated with the calling party.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other advantages of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a high level block diagram of an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) for providing IP based multimedia services. It should be noted that one or more functions may be run on a single implementer (i.e. specific hardware or a node) and that various embodiments may have one or more functions distributed across a number of implementers or nodes. Functions are conventionally linked by standardized interfaces which allow communication between the functions. Each of the functions of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> performs operations related to providing IP based multimedia services described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b> are IP Multimedia Subsystem User Equipment for the calling and called party, respectively. IMS User Equipment may comprise one or more of a variety of customer end point device (e.g. wireline or wireless phones, personal computers, laptop computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc.) IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b> are each located in their respective IMS networks, referred to herein as the calling party network <b>103</b> and the called party network <b>105</b>. IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b> communicate with one another and other functions in the IMS networks via a Peering Border Element (PBE), such as PBE1 <b>102</b> and PBE2 <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">PBE1 <b>102</b> and PBE2 <b>122</b> perform session border control and functions to control the one or more data streams related to a particular IMS communication session. PBE1 <b>102</b> and PBE2 <b>122</b> include functionality (e.g. security related functionality) to control the flow of data between an internal and an external network. PBE1 <b>102</b> and PBE2 <b>122</b> may each be, for example, a Session Border Control (SBC) which is used in some VoIP networks to exert control over the signaling and the media streams involved in setting up, conducting, and tearing down voice calls or other interactive media communications.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An IMS network includes multiple Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Servers which are known as Call Session Control Functions (CSCFs). The CSCFs are used to process SIP signaling packets and perform different functions as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A Proxy Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF) intercepts SIP INVITE messages and analyzes them to determine the desired called party and whether the messages contain logic requiring analysis by an Application Server (AS). The P-CSCF is usually a first point of contact for user equipment unless a Session Border Controller (SBC) such as PBE1 <b>102</b> described above is used to implement some of the functionality of the P-CSCF. The P-CSCF may inspect every message from user equipment and may also authenticate and establish a security association with the user equipment to prevent spoofing and replay attacks. A P-CSCF may also employ a Policy Decision Function (PDF) that authorizes resources in a media plane. For example, the P-CSCF may employ a PDF pertaining to the quality of service over the media plane for policy control or bandwidth management. The calling party and called party networks typically each have their own P-CSCFs such as P-CSCF1 <b>104</b> and P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. P-CSCFs are typically in communication with user equipment, either directly or through a session border controller such as PBE1 <b>102</b>, other CSCFs, and Application Servers (AS) and may be in communication with other devices in the IMS network as well.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An Application Server (AS) hosts and executes various services such as caller ID, call waiting, push to talk, etc. An AS may interface with Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) using Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to provide these services and the AS may operate in different modes depending on the service provided. The AS server may operate in SIP Proxy mode, SIP user agent mode, or SIP back to back user agent mode. An AS may be located in a home network, such as AS <b>108</b> shown in calling party network <b>103</b>, or in an external third party network.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A Home Subscriber Server (HSS), such as HSS <b>112</b>, is conventionally a master database that supports the IMS functions that actually handle communication sessions. An HSS contains information related to subscribers such as user profiles and performs authentication and authorization of a particular user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Server Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) is the central node of an IMS network and is conventionally an SIP server. The S-CSCF performs session control functions and handles SIP registrations which relate user locations and SIP addresses. An S-CSCF can inspect every message and determine which application server or servers an SIP message should be forwarded to. The S-CSCF routes messages using tElephone NUMbering (ENUM) lookups. There may be multiple S-CSCFs in a network in order to distribute communication session loads and increase availability. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an S-CSCF <b>106</b> and S-CSCF <b>114</b> are located in the calling party network <b>103</b> and the called party network <b>105</b>, respectively. An S-CSCF is in communication with various IMS functions including P-CSCFs, AS, HSS, and Interrogating-CSCFs (I-CSCFs) and may be in communication with other devices in the IMS network as well.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">I-CSCF2 <b>110</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> located in called party network <b>105</b> and in communication with S-CSCF2 <b>114</b>. An I-CSCF is an SIP function that may be located at the edge of an administrative domain. An IP address of the I-CSCF may be maintained in a Domain Name System (DNS) of the administrative domain thereby allowing remote servers to locate a specific I-CSCF and use it as a forwarding point for SIP packets to the administrative domain. An I-CSCF may be in communication with a HSS in order to determine subscriber locations and then route SIP messages to the appropriate S-CSCF.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, dashed lines indicate signaling channels and solid lines indicate bearer channels.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Initiation of a conventional IMS communication session between a calling party and a called party is briefly described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as follows. A communication session is initiated by a user via IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and an invitation is transmitted to S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> via PBE1 <b>102</b> and P-CSCF1-<b>104</b>. S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> accesses HSS <b>112</b> to retrieve a subscriber profile if necessary. S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> also communicates with AS <b>108</b> in order to determine and apply service logic as necessary. Domain Name Server (DNS) <b>118</b> may be accessed by S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> to retrieve the address of called party network <b>105</b> which allows the invitation to be transmitted from S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> to I-CSCF2 <b>110</b>. I-CSCF2 <b>110</b> determines the Registrar of the called party and subsequently transmits the invitation to S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> which is associated with the called party. The called party's subscriber profile may be retrieved from an HSS (not shown for clarity) associated with the called party similar to the retrieval described above related to the calling party. An AS (also not shown for clarity) associated with the called party may also be accessed by S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> to determine and apply any service logic as necessary. The invitation is then forwarded to IMS UE2 <b>116</b> via P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> and PBE2 <b>122</b>. Session Description Protocol (SDP) negotiation and resource reservation control then occur followed by ringing/alerting. Finally, in response to the called party answering the call, IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b> are connected through PBE1 <b>102</b>, PBE2 <b>122</b> and the bearer line connecting PBE1 <b>102</b> and PBE2 <b>122</b> as well as the bearer lines connecting IMS UE1 and IMS UE2 to their respective PBEs <b>102</b> and <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the functions described above are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and will not be described further herein except as necessary to describe various embodiments and implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show a conventional two round procedure for establishing an IMS communication session. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are described herein while referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to illustrate the conventional two round procedure for establishing an IMS communication session between IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b>. It should be noted that some of the functions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> (i.e. DNS <b>118</b>, and PBE 2 <b>122</b>) for clarity. The omitted functions may be included in various implementations as required or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In brief, the conventional two round procedure is effectuated as follows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, IMS UE1 <b>100</b> initiates the signal flow after a calling party attempts to initiate a communication session. Signals transmitted between various functions determine the called party as well as functions associated with the called party such as S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b>. After the called party is determined, the called party is alerted with a pre-alert indicating that the calling party would like to initiate a communication session. The pre-alert signal transmitted to the IMS UE2 <b>116</b> can be considered the end of the signal path round as there is now at least one known signal path between IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b>. If the called party is available and willing to accept the call, the resource reservation round shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> begins. It should be noted that at this point in the two round procedure, the numerous signals and messages transmitted between the functions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only determine a signal path between the calling and called parties. Additional signals and messages must be transmitted to reserve the resources required for the communication session as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Described briefly, the resource reservation round of the conventional two round procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> begins after it has been determined that the called party is available and willing to begin a communication session with the calling party. IMS UE2 <b>116</b> signals P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> to reserve resources associated with the called party for the communication session. P-CSCF 2 <b>120</b> signals PCSCF-1 <b>104</b> through S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> to reserve resources associated with the called party for the communication session. P-CSCF1 <b>104</b> then signals IMS UE1 <b>100</b> indicating that the resources for the call have been reserved. IMS UE1 <b>100</b> signals P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> indicating that the resources for the communication session are reserved and P-CSCF2 <b>120</b>, in turn, signals IMS UE2 <b>116</b> indicating same. Finally, IMS UE2 <b>116</b> signals IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and the communication session commences.</p>

In the path finding procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it should be noted that some steps may be eliminated, or additional steps added, depending on various configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In response to a calling party attempting to initiate a communications session, IMS UE1 <b>100</b> transmits an SIP INVITE message <b>200</b> containing a Session Description Protocol (SDP) message (SDP A) to PBE1 <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In response to SIP INVITE message <b>200</b>, PBE1 <b>102</b> transmits an informational response &#x2018;Trying&#x2019; message <b>202</b> to IMS UE 1 <b>100</b> and transmits INVITE message <b>204</b> to P-CSCF 1 <b>104</b>. INVITE message <b>204</b> also contains an SDP message (SDP B) containing information originally contained in the SDP A message. It should be noted that the designation &#x201c;A&#x201d; of the SDP A message indicates that the SDP message is sent from IMS UE1 <b>100</b> to PBE1 <b>102</b> and the designation &#x201c;B&#x201d; of the SDP B message indicates that the SDP message is sent from PBE1 <b>102</b> to P-SCSF1 <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In response to INVITE message <b>204</b>, P-CSCF1 <b>104</b> transmits INVITE message <b>208</b> to S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> which responds with Trying message <b>210</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In response to INVITE message <b>216</b>, S-CSCF1 transmits Trying message <b>218</b> to AS <b>108</b>. S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> also transmits INVITE message <b>220</b> to I-CSCF2 <b>110</b> which, in response, transmits Trying message <b>224</b> to S-CSCF1 <b>106</b>. In response to INVITE message <b>220</b>, I-CSCF2 <b>110</b> also transmits CX: LIR Message <b>226</b> to HSS <b>112</b> in order to determine the address of the S-CSCF allocated to the called party. In response to CX: LIR message <b>226</b>, HSS <b>112</b> transmits CX:LIA (S-CSCF 2) message <b>228</b> to I-CSCF2 <b>110</b>. In response to CX:LIA (S-CSCF2) message <b>228</b>, I-CSCF2 transmits INVITE message <b>230</b> to S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> which, in response, transmits trying message <b>232</b> to I-CSCF2 <b>110</b>. Also in response to INVITE message <b>230</b>, S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> transmits INVITE message <b>234</b> to AS <b>108</b> which, in response, transmits Trying message <b>236</b> to S-CSCF2 <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also in response to INVITE message <b>234</b>, AS <b>108</b> transmits INVITE message <b>238</b> to S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> which, in response, transmits trying message <b>240</b> to AS <b>108</b>. Also in response to INVITE message <b>238</b>, S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> transmits INVITE message <b>242</b> to P-CSCF1 <b>104</b>, which, in response, transmits trying message <b>244</b> to S-CSCF2 <b>114</b>. Also in response to INVITE message <b>242</b>, P-CSCF1 <b>104</b> transmits INVITE message <b>246</b> to PBE1 <b>102</b>. INVITE message <b>246</b> transmitted to PBE1<b>102</b> contains SDP B information and in response to message <b>246</b>, PBE1 <b>102</b> transmits trying message <b>248</b> to P-CSCF1 <b>104</b>. PBE1 <b>102</b> also transmits INVITE message <b>250</b> containing SDP A information to IMS UE2 <b>116</b> in response to INVITE message <b>246</b>. In response to INVITE message <b>250</b>, IMS UE2 <b>116</b> transmits trying message <b>252</b>. PBE1 <b>102</b> then sends Pre-Alert UE2 message <b>254</b> to IMS UE2 <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the called party, in this case the party associated with IMS UE2 <b>116</b>, is available, then the process of resource reservation to support the communication session occurs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a signaling diagram showing the resource reservation round of the conventional two round procedure that occurs after the path finding round shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is completed. IMS UE2 <b>116</b> transmits session progress message <b>300</b> to P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> which indicates to P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> that the called party is available for the requested communication session and P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> should allocate resources in the called party network for the session. P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> also transmits session progress message <b>302</b> to S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> which then transmits session progress message <b>304</b> to S-CSCF1 <b>106</b> which, in turn, transmits session progress message <b>306</b> to P-CSCF1 <b>104</b>. P-CSCF1 <b>104</b>, in response, allocates resources in the calling party network for the communication session. P-CSCF1 <b>104</b> then transmits session progress message <b>308</b> to IMS UE1 <b>100</b> indicating that the resources for the communication session have been allocated. IMS UE1 then transmits PRACK (Provisional Response ACKnowledgement) message <b>310</b> to P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> indicating that the resources for the communication session have been allocated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">PRACK message <b>310</b> is a provisional type response which is one of the two types of SIP responses, the other type being final. Final responses (designated as 2xx-6xx) convey the result of the requested processing and are sent reliably. Normal SIP provisional responses do not have an acknowledgement system and, as such, they are not reliable. This can create problems as there are certain scenarios in which the provisional SIP responses (designated as 1xx) must be delivered reliably. For example, in an SIP/PSTN inter-working scenario it is crucial that the 180 and 183 messages are not missed. The SIP PRACK method solves this problem by guaranteeing a reliable and ordered delivery of provisional responses in SIP.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In response to PRACK message <b>310</b> transmitted to P-CSCF2 <b>120</b>, PRACK message <b>312</b> is transmitted from P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> to IMS UE2 <b>116</b> indicating to IMS UE2 <b>116</b> that the resources for the communication session have been allocated and the communication session can commence. 200 OK message <b>314</b> is sent from IMS UE2 <b>116</b> to IMS UE1 <b>100</b> in response to PRACK message <b>312</b> and indicates to IMS UE1 <b>100</b> that the communication session can commence.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be noted that the transmission and receipt of PRACK messages ensure that adequate network resources (e.g. bandwidth) are available to support the requested communication session with the desired Quality of Service (QoS).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the conventional two round procedure to establish an IMS communication session requires that a large number of signaling messages be sent between various IMS functions. This is because the resource allocation round shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is performed after the signal path finding round shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. According to an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the amount of signaling required, and thus the number of messages sent, can be lowered using a one round procedure for establishing an IMS communication session which combines both the signal path finding round and the resource allocation round.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> depicts flow chart <b>459</b> illustrating one embodiment of the present invention can be performed using the IMS shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It should be noted that the functions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are modified as described below to facilitate the embodiment of the one round procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, at step <b>460</b>, a request to establish an IMS communication session is received. At step <b>462</b>, resources for the communication session are allocated based on predetermined configuration information related to the calling and called parties.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The predetermined configuration information, in one embodiment, pertains to the codecs and media both the calling and called party support. The predetermined configuration information may also include other information such as a predetermined quality of service for the communication session. The predetermined configuration information, in one embodiment, is based on prior peering business agreements pertaining to the codec and media the calling and called parties support in addition to information pertaining to a predetermined quality of service for communication sessions between the calling and called party.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Peering is the exchange of IP traffic between two directly interconnected IP networks, including best available router arrangement, codec combination, etc. Throughout the history of the Internet, there have been a spectrum of kinds of agreements between peers, ranging from handshake deals to peering contracts which may be required by one or both sides. Such a contract sets forth the details of how traffic is to be exchanged, along with a list of expected activities which may be necessary to maintain the peering relationship, a list of activities which may be considered abusive and result in termination of the relationship, and details concerning how the relationship can be terminated. Detailed contracts of this type are typically used between the largest ISPs, and the ones operating in the most heavily-regulated economies, accounting for about 1-2% of peering relationships overall.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the prior peering business agreements are stored on IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b>. In other embodiments, the prior peering business agreements may be stored and retrieved from an HSS or AS such as HSS <b>112</b> or AS <b>108</b> or other functions, implementers, or nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, the predetermined configuration information may be transmitted by IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and contained in an SDP A message included in SIP INVITE message. In one embodiment, IMS UE1 <b>100</b> may allocate the resources for a communication session first and IMS UE2 <b>116</b> follows the same path thereby eliminating the need for another round trip responsive message.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At step <b>464</b>, a signal path for the IMS communication session is determined, after which the communications session between the calling and called party may commence.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be noted that IMS UE1 <b>100</b> and IMS UE2 <b>116</b> used with the conventional two round procedure are normally programmed so that UE1 determines the codec used and responds to UE2. In one embodiment, in order to facilitate the one round procedure, IMS UE1 is configured to not send a response back to IMS UE2. In addition, IMS UE2 is configured to not expect confirmation from IMS UE1.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a signaling diagram depicting an implementation of one embodiment of the one round procedure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> according to one embodiment of the present invention. In response to a calling party requesting or attempting to initiate a communications session, IMS UE 1 transmits an SIP INVITE message <b>400</b> to PBE1 <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, SIP INVITE message <b>400</b> includes an SDP message (SDP A) which contains information such as the media content of the session and may also include other information such as what IP ports to use and information concerning codecs to be used. In one embodiment, SIP INVITE message <b>400</b> includes an SDP message containing additional information such as the media streams required for the communication session and the bandwidth requirement for the communication session. The SDP message, in one embodiment is an IETF RFC 2327 SDP message modified to include the additional information. In other embodiments, SIP message <b>400</b> does not contain an SDP message and information concerning the communication session is based on predetermined configuration information, which, in turn, is based on prior peering business agreements. Such predetermined configuration information may be stored in IMS UE1 and IMS UE2, an HSS, or an AS as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In response to SIP INVITE message <b>400</b>, PBE1 <b>102</b> transmits informational response Trying message <b>402</b> to IMS UE 1 <b>100</b> and transmits INVITE message <b>404</b> to P-CSCF 1 <b>104</b>.

In response, S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> transmits Trying message <b>440</b> to AS <b>108</b>. Also in response to INVITE message <b>438</b>, S-CSCF2 <b>114</b> transmits INVITE message <b>442</b> to P-CSCF2 <b>120</b>, which, in response, transmits Trying message <b>444</b> to S-CSCF2 <b>114</b>. Also in response to INVITE message <b>442</b>, P-CSCF2 <b>120</b> transmits INVITE message <b>446</b> to IMS UE2 <b>116</b>. INVITE message <b>446</b> includes SDP A message which indicates resources required for the communication session as well as the media and codecs to be used. INVITE message <b>446</b> also contains an alert indicating that IMS UE1 <b>100</b> is trying to establish a communication session with IMS UE2 <b>116</b>. In response to INVITE message <b>446</b>, IMS UE2 <b>116</b> transmits Trying message <b>448</b> to P-CSCF2 <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If IMS UE2 <b>116</b> is available, it will then examine the resource requirement identified in the SDP A message contained in INVITE message <b>446</b> and perform resource reservation (also referred to as resource allocation) to guarantee QoS for the IMS communication session. After the required resources are reserved, IMS UE2 <b>116</b> sends response message <b>450</b> to IMS UE1 <b>100</b> to confirm acceptance of the invitation to establish an IMS communication session. IMS UE1, in response to the received confirmation replies to IMS UE2 <b>116</b> with an SIP ACK message <b>452</b> which completes the call signaling set up procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If IMS UE2 <b>116</b> is not available, IMS UE1 <b>100</b> will receive an indication that IMS UE2 <b>116</b> is not available.

In one embodiment, the alert is transmitted from IMS UE2 <b>116</b>, in other embodiments, the alert to IMS UE1 to free up the advance QoS resource reservation may be transmitted by a different function or IMS UE1 <b>100</b> may free up the resources after a period of time interpreted as an indication that IMS UE2 <b>116</b> is not available.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It should be noted that an attempted communication session using the conventional two round procedure may fail if the called party and calling party do not support the same codec to be used for the communication session. The one round procedure described above will not fail due to the lack of a codec common to both the calling and called party because codec information is part of the predetermined configuration information and may be included in the peering business agreements between the called and calling parties.</p>
