<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Reference is made to commonly-assigned, U.S. Pat. No. 8,273,654, entitled &#x201c;PRODUCING A VERTICAL TRANSISTOR INCLUDING REENTRANT PROFILE&#x201d;, filed concurrently herewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, and in particular to vertical thin film transistor (VTFT) devices. Further, this invention relates to a method of atomic layer deposition of materials onto a substrate and the use of polymers as deposition inhibitor materials in selective deposition. This invention also relates to electronic devices prepared using this method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In semiconductor processing technology, planar substrate surfaces which are horizontal with respect to a wafer surface are patterned by photolithographic methods in combination with selective etching processes. During the processing of integrated circuits, reliefs with a pronounced topography are formed on the wafer or substrate surface. Typically, this type of relief includes surfaces which are inclined or vertical with respect to the substrate surface. As sizes of integrated circuits continue to shrink, it is becoming more and more necessary to pattern vertical or inclined device surfaces so as to functionally differentiate these devices over their vertical extent while still maintaining pattern alignment. Examples of these types of semiconductor devices include deep trench capacitors, stacked capacitors, and vertical transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, it is not possible to put patterns directly on walls which are vertical with respect to the substrate surface using conventional photolithographic techniques. Usually, vertical wall patterning of this nature is accomplished using a suitable filler material which, when partially filling in a trench, acts as a mask for the portions of the wall located underneath while allowing for processing of the walls above the filler material. For example, when an oxide is to be deposited exclusively on vertical walls below a filler material, the oxide is first deposited or produced over the entire surface of the relief. The relief or trench is initially completely filled with a suitable filler material. Then, the filler material is recessed back to a depth that just covers the desired oxide. After uncovered sections of the oxide are removed, the remaining filler material is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, when an oxide is to be deposited or produced only in upper regions of a vertical wall, an etching stop layer, for example, a nitride layer is first provided over the entire surface of the entire relief pattern. A different material, susceptible to directional etching, for example, polycrystalline silicon, is used to fill the relief, and is etched back as far as the desired coverage depth of the final vertical oxide. After the etching stop layer is removed from the unfilled sections of the walls, an oxide is deposited or generated using a thermal technique in the uncovered regions. Next, the oxide is anisotropically etched which removes the deposited oxide from horizontal. This is followed by removal of the filler material and, then, the removal of the etching stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are deposition processes which can be used to deposit thin films on vertical or inclined surfaces of a substrate relief. However, it is difficult to control the thickness of the layer deposited. Typically, the thickness of the coating decreases as the depth of the relief increases, for example, as the length of the vertical or inclined wall increases. As such, layers deposited using these types of deposition processes have considerable differences in thickness over the length of the relief. These types of deposition processes include plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and diffusion-limited deposition of silicon oxide using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Modern-day electronics systems require multiple patterned layers of electrically or optically active materials, sometimes over a relatively large substrate. Electronics such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, photovoltaics, and optical and chemical sensors all require some level of patterning in their electronic circuitry. Flat panel displays, such as liquid crystal displays or electroluminescent displays rely upon accurately patterned sequential layers to form thin film components of the backplane. These electronic components include capacitors, transistors, and power buses. The combination of photolithographic patterning methods and selective etch processes is commonly referred to as subtractive patterning. Subtractive patterning has several shortcomings including high cost, incompatibility with large substrates, and complexity of selective etch processes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As such, there is an ongoing need to provide semiconductor device components that include patterned vertical or inclined device surfaces. There is also an ongoing need to provide manufacturing techniques capable of processing small device features of semiconductor devices without requiring high resolution alignment tolerances. Further, the industry is continually looking for new methods of materials deposition and layer patterning for improved performance and the ability to produce large low cost electronics systems containing these semiconductor components.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, producing a vertical transistor includes providing a substrate including a gate material layer stack with a reentrant profile. A patterned deposition inhibiting material is deposited over a portion of the gate material layer stack and over a portion of the substrate. An electrically insulating material layer is deposited over a portion of the gate material layer stack and over a portion of the substrate using a selective area deposition process in which the electrically insulating material layer is not deposited over the patterned deposition inhibiting material. A semiconductor material layer is deposited over the electrically insulating material layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the invention, depositing the semiconductor material layer over the electrically insulating material layer can include depositing the semiconductor material layer over the electrically insulating material layer using a selective area deposition process in which the semiconductor material layer is not deposited over the patterned deposition inhibiting material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the invention, a source/drain material layer is deposited over discrete locations of the semiconductor material layer.</p>

A substrate <b>110</b> is provided including in order a first electrically conductive material layer <b>120</b> and a second electrically conductive material layer <b>130</b>. A resist material layer <b>140</b> is coated or deposited over second electrically conductive material layer <b>130</b>. Resist material layer <b>140</b> is patterned to expose a portion of second electrically conductive material layer <b>130</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the reentrant profile <b>170</b> is created by the removal of some of first electrically conductive material layer <b>120</b> while some of second electrically conductive material layer <b>130</b> remains. In this sense, it can be said that the reentrant profile <b>170</b> is created in conductive material layer <b>120</b> relative to electrically conductive material layer <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After removal of photoresist layer <b>140</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>), if such is necessary, a first deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b> is printed on the substrate <b>110</b> in regions where the subsequent layer or layers are not desired, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>. After printing of the first deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b>, the remaining exposed material layers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> and substrate <b>110</b> are conformally coated with an electrically insulating material layer <b>150</b>.

For example, after substrate <b>110</b> including conductive material layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> (the gate material layer stack) with reentrant profile <b>170</b> has been provided, electrically insulating material layer <b>150</b> is deposited over a portion of the gate material layer stack and over a portion of the substrate. A patterned deposition inhibiting material <b>500</b> is then deposited over the electrically insulating material layer. A semiconductor material layer <b>160</b> is then deposited over the electrically insulating material layer using a selective area deposition process in which the semiconductor material layer is not deposited over the patterned deposition inhibiting material. Optionally, the electrically insulating material layer can be patterned prior to depositing the patterned deposition inhibiting material.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, a schematic cross sectional view of transistor <b>100</b> material layers prior to material processing is shown. The manufacturing process for forming the vertical transistor device begins with a substrate <b>110</b> that is non-conductive, either in whole or in part with respect at least the portion of the substrate that is adjacent to conductive layer <b>120</b> (the top of the substrate <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>), such that electrical shorting of transistor <b>100</b> does not occur. Conductive layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are applied to or deposited onto substrate <b>110</b>. The combined conductive layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> function as the gate of transistor <b>100</b> and by the combined thickness of conductive layers <b>120</b> and <b>103</b> (in the vertical direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) defines a length of the gate by the combined thickness. A resist layer <b>140</b> is applied to conductive layer <b>130</b>. Resist <b>140</b> is patterned.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Substrate <b>110</b> does not interact appreciably with any of the layers or the processing methods. Substrate <b>110</b>, often referred to as a support, can be used for supporting the thin film transistor (also referred to as a TFT) during manufacturing, testing, or use. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a support selected for commercial embodiments can be different from one selected for testing or screening embodiments. In some embodiments, substrate <b>110</b> does not provide any necessary electrical function for the TFT. This type of substrate <b>110</b> is termed a &#x201c;non-participating support&#x201d; herein. Useful substrate materials include organic or inorganic materials. For example, substrate <b>110</b> can include inorganic glasses, ceramic foils, polymeric materials, filled polymeric materials, coated metallic foils, acrylics, epoxies, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyimides, polyketones, poly(oxy-1,4-phenyleneoxy-1,4-phenylenecarbonyl-1,4-phenylene) (sometimes referred to as poly(ether ether ketone) or PEEK), polynorbornenes, polyphenyleneoxides, poly(ethylene naphthalenedicarboxylate) (PEN), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ether sulfone) (PES), poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), and fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP). The thickness of substrate <b>110</b> can vary, typically from about 100 &#x3bc;m to about 1 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A flexible support or substrate <b>110</b> is used in some example embodiments of the present invention. Using a flexible substrate <b>110</b> allows for roll processing, which can be continuous, providing economy of scale and economy of manufacturing over flat or rigid supports. The flexible support chosen is preferably capable of wrapping around the circumference of a cylinder of less than about 50 cm in diameter, more preferably 25 cm in diameter, and most preferably 10 cm in diameter, without distorting or breaking, using low force as by unaided hands. The preferred flexible support can be rolled upon itself. Additional examples of flexible substrates include thin metal foils such as stainless steel provided the foils are coated with an insulating layer to electrically isolate the thin film transistor. If flexibility is not a concern, then the substrate can be a wafer or sheet made of materials including glass and silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some example embodiments, substrate <b>110</b> can include a temporary support or support layer, for example, when additional structural support is desired for a temporary purpose, e.g., manufacturing, transport, testing, or storage. In these example embodiments, substrate <b>110</b> can be detachably adhered or mechanically affixed to the temporary support. For example, a flexible polymeric support can be temporarily adhered to a rigid glass support to provide added structural rigidity during the transistor manufacturing process. The glass support can be remove from the flexible polymeric support after completion of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The conductive layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, commonly referred to as conductors, can be any suitable conductive material that permits conductive layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> to function as a gate. Conductive layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> can also be made of the same material. A variety of gate materials known in the art are also suitable, including metals, degenerately doped semiconductors, conducting polymers, and printable materials such as carbon ink, silver-epoxy, or sinterable metal nanoparticle suspensions. For example, the gate electrode can include doped silicon, or a metal, such as aluminum, chromium, gold, silver, nickel, copper, tungsten, palladium, platinum, tantalum, and titanium. Gate electrode materials can also include transparent conductors such as indium-tin oxide (ITO), ZnO, SnO2, or In2O3. Conductive polymers also can be used, for example polyaniline, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). In addition, alloys, combinations, and multilayers of these materials can be used. In addition the materials for conductor <b>120</b> and conductor <b>130</b> are preferable different and are chosen to facilitate creation of reentrant profile <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gate electrode can be deposited on substrate <b>110</b> using chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, evaporation, doping, or solution processing. In some embodiments of the invention, the same material can provide the gate electrode function and also provide the support function of substrate <b>110</b> provided substrate <b>110</b> also includes an insulating layer to electrically isolate transistor <b>100</b>. For example, doped silicon or silicon on insulator (SOI) can function as the gate electrode and support the TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The thickness (the vertical direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) of the gate electrode can vary, typically from about 100 to about 10000 nm. As the thickness defines the gate length, the thickness is usually thicker than twice the thickness of the conformally coated materials in order to reduce the likelihood of electrical shorting.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Conductive layer <b>130</b> is coated with a resist <b>140</b>. Resist <b>140</b> is patterned. Resist <b>140</b> can be a conventional photoresist known in the art such as a polymeric positive acting resist or a negative resist. Resist <b>140</b> is exposed through a mask with a low resolution (&#x3e;1 mm) alignment to substrate <b>110</b> and developed to yield a pattern of resist. In another example embodiment, the pattern of resist <b>140</b> is accomplished using a printing process, such as flexography or inkjet printing, that prints the resist directly in a patterned manner without using a mask.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, conductive layer <b>130</b>, commonly referred to as a conductor, is etched through patterned resist <b>140</b>. The etchant can be any organic or inorganic material which removes the nonconductive material without substantial attacking resist <b>140</b> or the underlying conductor layer <b>120</b>. Conductor <b>120</b> is then removed using a suitable etchant which removes the conductor <b>120</b> but has little impact on substrate <b>110</b> or the overlying conductive layer <b>130</b>. As such, the selected etchant often depends on the substrate <b>110</b>, the conductor <b>120</b>, or the conductor <b>130</b>. Etchant interaction with resist <b>140</b> and loss of the resist <b>140</b> at this point is usually of little consequence, since the conductor <b>130</b> now acts as a mask. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i>, the etching process or processes used, etch away portions of conductor <b>120</b> and conductor <b>130</b> such that conductor <b>120</b> and conductor <b>130</b> have the same pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, selective etching of conductor <b>120</b> is continued until the reentrant profile <b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>is formed. When etching of conductor <b>120</b> is complete, conductor <b>130</b> overhangs conductor <b>120</b> which creates a reentrant profile <b>170</b> that is sufficient to shield at least some of the underlying surface (of either conductor <b>120</b> or substrate <b>110</b>) from coating by a directional (or line-of-sight) coating source positioned above (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>) substrate <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At this point, if it is necessary, resist <b>140</b> is removed.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b> is printed on portions of the substrate <b>110</b> and gate conductive layer <b>130</b>. Printing of deposition layer <b>500</b> can be accomplished by various methods including an inkjet printing process, a flexographic printing process, a gravure printing process, and a photolithographic process. The deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b> is used to provide selective area deposition (SAD) of subsequent material layers in producing transistor <b>100</b>. SAD requires that designated areas of a surface be masked or &#x201c;protected&#x201d; to prevent reactions in those selected areas, thus ensuring that the desired layer nucleates and grows only on the desired unmasked regions. It is also possible to have SAD processes where the selected areas of the surface area are &#x201c;activated&#x201d; or surface modified in such a way that the film is deposited only on the activated areas. There are many potential advantages to selective area deposition techniques, such as eliminating an etch process for film patterning, reduction in the number of cleaning steps required, and patterning of materials which are difficult to etch. Two suitable approaches to combining patterning and depositing the semiconductor are described in US Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0081827 A1, published to Yang et al., on Mar. 26, 2009, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety; and U.S. Pat. No. 8,017,183 B2, issued to Yang et al., on Sep. 13, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Given that the preferred subsequent layers are deposited and conformally coated by atomic layer deposition (ALD), preferred deposition inhibitor materials are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,998,878 B2, issued to Levy et al., on Aug. 16, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In addition, deposition inhibitor materials are chosen to be compatible with printing on large flexible substrates in a low cost manner.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, although deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b> is shown as a rectangular annulus, it is noted that this is a view of a single transistor <b>100</b> and that a pattern of an array of adjacent transistors <b>100</b> can be created. This array of adjacent transistors <b>100</b> can be produced by printing patterns, for example, orthogonal lines, of deposition inhibitor material <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>, a dielectric nonconductive material <b>150</b> is then conformally coated only in regions that are not covered by deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b>, using a conformal coating deposition process over substrate <b>110</b> and the topographic feature formed by material layers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>. Applying nonconductive material <b>150</b> using a conformal coating process helps to maintain the reentrant profile <b>170</b>. Nonconductive material <b>150</b> is often referred to as the gate dielectric. Suitable nonconductive materials include strontiates, tantalates, titanates, zirconates, aluminum oxides, silicon oxides, tantalum oxides, titanium oxides, silicon nitrides, barium titanate, barium strontium titanate, barium zirconate titanate. As the dielectric material separates the gate conductor from the semiconductor material that is to be applied, it is important that the conformally coated material be provided with a consistent or uniform thickness at least in the region where the reentrant profile <b>170</b> and the gate are located.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Preferred processes for accomplishing conformal coating include atomic layer deposition (ALD) or one of its derivatives such as spatial ALD (S-ALD) or plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) because these processes yield a uniform thickness coating over or on a highly varying topology. ALD and S-ALD are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b</i>, a semiconductor material <b>160</b> is then conformally coated only in regions that are not covered by deposition inhibitor layer <b>500</b> (or layer <b>501</b>), using a conformal coating deposition process which helps to maintain the reentrant profile <b>170</b>. This conformal coating process can be the same process used previously to coat the dielectric material. Alternatively, the conformal coating process can be different. As the semiconductor material <b>160</b> acts as a channel between electrodes <b>700</b> and <b>800</b> when gate <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> is energized, it is important that the conformally coated material be provided with a consistent or uniform thickness at least in the region where the reentrant profile <b>170</b> and the gate are located and more preferable in the areas between electrode(s) <b>700</b> and electrode <b>800</b> including the area where the reentrant profile <b>170</b> and the gate are located. A preferred process for conformally coating is atomic layer deposition (ALD) or one of its various derivatives such as spatial ALD (S-ALD). This process yields a uniform thickness on a highly varying topology. ALD and S-ALD are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The semiconductor material layer <b>160</b>, often referred to as a semiconductor, can be any type of semiconductor provided the semiconductor material can be deposited or coated using a conformal coating process such as ALD. Examples of suitable semiconductor materials include zinc oxide, zinc chalcogenides, cadmium chalcogenides, gallium pnictides, aluminum nictides, or silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The semiconductor can optionally be doped with other materials to increase or decrease the conductivity. In some example embodiments, a depletion mode device is desirable, and therefore carriers can be added through the use of dopants. When the semiconductor is a zinc oxide, the use of an aluminum dopant, for example, increases the electron carrier density. In this configuration, the gate is typically used to turn off the device by making it negative relative to the drain and source.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A compensating dopant can also be used to deplete the intrinsic carrier density. When the semiconductor is zinc oxide, the use of nitrogen has been found to decrease the electron carrier density making it less n-type. In this configuration, the semiconductor can be made to operate in an accumulation mode to turn on the transistor when a positive gate voltage is applied. These dopants are often added as compounds during the growth process but can also be added after the semiconductor layer has been applied using a process such as ion implantation and thermal diffusion.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is a process which is used to produce coatings with thicknesses that can be considered consistent, uniform, or even exact. ALD produces coatings that can be considered conformal or even highly conformal material layers. Generally described, an ALD process accomplishes substrate coating by alternating between two or more reactive materials, commonly referred to a precursors, in a vacuum chamber. A first precursor is applied to react with the substrate. The excess of the first precursor is removed is removed from the vacuum chamber. A second precursor is then applied to react with the substrate. The excess of the second precursor is removed from the vacuum chamber and the process is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Recently, a new ALD process has been developed which negates the need for a vacuum chamber. This process, commonly referred to as S-ALD, is described in at least one of U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,413,982, 7,456,429, US 2008/0166884, and US 2009/0130858, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein. S-ALD produces coatings with thicknesses that can be considered consistent, uniform, or even exact. S-ALD produces coatings that can be considered conformal or even highly conformal material layers. S-ALD is compatible with a low temperature coating environment and provides the ability to use higher mobility materials when compared to other coating techniques. Additionally, S-ALD is compatible with web coating, making it attractive for large scale production operations. Even though some web coating operations may experience alignment issues, for example, web tracking or stretching issues, the architecture of the present invention reduces reliance on high resolution or very fine alignment features during the manufacturing process. As such, S-ALD is well suited for manufacturing the present invention.</p>
