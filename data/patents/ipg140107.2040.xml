<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method using directed self-assembly of BCPs enables the making of a master disk for nanoimprinting magnetic recording disks that have patterned data islands and patterned binary encoded nondata marks. The method uses guided self-assembly of a BCP to form patterns of sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps of one of the BCP components, which can be used as an etch mask to make the master disk. The sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps can be patterned so as to encode binary numbers. The pattern is replicated as binary encoded nondata marks into the nanoimprinted disks, with the marks functioning as binary numbers for data sector numbers and/or servo sector numbers. If the disks also use a chevron servo pattern, the binary numbers can function to identify groups of tracks associated with the chevron servo pattern.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to patterned-media magnetic recording disks, wherein each data bit is stored in a magnetically isolated data island on the disk, and more particularly to a method for making a master disk to be used for nanoimprinting the patterned-media disks with both data islands and binary encoded nondata marks.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Magnetic recording hard disk drives with patterned magnetic recording media have been proposed to increase data density. In patterned media, the magnetic recording layer on the disk is patterned into small isolated data islands arranged in concentric data tracks. To produce the required magnetic isolation of the patterned data islands, the magnetic moment of spaces between the islands must be destroyed or substantially reduced to render these spaces essentially nonmagnetic. In one type of patterned media, the data islands are elevated regions or pillars that extend above &#x201c;trenches&#x201d; and magnetic material covers both the pillars and the trenches, with the magnetic material in the trenches being rendered nonmagnetic, typically by &#x201c;poisoning&#x201d; with a material like silicon (Si). In another type of patterned media, the magnetic material is deposited first on a flat disk substrate. The magnetic data islands are then formed by milling, etching or ion-bombarding of the area surrounding the data islands. Patterned-media disks may be longitudinal magnetic recording disks, wherein the magnetization directions are parallel to or in the plane of the recording layer, or perpendicular magnetic recording disks, wherein the magnetization directions are perpendicular to or out-of-the-plane of the recording layer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One proposed method for fabricating patterned-media disks is by nanoimprinting with a template or disk, sometimes also called a &#x201c;stamper&#x201d;, that has a topographic surface pattern. In this method the magnetic recording disk substrate with a polymer film on its surface is pressed against the template. The polymer film receives the reverse image of the template pattern and then becomes a mask for subsequent etching of the disk substrate to form the pillars on the disk. In one type of patterned media, the magnetic layer and other layers needed for the magnetic recording disk are then deposited onto the etched disk substrate and the tops of the pillars to form the patterned-media disk. In another type of patterned media, the magnetic layers and other layers needed for the magnetic recording disk are first deposited on the flat disk substrate. The polymer film used with nanoimprinting is then pressed on top of these layers. The polymer film receives the reverse image of the template pattern and then becomes a mask for subsequent milling, etching or ion-bombarding the underlying layers. The template may be a master disk for directly imprinting the disks. However, the more likely approach is to fabricate a master disk with a pattern of pillars corresponding to the pattern of pillars desired for the disks and to use this master disk to fabricate replica templates. The replica templates will thus have a pattern of recesses or holes corresponding to the pattern of pillars on the master disk. The replica templates are then used to directly imprint the disks. Nanoimprinting of patterned media is described by Bandic et al., &#x201c;Patterned magnetic media: impact of nanoscale patterning on hard disk drives&#x201d;, <i>Solid State Technology S</i>7<i>+Suppl. S</i>, September 2006; and by Terris et al., &#x201c;TOPICAL REVIEW: Nanofabricated and self-assembled magnetic structures as data storage media&#x201d;, <i>J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. </i>38 (2005) R199-R222.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In patterned media, the bit-aspect-ratio (BAR) of the pattern or array of discrete data islands arranged in concentric tracks is the ratio of track spacing or pitch in the radial or cross-track direction to the island spacing or pitch in the circumferential or along-the-track direction. This is the same as the ratio of linear island density in bits per inch (BPI) in the along-the-track direction to the track density in tracks per inch (TPI) in the cross-track direction. The BAR is also equal to the ratio of the radial dimension of the bit cell to the circumferential dimension of the bit cell, where the data island is located within the bit cell. The bit cell includes not only the magnetic data island but also one-half of the nonmagnetic space between the data island and its immediately adjacent data islands. The data islands have a ratio of radial length to circumferential width, referred to as the island aspect ratio (IAR), that can be close to or greater than the BAR.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The making of the master template or disk is a difficult and challenging process. The use of electron beam (e-beam) lithography using a Gaussian beam rotary-stage e-beam writer is viewed as a possible method to make a master disk capable of nanoimprinting patterned-media disks with a BAR of about 1 with a track pitch (island-to-island spacing in the radial or cross-track direction) of about 35 nm, and an island pitch (island-to-island spacing in the circumferential or along-the-track direction) of about 35 nm. If the data islands have a radial length and circumferential width each of about 20 nm for an IAR of 1, then these dimensions generally limit the areal bit density of patterned-media disks to about 500 Gbit/in<sup>2</sup>. To achieve patterned-media disks with both an ultra-high areal bit density (greater than 1 Terabits/in<sup>2</sup>), a track pitch and an island pitch of about 20 nm will be required. However, a master disk capable of nanoimprinting patterned-media disks with these small dimensions over an area equal to the data area of a disk may not be practical given the speed of e-beam lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Directed self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) has also been proposed for making the master disk and is believed capable of achieving areal bit densities of greater than 1 Terabit/in<sup>2</sup>.

No. 7,976,715 B2, assigned to the same assignee as this application, describes the use of directed or guided self-assembly of block copolymers to form a pattern of generally radial lines on a master disk substrate, followed by conventional lithography to form a pattern of concentric rings over the radial lines. After removal of resist and one of the block copolymer components, the substrate has a pattern of pillars of the other block copolymer component, which are then used as an etch mask to etch the substrate into a pattern for nanoimprinting disks with discrete data islands arranged in concentric data tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patterned media disks are also required to have various types of nondata regions, such as synchronization marks that are used to time the reading and/or writing of data and marks in servo sectors that are used to position and maintain the read/write head on the desired data track. These nondata regions are typically interspersed circumferentially around the data tracks and extend across multiple data tracks. It is also necessary that certain of the nondata marks contain binary encoded information that can be read out, for example to identify the track number, the data sector number and/or the servo sector number. However, directed self-assembly of BCPs is capable only of forming the discrete data islands arranged in repetitive patterns in concentric tracks, and is not capable of forming patterned nondata regions simultaneously with the patterned data islands, and thus not capable of forming binary encoded nondata marks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What is needed is a master disk and a method for making it that can result in patterned-media magnetic recording disks with the required high areal bit density and with patterned nondata regions containing binary encoded nondata marks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention relates to a method using directed self-assembly of BCPs for making a master disk that has the required patterns for both the data islands and the nondata regions that contain binary encoded nondata marks. The master disk is used in the nanoimprinting process to make patterned-media disks that also have the required nondata regions formed at the same time as the patterned data islands.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method uses guided self-assembly of a BCP to form patterns of generally radial lines and circumferential gaps of one of the BCP components. The pattern of lines has the BCP components aligned as lamellae perpendicular to the substrate, while the pattern of circumferential gaps has the BCP components aligned as lamellae parallel to the substrate. One of the BCP components is removed, leaving the other BCP component as an etch mask. The pattern of the BCP component that serves as the etch mask comprises sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps, with the gaps preferably having the same gap width as the circumferential width of the sets of radial lines. The sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps can be patterned so as to encode binary numbers. The pattern is replicated as binary encoded nondata marks into the nanoimprinted disks, with the marks functioning as binary numbers for data sector numbers and/or servo sector numbers. If the disks also use a chevron servo pattern, the binary numbers can function to identify groups of tracks associated with the chevron servo pattern.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top view of a disk drive <b>100</b> with a patterned magnetic recording disk <b>10</b> as described in the prior art. The drive <b>100</b> has a housing or base <b>112</b> that supports an actuator <b>130</b> and a drive motor for rotating the magnetic recording disk <b>10</b> about its center <b>13</b>. The actuator <b>130</b> may be a voice coil motor (VCM) rotary actuator that has a rigid arm <b>134</b> and rotates about pivot <b>132</b> as shown by arrow <b>124</b>. A head-suspension assembly includes a suspension <b>121</b> that has one end attached to the end of actuator arm <b>134</b> and a head carrier <b>122</b>, such as an air-bearing slider, attached to the other end of suspension <b>121</b>. The suspension <b>121</b> permits the head carrier <b>122</b> to be maintained very close to the surface of disk <b>10</b>. A read/write head <b>109</b> that includes a magnetoresistive read head and an inductive write head are typically formed as an integrated read/write head patterned on the trailing surface of the head carrier <b>122</b>, as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The patterned magnetic recording disk <b>10</b> includes a disk substrate <b>11</b> and discrete data islands <b>30</b> of magnetizable material on the substrate <b>11</b>. The data islands <b>30</b> function as discrete magnetic bits for the storage of data and are arranged in radially-spaced circular tracks <b>118</b>, with the tracks <b>118</b> being grouped into annular bands <b>119</b><i>a, </i><b>119</b><i>b, </i><b>119</b><i>c. </i>In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only a few islands <b>30</b> and representative tracks <b>118</b> are shown in the inner band <b>119</b><i>a </i>and the outer band <b>119</b><i>c. </i>The grouping of the data tracks into annular zones or bands permits banded recording, wherein the angular spacing of the data islands, and thus the data rate, is different in each band. Within each band, the tracks are also circumferentially divided into a number of data fields or sectors, such as typical data sectors <b>164</b>. Each data sector <b>164</b> is preceded by a nondata field, which may be a synchronization (sync) field, such as typical sync fields <b>173</b>. The sync fields <b>173</b> are nondata regions that extend across multiple data tracks and are detectable by the read head for enabling synchronization of reading and writing the data bits in the data sectors <b>164</b>. The nondata sync fields <b>173</b> may also contain a data sector number for identifying the data sector.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As the disk <b>10</b> rotates about its center <b>13</b> in the direction of arrow <b>20</b>, the movement of actuator <b>130</b> allows the read/write head on the trailing end of head carrier <b>122</b> to access different data tracks <b>118</b> on disk <b>10</b>. Rotation of the actuator <b>130</b> about pivot <b>132</b> to cause the read/write head <b>109</b> on the trailing end of head carrier <b>122</b> to move from near the disk inside diameter (ID) to near the disk outside diameter (OD) will result in the read/write head making an arcuate path across the disk <b>10</b>. Each data track also includes a plurality of circumferentially or angularly-spaced servo sectors <b>150</b> that contain positioning information detectable by the read head for moving the head <b>109</b> to desired data tracks and maintaining the head <b>109</b> on the data tracks. The servo sectors in each track are aligned circumferentially with the servo sectors in the other tracks so that they extend across the tracks in a generally radial direction, as represented by radially-directed servo sectors <b>150</b>. The servo sectors <b>150</b> are nondata regions on the disk that are magnetized once, typically during manufacturing or formatting of the disk, and are not intended to be erased during normal operation of the disk drive.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of an enlarged portion of disk <b>10</b> showing the detailed arrangement of the data islands <b>30</b> in one of the bands on the surface of disk substrate <b>11</b> according to the prior art. While the islands <b>30</b> are shown as being circularly shaped, they may have other shapes, such as generally rectangularly or generally elliptical. The islands <b>30</b> contain magnetizable recording material and are arranged in tracks spaced-apart in the radial or cross-track direction, as shown by tracks <b>118</b><i>a</i>-<b>118</b><i>e. </i>The tracks are typically spaced apart by a nearly fixed track pitch or spacing TS. Within each track <b>118</b><i>a</i>-<b>118</b><i>e, </i>the islands <b>30</b> are roughly equally spaced apart by a nearly fixed along-the-track island pitch or spacing IS, as shown by typical islands <b>30</b><i>a, </i><b>30</b><i>b, </i>where IS is the spacing between the centers of two adjacent islands in a track. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, TS and IS are depicted as being equal, so the bit aspect ratio (BAR) is 1. The islands <b>30</b> are also arranged into generally radial lines, as shown by radial lines <b>129</b><i>a, </i><b>129</b><i>b </i>and <b>129</b><i>c </i>that extend from disk center <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Because <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows only a very small portion of the disk substrate <b>11</b> with only a few of the data islands, the pattern of islands <b>30</b> appears to be two sets of perpendicular lines. However, tracks <b>118</b><i>a</i>-<b>118</b><i>e </i>are concentric rings centered about the center <b>13</b> of disk <b>10</b> and the lines <b>129</b><i>a, </i><b>129</b><i>b</i>, <b>129</b><i>c </i>are not parallel lines, but radial lines extending from the center <b>13</b> of disk <b>10</b>. Thus the angular spacing between adjacent islands as measured from the center <b>13</b> of the disk for adjacent islands in lines <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>in a radially inner track (like track <b>118</b><i>e</i>) is the same as the angular spacing for adjacent islands in lines <b>129</b><i>a </i>and <b>129</b><i>b </i>in a radially outer track (like track <b>118</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The generally radial lines (like lines <b>129</b><i>a, </i><b>129</b><i>b, </i><b>129</b><i>c</i>) may be perfectly straight radial lines but are preferably arcs or arcuate-shaped radial lines that replicate the arcuate path of the read/write head on the rotary actuator. Such arcuate-shaped radial lines provide a constant phase position of the data islands as the head sweeps across the data tracks. There is a very small radial offset between the read head and the write head, so that the synchronization field used for writing on a track is actually read from a different track. If the islands between the two tracks are in phase, which is the case if the radial lines are arcuate-shaped, then writing is greatly simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Patterned-media disks like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be longitudinal magnetic recording disks, wherein the magnetization directions in the magnetizable recording material are parallel to or in the plane of the recording layer in the islands, or perpendicular magnetic recording disks, wherein the magnetization directions are perpendicular to or out-of-the-plane of the recording layer in the islands. To produce the required magnetic isolation of the patterned data islands, the magnetic moment of the regions between the islands must be destroyed or substantially reduced to render these spaces essentially nonmagnetic. Patterned media may be fabricated by any of several known techniques. In one type of patterned media, the data islands are elevated, spaced-apart pillars that extend above the disk substrate surface to define troughs or trenches on the substrate surface between the pillars. This type of patterned media is shown in the sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this type of patterned media the substrate <b>11</b> with a pre-etched pattern of pillars <b>31</b> and trenches or regions between the pillars can be produced with relatively low-cost, high volume nanoimprinting process using a master template or disk. The magnetic recording layer material is then deposited over the entire surface of the pre-etched substrate to cover both the ends of the pillars <b>31</b> and the trenches between the pillars <b>31</b>, resulting in the data islands <b>30</b> of magnetic recording layer material and trenches <b>32</b> of magnetic recording layer material. The trenches <b>32</b> of recording layer material may be spaced far enough from the read/write head to not adversely affect reading or writing to the recording layer material in islands <b>30</b>, or the trenches may be rendered nonmagnetic by &#x201c;poisoning&#x201d; with a material like Si.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view of patterned-media disk <b>10</b> with patterned nondata regions in three annular bands <b>119</b><i>a</i>-<b>119</b><i>c. </i>Each band includes a large number of individual data tracks with patterned data islands (not shown). The radial lines in each band represent nondata sync fields <b>173</b> that separate the data fields or sectors <b>164</b>. Thus each sync field <b>173</b> in a band extends radially across all the data tracks in its band. The sync fields <b>173</b> or other nondata fields preceding the data sectors <b>164</b> may also contain binary encoded nondata marks that represent a number for identifying the data sectors. The circumferential density of the sync fields <b>173</b> is similar in all three bands, with the angular spacing of the sync fields <b>173</b> being adjusted in the bands to have smaller angular spacing in the direction from the disk inside diameter (ID) to outside diameter (OD). The circumferential density of the sync fields <b>173</b>, and thus the &#x201c;linear&#x201d; or along-the-track density of data islands, stays relatively constant over all the bands on the disk. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are typical nondata servo sectors <b>150</b> that extend generally radially across all the bands. The servo sectors are generally equally-angularly spaced around the disk. In actuality, a typical disk is divided into about 20 annular bands, which allows the linear bit density to remain constant to within a few percent across all bands. Each annular band, like band <b>119</b><i>c, </i>has a band ID and a band OD. Also, in actuality the generally radial sync fields <b>173</b> and servo sectors <b>150</b> are more typically generally arcuate lines that replicate the path of the read/write head mounted on the end of the rotary actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic showing a portion of a patterned-media disk with a patterned nondata sync field <b>173</b> and a patterned nondata servo sector <b>150</b> spanning several data tracks, as proposed in the prior art. Eight full data tracks <b>118</b><i>a</i>-<b>118</b><i>h </i>are depicted. The read head is shown as positioned in data track <b>118</b><i>g </i>and will detect the sync field <b>173</b>, the data islands in data sector <b>164</b> in track <b>118</b><i>g </i>and the servo sector <b>150</b> as the disk rotates in the direction of arrow <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The sync field <b>173</b> is depicted with four individual sync marks as magnetized nondata islands <b>173</b><i>a</i>-<b>173</b><i>d </i>separated by nonmagnetic spaces. The sync marks extend across the data tracks in the radial direction, resulting in a single-frequency pattern suitable for locking a phase-locked-loop data clock prior to reading or writing data bits in the data sectors <b>164</b>. The sync field <b>173</b> precedes the data sector <b>164</b>, which shows several data islands, represented as solid lines. The sync field <b>173</b>, or a separate nondata field that also extends across all the tracks in a data sector <b>164</b>, may also contain binary encoded nondata marks that represent a number for identifying the data sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The patterned-media disk <b>10</b> also includes patterned servo sectors <b>150</b>. The servo sector <b>150</b> includes a servo-timing-mark (STM) field, a track ID (TID) field and a position-error-signal (PES) field. The STM and TID extend radially across multiple data tracks, typically across at least all the data tracks in an annular band. The STM field, or a separate nondata field, may also contain binary encoded nondata marks that represent a number for identifying the servo sectors. In the patterned-media disk as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the PES field in each of the servo sectors <b>150</b> includes a V-shaped pattern or inverted V-shaped pattern (sometimes called a chevron pattern) of circumferentially adjacent fields <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b </i>of parallel non-radial magnetized stripes <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>, respectively. The stripes <b>186</b> in field <b>150</b><i>a </i>are slanted in one direction (to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) relative to data tracks <b>118</b> at an acute angle &#x3b8;, and the stripes <b>188</b> in field <b>150</b><i>b </i>are slanted in a different direction (to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) relative to data tracks <b>118</b> at an acute angle, preferably the same angle &#x3b8;. The stripes <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> are thus also slanted relative to a radial line by an acute angle (90&#x2212;&#x3b8;). The stripes <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> are preferably magnetized in the same direction, i.e., in a direction either perpendicularly into or out of the plane of the disk substrate <b>11</b>, preferably by being DC-magnetized after the disk has been fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A chevron servo pattern is well-known for conventional disk drives with conventional non-patterned media. The readback signal registers a sinusoid as the read head passes over each of the two fields of the chevron pattern. If the radial position of the head varies, the phase of one sinusoid will be advanced while the phase of the other sinusoid will be retarded. Thus the radial position of the head can be estimated by measuring the phase difference between the two sinusoidal readback signals. Single-frequency Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods can generate the necessary phase estimates and are near-maximum-likelihood estimators in the presence of white noise and if the signals are high density. More complex estimators based on non-sinusoidal inputs or more general noise phenomenon can achieve somewhat better performance. The measured phase difference from a chevron servo pattern yields only the fractional part of the head radial position, i.e., the fractional part of one complete radial span of the chevron pattern (which is four data tracks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), because the phase measurement will be the same result for two head positions differing by an integer multiple of the chevron pattern period. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the chevron pattern repeats every four data tracks. Thus in the conventional servo system with a chevron servo pattern, the integer part of the radial head position, i.e. the actual track number, is typically determined by demodulation of a gray-coded TID, which is typically located near the start of a servo sector before the chevron pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a servo system for patterned media, like the one shown in this invention, the stripes <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> in the chevron servo fields <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b </i>are continuous stripes of magnetized material, which will generate a conventional readback signal like that from the well-known chevron servo pattern. However, the stripes <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> may alternatively be comprised of discrete magnetized segments circumferentially spaced with same spacing BP as the data islands, as described in application Ser. No. 12/604,333, assigned to the same assignee as this application. In such an alternative approach, the readback signal would respond to the magnetized segments separated in the circumferential direction by, and at the same time would also be modulated by the spacing and acute angle of the non-radial stripes <b>186</b>, <b>188</b>. The result would be a readback signal whose amplitude is modulated by an &#x201c;envelope&#x201d; that is similar to the sinusoidal signal from a conventional chevron servo pattern as explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> all of the islands in sync field <b>173</b> and servo sector <b>150</b> are discrete islands of magnetic material and are magnetized in the same direction, either perpendicular to the recording layer (either into or out of the paper in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for perpendicular-recording media, or in the plane of the recording layer (either to the right or left in the along-the-track direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for horizontal-recording media. The islands are typically DC-magnetized by a large magnet during manufacturing. Each discrete island is a magnetized island separated from other islands by nonmagnetic spaces represented as <b>190</b>. The term &#x201c;nonmagnetic&#x201d; means that the spaces <b>190</b> between the islands are formed of a nonferromagnetic material, such as a dielectric, or a material that has no substantial remanent moment in the absence of an applied magnetic field, or a magnetic material in a groove or trench recessed far enough below the islands to not adversely affect reading or writing. The nonmagnetic spaces <b>190</b> may also be the absence of magnetic material, such as grooves or troughs in the magnetic recording layer or disk substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the nondata islands (sync field <b>173</b> and servo sector <b>150</b>) have a frequency substantially lower than the data islands (data sector <b>164</b>). This is because for a given resolution of the read head, a modern partial-response (PR) read channel in the disk drive's read/write electronics <b>113</b> can handle linear bit densities with a period smaller than the resolution of the read head.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The making of the master template or disk to achieve an ultrahigh density patterned-media disk is a difficult and challenging process. The use of electron beam (e-beam) lithography using a Gaussian beam rotary-stage e-beam writer is viewed as a possible method to make a master disk capable of nanoimprinting patterned-media disks with a BAR of about 1 with a track pitch (island-to-island spacing in the radial or cross-track direction) of about 35 nm, and an island pitch (island-to-island spacing in the circumferential or along-the-track direction) of about 35 nm. If the data islands have a radial length and circumferential width each of about 20 nm for an island aspect ratio (IAR) of 1, then these dimensions generally limit the areal bit density of patterned-media disks to about 500 Gbit/i<sup>n2</sup>. To achieve patterned-media disks with both an ultra-high areal bit density (greater than 1 Terabits/i<sup>n2</sup>), a track pitch and an island pitch of about 25 nm will be required. However, a master disk capable of nanoimprinting patterned-media disks with these small dimensions over an area equal to the data area of a disk is not achievable with the resolution of e-beam lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Directed self-assembly of BCPs has also been proposed for making the master disk and is believed capable of achieving areal bit densities of greater than 1 Terabit/in<sup>2 </sup>. U.S. Pat. No. 7,976,715 B2, assigned to the same assignee as this application, describes the use of directed self-assembly of BCPs to form a pattern of generally radial lines on a master disk substrate, followed by a pattern of concentric rings over the radial lines. After removal of resist and one of the BCP components, the substrate has a pattern of pillars of the other BCP component, which are then used as an etch mask to etch the substrate. This results in a master disk with pillars of substrate material corresponding to the desired pattern of data islands for the patterned-media disks. However, the prior art method of directed self-assembly of BCPs is not capable of simultaneously forming the patterned data islands and nondata regions that extend across multiple tracks, and is thus not capable of forming binary encoded nondata marks that extend across multiple tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention relates to a method using directed self-assembly of BCPs for making a master disk that has the required patterns for both the data islands and the nondata regions, and wherein the nondata regions contain binary encoded nondata marks. The binary encoded nondata marks may be used, for example, for data sector numbers, servo sector numbers or track group numbers for chevron servo patterns. The master disk is used in the nanoimprinting process to make patterned-media disks that also have the required nondata regions with binary encoded nondata marks formed at the same time as the patterned data islands. The binary encoded nondata marks extend across multiple data tracks, either as continuous radial lines or as segmented radial lines with the line segments being aligned with the data tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method uses guided self-assembly of a BCP to form patterns of generally radial lines and/or generally concentric rings as well as patterns of gap regions of one of the BCP components. The pattern of lines and/or rings have the BCP components aligned as lamellae perpendicular to the substrate, while the pattern of gap regions has the BCP components aligned as lamellae parallel to the substrate. One of the BCP components is removed, leaving the other BCP component as an etch mask to fabricate either the final master disk or two separate molds that are then used to fabricate the master disk.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Self-assembling BCPs have been proposed for creating periodic nanometer (nm) scale features. A self-assembling BCP typically contains two or more different polymeric block components, for example components A and B, that are immiscible with one another. Under suitable conditions, the two or more immiscible polymeric block components separate into two or more different phases or microdomains on a nanometer scale and thereby form ordered patterns of isolated nano-sized structural units. There are many types of BCPs that can be used for forming the self-assembled periodic patterns. If one of the components A or B is selectively removable without having to remove the other, then an orderly arranged structural units of the un-removed component can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Specific examples of suitable BCPs that can be used for forming the self-assembled periodic patterns include, but are not limited to: poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA), poly(ethylene oxide-block-isoprene) (PEO-b-PI), poly(ethylene oxide-block-butadiene) (PEO-b-PBD), poly(ethylene oxide-block-styrene) (PEO-b-PS), poly(ethylene oxide-block-methylmethacrylate) (PEO-b-PMMA), poly(ethyleneoxide-block-ethylethylene) (PEO-b-PEE), poly(styrene-block-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-PVP), poly(styrene-block-isoprene) (PS-b-PI), poly(styrene-block-butadiene) (PS-b-PBD), poly(styrene-block-ferrocenyldimethylsilane) (PS-b-PFS), poly(butadiene-block-vinylpyridine) (PBD-b-PVP), poly(isoprene-block-methyl methacrylate) (PI-b-PMMA), and poly(styrene-block-dymethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The specific self-assembled periodic patterns formed by the BCP are determined by the molecular volume ratio between the first and second polymeric block components A and B. When the ratio of the molecular volume of the second polymeric block component B over the molecular volume of the first polymeric block component A is less than about 80:20 but greater than about 60:40, the BCP will form an ordered array of cylinders composed of the first polymeric block component A in a matrix composed of the second polymeric block component B. When the ratio of the molecular volume of the first polymeric block component A over the molecular volume of the second polymeric block component B is less than about 60:40 but is greater than about 40:60, the BCP will form alternating lamellae composed of the first and second polymeric block components A and B. In the present invention, the un-removed component is to be used as an etch mask, so ordered arrays of alternating lamellae and alternating cylinders are of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The periodicity or bulk period (L<sub>0</sub>) of the repeating structural units in the periodic pattern is determined by intrinsic polymeric properties such as the degree of polymerization N and the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter &#x3c7;. L<sub>0 </sub>scales with the degree of polymerization N, which in turn correlates with the molecular weight M. Therefore, by adjusting the total molecular weight of the BCP of the present invention, the bulk period (L<sub>0</sub>) of the repeating structural units can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To form the self-assembled periodic patterns, the BCP is first dissolved in a suitable solvent system to form a BCP solution, which is then applied onto a surface to form a thin BCP layer, followed by annealing of the thin BCP layer, which causes phase separation between the different polymeric block components contained in the BCP. The solvent system used for dissolving the BCP and forming the BCP solution may comprise any suitable non-polar solvent, including, but not limited to: toluene, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA), propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME), and acetone. The BCP solution can be applied to the substrate surface by any suitable techniques, including, but not limited to: spin casting, coating, spraying, ink coating, dip coating, etc. Preferably, the BCP solution is spin cast onto the substrate surface to form a thin BCP layer. After application of the thin BCP layer onto the substrate surface, the entire substrate is annealed to effectuate microphase segregation of the different block components contained by the BCP, thereby forming the periodic patterns with repeating structural units.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The BCP films in the above-described techniques self-assemble without any direction or guidance. This undirected self-assembly results in patterns with defects so it is not practical for applications that require long-range ordering, such as for making annular bands of radial lines on a master disk for nanoimprinting patterned-media disks. However, directed or guided self-assembly of a BCP to form patterns of generally radial lines and/or generally concentric rings of one of the BCP components is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,976,715 B2, assigned to the same assignee as this application.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a first implementation of the invention two separate molds are fabricated, one with generally radial lines and circumferential gap regions and one with generally concentric rings and possibly gap regions. The radial lines are formed as sets with a fixed number of radial lines. The sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps can represent a binary 1 or 0, and can be patterned to form binary encoded numbers. The two molds are then used to make the master disk. The method for making each mold is explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6J</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> , <b>6</b>E-<b>6</b>G and <b>6</b>J are side sectional views, at various stages of the fabrication method, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6D</figref>, <b>6</b>H and <b>6</b>I are top views at various stages of the method. The method will be described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6J</figref> for making a mold with generally radial lines and gap regions, but the method is identical for making a mold with generally concentric rings and circumferential gap regions that divide the rings into sections of rings.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the substrate <b>200</b> comprises a base <b>200</b>, which may be formed of any suitable material, such as, but not limited to, single-crystal Si, amorphous Si, silica, quartz, silicon nitride, carbon, tantalum, molybdenum, chromium, alumina and sapphire. A nearly neutral layer <b>205</b> of a material that does not show a strong wetting affinity by one of the polymer blocks over the other, that will be referred to as &#x201c;neutral layer&#x201d;, is deposited onto the substrate <b>200</b>. The neutral layer can be, but is not restricted to, a functionalized polymer brush, a cross-linkable polymer, a functionalized polymer &#x201c;A&#x201d; or &#x201c;B&#x201d; or a functionalized random copolymer &#x201c;A-r-B&#x201d;. The functional group may be, for example, a hydroxyl group. In the present example, the neutral layer <b>205</b> is a hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene brush of lower molecular weight than the BCP used. The brush material is spin-coated on substrate <b>200</b> to a thickness of about 1-10 nm (below 6 nm is preferred). The purpose of the neutral layer is to tune the surface energy adequately to promote the desired domain orientation (perpendicular lamellae) and to provide the adequate wetting conditions for density multiplication.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> a resist layer has been deposited on neutral layer <b>205</b> and patterned into generally radial bars <b>210</b> of resist. The resist may be a positive e-beam resist like poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) or ZEP520 from Zeon Chemicals, L.P. The resist layer is patterned by e-beam and developed to form the pattern of radial bars <b>210</b> separated by radial stripes <b>211</b> and by a radial gap region <b>211</b><i>a </i>that expose portions of neutral layer <b>205</b>. The e-beam tool patterns the resist layer so that the radial stripes <b>211</b> have a circumferential spacing or stripe pitch that is approximately an integer multiple of L<sub>0 </sub>(i.e., nL<sub>0</sub>), the known bulk period for the selected BCP that will be subsequently deposited. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, n is 2. The e-beam tool also patterns the resist layer so that the gap region <b>211</b><i>a </i>has the desired circumferential width. Only one gap region <b>211</b><i>a </i>is depicted, but there would typically be multiple gap regions circumferentially spaced around the substrate to help form the nondata regions in the nanoimprinted disk. The circumferential width of each radial stripe <b>211</b> is selected to be approximately 0.5 L<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the structure is etched, by a process of oxygen plasma reactive ion etching (O<sub>2 </sub>RIE), to remove portions of neutral layer <b>205</b> in the radial stripes <b>211</b> and gap region <b>211</b><i>a, </i>which exposes the substrate <b>200</b>. Alternatively, the chemical structure of the exposed portions of neutral layer <b>205</b> in the radial stripes <b>211</b> and gap region <b>211</b><i>a </i>can be chemically damaged or altered (by oxygen plasma etching or other process such as reactive ion etching, neutral atom (such as Ar) or molecule milling, ion bombardment and photodegradation) so that the exposed portions of neutral layer <b>205</b> have a preferred affinity (or repulsion) for one of the copolymers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, which is a top view, the resist <b>210</b> is removed, leaving on the substrate <b>200</b> a pattern of generally radial bars <b>205</b> of polymer brush material and generally radial stripes <b>200</b> and gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>of exposed substrate (or chemically altered neutral layer material). In this pattern the generally radial stripes <b>200</b> have a circumferential width of 0.5 L<sub>0 </sub>and a circumferential pitch of 2 L<sub>0 </sub>and the gap region has a circumferential width greater than 2 L<sub>0</sub>. Because <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> is only a very small portion of the master disk, the stripes <b>200</b> and gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>appear as parallel stripes. However, the stripes <b>200</b> and gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>are arranged generally radially, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The stripes <b>200</b> and gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>may be perfectly radially straight but are preferably arcs or arcuate-shaped so as to replicate the arcuate path of the read/write head on the rotary actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref>, a layer <b>220</b> of BCP material is deposited over the radial bars <b>205</b> of brush material and onto the exposed substrate <b>200</b>. The preferred BCP material is the lamellae-forming diblock copolymer polystyrene-block-polymethylmethacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) with L<sub>0 </sub>between about 8 nm and 30 nm and is deposited by spin coating to a thickness of about 0.5 L<sub>0 </sub>to 3 L<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>, the BCP layer has been annealed, for example by heating to about 250&#xb0; C. for approximately 60 minutes under nitrogen atmosphere, which results in phase separation between the A and B components contained in the BCP. Alternatively, the BCP can be &#x201c;annealed&#x201d; by exposure to vapor that is the same or similar to the non-polar solvent that was used to dissolve the BCP into solution. The exposure to vapor, also called &#x201c;solvent annealing&#x201d;, will lower the glass transition temperature Tg of the BCP layer below room temperature when exposed to the vapor. After the vapor is removed (or purged) the A and B components of the BCP will be in their final phase-separated state. In this example, the B component (PMMA) has an affinity for the substrate surface <b>200</b> (or for the polar groups of the chemically altered neutral layer material) and thus form as generally radial lines <b>215</b> on top of the radial stripes <b>200</b>. Because the circumferential width of the stripes <b>200</b> is approximately 0.5 L<sub>0</sub>, the A component (PS) form in adjacent radial lines <b>212</b> on the radial bars <b>205</b> of polymer brush material. As a result of the self-assembly of the A and B components this causes the B component to also form as generally radial lines <b>215</b> on the centers of each radial bar <b>205</b> of polymer brush material. The generally radial stripes <b>200</b> thus guide the self-assembly of the PS and PMMA components to form the alternating radial lines <b>212</b>, <b>215</b> in the structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>. The A and B BCP components in the radial lines <b>212</b>, <b>215</b> become arranged as lamellae perpendicular to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the A and B components prefer to self-assemble in parallel lines <b>212</b>, <b>215</b> with a period of L<sub>0</sub>, the substrate pattern of radial stripes <b>200</b> guides the alternating lines <b>212</b>, <b>215</b> to form as radial lines, which means that that L<sub>0 </sub>cannot be constant over the entire radial length. However, a pattern of alternating radial lines <b>212</b>, <b>215</b> can be accomplished without any significant defects if the variation from L<sub>0 </sub>does not exceed approximately 10 percent. Thus, to achieve this, the circumferential spacing of the radial stripes <b>200</b> at the band ID should not be less than about 0.9 nL<sub>0 </sub>and the circumferential spacing of the radial stripes <b>200</b> at the band OD should not be greater than about 1.1 nL<sub>0 </sub>(n is an integer).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">However, because the exposed gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>of the substrate has a circumferential width greater than 2 L<sub>0</sub>, the A and B BCP components cannot form as lamellae perpendicular to the substrate but instead become arranged as lamellae parallel to the substrate. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref> with A component <b>222</b> on substrate <b>200</b> in gap region <b>200</b><i>a, </i>B component <b>225</b> on top of the lower A component <b>222</b>, and A component <b>222</b> on top of B component <b>225</b>, all oriented as lamellae parallel to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</figref>, the B component (PMMA) is selectively removed by a wet etch (acetic acid, IPA or other selective solvent) or a dry etch process (O<sub>2 </sub>RIE), leaving generally radial lines <b>212</b> of the A component (PS) arranged as lamellae perpendicular to the substrate and the A component <b>222</b> (and underlying B component <b>225</b>) in gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>arranged as a lamellae parallel to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref> is a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</figref> and shows the generally radial A-component lines <b>212</b> (oriented perpendicular to the substrate) with a circumferential spacing L<sub>0 </sub>and the A-component <b>222</b> (oriented parallel to the substrate) in gap region <b>200</b><i>a. </i>In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref> the circumferential density of radial lines <b>212</b> has been doubled from the circumferential density of radial stripes <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>. The A-component radial lines <b>212</b> and A-component <b>222</b> in gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>are then used as an etch mask to etch away unprotected portions of the substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the substrate <b>200</b> has been etched, the A-component radial lines <b>212</b> (and underlying neutral layer <b>205</b>) and the A-component <b>222</b> (and underlying B-component <b>225</b>) are removed by a O<sub>2 </sub>RIE process or by forming gas RIE or ashing or by a wet process. The resulting structure is shown in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6I</figref> and the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6J</figref>. The etched substrate has etched recesses <b>214</b> which are arranged as generally radial lines with a circumferential spacing L<sub>0</sub>. Because the gap region <b>224</b> (and its two adjacent radial lines) were protected by the A-component etch mask, no recesses were formed in this area. The gap region <b>224</b> is now the surface of substrate <b>200</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6J</figref>) with a circumferential gap width equal to the gap width of the A-component lamellae parallel to the substrate (which is greater than 2 L<sub>0</sub>) plus the circumferential width of the two adjacent radial lines of the A component (L<sub>0</sub>). The portions of the substrate that were protected by the A-component etch mask can be considered as substrate pillars separated by recesses, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6J</figref>. The etched substrate <b>200</b> can now function as a first mold to be used to pattern generally radial lines and gap regions in the making of the master disk.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this invention the process described above for making the mold shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6I-6J</figref> is used to form binary encoded patterns that will replicate into the completed nanoimprinted disks. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is a top view of a mold like the top view of the mold shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6I</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there are two radial recesses <b>214</b> and two non-recessed regions <b>214</b><i>a </i>in each radial line set and each set represents a binary 1. In this example the circumferential width of a radial line set is 2 L<sub>0 </sub>but can be made larger. Each circumferential gap preferably has a gap width equal to the circumferential width of a set of radial lines and represents a binary 0. The binary 0 and 1 can be selected to be either the sets of radial lines or the circumferential gaps, and there can be more than two radial recesses in each radial line set. Thus the binary encoded pattern of sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps will replicate into the nanoimprinted disks and can be used as data sector numbers (such as in nondata fields <b>173</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or as servo sector numbers (such as in nondata servo fields <b>150</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that extend across multiple data tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The same process as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6J</figref> can be used to make the second mold to be used to pattern concentric rings and optional circumferential gap regions in the making of the master disk. The only difference is that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> the resist layer deposited on neutral layer <b>205</b> is patterned into concentric bars <b>210</b> of resist with concentric stripes <b>211</b> and optional circumferential gap regions <b>200</b><i>a. </i>An example of the patterning of the resist layer for the mold to make the concentric rings is shown in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The e-beam tool patterns the resist layer so that the concentric stripes <b>211</b> between the concentric bars <b>205</b> have a radial width of 0.5 L<sub>0 </sub>and a radial spacing or stripe pitch that is approximately an integer multiple of L<sub>0 </sub>(i.e., nL<sub>0</sub>, where n=2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), where L<sub>0 </sub>is the known bulk period for the selected BCP that will be subsequently deposited and which may have a different value of L<sub>0 </sub>from the one used in forming the radial lines. The gap region <b>200</b><i>a </i>separates the concentric bars <b>205</b> into circumferentially spaced sections of concentric bars.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">To make the master disk using the two molds, one with the pattern of generally radial lines and gap regions and the other with the pattern of generally concentric rings, the master disk substrate is covered with a protective layer and a resist layer. The master disk substrate may be formed of any suitable material, such as, but not limited to, single-crystal Si, amorphous Si, silica, quartz, silicon nitride, carbon, tantalum, molybdenum, chromium, alumina and sapphire. The protective layer may be formed of Cr, SiO<sub>2</sub>, or multilayers thereof. The first mold, for example the one with radial lines (with or without gap regions), is impressed on the resist layer, and the resulting resist pattern is used as an etch mask to etch away the protective layer not covered by the resist, leaving lines of resist and underlying protective layer corresponding to the pattern of the first mold. The remaining resist is removed by a dry or wet process. The substrate is coated again with imprint resist. The second mold, the one with concentric rings and circumferential gap regions, is then impressed on the resist with the rings of the second mold intersecting the protective layer lines formed in the first pattern. The resulting resist pattern is used either as an etch mask or as a liftoff mask to form pillar-tone or hole-tone templates respectively. When used for pillar-tone, the resist pattern is used as a mask to etch away remaining portions of the protective layer not covered by the resist, leaving pillars of resist and underlying protective layer. The pillars then serve as an etch mask for an etching process that etches unprotected portions of the master disk substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> show one example of how the two molds made by the process of this invention can be used to make a master disk with the desired pattern for both data sectors with data tracks and binary encoded nondata radial marks between the data sectors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows the top view of a mold made according to the above-described self-assembling BCP process, similar to the mold in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with two angular sectors <b>301</b>, <b>303</b> of radial lines with a binary encoded pattern <b>302</b> between radial line sectors <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>. The binary encoded pattern <b>302</b> includes one or more sets of radial lines, like radial line set <b>305</b>, and one or more sets of circumferential gaps, like gap <b>307</b>. The pattern <b>302</b> may represent the binary encoded number for sector <b>303</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a mold with concentric rings and a circumferential gap region <b>322</b> made according to the above-described self-assembling BCP process. The gap region <b>322</b> separates the concentric rings into ring sections <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>. As used herein the term &#x201c;rings&#x201d; includes sections of rings, like section <b>321</b>, <b>323</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> the concentric ring sections <b>321</b>, <b>323</b> were formed with the neutral layer patterned such that the A and B components of the BCP formed as lamellae perpendicular to the substrate so as to form the concentric rings with a radial spacing of nL<sub>0 </sub>(where L<sub>0 </sub>is the bulk period of the BCP selected for making the concentric rings and which may be different from the L<sub>0 </sub>of the BCP selected for making the radial lines in the mold of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). However, the neutral layer was patterned in the circumferential gap region <b>322</b> so as to form the A and B components of the BCP parallel to the substrates so that each of the circumferential gap region <b>322</b> has a circumferential width greater than 2 L<sub>0</sub>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> shows the top view of a master disk made using the molds of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. The master disk is depicted with two data sectors <b>301</b>, <b>303</b> with 11 concentric data tracks <b>330</b> with discrete data islands. The binary encoded pattern <b>302</b> is depicted as extending radially across the data tracks.

However, the mold of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> can be made without the circumferential gap <b>322</b>, in which case the radial line sets <b>305</b> would become segmented and aligned with the individual data tracks. However, the binary encoded pattern with the sets of radial line segments would be the same in each track.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a second implementation of the method, the master disk is made directly. This method uses the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,976,715 B2, assigned to the same assignee as this application and which is incorporated herein by reference, but incorporates the method for making the gap regions simultaneously with the radial lines and/or concentric rings. This implementation of the method uses a first BCP material with bulk period L<sub>0</sub>=L<sub>rad</sub>, resulting in guided self-assembly of the first BCP into its components to multiply the generally radial stripes into generally radial lines of alternating first BCP components, and with optional formation of the first BCP components as lamellae parallel to the substrate to form optional gap regions. One of the first BCP components is removed, leaving the radial lines of the remaining first BCP component and the remaining first BCP component in the gap regions. The resulting structure is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6G-6H</figref>. An optional protective layer is then deposited over the remaining component of the first BCP. The protective layer may be Si, SiO<sub>2</sub>, alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or similar material sputter deposited to a thickness of approximately 1-2 nm. The purpose of the protective layer is to prevent movement and/or dissolving of the remaining first BCP component during subsequent processing. Then, a second neutral layer is deposited on the protective layer. A resist layer is applied over the second neutral layer and patterned by e-beam into concentric bars and gap regions, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Then a second BCP with bulk period L<sub>0</sub>=L<sub>circ </sub>is deposited over these concentric bars and gap regions to define generally concentric rings and gap regions. One of the components of the second BCP is removed, leaving the concentric rings of the remaining second BCP component and the remaining second BCP component in the gap regions. The concentric rings of one of the components of the second BCP are removed, leaving the concentric rings of the remaining component of the second BCP. The concentric rings and gap regions of the remaining second BCP component and the underlying radial lines and gap regions of the remaining first BCP component form a grid that functions as an etch mask. Etching of the substrate through this mask, followed by removal of the remaining BCP material, results in a master mold with a pattern of recesses or holes. The ratio of L<sub>circ</sub>/L<sub>rad </sub>defines the BAR for the disk made from the master disk. If L<sub>circ</sub>=L<sub>rad </sub>then the BAR would be 1, but the BAR can be made greater than 1 by appropriate selection of the two BCPs with different bulk ratios, L<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustration of how the self-assembling BCP process of the invention can be used to make both perpendicular lamellae and parallel lamellae that result in a mold that can replicate binary encoded nondata marks onto the nanoimprinted disks, wherein the marks can be used as data sector numbers that can extend radially across all the tracks in an annular band, or as servo sector numbers that can extend across all tracks on the disk. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a section of a disk nanoimprinted by a mold or master disk made by the self-assembling BCP process of the invention wherein the binary encoded nondata marks can be used as track group numbers associated with a chevron servo pattern with fields <b>150</b><i>a, </i><b>150</b><i>b, </i>like that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Each track group includes multiple data tracks with three groups depicted. There are two sequences of track group numbers. Sequence 2 immediately precedes the chevron servo pattern and has group N identified by binary number 1010010, group N+1 identified by binary number 1010011, and group N+2 identified by binary number 1010101. The binary numbers are formed by combinations of the sets of radial lines and circumferential gaps as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As explained with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the measured phase difference from a chevron servo pattern yields only the fractional part of the read head radial position, i.e., the fractional part of one complete radial span of the chevron pattern. Three radial spans are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Thus the group numbers in sequence 2 identify which of the spans the read head is located on. The group numbers are thus used together with the signal output from the chevron servo pattern to determine the absolute radial position of the read head.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To account for the possibility of the read head being located at a group transition boundary in sequence 2, an optional identical sequence 1 may be used preceding sequence 2. Sequence 1 has a slight radial offset from sequence 2, with the offset being approximately the same as the cross-track width of the read head. Sequences 1 and 2 are both read, but sequence 2 is used to identify the group number unless the readback signal is noisy, indicating the head is at a transition region. Then the output from sequence 1 is used to identify the group number.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the disclosed invention is to be considered merely as illustrative and limited in scope only as specified in the appended claims.</p>
