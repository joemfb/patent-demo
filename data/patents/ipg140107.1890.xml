<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to prosthetic heart valves. More particularly, it relates to devices, methods, and delivery systems for percutaneously implanting prosthetic heart valves.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types and configurations of prosthetic heart valves are used to replace diseased natural human heart valves. The actual shape and configuration of any particular prosthetic heart valve is dependent to some extent upon the valve being replaced (i.e., mitral valve, tricuspid valve, aortic valve, or pulmonary valve). In general, the prosthetic heart valve designs attempt to replicate the function of the valve being replaced and thus will include valve leaflet-like structures used with either bioprostheses or mechanical heart valve prostheses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As used throughout this specification a &#x201c;prosthetic heart valve&#x201d; is intended to encompass bioprosthetic heart valves having leaflets made of a biological material (e.g., harvested porcine valve leaflets, or bovine or equine pericardial leaflets), along with synthetic leaflet materials or other materials. These bioprosthetic heart valves typically include a stent having a substantially circular base (or stent ring), around which an annular suture material is disposed for suturing the prosthesis to heart tissue. The stent further typically includes at least two, but typically three, support structures extending from the stent ring. These support structures are commonly referred to as stent posts or commissure posts. These posts typically are rigid yet somewhat flexible structures extending from the stent ring, which are covered by a cloth-like material similar to that of the annular suture material. The stent or commissure posts define the juncture between adjacent tissue or synthetic leaflets otherwise secured thereto. Examples of bioprosthetic heart valves are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,106,129 (Carpentier et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,434 (Lane), the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These disclosures describe a conventional configuration of three leaflets, with one leaflet disposed between each pair of stent or commissure posts. Regardless of whether a stent is provided, however, bioprosthetic heart valves are generally tubular so that when the leaflets are in an open position, an internal passage is defined through which blood can flow.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The bioprosthetic heart valves further typically include a sewing ring or suture ring that provides a means for fixing the prosthetic heart valve to the patient's native heart valve orifice tissue (e.g., native annulus or valvular rim) that is associated with the native heart valve being repaired or replaced. In particular, an exacting surgical implantation technique is traditionally employed whereby the heart is stopped (i.e., cardiopulmonary bypass) and opened, which is followed by surgical removal of damaged or diseased natural valve structure. A prosthetic heart valve can then be oriented within the native valvular area, with the sewing ring being seated against or at the native annulus or valvular rim. Sutures are then used to affix the sewing ring to the natural tissue. Obviously, the risks associated with this invasive type of surgery are numerous, particularly when cardiopulmonary bypass procedures are used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A successfully implanted prosthetic heart valve will normally function without problems for many years. In certain instances, however, deficiencies may become evident shortly after implant or within a few years, particularly in younger patients. Common functional deficiencies include the calcification of the prosthetic heart valve leaflets, stenosis, and prosthetic heart valve insufficiency. Under these and other circumstances, the prosthetic heart valve does not function properly and conventionally requires surgical removal and replacement. Surgical removal of such a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve entails the same invasive surgical intervention described above, coupled with the need to remove the old prosthetic valve and implant a new prosthetic heart valve. In addition, the risk of mortality is often higher when performing a second surgery in the same area of the body, particularly when performing heart-related surgeries. Another disadvantage to this additional surgery is that the reopening of a sternotomy has been known to have a relatively high risk of causing an infection.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, while these types of surgeries are well-accepted, the conventional surgical intervention described above is difficult to perform and can result in patient injury or more severe complications. In fact, due to physical weakness of a patient, implantation of a prosthetic heart valve via the conventional surgical technique may be considered too high-risk or contra-indicated for certain patients. Further, removal of a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve requires cutting of the sutures that secure the prosthesis to the native annulus/valvular rim, and attachment of a new sewing ring via stitching, which can further compromise the integrity of the valvular rim and lead to recovery complications, morbidity, and mortality.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although not necessarily related to the specific prosthetic heart valve replacement concerns described above, efforts have also been made to devise a prosthetic heart valve capable of being delivered percutaneously via transcatheter implantation, thereby avoiding the complications and risks associated with conventional surgical intervention. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,168,614 (Andersen et al.), a heart valve prosthesis is described for implantation in the body by use of a catheter. The valve prosthesis consists of a support structure with a tissue valve connected to it, whereby the support structure is delivered in a collapsed state through a blood vessel and secured to a desired valve location with the support structure in an expanded state.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other percutaneously-delivered prosthetic heart valves have been suggested having a generally similar configuration, such as by Bonhoeffer, P. et al., &#x201c;<i>Transcatheter Implantation of a Bovine Valve in Pulmonary Position</i>.&#x201d; Circulation, 2002; 102:813-816, and by Cribier, A. et al. &#x201c;<i>Percutaneous Transcatheter Implantation of an Aortic Valve Prosthesis for Calcific Aortic Stenosis</i>.&#x201d; Circulation, 2002; 106:3006-3008, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. These techniques rely at least partially upon a frictional type of engagement between the expanded support structure and the native tissue to maintain a position of the delivered prosthesis, although the stents can also become at least partially embedded in the surrounding tissue in response to the radial force provided by the stent and any balloons used to expand the stent. Thus, with these transcatheter techniques, conventional sewing of the prosthetic heart valve to the patient's native tissue is not necessary. Similarly, in an article by Bonhoeffer, P. et al. titled &#x201c;<i>Percutaneous Insertion of the Pulmonary Valve</i>.&#x201d; J Am Coll Cardiol, 2002; 39:1664-1669, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, percutaneous delivery of a biological valve is described. The valve is sutured to an expandable stent within a previously implanted valved or non-valved conduit, or a previously implanted valve. Again, radial expansion of the secondary valve stent is used for placing and maintaining the replacement valve.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Devices and methods have more recently been developed for percutaneously replacing deficient, previously implanted prosthetic heart valves, which are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0052867 (Revuelta et al.), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other transcatheter technologies for delivering replacement valves are described in PCT Application Nos. WO 2007/053243-A2, WO 2007/130537-A1, and WO 2007/081820-A1; United States Patent Application Publication Nos. 2005/0251251-A1, 2007/0043435-A1, and 2008/0004696-A1; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,641. However, a need exists for additional delivery systems, and related methods of implanting replacement heart valves, that are conducive to percutaneous delivery for replacing a deficient, previously implanted bioprosthetic heart valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The delivery systems of the invention can be used with a number of different configurations of replacement valves that provide complimentary features to promote physical docking or connection of the replacement heart valve to a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve, such as the aortic valve, mitral valve, pulmonic valve, and/or tricuspid valve. In some embodiments, the delivery systems and related methods of implantation of the invention utilize a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve as a platform to facilitate mounting relative to a native heart valve. Thus, the delivery systems of the invention are amenable to percutaneous delivery via either a transarterial or apical approach (either with or without cardiopulmonary bypass). Further, in cases where a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve is being functionally replaced, the deficient prosthetic heart valve need not be physically removed from the patient. Thus, the systems for delivering replacement heart valves of the present invention can be used at any point during the &#x201c;useful life&#x201d; of a conventional prosthetic heart valve. Further, the methodology associated with the present invention can be repeated multiple times, such that the delivery systems of the invention can be used to deliver multiple prosthetic heart valves on top of or within one another, if necessary or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The delivery systems of the invention include features for engagement with a stent to which a valve structure is attached. These stents can include a wide variety of structures and features that can be used alone or in combination with features of other stents and/or heart valves. In particular, these stents provide a number of different docking and/or anchoring structures that cooperate with the structure of a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve, and are conducive to percutaneous delivery thereof. Many of the structures are thus compressible to a relatively small diameter for percutaneous delivery to the heart of the patient using the delivery systems and implantation methods of the invention, and then are expandable through another movement or action of the delivery system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Methods for insertion of the replacement heart valves of the invention include delivery systems that can maintain the stent structures in their compressed state during their insertion and allow or cause all or specific features of the stent structures to expand once they are in their desired location. In addition, delivery methods of the invention can further include features that allow the stents to be retrieved for removal of relocation thereof after they have been deployed from the stent delivery systems. Such methods advantageously provide a surgeon with flexibility in proper placement of a heart valve within a patient. The methods may include implantation of the stent structures using either an antegrade or retrograde approach. Further, in many of the delivery approaches of the invention, the stent structure is rotatable in vivo to allow the stent structure to be positioned in a desired orientation.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The delivery systems and methods of the invention can be used with heart valves having a wide variety of configurations, a number of which are described below. In many cases, only the stent portion of a heart valve is illustrated, although it is understood that multiple leaflets will typically be attached within the interior portion of each stent so that it can perform as a valve. In some cases, these stents are described and illustrated as being positioned relative to a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve, where the stents can be delivered using one or more of the delivery systems and methods described herein, where many of the delivery systems can optionally be used to recapture or retrieve a stent of a heart valve after it has been at least partially deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to the Figures, wherein the components are labeled with like numerals throughout the several Figures, and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b> is illustrated with a stent <b>30</b> of the invention positioned therein, which will be described in further detail below. However, referring specifically to the prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b>, this valve <b>10</b> is a typical configuration of a valve that can be implanted within the heart of a patient, such as by suturing or otherwise securing the valve <b>10</b> into the area of a native heart valve of a patient. The native heart valves referred to herein can be any of the human heart valves (i.e., mitral valve, tricuspid valve, aortic valve, or pulmonary valve), wherein the type and orientation of an implanted (e.g., surgically implanted) prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b> will correspond with the particular form, shape, and function of the native heart valve in which it is implanted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Valve <b>10</b> generally includes a valve structure <b>12</b> including a stent ring <b>14</b> from which three stent posts or commissure posts <b>16</b> extend. All or a portion of the valve structure <b>12</b>, including the stent ring <b>14</b> and stent posts <b>16</b>, can be covered by a flexible covering <b>18</b>, which may be a tissue, polymer, fabric, cloth material, or the like to which leaflets (not shown) of the heart valve <b>10</b> are attached, such as by sewing. Further, as is known in the art, the internal structure of each of the stent posts <b>16</b> can be formed of a stiff but somewhat resiliently bendable material. This construction allows the stent posts <b>16</b> to be moved from the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to a deflected orientation by the application of an external force. Once this external force is removed or reduced, the stent posts <b>16</b> can then move back toward the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The valve structure <b>12</b> is generally tubular in shape, defining an internal area <b>20</b> (referenced generally) that extends from an inflow end <b>22</b> to an outflow end <b>24</b>. The internal area <b>20</b> is essentially surrounded by the valve structure <b>12</b>, and the leaflets attached within the valve structure <b>12</b> selectively allow for fluid flow into or out of the lumen of the natural heart valve in which it is implanted. That is, the internal area <b>20</b> is alternatively open and closed to the lumen of the natural heart valve in which it is inserted via movement of leaflets. In some patients, the prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b> will have previously been implanted in a patient using typical surgical techniques, whereby the stent ring <b>14</b> is sewn or attached to the annulus or valvular rim of the native heart valve. Alternatively, the prosthetic valve could have been previously placed in the patient using minimally invasive techniques for holding the valve in place, such as U-clips, for example, or a wide variety of other techniques and features used for minimally invasive and/or percutaneous implantation of the initial prosthetic heart valve.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The prosthetic heart valves (e.g., heart valve <b>10</b>) used in accordance with the delivery systems and methods of the invention may include a wide variety of different configurations, such as a prosthetic heart valve that has tissue leaflets, or a synthetic heart valve that has polymeric leaflets. In this way, the delivery systems can be used with prosthetic heart valves that are specifically configured for replacing any heart valve. That is, while much of the description herein refers to replacement of aortic valves, the delivery systems of the invention can also generally be used for replacement of tricuspid valves, delivery of venous valves, or for replacing a failed bioprosthesis, such as in the area of an aortic valve or mitral valve, for example. The delivery systems of the invention can also be used for functionally replacing stentless prosthetic heart valves.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The delivery systems of the invention are used for delivering a replacement prosthetic heart valve relative to a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve, which may be configured as the heart valve <b>10</b> shown and described herein. This would become a desirable procedure in cases where it is determined that a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve is functionally deficient due to one or more of a variety of factors, such as stenosis, valve failure, inflammation, native valve insufficiency, etc. Regardless of the cause of the deficiency, rather than removing the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve and implanting a second, similarly formed prosthetic heart valve via relatively complicated and invasive open heart surgical techniques, the delivery systems and methods of the present invention leave the deficient previously implanted prosthetic heart valve in place, and the new prosthetic heart valve is deployed so that it functionally replaces the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. Prior to implanting the new prosthetic valve, the leaflets of the previously implanted and deficient prosthetic heart valve can either be removed using a variety of techniques such as cutters, lasers, and the like, or the leaflets may instead be left in place within the deficient valve, where they will likely be pushed toward the walls of the vessel upon implantation of the new valve.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One embodiment of a stent <b>30</b>, which can be used as a component of a prosthetic heart valve in accordance with the present invention, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Stent <b>30</b> includes a support structure <b>31</b> comprising a number of strut or wire portions arranged relative to each other to provide secure coupling between the stent <b>30</b> and a prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b> in which it is located. In addition, stent <b>30</b> provides a semi-rigid frame for the leaflets of the replacement heart valve, which will be attached in some way within the interior portion of stent <b>30</b>. Details of several configurations of the stents of the invention are described below; however, in general terms, the stents described herein are generally a series of wires arranged into a tubular support structure, and leaflets can be secured to the interior of the support structure. The leaflets can be formed from a variety of materials, such as autologous tissue, xenograph material, synthetics, or the like, as known in the art. The leaflets may be provided as a homogenous, biological valve structure, such as a porcine, bovine, or equine valve. Alternatively, the leaflets can be provided independent of one another (e.g., bovine or equine pericardial leaflets) and subsequently assembled and attached to a stent support structure. The support structures shown and described relative to the Figures are generally configured to accommodate three leaflets and replace a heart valve (e.g., heart valve <b>10</b>) that has three commissure posts that accommodate a three-leaflet structure. However, the replacement prosthetic heart valves can incorporate more or less than three leaflets.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In more general terms, the delivery systems and methods of the invention can be used for many different devices that combine a support structure with one or more leaflets to assume configurations that differ from those shown and described, including any known prosthetic heart valve design. In one embodiment, a stent support structure with leaflets can be any known expandable prosthetic heart valve configuration, whether balloon expandable, self-expanding, or unfurling (as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,671,979; 4,056,854; 4,994,077; 5,332,402; 5,370,685; 5,397,351; 5,554,185; 5,855,601; and 6,168,614; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0034411; Bonhoeffer P., et al., &#x201c;<i>Percutaneous Insertion of the Pulmonary Valve</i>&#x201d;, Pediatric Cardiology, 2002; 39:1664-1669; Andersen H R, et al., &#x201c;<i>Transluminal Implantation of Artificial Heart Valves</i>&#x201d;, EUR Heart J., 1992; 13:704-708; Andersen, H.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The stent <b>30</b> comprises a support structure <b>31</b> that is made up of a number of struts or wire segments arranged to provide desired docking or engagement features, which may include individual struts or wire segments arranged and secured to each other, or the support structure <b>31</b> may instead be formed from a single piece of material (e.g., a tube of material that is machined to provide the structure shown). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, stent <b>30</b> is shown as being positioned within a heart valve <b>10</b>, which typically would have been previously implanted in a patient. Stent <b>30</b> comprises a support structure <b>31</b> having multiple upper vertical members <b>32</b> spaced apart from each other around the perimeter of the support structure <b>31</b>, and a corresponding number of lower vertical members <b>34</b>. Both the upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> extend in a direction that is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis <b>40</b> of the support structure <b>31</b>, and help to define the generally cylindrical shape of the support structure <b>31</b>. Upper vertical members <b>32</b> extend generally toward the outflow end <b>24</b> of the valve structure <b>12</b>, and the lower vertical members <b>34</b> extend in a direction that is generally opposite to the direction of the upper vertical members <b>32</b>, which is toward the inflow end <b>22</b> of the valve structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each of these upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are preferably spaced from adjacent upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, by a distance that is similar or identical to the distance that the stent posts (e.g., stent posts <b>16</b>) are spaced from each other in a corresponding implanted heart valve (e.g., heart valve <b>10</b>). Thus, both the number of upper vertical members <b>32</b> and the number of lower vertical members <b>34</b> are typically the same as the number of stent posts. However, it is possible that the number of upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are not the same as each other and/or not the same as the number of stent posts.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The upper vertical members <b>32</b> are designed to have a height that allows them to have a desired amount of contact with a corresponding stent post. The upper vertical members <b>32</b> may extend at least slightly beyond the tops of the stent posts, or may be at least slightly shorter than the stent posts. The lower vertical members <b>34</b> may also have any length that allows them to have a desired amount of contact with their corresponding stent posts <b>16</b> and other portions of the stent structure <b>12</b> with which they come into contact. Again, the lower vertical members <b>34</b> may extend at least slightly below the bottom of the stent structure (i.e., stent ring <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), or may be at least slightly shorter so that they do not extend below any portion of the stent structure. The selection of the length of these upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> can vary widely, depending on the configuration of the valve structure and the amount of contact desired between the support structure <b>31</b> and the interior portion of the stent or valve structure. In any case, the height of upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> should be adequate to provide sufficient contact between the support structure <b>31</b> and the corresponding heart valve in which it is positioned to keep the stent <b>30</b> in place relative to the heart valve. In addition, the arrangement of upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> should provide sufficient structural integrity to the support structure <b>31</b> so that it is resistant to deformation or other changes that impact its effectiveness as a stent structure.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may be generally &#x201c;U&#x201d; or &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped, as illustrated, with the distance between opposite &#x201c;legs&#x201d; or extending portions of the members being chosen to provide desired characteristics to the support structure <b>31</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper vertical members <b>32</b> are preferably narrow enough that they will not unintentionally engage with the top edge of corresponding stent posts <b>16</b>, but are preferably wide enough that they provide adequate contact with the interior portion of the stent posts <b>16</b> to help keep the stent <b>30</b> in place. In other words, the distance between opposite legs of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; or &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped structure is preferably not so large that the members <b>32</b> can latch onto the stent posts <b>16</b>, but is preferably large enough to provide contact between the members <b>32</b> and some portion of the interior surface of the stent posts <b>16</b>. This &#x201c;U&#x201d; or &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped structure of these members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is particularly adaptable to the configuration where the support structure <b>31</b> is essentially a continuous wire structure; however, if the support structure is configured in another manner (e.g., with separate components that are not wire-like), each of the members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> may essentially consist of a single, relatively solid extending structure, for example. These structures may be arranged and connected relative to each other in a similar configuration to that described relative to a wire structure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, heart valve <b>10</b> includes three stent posts <b>16</b> that are spaced generally at an equal distance from each other around the perimeter of the valve <b>10</b> (i.e., approximately 120 degrees apart). These stent posts <b>16</b> will generally correspond with the commissures of leaflets of the valve (not shown). It is understood, however, that the stent posts <b>16</b> may instead be unevenly spaced from each other. In one example of such an embodiment, first and second stent posts <b>16</b> may be spaced from each other by approximately 120 degrees, second and third stent posts <b>16</b> may be spaced from each other by approximately 115 degrees, so that first and third stent posts <b>16</b> would be spaced from each other by approximately 125 degrees. Other arrangements that vary slightly or substantially from this arrangement may alternatively be used; particularly in cases where more or less than two stent posts <b>16</b> are used. One example of such an arrangement would be in the case of a two-leaflet valve (e.g., the mitral valve), which would only include two stent posts arranged at approximately 180 degrees from each other and a corresponding arrangement for its support structure <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Support structure <b>31</b> further includes multiple upper flange or petal portions <b>36</b>, each of which is located generally between two adjacent upper vertical members <b>32</b>, and multiple lower flange or petal portions <b>38</b>, each of which is located generally between two adjacent lower vertical members <b>34</b>. The upper and lower flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are provided for engagement with the stent or valve structure <b>12</b> on generally opposite edges (i.e., top and bottom edges) of the stent ring <b>14</b> when positioned within a heart valve <b>10</b>. That is, the upper flange portions <b>36</b> will be positioned in the area between adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> on the outflow end <b>24</b> of the valve structure <b>12</b>, and the lower flange portions <b>38</b> will be positioned generally below the upper flange portions <b>36</b>, but on the opposite side of the valve structure <b>12</b> (i.e., along the bottom edge of the stent ring <b>14</b> on the inflow end <b>22</b> of the valve structure <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Orientation and positioning of the stents of the invention may be accomplished either by self-orientation of the stents (such as by interference between features of the stent and a previously implanted stent or valve structure) or by manual orientation of the stent, such as by manipulation of its delivery system, to align its features with anatomical or previous bioprosthetic features, such as can be accomplished using fluoroscopic visualization techniques, for example. For example, when aligning the stents of the invention with a previously implanted bioprosthetic valve, features of the stents can align with the stent rail and/or commissures of the valve. It is desirable that the stents be locked in place both rotationally and axially.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the length and shape of each of these upper and lower flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> can be the same or different from each other within a single support structure <b>31</b>, as desired. The upper and lower flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may be generally &#x201c;U&#x201d; or &#x201c;V&#x201d; shaped, as illustrated, although the distance between opposite &#x201c;legs&#x201d; or extending portions of the members will generally be larger than the distance between the legs of the upper and lower vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> within the same stent <b>30</b>, particularly when the stent <b>30</b> is in its expanded state. Each upper flange portion <b>36</b> includes a distal tip <b>44</b> and each lower flange member <b>38</b> includes a distal tip <b>46</b>. The tips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> may have a tighter curvature than the rest of their respective flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b>, if desired. The tips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> may also serve as interfaces or connecting portions with a corresponding delivery system, as will be explained in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The lower flange portions <b>38</b> are configured to engage with the lower surface of a sewing ring <b>14</b> of a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve (e.g: heart valve <b>10</b>) when the stent <b>30</b> is in its expanded condition. Alternatively, the lower flange portions <b>38</b> can be configured to engage other structure(s) of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in order to engage with a previously implanted heart valve, one exemplary embodiment of a lower flange portion <b>38</b> includes a wire structure that extends generally from a common area <b>42</b> on one upper vertical member <b>32</b> toward the tip <b>46</b> of the flange portion <b>38</b>, then toward another common area <b>42</b> on an adjacent upper vertical member <b>32</b>. The curvature or contours of each flange portion <b>38</b> can be designed so that it closely matches the shape of the stent or valve structure <b>12</b> in which it will be implanted, such as at its inflow end <b>22</b>. That is, there is preferably minimal to no gap between the flange <b>38</b> and the interior surface of the valve structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each of the tips <b>46</b> of the flange portions <b>38</b> are positioned approximately 120 degrees from each other around the periphery of the sewing ring <b>14</b>, although they can be spaced differently from each other, depending on the locations of the stent posts of the heart valve. When the stent <b>30</b> is in an expanded condition, the lower flange portions <b>38</b> are preferably biased toward the sewing ring <b>14</b> to keep the flange portion <b>38</b> in place relative to the heart valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The upper flange portions <b>36</b> are configured to engage with the spaces between stent posts <b>16</b> of a previously implanted heart valve (e.g., heart valve <b>10</b>) when the stent <b>30</b> is in its expanded condition. Alternatively, the upper flange portions <b>36</b> can be configured to engage other structure(s) of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. In order to engage with a previously implanted heart valve, one exemplary embodiment of an upper flange portion <b>36</b> includes a wire structure that extends generally from a common area on one upper vertical member <b>32</b> toward the tip <b>44</b> of the flange portion <b>36</b>, then toward another common area on an adjacent vertical member <b>32</b>. The curvature or contours of each flange portion <b>36</b> can be designed to closely match the shape of the stent or valve structure <b>12</b> in which it will be implanted. Each of the tips <b>44</b> of the flange portions <b>36</b> are positioned approximately 120 degrees from each other around the periphery of the sewing ring <b>14</b>, although they can be spaced differently from each other, depending on the locations of the stent posts of the heart valve. In any case, the tip <b>44</b> of flange portion <b>36</b> will preferably fit between adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> in order to help physically dock or connect the stent <b>30</b> to the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b>. When the stent <b>30</b> is in an expanded condition, the upper flange portions <b>36</b> are preferably biased toward the sewing ring <b>14</b> (and preferably toward a corresponding lower flange portion <b>38</b>) to keep each flange portion <b>36</b> in place relative to the heart valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The support structure <b>31</b> of the stent <b>30</b> is, in one embodiment, a wire stent capable of transitioning from a collapsed state to an expanded state, where a number of individual wires comprising the support structure <b>31</b> are formed of a metal or other material. These wires are arranged in such a way that a support structure <b>31</b> is provided that allows for folding or compressing to a contracted state in which its internal diameter is at least somewhat smaller than its internal diameter in an expanded state. In its contracted state, such a support structure <b>31</b> with attached valves can be mounted relative to a delivery device, and the support structure <b>31</b> is configured so that it can be changed to its expanded state when desired. The delivery systems of the invention used for such replacement heart valve can optionally be provided with degrees of rotational and axial orientation capabilities in order to properly position the new heart valve within the previously implanted heart valve.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The wires of the support structure <b>31</b> can alternatively be formed from a shape memory material such as a nickel titanium alloy (e.g., Nitinol). With this configuration, the support structure <b>31</b> is self-expandable from a contracted state to an expanded state, such as by the application of heat, energy, and the like, or by the removal of external forces (e.g., compressive forces), such as external forces provided by the delivery system. In addition, the support structure <b>31</b> of this embodiment may be laser cut from a single piece of material or may be assembled from a number of different components. For these types of stent structures, one example of a delivery system that can be used includes a catheter with a retractable sheath that covers a compressed stent (thereby providing external compressive forces on the stent) until it is to be deployed, at which point the sheath can be retracted to allow the stent to expand.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The support structure <b>31</b> can include features not specifically described or shown instead of, or in addition to, the various coupling structures and methods described herein. For example, the support structure <b>31</b> can have a non-expandable design, but can instead be sized and shaped to nest within a previously implanted heart valve (not shown) in a manner that presses features of the previously implanted heart valve (e.g., leaflets) outwardly relative to the native conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The height and diameter of the stent <b>30</b> in its expanded state is preferably chosen and/or designed for use with a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve having a particular size and shape. Thus, the stent <b>30</b> can assume a variety of different longitudinal heights and/or diameters. In one embodiment, for example, the support structure <b>31</b> has a height in its expanded state that is slightly greater than a height of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve, and/or has a free-standing outer diameter that is greater than an inner diameter of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. With this embodiment, upon transitioning toward the expanded state, the support structure <b>31</b> (including the vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>) presses against an inner diameter of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. The overall shape of the support structure <b>31</b> is cylindrical in many cases; however, other shapes are also contemplated, such as elliptical, oval, or the like. For example, portions of the support structure <b>31</b> can define an enlarged diameter as compared to other portions. Further, depending upon the previously implanted heart valve being functionally replaced, the support structure <b>31</b> can be less uniform along a height thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">One method of delivering a stent (e.g., stent <b>30</b>) to the location of a previously implanted heart valve (e.g., heart valve <b>10</b>) is performed percutaneously, as represented in simplified form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In general terms for this exemplary delivery system, a transcatheter assembly <b>70</b> is provided, including a delivery catheter <b>72</b>, a balloon catheter <b>74</b>, and a guide wire <b>76</b>. The delivery catheter <b>72</b> is of a type known in the art, and defines a lumen <b>78</b> within which the balloon catheter <b>74</b> is received. The balloon catheter <b>74</b>, in turn, defines a lumen (not shown) within which the guide wire <b>76</b> is slidably disposed. Further, the balloon catheter <b>74</b> includes a balloon <b>80</b> that is fluidly connected to an inflation source (not shown). It is noted that if the stent being implanted is a self-expanding type of stent, the balloon would not be needed and a sheath or other restraining means would instead be used for maintaining the stent in its compressed state until deployment of the stent. In any case, in this embodiment, the transcatheter assembly <b>70</b> is appropriately sized for a desired percutaneous approach to the prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b> that was previously implanted in a native heart valve <b>79</b>. For example, the transcatheter assembly <b>70</b> can be sized for delivery to the heart valve <b>10</b> via an opening at a carotid artery, a jugular vein, a sub-clavian vein, femoral artery or vein, or the like. Essentially, any percutaneous intercostals penetration can be made to facilitate use of the transcatheter assembly <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Prior to delivery, the stent <b>30</b> is mounted over the balloon <b>80</b> in a contracted state to be as small as possible without causing permanent deformation of the stent structure. As compared to the expanded state, the support structure <b>31</b> is compressed onto itself and the balloon <b>80</b>, thus defining a decreased inner diameter as compared to an inner diameter in the expanded state. Further, the vertical members <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and flange portions <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are compressed toward the longitudinal axis <b>40</b> when in the contracted state. While this description is related to the delivery of a balloon-expandable stent, the same basic procedures can also be applicable to a self-expanding stent, where the delivery system would not include a balloon, but would preferably include a sheath or some other type of configuration for maintaining the stent in its compressed condition until its deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With the stent <b>30</b> mounted to the balloon <b>80</b>, the transcatheter assembly <b>70</b> is delivered through a percutaneous opening (not shown) in the patient via the delivery catheter <b>72</b>. The previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b> is located by inserting the guide wire <b>76</b> into the patient, which guide wire <b>76</b> extends from a distal end <b>82</b> of the delivery catheter <b>72</b>, with the balloon catheter <b>74</b> otherwise retracted within the delivery catheter <b>72</b>. Once the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b> has been located, the balloon catheter <b>74</b> is advanced distally from the delivery catheter <b>72</b> along the guide wire <b>76</b>, with the balloon <b>80</b> and stent <b>30</b> positioned relative to the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b>. More particularly, the balloon <b>80</b> and stent <b>30</b> are positioned within the internal region of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b>, with the lower flange portions <b>38</b> positioned adjacent the sewing ring <b>14</b> of the heart valve <b>10</b>, and the upper flange portions <b>36</b> are positioned adjacent the outflow end <b>24</b> of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">With a stent in its contracted state, its support structure can readily move within the internal area of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve, and any vertical members and flange portions, which are otherwise retracted or compressed, do not unintentionally contact or engage portions of the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. In one embodiment, the stent includes a radiopaque, echogenic, or MRI visible material to facilitate visual confirmation of proper placement of the stent relative to the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. Alternatively, other known surgical visual aids can be incorporated into the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The techniques described above relative to placement of the stent within the heart can be used both to monitor and correct the placement of the stent in a longitudinal direction relative to the length of the anatomical structure in which it is positioned and also to monitor and correct the orientation of the stent relative to the stent posts <b>16</b> of the previously implanted heart valve. In particular, it is desirable for the stent to be positioned so that each of its upper flange portions are between two adjacent stent posts when they are expanded outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Once the stent is properly positioned, the balloon catheter <b>74</b> is operated to inflate the balloon <b>80</b>, thus transitioning the stent to the expanded state, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> relative to stent <b>30</b>. Alternatively, if the support structure is formed of a shape memory material, the stent can be allowed to self-expand to the expanded state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, a self-expanding stent structure can be percutaneously delivered by an appropriate catheter device other than a balloon catheter, as will be described in further detail below. In either case, the support structure expands within the internal region <b>20</b> of the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b>, radially pressing against the valve structure <b>12</b>. Because the previously implanted prosthetic heart valve <b>10</b> would have included leaflets (not shown), radial expansion of the stent would press against these leaflets, thereby lodging them against the valve structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an embodiment of another exemplary stent <b>50</b> that includes a number of eyelets or apertures <b>52</b> that can be used for maintaining the various components of stent <b>50</b> in a compressed state when desired. These eyelets <b>52</b> can be particularly useful in the case where the stent <b>50</b> is a self-expanding stent, since this type of structure needs external forces to keep it in its compressed state. In particular, an eyelet <b>52</b> may be located at the end of at least one of the multiple upper vertical members <b>54</b> and/or one or more of the upper and lower flange portions <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> and the lower vertical members <b>55</b>. Each eyelet <b>52</b> is preferably sized for accepting an elongated thread-like material, such as suture material or a thin wire, and/or sized for engagement with a hook or other engagement feature of a delivery device. If a thread-like material is used, it can be threaded through at least one of the eyelets <b>52</b> in such a way that when the material is pulled tight, the eyelets <b>52</b> are pulled toward the central axis of the stent <b>50</b>. If a wire-like material is used, it may be configured as a metal snare or other configuration that pulls the eyelets <b>52</b> toward the central axis of the stent <b>50</b>. If a delivery device having such engagement features is used, it may be configured in such a way that the engagement features can be moved toward and away from the central axis of the stent, as desired for insertion and deployment of the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Other arrangements of pulling the various portions of a stent toward a central stent axis are also contemplated, which preferably are relatively easy to operate for compression and release of the stent structures. In any case, once the stent structure is compressed to its desired configuration, the feature used to pull the stent into its compressed configuration is capable of being secured or fastened in some way to keep the stent from unintentionally expanding. This same feature can have its operation reversed to allow the various structures of the stent to move toward their expanded state.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-21</figref> illustrate one exemplary system of delivering a stent of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, for example, into a heart valve <b>10</b>, which would have previously been implanted in a patient. One feature provided by the delivery system of this embodiment is that it allows a self-expanding stent to be retrieved after its initial deployment if it is not positioned correctly in the heart. The stent then could be redeployed into the proper position, using the same or a different delivery system. With particular reference to the Figures, a distal portion of a delivery system <b>90</b> is illustrated, which includes a tip portion <b>92</b> and a sheath <b>94</b>. The system further includes a plurality of hooks or engagement features <b>96</b> that can engage with eyelets <b>52</b> of stent <b>50</b>, for example. While this delivery system <b>90</b> can generally be used for more procedures than the described implantation procedure, the procedure illustrated relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-21</figref> is particularly directed to percutaneous delivery of a stent to a previously implanted aortic heart valve via a retrograde approach. For purposes of this description of an implantation method, the exemplary stent <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is used in the implantation description; however, a number of different stent embodiments may utilize these same procedures, such as other stent embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, delivery system <b>90</b> is being advanced toward heart valve <b>10</b> as such a heart valve would have been previously implanted in a patient. The compressed replacement valve (not shown) is encompassed within sheath <b>94</b> for insertion into the patient so that there is no contact between the replacement valve and any portion of the patient's internal anatomy during the insertion process.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> illustrates delivery system <b>90</b> as it has been further advanced into heart valve <b>10</b>, and wherein the sheath <b>94</b> has been partially retracted away from the tip <b>92</b> to expose a portion of the stent <b>50</b> that was previously compressed therein. Because the upper flange portions <b>56</b> are no longer constrained by the sheath <b>94</b>, these portions <b>56</b> are able to move away from a central member <b>100</b> of the delivery system <b>90</b> as the sheath <b>94</b> is retracted. Further, eyelets <b>52</b> that extend from the ends of upper vertical members <b>54</b> are each engaged with a hook <b>96</b> of the delivery system <b>90</b>. These hooks <b>96</b> can be attached to a mechanism within the interior portion of the sheath <b>94</b>, for example, or may be attached to some other structure that extends through the sheath <b>94</b>. In either case, hooks <b>96</b> can maintain the upper vertical members <b>54</b> in their compressed state until they are disengaged from the hooks <b>96</b>. That is, the delivery system can control the diameter of the stent inflow structures, the stent outflow structures, or both the stent inflow and outflow structures independently or together. As is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the lower flange portions <b>58</b> are held in their compressed state with a snare <b>98</b> that engages with eyelets <b>52</b> that extend from each of the flange portions <b>58</b>. Snare <b>98</b> is shown as a single, shaped piece of elongated material; however, the lower flange portions <b>58</b> may instead be held in their compressed state via an alternative structure or system, such as by a suture, or by a moveable sleeve attached to the delivery system, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the delivery system <b>90</b> is further advanced into valve <b>10</b> until the upper flange portions <b>56</b>, which are extending radially away from the central member <b>100</b> of the delivery system <b>90</b>, become engaged with the valve structure <b>12</b> of the heart valve <b>10</b>. In particular, each of the upper flange portions <b>56</b> are preferably positioned to be in contact with the surface of the stent ring <b>14</b> between two adjacent stent posts <b>16</b>. In order to verify that the flange portions <b>56</b> are properly positioned relative to the valve structure <b>12</b> (e.g., flange portions <b>56</b> are not resting on the top of the stent posts <b>16</b>), the entire delivery system <b>90</b> can be rotated slightly in either direction while pressing downwardly toward the valve structure <b>12</b>. The system <b>90</b> can also be advanced axially to the desired position. In this way, the flange portions <b>56</b> can be moved into the area between adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> if they are not already in this position.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Once the delivery system <b>90</b> and its stent <b>50</b> are properly oriented, the snare <b>98</b>, sheath, or other structure holding the lower flange portions <b>58</b> in their compressed state is released or retracted, thereby allowing the lower flange portions <b>58</b> to deploy or radially extend, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The lower flange portions <b>58</b> can then contact the surface of the stent ring <b>14</b> that is opposite the surface that is contacted by the upper flange portions <b>56</b>. The hooks <b>96</b> can then be disengaged from the eyelets <b>52</b> of stent <b>50</b>, such as by further advancing the delivery system <b>90</b> into the opening of the valve <b>10</b>, or by activating a mechanism associated with the hooks <b>96</b> that can move the hooks <b>96</b> relative to the eyelets <b>52</b> until they become disengaged from the eyelets <b>52</b>. It is noted that the stent is retrievable at any point prior to the hooks <b>96</b> being disengaged from the stent <b>50</b> with use of the hooks <b>96</b> and/or the sheath <b>94</b>. The upper and lower vertical members <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> are then free to expand radially until they contact the inner surface of the stent or valve structure <b>12</b>. The upper and lower vertical members <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> preferably are configured so that they will press against the inner surface of the valve structure <b>12</b> with sufficient force to provide further anchoring of the stent <b>50</b> within the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">After the stent <b>50</b> is implanted and its various portions are deployed or released from a compressed state to an expanded state, the delivery system <b>90</b> can be removed from the patient. The stent <b>50</b> will then be in its deployed or expanded state, as is generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, or in a similar manner to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> relative to a stent <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>110</b> that has a similar structure to the stent <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but further includes at least one stent post engaging structure <b>112</b>. Relative to the specific embodiment of the stent <b>110</b> that is illustrated, this structure also does not include upper flange portions (such as upper flange portions <b>36</b> of stent <b>30</b>), since such portions could be redundant and/or interfere with the specific structure of the structures <b>112</b> shown. However, it is contemplated that upper flange portions could also be provided with this embodiment, if they are configured to not interfere with any stent post engagement structures <b>112</b>. Further, in the embodiment shown in this figure, three structures <b>112</b> are provided to correspond with a like number of stent posts <b>16</b> of heart valve <b>10</b>; however it is contemplated that the stent <b>110</b> includes less than three structures <b>112</b>, even if three stent posts are provided. If less than three structures <b>112</b> are provided, it may be desirable to additionally provide at least one upper flange portion to engage with the heart valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Each stent post engaging structure <b>112</b> is configured to partially surround a portion of a stent post <b>16</b>, thereby providing another way of anchoring the stent <b>110</b> in place. These structures <b>112</b> can cooperate with one or more lower flange portions <b>114</b> to provide anchoring on both the inflow and outflow ends of the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b>. The structures <b>112</b> can be individual structures that are each secured to upper vertical members <b>116</b>, or may be formed as a single structure having multiple loops that are secured to the structure of the stent <b>110</b>. Alternatively, these structures <b>112</b> can be integrally formed with the structure of the stent <b>110</b>. Stent <b>110</b> can be a self-expanding stent or may be a balloon-expandable stent structure.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>120</b> for use with a replacement prosthetic heart valve in accordance with the present invention. Stent <b>120</b> includes a number of strut or wire portions arranged relative to each other to provide secure coupling between the stent <b>120</b> and a previously-implanted prosthetic heart valve, such as heart valve <b>10</b>. In addition, stent <b>120</b> provides a semi-rigid frame for the leaflets of the replacement heart valve, which will be attached to the interior portion of stent <b>120</b>, as will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Stent <b>120</b> includes multiple upper vertical members <b>122</b> spaced apart from each other around the perimeter of the stent <b>120</b>, and a corresponding number of lower vertical members <b>124</b>. It is understood that the number of upper and lower vertical members can be different from each other, however. Both the upper and lower vertical members <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> extend in a direction that is generally parallel to a longitudinal axis of the stent <b>120</b>, thereby partially defining the generally cylindrical shape of the stent <b>120</b>. Upper vertical members <b>122</b> extend generally toward the outflow end of the stent structure <b>12</b>, and the lower vertical members <b>124</b> extend in a direction that is generally opposite to the direction of the upper vertical members <b>122</b>, which is toward the inflow end of the stent structure <b>12</b>. As with previously described embodiments, the number of upper and lower vertical members <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> may or may not be the same as the number of stent posts of the stent structure <b>12</b>. In addition, the length of upper and lower vertical members <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> should be adequate to provide sufficient contact between the stent <b>120</b> and the stent structure <b>12</b> to help keep the stent <b>120</b> in place relative to the heart valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Stent <b>120</b> further includes upper and lower flange portions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, respectively. Flange portions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are configured for positioning on opposite sides of a stent ring <b>14</b> of stent structure <b>12</b> when the stent is in its expanded state. Through the design and manufacturing of the stent <b>120</b>, the flange portions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> can be biased toward each other when the stent is in its expanded condition in order to keep the stent <b>120</b> positioned properly relative to a stent structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Stent <b>120</b> includes components that can be made of materials that perform differently relative to deployment thereof. In particular, a portion of stent <b>120</b> can be expandable from its compressed state via the application of an internal radial force (e.g., inflation of a balloon), while another portion of stent <b>120</b> can be self-expandable such that the removal of radial compressive forces will allow that portion of stent <b>120</b> to expand without application of additional forces. Alternatively, different portions of the stent <b>120</b> can be made of different materials that are both self-expanding, or of different materials that are expandable via the application of an internal radial force. Although the components that comprise these two structures can vary, the stent <b>120</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> includes a first component that is expandable through application of a radial force. This component may be made of a material such as stainless steel, for example. The first component includes the upper vertical members <b>122</b>, lower vertical members <b>124</b>, and lower flange portions <b>128</b>, and can include a number of components attached to each other, or can be a single machined piece. This first component is illustrated in its compressed state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and in its expanded state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The stent <b>120</b> further includes a second component that is self-expandable and may be made of a shape memory material such as a nickel titanium alloy (e.g., Nitinol). This second component includes the upper flange portions <b>126</b> and also a second lower vertical member <b>130</b> that can at least roughly duplicate the shape of the lower vertical member <b>124</b> of the first component.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When this stent <b>120</b> is implanted into a patient, a sheath or other mechanism of its delivery system will hold the self-expandable portions of the stent in a compressed state until such a mechanism is retracted or removed, thereby allowing the upper flange portions <b>126</b> to extend radially from the stent structure, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. These upper flange portions <b>126</b> are preferably positionable between adjacent stent posts of a previously implanted heart valve for proper orientation of the stent <b>120</b>. Because the first component is not made from a self-expandable material, the first component of stent <b>120</b> will remain in its compressed state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, until it is expanded radially, such as via expansion by a balloon catheter that is positioned in its central opening. When fully inflated, such a balloon will be constrained by the stent structure <b>12</b> along a portion of its length, but portions of the balloon that are above and below the stent structure <b>12</b> can be allowed to expand further so that the balloon takes on an &#x201c;hourglass&#x201d; type of shape, thereby pressing the lower flange portions <b>128</b> outward and under the stent ring <b>14</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. These lower flange portions <b>128</b> can thereby help to anchor the stent <b>120</b> relative to the heart valve in which it is positioned. Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the stent <b>120</b> in its expanded state, where the upper and lower flange portions <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are positioned on opposite sides of stent ring <b>14</b>, and where the vertical members <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>130</b> are positioned adjacent to the internal portion of stent structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>140</b> for use as a replacement prosthetic heart valve in accordance with the invention. This stent <b>140</b> includes similar structures to those of the stent <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; however, stent <b>140</b> does not include lower vertical members that correspond to and extend in the opposite direction from upper vertical members <b>142</b>. Otherwise, stent <b>140</b> can include any of the features described herein. Stent <b>140</b> can be self-expanding or expandable with application of a radial force, and pericardial tissue or other materials may be attached to its structure to provide a prosthetic heart valve.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>150</b> for use as a replacement prosthetic heart valve in accordance with the present invention. Stent <b>150</b> includes similar structures to the stent <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, including upper vertical members <b>152</b> and corresponding lower vertical members <b>154</b>, stent post engagement structures <b>156</b>, and lower flange members <b>158</b>. In an embodiment where the number of stent post engagement structures <b>156</b> is optionally less than the number of corresponding stent posts of the previously implanted heart valve, upper flange members may be included on stent <b>150</b>, if desired. Alternatively, upper flange members may be included on stent <b>150</b> in a configuration that does not interfere with the structures <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Stent <b>150</b> further includes &#x201c;W&#x201d; shaped structures <b>160</b> positioned along the stent ring <b>14</b> between adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> in the interior area of the stent structure <b>12</b>. Each structure <b>160</b> is positioned generally between adjacent lower flange members <b>158</b> and provides additional contact surfaces between the stent <b>150</b> and the interior portion of the stent structure <b>12</b>. In addition, any or all of the structures <b>160</b> can be used to hold a leaflet of the failed bioprosthesis against the stent ring of the failed bioprosthesis (such as stent ring <b>14</b>) so that the leaflets of the failed bioprosthesis do not interfere with the valve leaflets of the newly implanted valved stent. That is, it may be desirable to hold the leaflets of the failed bioprosthesis toward the stent ring in order to minimize the potential for formation of thrombus between the failed leaflets and the new leaflets. In addition, holding the leaflets against the stent ring can prevent abrasion and/or tearing of the new leaflets that can occur during repeated contact with the old leaflets. The structures <b>160</b> may take a &#x201c;W&#x201d; type shape, as shown, or may instead have a different shape, such as one or more &#x201c;U&#x201d; or &#x201c;V&#x201d; shapes, a series of extensions, a sinusoidal shape, or any desired configuration that can hold leaflets against the stent ring of the failed bioprosthesis, when desired.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The stent <b>150</b> may comprise any desired number of components that are connected or attached to each other; however, the exemplary embodiment of stent <b>150</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> provides an embodiment with two separate structures attached or arranged relative to each other. That is, a first component is a formed structure that includes the stent post engagement structures <b>156</b> and the &#x201c;W&#x201d; shaped structures <b>160</b>, while a second component is a formed structure that includes the upper and lower vertical members <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> and the lower flange members <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>170</b> for use as a prosthetic heart valve in accordance with the present invention. Stent <b>170</b> generally includes upper vertical members <b>172</b> and corresponding lower vertical members <b>174</b>, upper flange members <b>176</b>, lower flange members <b>178</b>, and upper connecting members <b>182</b>. In this embodiment, the upper flange members <b>176</b> are offset relative to lower flange members <b>178</b> such that each of the upper flange members <b>176</b> is positioned generally between adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> of stent structure <b>12</b>, and each of the lower flange members <b>178</b> is generally aligned with the stent posts <b>16</b>. Upper connecting members <b>182</b> extend between adjacent upper vertical members <b>172</b> and are provided for tying together the upper vertical members <b>172</b> to carry the valve hydrodynamic closing loads, which can thereby reduce various stresses in the stent. The upper connecting members <b>182</b> can also provide interface points for connection of the stent <b>170</b> with the delivery system used for the implantation process. Stent <b>170</b> further includes optional lower connecting members <b>184</b> that extend between adjacent lower vertical members <b>174</b>. Lower connecting members <b>184</b> are provided for attachment of the material that makes up the leaflets of the replacement heart valve. That is, pericardial or another valve material may be sewn or otherwise attached to the lower connecting members <b>184</b> and may further be sewn or otherwise attached to the upper vertical members <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The upper connecting members <b>182</b> are shown as a single curved member; however, the connecting members can have any desired structure or configuration that provides the desired support for the upper vertical members <b>172</b>. Further, the connecting members <b>182</b> may be made of the same or a different material than the other portions of the stent.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">One or more of the lower flange members <b>178</b> may further include an eyelet or aperture <b>180</b> for engagement with a structure of a delivery system for use during the implantation of the stent <b>170</b> (e.g., sutures or a hook structure that can pull the stent structure toward its central axis). One or more of the upper vertical members <b>172</b> may similarly include an eyelet or aperture <b>185</b> for use during the implantation of the stent <b>170</b> and/or for use as an anchor point for attachment of valve material to the stent <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref> illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>200</b> for use as a replacement prosthetic heart valve in accordance with the present invention. Stent <b>200</b> is similar to stent <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> in that stent <b>200</b> also includes a portion that is made of a material that is expandable (e.g., stainless steel) with a device such as a balloon catheter, for example, and a portion that is made of a material that is self-expanding (e.g., Nitinol) when external forces are removed. In particular, a self-expanding portion of stent <b>200</b> may include upper flange portions <b>202</b> that can be generally positioned between adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> of a stent structure <b>12</b>, and bracing portions <b>204</b> that can be generally aligned with stent posts <b>16</b> of a stent structure <b>12</b>. The other portion (i.e., the portion that is not self-expanding) of the stent <b>200</b> may include any or all of the following structures: upper vertical members <b>206</b>; lower vertical members <b>208</b>; upper support structures <b>210</b> extending between adjacent upper vertical members <b>206</b>; lower support structures <b>212</b> extending between adjacent lower vertical members <b>208</b>, lower flange portions <b>220</b>; and intermediate lower flange portions <b>214</b> located between adjacent lower flange portions <b>220</b>. The lower flange portions <b>214</b> can provide additional anchoring force for the stent <b>200</b> against the stent structure <b>12</b> in the areas generally adjacent to the stent posts <b>16</b>. The lower support structures <b>212</b> may be used for securing the valve structure to the stent <b>200</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>230</b> for use as a prosthetic heart valve. Stent <b>230</b> includes multiple upper vertical members <b>232</b> and optional corresponding lower vertical members <b>234</b>, and multiple lower flange members <b>236</b>. The number of upper vertical members <b>232</b> and lower vertical members <b>234</b> preferably correspond to the number of stent posts of the previously implanted heart valve. In addition, the number of lower flange members <b>236</b> preferably corresponds to the number of stent posts <b>16</b> of the previously implanted heart valve <b>10</b> so that one lower flange member <b>236</b> can be positioned generally between two adjacent stent posts <b>16</b>, but on the opposite side of the stent structure <b>12</b> from the stent posts <b>16</b>. The stent <b>230</b> further includes multiple upper flange members <b>238</b>, which are positionable in the space between every two adjacent stent posts <b>16</b>, but on the same side of the stent structure <b>12</b> as the stent posts <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, two upper flange members <b>238</b> are positioned in each of the spaces between two adjacent stent posts <b>16</b>, which thereby provide additional anchoring points for the stent <b>230</b> within the stent structure <b>12</b>. In addition, these flange members <b>238</b> can function similarly to the structures <b>160</b> described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in that one or more of the flange members <b>238</b> can help to hold the leaflets of the failed bioprosthesis generally against the stent ring of the bioprosthesis so that they do not interfere with the leaflets of the new valved stent. The stent <b>230</b> can be configured so that each of the upper flange members <b>238</b> of the pair of upper flange members are angled at least slightly toward their adjacent stent posts <b>16</b> so that they are facing in at least slightly opposite directions from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a stent <b>250</b> for use as a prosthetic heart valve. Stent <b>250</b> is similar to stent <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> in that stent <b>250</b> also includes a portion that is made of an expandable material (e.g., stainless steel) with a balloon catheter, for example, and a portion that is made of a material that is self-expanding (e.g., Nitinol) when external forces are removed. In particular, a self-expanding portion of stent <b>250</b> may include multiple stent post engagement structures <b>252</b>, which are shown in this embodiment as being part of a continuous unit or piece that is configured to include three stent post engagement structures <b>252</b>. Each of the structures <b>252</b> is provided to engage with a stent post <b>16</b> of a stent structure <b>12</b>. The other portion (i.e., the portion that is not self-expanding) of the stent <b>250</b> comprises a mesh-like stent structure <b>254</b> that includes a number of wire portions arranged as best illustrated in the expanded version of the stent <b>250</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Although this embodiment does not illustrate particular flange portions that extend above or below the stent structure <b>12</b>, it is contemplated that any of the anchoring structures discussed above may be incorporated into the stent <b>250</b> to provide additional anchoring mechanisms for the stent <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates another stent <b>360</b> of the invention as it can be implanted within a previously implanted heart valve, such as a heart valve <b>362</b>, and specifically illustrates an exemplary positioning of the leaflets <b>370</b> of the previously implanted heart valve <b>362</b>. Stent <b>360</b> includes a split petal structure for its upper flange member that is positioned between stent posts <b>364</b>, as shown with petals <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>. These petals <b>366</b>, <b>368</b> provide two structures for holding the leaflets <b>370</b> of the heart valve <b>362</b> against the stent rail of that heart valve <b>362</b> so that the leaflets <b>370</b> do not interfere with the implantation and/or functioning of the newly implanted heart valve. The petals <b>366</b>, <b>368</b> may have the same configuration as each other, as shown, or may instead be differently sized and/or shaped than each other. It is also contemplated that other structures may be used, such as a series of barbs or extending members, and it is further understood that more or less than two structures can be used for holding the leaflets <b>370</b> against the rail of the heart valve <b>362</b>. The petal structures could also be used to hold native leaflets outward for the stented valve implanted in a native valve.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-27</figref> sequentially illustrate a delivery process for percutaneous delivery of a self-expanding type of stent into a prosthetic heart valve <b>320</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a distal tip <b>322</b> of a delivery system <b>324</b> as it is approaching heart valve <b>320</b>, with a stent completely enclosed within an outer sheath <b>326</b> such that there is no contact between the stent (which will be a replacement valve when the leaflets are attached) and any portion of the patient's internal anatomy during the insertion process. The delivery system <b>324</b> is advanced further toward heart valve <b>320</b> until the distal tip <b>322</b> is adjacent to or at least partially inserted into the central area of the heart valve <b>320</b>, or any desired location for deployment of the stent. The sheath <b>326</b> can then be partially retracted to release a portion of a stent <b>328</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. As shown, stent <b>328</b> includes upper flange portions <b>330</b>, upper vertical members <b>332</b>, and upper connecting members <b>334</b> extending between adjacent upper vertical members <b>332</b>. The upper connecting members <b>334</b> provide interface points for connection of the stent <b>328</b> with delivery system <b>324</b> used for the implantation process. In that regard, the upper connecting members <b>334</b> may optionally include one or more connection features that provide a more specific feature and/or portion for engagement with a portion of the delivery system, such as a groove <b>336</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a loop, or some other engagement feature.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the sheath <b>326</b> is partially retracted, as described above, the upper flange portions <b>330</b> are released from the interior of the sheath <b>326</b> and can expand or extend radially away from the central axis of the delivery system. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper flange portions <b>330</b> extend a sufficient distance from the delivery system <b>324</b> so that they can engage with the top surfaces (i.e., the outflow end) of the heart valve <b>320</b>. More specifically, the upper flange portions <b>330</b> can preferably extend into the space between adjacent stent posts <b>338</b> of the heart valve <b>320</b>. Thus, once the flange portions <b>330</b> are deployed, the delivery system <b>324</b> should be rotatable to orient the flange portions <b>330</b> in the spaces between adjacent stent posts <b>338</b>. Such a positioning can be accomplished either using a wide variety of visualization techniques and/or through tactile feedback to the person doing the implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Throughout the initial process of deploying the flange portions <b>330</b> in the implantation process, the upper connecting members <b>334</b> are engaged with a hook or other engagement device <b>340</b> of the delivery system <b>324</b>. These devices <b>340</b> can be attached to a mechanism within the interior portion of the sheath <b>326</b>, for example, or may be attached to some other structure that extends from the sheath or another portion of the delivery system. In this embodiment and as can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, an inner sheath member <b>342</b> includes an internal structure that supports multiple engagement devices <b>340</b>. In this embodiment, engagement devices <b>340</b> are configured as loops, each of which has a free end <b>344</b>. The structure of each of the devices <b>340</b> is designed and selected so that it can remain engaged with the upper connecting members <b>334</b> throughout the process of positioning the delivery system <b>324</b> and stent <b>328</b> in its desired position relative to the heart valve <b>320</b>. Advantageously, after deployment of at least part of the stent <b>328</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-25</figref>, for example, the stent <b>328</b> can be retracted back into the delivery system <b>324</b>, if desired or necessary, due to the continued engagement between the upper connecting members <b>334</b> and the engagement devices <b>340</b>. That is, the delivery systems and stents of the invention advantageously provide opportunities for stent repositioning that are not typically available in the deployment of self-expanding stents.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">At some point during the stent delivery, deployment, and repositioning process, the delivery system <b>324</b> can be further manipulated to release lower flange portions <b>346</b> from their compressed state within the delivery system <b>324</b>. For example, the distal tip <b>322</b> can be further moved away from the sheath <b>326</b> to allow the lower flange portions <b>346</b> to expand or extend outwardly from the internal area of the distal tip <b>322</b>. However, it is understood that the lower flange portions <b>346</b> may be confined and deployed in a wide variety of different ways, such as deployment methods that are discussed herein relative to various stent embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">After the stent <b>328</b> is properly oriented and positioned relative to the previously implanted heart valve <b>320</b>, the stent can be released completely from the delivery system <b>324</b> by increasing the force on the engagement devices <b>340</b> until the devices <b>340</b> disengage from the upper connecting members <b>334</b> of the stent <b>328</b>. In this embodiment, the force can be increased to at least partially straighten the engagement devices <b>340</b> until their free ends <b>344</b> move past the connecting members <b>334</b>, thereby disengaging the delivery system <b>324</b> from the stent <b>328</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates the stent <b>328</b> after the deployment process described above.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> illustrate further details of an embodiment of the inner sheath member <b>342</b> described above, along with the positional relationship between the inner sheath member <b>342</b> and engagement devices <b>340</b>. In particular, inner sheath member <b>342</b> includes an outer shell <b>348</b> that is cylindrical or circular in shape, although it could have another shape, such as oval, elliptical, square, or another symmetrical or asymmetrical shape. Outer shell <b>348</b> includes multiple extensions <b>354</b> that protrude toward its internal area, where one extension is preferably provided for each of the engagement devices <b>340</b> of a particular delivery system. Each of the extensions <b>354</b> of this embodiment includes an aperture <b>350</b>, which is sized to surround a portion of an engagement device <b>340</b>, and an optional notch <b>352</b> positioned to maintain the free end <b>344</b> of an engagement device <b>340</b> in a particular orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31-38</figref> illustrate another exemplary delivery process for implanting a stent <b>380</b> into a previously implanted heart valve <b>382</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows a basic first step of inserting a delivery device into the area of the failed heart valve or bioprosthesis <b>382</b>, and then a sheath <b>384</b> is retracted (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>) to allow the outflow end of the stent <b>380</b> to expand or extend outwardly, since the stent <b>380</b> is a self-expanding stent structure. As described above, the stent <b>380</b> can remain engaged with the delivery device, even when the stent is partially deployed, in order to allow it to be pulled back into the sheath <b>384</b> if desired during certain aspects of the delivery and positioning process. In any case, the sheath <b>384</b> can then be further retracted to allow the inflow end of the stent <b>380</b> to further expand or extend outwardly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref>. In this embodiment, the delivery system includes multiple engagement members in the form of hooks <b>386</b> that engage with the stent crown during positioning of the stent <b>380</b>. Positioning of the stent <b>380</b> can include rotation of the delivery device to properly orient the stent. The hooks <b>386</b> can be remotely connected to a deployment or other activation mechanism that allows the hooks <b>386</b> to become disengaged from the stent <b>380</b>, when desired.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Next, the delivery device can be pulled back to seat the stent <b>380</b> against the rails of the heart valve <b>382</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, while the hooks <b>386</b> remain engaged with the stent <b>380</b>. When the final positioning of the stent <b>380</b> is complete, the wires that make up the hooks <b>386</b> can be pulled in such a way that the wires straighten sufficiently that they release from the stent <b>380</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>. Notably, the act of releasing the stent when it is fully expanded is advantageous in that it allows blood to flow through the valve during the delivery and implantation process. In addition, it allows the clinician to verify that the valve is properly positioned and seated with the valve in a fully expanded condition.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The delivery system can further include a tube or other covering structure <b>388</b> that at least partially surrounds the wires that comprise the hooks <b>386</b>, especially when the delivery device is being manipulated within a patient. These structures <b>388</b> can be retracted before or after the wires they surround are disengaged from their respective stent structures, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, thereby releasing the stent from the delivery system.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39-41</figref> illustrate a portion of a delivery system that includes another embodiment of an engagement member <b>390</b> in the form of a clasp or spring-like structure that engages with a portion of a stent during delivery of the stent. In particular, the engagement member <b>390</b> includes a delivery wire <b>392</b> from which a clasping mechanism <b>394</b> extends. Clasping mechanism <b>394</b> includes two wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> that are bent or curved near their distal ends <b>400</b>, <b>402</b>, respectively. In this embodiment, the wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> are shaped so that their end portions extend over a wire of the stent with which the delivery system is engaged, and the wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> optionally overlap each other at least slightly. As with other delivery systems described herein, the engagement member <b>390</b> (specifically, the clasping mechanism <b>394</b>) will remain engaged with the stent until the stent is properly positioned and oriented. When the final positioning of the stent is complete, the delivery wire <b>392</b> can be pulled or otherwise manipulated in such a way that the wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> straighten enough that they release from the stent, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. It is understood that the wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> can be shaped or formed differently than shown to provide more, less, or different functional engagement with the stent wires. For example, the wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> may be formed in such a way that they rotate relative to each other to engage with and release the stent, rather than being deformed or straightened to release from the stent, as is generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The delivery system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39-41</figref> can further include a tube or other covering structure <b>404</b> that at least partially surrounds the wire portions <b>396</b>, <b>398</b> for at least part of the delivery process, such as when the delivery device is being manipulated within a patient. These structures <b>404</b> can be retracted before or after the wires they surround are disengaged from their respective stent structures.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref> illustrate a portion of a delivery system that includes another embodiment of an engagement member <b>410</b> in the form of a protrusion structure that engages with a portion of a stent during insertion and positioning of the stent. The protrusion can take many shapes or configurations, including the ball-like structure illustrated, although it is contemplated that the protrusion has any geometry, shape, and/or size that allows the protrusion to engage with an opening in the stent and retain the stent while covered. In particular, the engagement member <b>410</b> includes a delivery wire <b>412</b> from which a protrusion <b>414</b> extends. The delivery wire <b>412</b> is shaped so that the protrusion <b>414</b> can be positioned for engagement with a wire of the stent with which the delivery system is engaged, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. As with other delivery systems described herein, the engagement member <b>410</b> (specifically, the protrusion <b>414</b>) will remain engaged with the stent until the stent is properly positioned and oriented. When the final positioning of the stent is complete, the delivery wire <b>412</b> can be pulled or otherwise manipulated in such a way that the protrusion <b>414</b> disengages from the stent, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>. The delivery system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref> can further include a tube or other covering structure <b>416</b> that at least partially surrounds protrusion <b>414</b>, such as when the delivery device is being manipulated within a patient. These structures <b>416</b> can be retracted before or after the wires they surround are disengaged from their respective stent structures, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the portion of the delivery system embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref>, the engagement member <b>414</b> is described and shown as a relatively spherical member that engages with the wires of a stent. However, alternative engagement member configurations can be provided that function similarly to the illustrated engagement member, where these engagement members can extend from a delivery wire that is configured the same or differently from delivery wire <b>412</b>, although the method of engagement with the stent wire(s) can be similar. For example, the engagement member may instead be configured more as a tab that can have a wide variety of shapes, such as triangular, rectangular, or elliptical, for a few examples. Any of these engagement members may further include an angled face that extends from a portion of the engagement member toward its associated delivery wire. Such an angled face can provide for easier engagement with and/or removal from the stent wire, for example, and can have a corresponding angle and size that provides the desired functional feature.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The tube or covering structures described above can additionally or alternatively serve the function of maintaining an engagement mechanism in its engaged position until it is desired to release the stent from the mechanism. For example, such a tube can surround a wire that is bent around a stent structure, then when the tube is retracted, the wire can spring or move to a different position to thereby release from the stent structure. The tubes can be flexible so that they can dramatically expand with a stent when a corresponding sheath is retracted.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46-48</figref> illustrate another stent design for use with leaflets in a valved stent. In particular, a stent <b>420</b> is shown with a number of peaks or &#x201c;V's&#x201d; at both its inflow and outflow ends. The number of peaks may be the same at both ends of the stent, or as shown with stent <b>420</b>, the two ends of the stent <b>420</b> may have a different number of peaks. In this embodiment, the end <b>422</b> has twice as many peaks as the end <b>424</b>; however, the relative number of peaks at opposite ends of the stents can vary widely. In any case, either the inflow or the outflow petals or peaks are provided to interface with a delivery system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 48</figref>. In that regard, the delivery system preferably includes some type of engagement device or structure (shown in this embodiment as wire hook-shaped structures <b>426</b>) that facilitates full stent retrievability into the delivery system, even after the stent is partially or completely deployed. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, because the engagement devices remain engaged with the stent <b>420</b> after the stent is fully deployed from the sheath of a delivery system, the stent can be retracted back into the sheath, such as may be desirable if the stent cannot be positioned correctly in a patient. The various configurations discussed above relative to stent engagement alternatives can also be used with stent <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The delivery systems and methods described herein, along with other delivery systems and methods used for implantation of heart valves, can also be used with replacement heart valves that are not positioned within a previously implanted heart valve. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> illustrates one such exemplary embodiment of a replacement heart valve <b>260</b>, which comprises a stent <b>262</b> that is similar to stent <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>; however, the stent <b>262</b> does not have the same flanges as the stent <b>170</b>. It is noted that like this stent, any of the other embodiments of stents described herein could alternatively be provided without their respective flanges, which would allow the stents to additionally be used for replacement of a native valve. This figure further illustrates a leaflet structure <b>264</b> attached to the interior portion of stent <b>262</b>. Leaflet structure <b>264</b> includes three leaflets <b>266</b>, each of which has opposite side edges that are attached to one or both of upper vertical members <b>268</b> and lower vertical members <b>269</b> of stent <b>262</b>. Stent <b>262</b> further includes lower connecting members <b>270</b> to which leaflet structure <b>264</b> can be attached via suturing, adhesives, or any known or developed method of providing such an attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> illustrates another stented valve <b>442</b> as positioned within a native aorta <b>440</b>. This valve <b>442</b> can include a stent structure similar to those discussed herein relative to upper and lower flanges, extensions, and the like, such as stent <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, although it can vary in the positioning and configuration of the various structures. In general, stented valve <b>442</b> includes a stent <b>444</b> to which a tissue structure <b>446</b> is attached to provide the leaflets of the stented valve. Stent <b>444</b> includes upper connecting members <b>448</b> that can be used for engagement with a delivery system during the delivery and positioning process, and also includes lower flanges <b>450</b> that can serve as anchors with the native valve structure. It is noted that although the connecting members <b>448</b> of this stent structure and similar connecting members in other embodiments of the invention are shown as relatively simple curved structures, these connecting members can instead have a different structure that facilitates compression and expansion of the stent. For example, the connecting member could instead have a zigzag shape or structure or a coiled shape or structure. When implanted into a patient, the valve <b>442</b> can be aligned and oriented so that the portion of the tissue between extending vertical members <b>452</b> is aligned with the coronary arteries so that they are not blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Stented valve <b>460</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> includes a stent structure <b>462</b> to which a tissue structure <b>464</b> is attached to provide the leaflets of the stented valve. Stented valve <b>460</b> further includes a seal or gasket <b>466</b> on the outer surface of the stent structure <b>462</b> to mitigate the possibility of paravalvular leakage when implanted in a patient. Stented valve <b>470</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> similarly includes a stent structure <b>472</b> to which a tissue structure <b>474</b> is attached to provide the leaflets of the stented valve. Stented valve <b>470</b> includes a seal or gasket <b>476</b> on the outer surface of the stent structure <b>472</b>, wherein seal or gasket <b>476</b> extends higher along the stent rails than the gasket <b>466</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref> illustrates another stent design for use with leaflets in a stented valve. In particular, a stent <b>500</b> is shown with a central portion <b>502</b> from which a top structure <b>504</b> and a bottom structure <b>506</b> extend. Central portion <b>502</b> includes two sets of zigzag structures <b>508</b> and <b>510</b>, each of which has a number of peaks and valleys or &#x201c;V's&#x201d; that are differently sized and shaped around the circumference of stent <b>500</b>, although it is contemplated that the peaks and valleys can be the same around the circumference of the stent <b>500</b>. In this embodiment, each of the peaks of the zigzag structure <b>510</b> is adjacent to a valley of the zigzag structure <b>508</b> such that they meet at an intersection point, such as is indicated at reference numeral <b>512</b>. These intersection points <b>512</b> can provide attachment points for any tissue valve structures that may be positioned therein, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Structure <b>508</b> further optionally includes at least one extended peak <b>514</b> that is at least somewhat larger or higher than the other peaks in the structure, where this embodiment includes three of such extended peaks. The top structure <b>504</b> extends from these extended peaks <b>514</b> and is configured to provide at least one node <b>516</b> for attachment of the stent to a delivery device. In this embodiment, three nodes <b>516</b> are provided, although it is possible to have more or less than three nodes in such a stent structure. In a similar manner, structure <b>510</b> includes at least one peak <b>518</b>, which is opposite the extended peaks <b>514</b> in this embodiment, from which the bottom structure <b>506</b> extends. The bottom structure <b>506</b> includes at least one node <b>520</b> for attachment of the stent <b>500</b> to a delivery device. Again, three nodes <b>520</b> are provided in this embodiment, although it is possible to have more or less than three nodes in such a stent structure. The number of nodes <b>516</b> may be the same or different than the number of nodes <b>520</b> in a particular stent structure. The nodes <b>516</b>, <b>520</b> may be engageable with or attachable to some portion of a delivery system, such as the various delivery systems that are described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54-56</figref> illustrate another stent design for use with leaflets as a stented valve. In particular, a stent <b>530</b> includes zigzag structures that extend from each other at a number of intersection points, such as intersection points designated by reference number <b>532</b>. Again, the peaks and valleys of the multiple &#x201c;V's&#x201d; of the zigzag structures can vary somewhat from that shown, such as in the relative sizes, numbers, shapes and configurations of these structures. As shown in this embodiment, stent <b>530</b> includes a number of elongated portions <b>534</b> that generally extend from the top to the bottom of the stent <b>530</b>, and three of such elongated portions <b>534</b> are provided in this embodiment to correspond with the number of commissures of a valve that can be attached to the stent. Alternatively, the stent may include more or less than three elongated portions <b>534</b>. As with other embodiments of the stents of the invention, nodes <b>540</b> at one end of the stent <b>530</b> and nodes <b>542</b> at the opposite end of the stent <b>530</b> are configured in an arrangement that allows engagement of the nodes with a delivery system. The arrangement of the stent wires can desirably also push the native leaflets toward the vessel wall (e.g., the aortic wall) to minimize or eliminate interference between the native valves and those of the stented valve.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The intersection points <b>532</b> of stent <b>530</b> are arranged in such a way that they form a curve (indicated generally by broken line <b>536</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 and 58</figref>, this curve can be designed to generally match the desired attachment points for a valve leaflet <b>538</b> that will be attached to the stent, such as by suturing. These intersection points <b>532</b>, which are spaced from each other around the circumference of the stent <b>530</b>, provide secure anchoring points to maintain the valve <b>538</b> in its desired position relative to the stent <b>530</b>. In particular, these intersection points <b>532</b> can be advantageous to keep the valve in its desired location relative to the stent during compression and expansion of the stent. Stent <b>530</b> can further include a seal or gasket <b>540</b> on its outer surface to mitigate the possibility of paravalvular leakage when implanted in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As discussed herein, the various delivery systems of the invention can be used with any of the stent structures described herein, and/or with other stent structures, for replacement of a previously implanted prosthetic heart valve. A number of different stents and delivery systems can be used for such implantations, including the stents and delivery systems described above, along with other exemplary stents and delivery systems, such as those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0199963-A1; U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the stent or valve structure <b>12</b> includes a sewing ring <b>14</b> and stent posts <b>16</b> and is covered by a covering <b>18</b>, such as is included in the stented tissue valves commercially available from Medtronic, Inc. of Minneapolis, Minn. under the trade designations &#x201c;Hancock II&#x201d; and &#x201c;Mosaic&#x201d;. A wide variety of other stented tissue valves, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,680,031, 4,892,541, and 5,032,128, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, can be employed as the stent or valve structure <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the structure <b>12</b> can be stentless, such as, for example, a Freestyle stentless bioprosthesis, commercially available from Medtronic, Inc. under the trade designation &#x201c;Freestyle&#x201d;. Other acceptable stentless configurations are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,156,621; 5,197,979; 5,336,258; 5,509,930; 6,001,126; 6,254,436; 6,342,070; 6,364,905; and 6,558,417, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Regardless, the leaflets (not shown) are attached to the structure <b>12</b> by sewing, crimping, adhesive, etc., for example, and can assume a variety of forms (e.g., autologous tissue, xenograph tissue, or synthetic material, such as polymers, metals, combinations thereof, and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">With any of the embodiments of the invention described herein, the valved stents can be placed inside of a failed valve with leaflets, as described herein, or the leaflets of the failed valve can be removed prior to delivery of the new valved stents, in accordance with known procedures for leaflet removal.
