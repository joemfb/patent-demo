<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Hard masks are used in semiconductor processing to transfer patterns onto substrates, in particular as feature sizes are increasingly shrinking. A metal hard mask can provide a desired etching profile and critical dimension control for decreasing geometries. However, pattern distortion can result from hard masks fabricated with high residual stress, and a thermal budget may be required to release stress in the hard mask.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure provides for various advantageous embodiments. According to one embodiment, a method for fabricating a metal hard mask includes flowing at least one metal reactant gas into a reaction chamber configured to perform chemical vapor deposition (CVD), wherein the at least one metal reactant gas includes a metal-halogen gas or a metal-organic gas. The method further includes depositing a hard mask metal layer by CVD using the at least one metal reactant gas. According to one aspect, the method may further include tuning a stress and/or a density of the deposited hard mask metal layer with a plasma treatment on the deposited hard mask metal layer. The plasma treatment may include stopping flow of the at least one metal reactant gas and bombarding the deposited hard mask TiN layer with a plasma formed from the at least one carrier gas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In another embodiment, a method for fabricating a metal hard mask includes flowing at least one metal reactant gas and at least one carrier gas into a reaction chamber configured to perform chemical vapor deposition (CVD), wherein the at least one metal reactant gas includes a titanium-halogen gas or a titanium-organic gas. The method further includes depositing a hard mask TiN layer by CVD using the at least one metal reactant gas and the at least one carrier gas. According to one aspect, the method may further include tuning a stress and/or a density of the deposited hard mask TiN layer with a plasma treatment on the deposited hard mask TiN layer, and performing multiple cycles of hard mask TiN layer CVD and plasma treatment to form a plurality of hard mask TiN layers, each hard mask TiN layer deposited one above the other.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In yet another embodiment, a metal hard mask comprises a titanium hard mask metal layer or a tantalum hard mask metal layer deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) from at least one metal reactant gas including a metal-halogen gas or a metal-organic gas, wherein the titanium hard mask metal layer is deposited by plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) or metal-organic CVD (MOCVD) using a titanium-halogen precursor or a titanium-organic precursor, and wherein the tantalum hard mask metal layer is deposited by PECVD or MOCVD using a tantalum-halogen precursor or a tantalum-organic precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Advantageously, the present disclosure provides methods for fabricating a metal hard mask that is substantially stress-free or reduced in stress with a high density. The methods are simplified without requiring a conventional post-deposition anneal process, thus improving a thermal budget while maintaining device performance and ensuring high-k integrity.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for the sake of simplicity and clarity. It is noted that the same or similar features may be similarly numbered herein for the sake of simplicity and clarity. In addition, some of the drawings may be simplified for clarity. Thus, the drawings may not depict all of the components of a given apparatus (e.g., device) or method.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various aspects of the present disclosure will be described herein with reference to drawings that are schematic illustrations of idealized configurations of the present disclosure. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, the various aspects of the present disclosure presented throughout this disclosure should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of elements (e.g., regions, layers, sections, substrates, etc.) illustrated and described herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. By way of example, an element illustrated or described as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient concentration at its edges rather than a discrete change from one element to another. Thus, the elements illustrated in the drawings are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of an element and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It will be understood that when an element such as a region, layer, section, substrate, or the like, is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will be further understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;formed&#x201d; on another element, it can be grown, deposited, etched, attached, connected, coupled, or otherwise prepared or fabricated on the other element or an intervening element.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be understood that although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, and so on, may be used herein to describe various process parameters or elements, such as RF power, tap setting, precursor gases, electrodes, and the like, these process parameters or elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one process parameter or element from another process parameter or element. Thus, a first RF power, gas, tap setting, or electrode discussed below could be termed a second RF power, gas, tap setting, or electrode without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is understood that several processing steps and/or features of a device may be only briefly described, such steps and/or features being well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, additional processing steps or features can be added, and certain of the following processing steps or features can be removed and/or changed while still implementing the claims. Thus, the following description should be understood to represent examples only, and are not intended to suggest that one or more steps or features is required.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, flowcharts are shown illustrating a method <b>100</b> and a method <b>200</b>, respectively, for fabricating a metal hard mask in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The various steps in methods <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> described above may be performed by various techniques, means, apparatus, and/or systems. It should be noted that the operations of methods <b>100</b> or <b>200</b> may be rearranged or otherwise modified within the scope of the various aspects of the present disclosure. It is further noted that additional processes may be provided before, during, and after the operations of methods <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>, and that some other processes may only be briefly described herein. Thus, other implementations are possible within the scope of the various aspects described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, the reaction chamber may include a first electrode configured to support a substrate (e.g., a dielectric) and a second electrode disposed above the first electrode and the substrate. A radio frequency (RF) power may be applied between the first and second electrodes to deposit the metal layer onto the substrate. Another RF power may be applied between the first and second electrodes during a termination operation, and in one example, a second RF power may be less than a first RF power. In other words, a deposition operation may occur with the flowing of at least one reactant gas and a carrier or dilution gas into the deposition chamber and application of a first (main deposition) power level to the electrodes of the reaction chamber. A second power may be applied between electrodes of the reaction chamber during a termination operation or plasma treatment operation that subsequently occurs after the deposition operation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the deposited hard mask metal layer may include a titanium layer, a titanium nitride layer, a tantalum layer, or a tantalum nitride layer. According to another aspect, the hard mask metal layer may be deposited by plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) or metal-organic CVD (MOCVD).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the at least one metal reactant gas is selected from the group consisting of a titanium-halogen gas (e.g., TiCl<sub>4</sub>), a titanium-organic gas (e.g., tetrakis-(dimethylamido)titanium (TDMAT), tetrakis-(diethylamido)titanium (TDEAT)), a tantalum-halogen gas, a tantalum-organic gas, and combinations thereof. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, methods <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may each further comprise flowing a second reactant gas into the reaction chamber, wherein the second reactant gas is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, ammonia, and combinations thereof. According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, the carrier gas is selected from the group consisting of helium, argon, hydrogen, and combinations thereof. In one example, to form a TiN film, Ti-containing gases and N-containing gases are used as precursor gases, an inert gas is used as a carrier gas, and power applied between the electrodes during the deposition operation ranges between about 0 Watts and about 200 Watts, for between about 0 seconds and about 20 seconds. Process temperature may range between about 350 degrees Celsius and about 450 degrees Celsius, and process pressure may range between about 1 Torr and about 50 Torr.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment of a PECVD process, a glow discharge (i.e., a plasma) is formed when RF power is applied between the two electrodes in the reaction chamber. Reactant gases contained within the reaction chamber produce chemically reactive species (e.g., atoms, ions, and radicals). These reactive species diffuse to and are absorbed on the surface of the substrate material. RF power may be applied to both the upper and lower electrodes. According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, RF power may be applied to the upper electrode and the lower electrode may be held at ground potential. An impedance matching unit may be adjusted to maximize the amount of RF power absorbed by the plasma. The setting of the impedance matching unit is called a tap setting in this document and corresponds to a maximum RF power applied between the upper and lower electrodes and absorbed by the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the plasma treatment may include stopping flow of the at least one metal reactant gas into the reaction chamber and bombarding the deposited hard mask metal layer with plasma formed from nitrogen, ammonia, argon, helium, hydrogen, or a combination thereof, to thereby tune the stress and/or density of the deposited metal layer. The density of the deposited film may be increased by the plasma treatment, and in some instances for the case of Cl-containing precursor gases, the plasma treatment may remove Cl content. In one example, power applied between the electrodes during the plasma treatment operation may range between about 0 Watts and about 200 Watts, for between about 0 seconds and about 20 seconds. Process temperature may range between about 350 degrees Celsius and about 450 degrees Celsius, and process pressure may range between about 1 Torr and about 50 Torr.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one example, with no intent of limitation, the stress of the deposited hard mask metal layer is tuned to be between about 1E9 dyne/cm<sup>2 </sup>and about &#x2212;1E9 dyne/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the density of the metal layer is tuned to be greater than about 4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. In yet another example, the density of the hard mask metal layer may be tuned to be greater than about 4.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. In yet another example, the density of the hard mask metal layer may be tuned to be about 4.8 gm/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, method <b>100</b> may further comprise performing multiple cycles of hard mask metal layer CVD and plasma treatment to form a plurality of hard mask metal layers, with each hard mask metal layer deposited one above the other. For the case of a plurality of cycles of deposition and plasma treatment to form a plurality of hard mask metal layers in either method <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>, different deposition and plasma treatment parameters in each or some cycles, in one example, or fixed deposition and plasma treatment parameters in each cycle, in another example, may be utilized. Total thickness of the metal hard mask may vary and deposition and plasma treatment cycles (i.e., one cycle includes a deposition operation and a plasma treatment operation) may range between about 3 cycles and about 20 cycles in one example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, a RF power applied between the first and second electrodes may be changed. The RF power may be changed by various processes, such as by stopping flow of at least one reactant gas into the reaction chamber, stopping flow of at least one carrier gas into the reaction chamber, changing a chamber pressure, applying a different power to the first electrode and/or the second electrode, changing a tap setting to an impedance matching unit coupled to the second electrode, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one example, the RF power may be passively changed by stopping flow of at least one reactant gas into the reaction chamber, stopping flow of at least one carrier gas into the reaction chamber, changing a chamber pressure, or combinations thereof. In another example, the RF power may be actively changed by applying a different power to the first electrode and/or the second electrode, changing a tap setting to an impedance matching unit coupled to the second electrode, or combinations thereof. In yet another example, during the deposition operation, a first chamber pressure, a first chamber temperature, and a first maximum applied RF power may be provided between the electrodes of the reaction chamber. During a termination operation or a plasma treatment operation, a second chamber pressure, a second chamber temperature, and a second maximum applied RF power may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, plasma may be formed by applying low frequency RF (LFRF) power to the first electrode, applying high frequency RF (HFRF) power to the second electrode, and forming a plasma between the first and second electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, prior to applying a RF power between the first and second electrodes, a chamber pressure may be provided between about 1 Torr and about 50 Torr during a main deposition operation, a termination operation, or a plasma treatment operation, and a chamber temperature may be provided between about 350 degrees Celsius and about 450 degrees Celsius during a main deposition operation, a termination operation, or a plasma treatment operation.</p>

The term &#x201c;supporting&#x201d; as used in this document and in connection with the first electrode is intended to mean holding or positioning one or more substrates in a desired orientation so that chemical vapor deposition can take place. Accordingly, substrate can be supported, held, or otherwise positioned in orientations other than the shown horizontal position. Furthermore, although a parallel plate PECVD chamber is illustrated, other RF power systems are applicable to perform the methods of the present disclosure, such as an inductive coil PECVD chamber as described in U.S. Pat.
