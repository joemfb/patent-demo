<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">More and more organizations are implementing networks in which users authenticate to a server on the network before acquiring access to network services. Once users have access to network services, users may use that access to use network-based applications such as intranets, web-based email, web-based word processors, database services, document management services, content management services, etc. These network-based applications may restrict access to authorized users, and, in this case, will verify the identity of authorized users.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A method may include authenticating a device to a first server, where the device includes an agent; receiving a request, in the first server from a second server, to verify the authenticity of the device, where the device is not authenticated to the second server; sending a browser plug-in to the device to communicate with the agent for verifying the authenticity of the device; receiving, in the first server, a message from the agent verifying the authenticity of the device; and sending a message from the first server to the second server to authenticate the device to the second server.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A network device may include a processor to authenticate a user device to the network device, where the user device includes an agent; a receiver to receive a request from a server to authenticate the user device, where the user device is not authenticated to the server; and a transmitter to sent a browser plug-in to the user device to communicate with the agent for verifying the authenticity of the user device with the network device; where the receiver receives a message from the agent verifying the authenticity of the user device; and where the transmitter sends a message from the network device to the server to authenticate the user device to the server.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An apparatus may include means for authenticating a device to a first server, where the device includes an agent; means for receiving a request, in the first server from a second server, to verify the authenticity of the device, where the device is not authenticated to the second server; means for sending executable code to the device to communicate with the agent for verifying the authenticity of the device; means for receiving, in the first server, a message from the agent verifying the authenticity of the device; and means for sending a message from the first server to the second server to authenticate the device to the second server.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead, the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims and equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In organizations that implement 802.1X authentication by endpoints before endpoints can access the network, a policy server in the network may be aware of the identity of the user using an endpoint. After gaining access to the network, users may access servers over the network, for example, to request resources (e.g., services and applications) provided by those servers. For example, a user may want to access a document management database. The user may also want to access benefits information from the corporate human resources web page. These two services may be hosted on separate servers within a corporate network and each server may want to authenticate the user. It may be a hassle, however, for the user to type and re-type her user name, password, etc., over and over again each time the user accesses a different server associated with her corporate network, particularly if the user had already been authenticated over 802.1X by a policy server.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the user has already authenticated to a server on the network before acquiring access to network services, embodiments described herein may authorize access for the user to network-based application based on the original authentication rather than prompting the user for credentials again when the user attempts to use a network-based application. Embodiments disclosed herein may allow for a user (e.g., a user name or user device) to authenticate with a policy server that may also act as an identity provider. When the user requests resources from an application server (e.g., a service provider), the application server may request that the policy server verify the authenticity of the user. The policy server may validate the authenticity of the user and, as a result, the application server may deliver the resources requested by the user. Thus, in one embodiment, a single sign-on may be used for authentication of a user with multiple application servers.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Exemplary Environment</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary environment <b>100</b> that may include a network <b>102</b>, user devices <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>104</b>-N (individually &#x201c;user device <b>104</b>-<i>x</i>,&#x201d; collectively &#x201c;user devices <b>104</b>&#x201d;), a policy server <b>106</b>, and application servers <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>108</b>-M (individually &#x201c;application server <b>108</b>-<i>x</i>,&#x201d; collectively &#x201c;application servers <b>108</b>&#x201d;). In practice, there may be more, different, or fewer devices or a different arrangement of devices than what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, environment <b>100</b> may include thousands or even millions of user devices <b>104</b> (the number of which is denoted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by N). Environment <b>100</b> may also include dozens of application servers <b>108</b> (the number of which is denoted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by M).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows user devices <b>104</b>, policy server <b>106</b>, and application servers <b>108</b> in environment <b>100</b>, one or more of these devices may be remotely located from the others, e.g., the devices may be geographically diverse. Although arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may indicate communication between devices and network <b>102</b>, communication may be direct between devices or indirect through one or more networks. User devices <b>104</b>, policy server <b>106</b>, and application servers <b>108</b> may be considered &#x201c;nodes&#x201d; or &#x201c;devices&#x201d; coupled to or located within network <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Communication among user devices <b>104</b>, policy server <b>106</b>, and application servers <b>108</b> may be accomplished via wired and/or wireless communication connections. Network <b>102</b> may include a wide-area network (WAN) (e.g., the Internet), a local-area network (either wired or wireless), a telephone network (e.g., the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)), an intranet, a private corporate network, or a combination of networks.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">User devices <b>104</b> may include computers, telephones, personal digital assistants, or any other communication devices that may transmit or receive data. User devices <b>104</b> may include, for example, computers that send and/or receive data through network <b>102</b>. User devices <b>104</b> may also include, for example, telephones that send and/or receive voice conversations, video conferences, etc., through network <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Policy server <b>106</b> may receive requests, such as authentication, authorization, and/or access requests, from user devices <b>104</b> and/or application servers <b>108</b>. For example, policy server <b>106</b> may receive a request from user device <b>104</b>-<i>x </i>to be authenticated and to establish a session with policy server <b>106</b>. Policy server <b>106</b> may provision authorization and access for user device <b>104</b>-<i>x </i>after authenticating user device <b>104</b>-<i>x </i>and may establish a channel for communications between user device <b>104</b>-<i>x </i>and policy server <b>106</b>. Policy server <b>106</b> may include a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) server that processes EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) messages contained in RADIUS messages received from a network access device, such as a switch or wireless access point, where the user device uses 802.1X to authenticate to the network access device. Policy server <b>106</b> may also verify the authenticity of a user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> when requested by application server <b>108</b>-<i>x</i>. Policy server <b>106</b> may also be referred to as an identity provider.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Application servers <b>108</b> may provide application services to user devices <b>104</b> (or other nodes) in environment <b>100</b>. Such services may include document management services, email services, calendar services, instant messaging services, etc. Application servers <b>108</b> may send requests to policy server <b>106</b> to verify the authenticity of user devices <b>104</b> requesting resources in application servers <b>108</b>. An application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may also be referred to as a service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although application servers <b>108</b> are shown as separate devices, in one embodiment, one or more application servers <b>108</b> may be virtual machines running in one or more computers. In addition, although policy server <b>106</b> is shown separate from application servers <b>108</b>, in one embodiment, policy server <b>106</b> may be a virtual machine running in a computer that may also host other virtual machines, such as one or more application servers <b>108</b> implemented as virtual machines.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, application servers <b>108</b> and policy server <b>106</b> may be part of a common corporate environment, for example. In other words, application servers <b>108</b> may provide applications to corporate employees who may be authenticated by policy server <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, application servers <b>108</b> and policy server <b>106</b> may be able to communicate in a secure manner with each other, for example, by having shared secrets or a public/private key and certification system. For example, application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may be able to receive communication from policy server <b>106</b> knowing that the communication is unaltered and from policy server <b>106</b> (e.g., not an interloper), and vice versa. In other words, communications or messages from policy server <b>106</b> may be verifiable or certifiable when received by application servers <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, messages from policy server <b>106</b> may be verifiable or certifiable by virtue of physical security rather than the use of encryption, etc.</p>

For example, token table <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> does not list a user device in field <b>508</b> of record <b>520</b>. As described below, policy server <b>106</b> may determine the user device identity based on the channel over which a token was received.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As mentioned, policy server <b>106</b> may determine the user device, user name, and session ID based on the channel over which a token was received. For example, policy server <b>106</b> may receive token T<b>1</b> over channel Y. Referencing session table <b>400</b> (e.g., record <b>422</b>), policy server <b>106</b> may determine that channel Y is associated with session ID AC, user name JANE, and device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. Thus, policy server <b>106</b> may enter AC, JANE, and <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> into session ID field <b>504</b>, user name field <b>506</b>, and user device field <b>508</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Token received from agent field <b>510</b> may include a value indicating whether policy server <b>106</b> received the token from an authentication agent, such as agent <b>262</b>. Token received from browser field <b>512</b> may include a value indicting whether policy server <b>106</b> received the token from a browser, such as browser <b>264</b> of user device <b>104</b>-<i>x</i>. Token received from agent field <b>510</b> and token received from browser field <b>512</b> are described in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Exemplary Processing</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary process <b>600</b> for verifying the authenticity of a user device, such as user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. Process <b>600</b> is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a signal diagram of exemplary signals that may be sent between an application server, a user device, and a policy server, such as application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>, user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, and policy server <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Process <b>600</b> may begin when a user authenticates a user device to a policy server and establishes a session (block <b>602</b>). For example, a user with a user name JANE may want to authenticate user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> with policy server <b>106</b> so that she may be able to access the network, e.g., any one of application servers <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>108</b>-M. Policy server <b>106</b> may authenticate user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> using any number of authentication protocols including, for example, 802.1X/RADIUS or IKE (Internet Key Exchange). User device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> may establish a secure control channel with policy server <b>106</b> using any number of protocols, including, for example, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, etc. The secure channel may be maintained throughout the duration of a session between user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and policy server <b>106</b>, and enables agent <b>262</b> and policy server <b>106</b> to securely exchange information regarding the session. In one embodiment, the user of device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> with user name JANE may be required to type in a user name, password, and/or enter a pass code from a security fob or mobile phone. In one embodiment, user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and policy server <b>106</b> may perform certificate-based authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The user of device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> may use agent <b>262</b> to communicate with policy server <b>106</b> for authenticating and establishing the secure control channel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, signals <b>702</b> may pass between agent <b>262</b> of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and policy server <b>106</b> for authenticating and establishing the control channel. Establishing a control channel means that policy server <b>106</b> may be able to receive communication from agent <b>262</b> knowing that the communication is unaltered and actually originated from agent <b>262</b> (e.g., not an interloper). In other words, communications or messages from agent <b>262</b> may be verifiable or certifiable. As such, authenticating and establishing a control channel may be considered authenticating agent <b>262</b> to policy server <b>106</b> and establishing a control channel between agent <b>262</b> and policy server <b>106</b>. The control channel established may include a communication channel between policy server <b>106</b> and agent <b>262</b> with a channel ID and a session ID. A session between agent <b>262</b> and policy server <b>106</b> begins when agent <b>262</b> authenticates to policy server <b>106</b> and continues for a period of time determined by policy server <b>262</b>, agent <b>262</b>, and the user operating user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Policy server <b>106</b> may create a new record in session table <b>400</b>, such as record <b>424</b> for user name JANE. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, record <b>424</b> may have a session ID field <b>402</b> of AC corresponding to a user name of JANE in user name field <b>404</b> and a channel ID of Y in channel ID field <b>408</b>. In one embodiment, session ID (e.g., AC) may be a shared secret between agent <b>262</b> and policy server <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A request for a server resource may be received (block <b>604</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, signal <b>704</b> may pass from browser <b>264</b> (in user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>) to application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> requesting a server resource. Signal <b>704</b> may be a URI or a URL, for example, associated with a resource relating to benefits information, such as retirement account balances. Application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>, however, may not trust request signal <b>704</b> purporting to come from an authenticated user name and user device (e.g., JANE using device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>) because application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may not have been privy to the authentication that took place between agent <b>262</b> and policy server <b>106</b> in signals <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The request for the server resource may be redirected to a policy server (block <b>606</b>). In the current example, because application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may not trust the request signal <b>704</b>, application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may redirect browser <b>264</b> to policy server <b>106</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, signal <b>706</b> may be a redirection signal, which may be passed by browser <b>264</b> to policy server <b>106</b> as signal <b>708</b>. Redirection signal <b>706</b> may include a request by application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> to verify the authenticity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. In one embodiment, the request for verification may be encrypted or signed by application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A browser plug-in may be delivered (block <b>608</b>). Having received signal <b>708</b>, policy server <b>106</b> may recognize the signal as a request by application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> to verify the authenticity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. Policy server <b>106</b> may respond to browser <b>264</b> by delivering a plug-in to browser <b>264</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, signal <b>710</b> may include a plug-in being sent from policy server <b>106</b> to browser <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The session may be identified (block <b>610</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, browser <b>264</b> (using the plug-in) may communicate (using signals <b>712</b>) with agent <b>262</b> to identify the session established for user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. The session may be identified using, for example, the session ID, channel ID, the user name of device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, or the identity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The session may be verified with the policy server (block <b>612</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, signals <b>714</b> may pass between browser <b>264</b>, agent <b>262</b>, and policy server <b>106</b> such that policy server <b>106</b> verifies that user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> has indeed been authenticated and has established a session with policy server <b>106</b>. For example, agent <b>262</b> may use the secure communication channel established at block <b>602</b> to verify the authenticity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> with policy server <b>106</b>. One embodiment of blocks <b>610</b> and <b>612</b> are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The session may be verified with the application server and the user device may be redirected to the application server (block <b>614</b>). Although policy server <b>106</b> may have verified the authenticity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> (e.g., that user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> established a session), policy server <b>106</b> may verify this to application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> (as requested by application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, policy server <b>106</b> may send a verification message (signal <b>716</b>) to browser <b>264</b>. Verification message (signal <b>716</b>) may include a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) message, which is a standard for exchanging security authentication and authorization messages between devices, such as policy server <b>106</b> and application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>. Verification message (signal <b>716</b>) may include a SAML Assertion and/or a SAML Artifact, for example. The verification message (signal <b>716</b>) may be forwarded to application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> (signal <b>718</b>). The verification message may include information such as the user name (e.g., JANE), identification of the user device (e.g., user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>), time of authentication, authorization privileges, credentials used for authentication, etc. In one embodiment, verification messages (signals <b>716</b> and <b>718</b>) may include verified, certified, and/or encrypted information. Application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may thus verify that browser <b>264</b> that sent resource request signal <b>704</b> indeed has established a session with policy server <b>106</b> and can be trusted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The requested resources may be delivered (block <b>616</b>). Having been satisfied of the authenticity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may provide the resources requested in signal <b>704</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the verification message (signal <b>718</b>) forwarded to application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may include information regarding the requested resources of the original request (e.g., signal <b>704</b>). Application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may redirect browser <b>264</b> (using signal <b>720</b>) to the originally requested resources. Through this redirection, browser <b>264</b> may re-request the resources of signal <b>704</b> in signal <b>722</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the originally requested resources may be delivered in signal <b>724</b>. Further, application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may send a cookie to browser <b>264</b> so that application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> may verify the authenticity of user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> in the future without the intervention of policy server <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of an exemplary process <b>800</b> for verifying the authenticity of a user device, such as user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. Process <b>800</b> is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a signal diagram of exemplary signals that may be sent between application server <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>, user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> (including network browser <b>264</b> and agent <b>262</b>), and policy server <b>106</b>. Signals <b>702</b> through <b>710</b> and signals <b>716</b> through <b>724</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, may be the same or similar to those signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and described above. In one embodiment, signals <b>712</b> and <b>714</b>, described above, may be supplemented or replaced by signals <b>902</b> through <b>910</b> described below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As discussed above with respect to block <b>608</b>, policy server <b>106</b> may send a plug-in to browser <b>264</b> using signal <b>710</b>. In one embodiment, the plug-in may include a token. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B, and <b>5</b>C, the token may uniquely identify an authentication verification request, such as the verification request in signal <b>708</b>. In this example, policy server <b>106</b> may create record <b>520</b> in token table <b>500</b> that includes information regarding the token (e.g., token T<b>1</b>) sent with the plug-in to browser <b>264</b>. Policy server <b>106</b> may leave session ID field <b>504</b> and user name field <b>506</b> blank because policy server <b>106</b> may not know, during the creation of record <b>520</b>, the session ID or the user name to associated with the corresponding token, e.g., token T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A token may be sent to the agent (block <b>902</b>). Browser <b>264</b>, having just received a plug-in for communicating with agent <b>262</b>, may send the token (e.g., token T<b>1</b>) to agent <b>262</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, browser <b>264</b> may send token T<b>1</b> to agent <b>262</b> using signal <b>902</b>. The token may be received by the policy server from the agent (block <b>804</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, agent <b>262</b> may send token T<b>1</b> to policy server <b>106</b> using signal <b>904</b> over channel Y&#x2014;the channel previously established between user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> and policy server <b>106</b> during the authentication (block <b>602</b>) that took place using signals <b>702</b>. Because the token may be sent over channel Y, the token is part of a verifiable message from agent <b>262</b> to policy server <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The token may be associated with a session (block <b>806</b>). For example, having received token T<b>1</b> from agent <b>262</b> over channel Y, policy server <b>106</b> may reference session table <b>400</b>, which associates channel Y with session AC, user name JANE, and user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, policy server <b>106</b> may enter session ID of AC in session ID field <b>504</b>, user name JANE in user name field <b>506</b>, and user device <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> in user device field <b>508</b> of record <b>520</b> in token table <b>500</b>&#x2032;. Associating a token with a session may allow policy server <b>106</b> to receive many verification requests from application servers <b>108</b>, where each request may receive its own token. Each token, e.g., each request, may then be associated with a session in session table <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Confirmation of receipt of the token in the policy server may be sent (block <b>808</b>). Policy server <b>106</b> may send a confirmation to agent <b>262</b> that the token T<b>1</b> was successfully received in policy server <b>106</b>. Agent <b>262</b> may instruct the plug-in running in browser <b>264</b> to send the token T<b>1</b> to policy server <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The token may be received by the policy server (block <b>810</b>) from the browser. Policy server <b>106</b> may receive token T<b>1</b>. Policy server <b>106</b> may reference token table <b>500</b> to determine if there are any matching tokens. In this example, there is a matching token in record <b>520</b>. Policy server <b>106</b> may indicate in field <b>512</b>, shown in token table <b>500</b>&#x2033;, that a matching token was received.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the token received in policy server <b>106</b> from browser <b>264</b> matches the token received from agent <b>262</b> (block <b>812</b>: YES), then a verification message (signal <b>716</b>) may be sent (block <b>816</b>) by policy server <b>106</b>. If the token received in policy server <b>106</b> from browser is not the same as the token received from agent <b>262</b> (block <b>812</b>: NO), then the token may be ignored (block <b>814</b>) and a verification message (signal <b>716</b>) may not be sent. The comparison that takes place in block <b>812</b> may help prevent denial of service (DOS) attacks by malicious browser plug-ins that send tokens to policy server <b>106</b>, which may then issue a flood of bogus verification messages to application servers <b>108</b>. At block <b>816</b>, process <b>800</b> may proceed to block <b>614</b> of process <b>600</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Embodiments disclosed herein may allow for a user to authenticate with a policy server. When the user requests resources from an application server, the application server may request that the policy server verify the authenticity of the user. The policy server may validate the authenticity of the user and, as a result, the application server may deliver the resources requested by the user. Thus, in one embodiment, a single sign-on may be used for authentication of a user with multiple application servers.</p>
