<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A sealing unit longitudinally comprises first and second sealing sub-units disposed around first and second portions of a driveshaft of a marine propulsion system of a watercraft. The first sealing sub-unit is sealingly connected to a front wall of the hull and the engine casing. The second sealing sub-unit is sealingly connected to the driveshaft and a crankshaft. The second sealing sub-unit is disposed at least partially inside the first sealing sub-unit. An inside of the first sealing sub-unit is in fluid communication with a water intake ramp. An inside of the second sealing sub-unit is in fluid communication with an interior of an engine. The first sealing sub-unit prevents fluid communication between the water intake ramp and a portion of an inside of the hull. The second sealing sub-unit prevents fluid communication between the engine, the inside of the hull, and the water intake ramp.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to driveshaft sealing for marine propulsion systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some watercraft are powered by one or more water jet propulsion systems. The water jet propulsion system typically consists of a water jet pump which pressurizes water to create thrust. The water is first scooped from under the hull and flows in a water intake ramp to the water jet propulsion system, which expels it through a venturi as a water jet rearwardly of the watercraft. The water jet propulsion system is driven by an engine disposed inside the watercraft.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The water jet pump includes an impeller connected to a driveshaft. The driveshaft, which is operated by the engine, forces the impeller to rotate at high speeds when the watercraft is in operation. The impeller and a portion of the driveshaft are disposed in the water intake ramp surrounded by water, while a remainder of the driveshaft is disposed inside the hull, and connects to the engine. In those watercraft where the driveshaft is connected to the crankshaft by bulky couplings, the driveshaft is typically supported by one or more bearings in the vicinity of a front wall of the water intake ramp formed within the hull. A portion of the hull within the water intake ramp has an aperture equipped with a through-hull fitting through which the driveshaft extends. Typically, the aperture is of larger diameter than the driveshaft, and pressurized water from the intake ramp may flow through the aperture. Also, engine oil within the engine housing and used for lubricating parts of the engine such as the crankshaft bearings alongside the crankshaft through the crankcase cover may, in some cases, leak outside the engine and enter the inside of the hull.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To prevent water and/or engine oil to enter the inside of the hull, the driveshaft may be equipped with one or more sealing units (also called stuffing boxes or stern tubes). The sealing units consist of, for example, one or more ring seals. When sealing units are used to prevent both engine oil and water from flowing, the sealing units are two units separate from each other. One sealing unit is disposed at a portion of the driveshaft by the aperture of the hull receiving the driveshaft for preventing water to flow inside the hull, and another sealing unit is disposed at another portion of the engine housing or crankcase cover to prevent engine oil to flow inside the hull. A remainder of the driveshaft is deprived of sealing units, as it is sometimes equipped with two half jaw type couplings with an elastomeric element in between, which may be too bulky to be incorporated into any of the sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Having two separate sealing units may become bulky, expensive and require space that creates weight distribution challenges within a crowded hull volume. Some sealing units are particularly complex in design and can become difficult to assemble.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for a watercraft and a propulsion system for a watercraft with a sealing unit that would be simple, inexpensive, compact, and that would provide a more reliable sealing as currently available.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate at least some of the inconveniences present in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of the present invention is to provide a jet propulsion system for a watercraft which has a sealing unit for preventing water to enter the inside of the hull and for further preventing fluid communication between the water intake ramp and the interior of the engine. As an alternative to the bulky couplings, a slender crankshaft adapter can be provided at the connection between the driveshaft and the crankshaft. Because the crankshaft adapter can be smaller and lighter than the bulky couplings, the crankshaft adapter can be inserted at least partially in the crankshaft cover (or the engine casing), and the ball bearings can be removed from the driveshaft. Owing in part to this configuration, the inventors have elaborated a compact sealing unit that surrounds a portion of the driveshaft extending between the through-hull fitting and the engine casing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, as broadly embodied, the present invention provides a watercraft comprising a hull, and an engine disposed inside the hull. The engine has an engine casing. A crankshaft is disposed at least in part in the engine casing. A marine propulsion unit is operatively connected to the engine for propelling the watercraft. The marine propulsion unit includes a water intake ramp, a driveshaft connected to the crankshaft, and one of an impeller and a propeller operatively connected to the driveshaft. The one of the propeller and the impeller and a portion of the driveshaft are disposed in the water intake ramp. A remainder of the driveshaft is disposed at least partially inside the hull. A front wall is formed at least in part by the water intake ramp. The driveshaft extends through the front wall. A sealing unit is longitudinally disposed between the front wall and the engine. The sealing unit comprises a first sealing sub-unit disposed around a first portion of the remainder of the driveshaft. The first sealing sub-unit has a first end and a second end. The first end is sealingly connected to the front wall. The second end is sealingly connected to the engine casing. An inside of the first sealing sub-unit is in fluid communication with the water intake ramp. The first sealing sub-unit prevents fluid communication between the water intake ramp and a portion of an inside of the hull. A second sealing sub-unit is disposed around a second portion of the remainder of the driveshaft. The second sealing sub-unit has a first end and a second end. The first end is sealingly connected to the driveshaft. The second end is sealingly connected to at least one of the crankshaft and the engine casing. At least the first end of the second sealing sub-unit is disposed longitudinally between the first and second ends of the first sealing sub-unit. At least the first end of the second sealing sub-unit is disposed radially between the driveshaft and at least a portion of the first sealing sub-unit.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention will be described with respect to a personal watercraft and a boat propelled by a jet propulsion unit. However, it is contemplated that other types of marine propulsion units could be provided, such as, stern drives.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the general construction of a personal watercraft <b>10</b> will be described. It should be understood that the personal watercraft <b>10</b> could be another type of watercraft, and could have a construction other than the one described.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The watercraft <b>10</b> is made of two main parts, including a hull <b>12</b> and a deck <b>14</b>. The hull <b>12</b> buoyantly supports the watercraft <b>10</b> in the water. The deck <b>14</b> is designed to accommodate a rider and, in some watercraft, one or more passengers. The hull <b>12</b> and deck <b>14</b> are joined together at a seam <b>16</b> that joins the parts in a sealing relationship. Preferably, the seam <b>16</b> comprises a bond line formed by an adhesive. Other known joining methods could be used to sealingly engage the parts together, including but not limited to thermal fusion, molding or fasteners such as rivets or screws. A bumper <b>18</b> generally covers the seam <b>16</b>, which helps to prevent damage to the outer surface of the watercraft <b>10</b> when the watercraft <b>10</b> is docked, for example. The bumper <b>18</b> can extend around the bow <b>56</b>, as shown, or around any portion or all of the seam <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The space between the hull <b>12</b> and the deck <b>14</b> forms a volume, referred here as the inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b>. The inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b> accommodates an engine <b>200</b> disposed inside an engine casing <b>203</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), as well as a muffler, tuning pipe, gas tank, electrical system (battery, electronic control unit, etc.), air box, storage bins <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and other elements required or desirable in the watercraft <b>10</b>. The engine <b>200</b> will be described in greater details below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The deck <b>14</b> has a centrally positioned straddle-type seat <b>28</b> positioned on top of a pedestal <b>22</b> to accommodate a rider in a straddling position. The seat <b>28</b> is sized to accommodate one or more riders. The seat <b>28</b> includes a first, front seat portion <b>32</b> and a rear, raised seat portion <b>34</b> that accommodates a passenger. The seat <b>28</b> is preferably made as a cushioned or padded unit or interfitting units. The first and second seat portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are removably attached to the pedestal <b>22</b> by a hook and tongue assembly (not shown) at the front of each seat and by a latch assembly (not shown) at the rear of each seat, or by any other known attachment mechanism. The seat portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> can be individually tilted or removed completely. One of the seat portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> covers an engine access opening defined by a top portion of the pedestal <b>22</b> to provide access to the engine <b>200</b>. The other seat portion (in this case portion <b>34</b>) covers a removable storage box <b>26</b>. A &#x201c;glove compartment&#x201d; or small storage box <b>36</b> is provided in front of the seat <b>28</b>. A grab handle <b>38</b> is provided between the pedestal <b>22</b> and the rear of the seat <b>28</b> to provide a handle onto which a passenger may hold.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The watercraft <b>10</b> has a pair of generally upwardly extending walls located on either side of the watercraft <b>10</b> known as gunwales or gunnels <b>42</b>. The gunnels <b>42</b> help to prevent the entry of water in the footrests (not shown) of the watercraft <b>10</b>, provide lateral support for the rider's feet, and also provide buoyancy when turning the watercraft <b>10</b>, since personal watercraft roll slightly when turning.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A reboarding platform <b>52</b> is provided at the rear of the watercraft <b>10</b> on the deck <b>14</b> to allow the rider or a passenger to easily reboard the watercraft <b>10</b> from the water. Carpeting or some other suitable covering covers the reboarding platform <b>52</b>. A retractable ladder (not shown) may be affixed to the transom <b>54</b> to facilitate boarding the watercraft <b>10</b> from the water onto the reboarding platform <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The watercraft <b>10</b> is provided with a hood <b>58</b> located forwardly of the seat <b>28</b> and a steering assembly including a helm assembly <b>60</b>. A hinge (not shown) is attached between a forward portion of the hood <b>58</b> and the deck <b>14</b> to allow the hood <b>58</b> to move to an open position to provide access to the front storage bin <b>24</b> (shown schematically). A latch (not shown) located at a rearward portion of the hood <b>58</b> locks the hood <b>58</b> into a closed position. When in the closed position, the hood <b>58</b> prevents water from entering front storage bin <b>24</b>. Rearview mirrors <b>62</b> are positioned on either side of the hood <b>58</b> to allow the rider to see behind the watercraft <b>10</b>. A hook (not shown) is located at the bow <b>56</b> of the watercraft <b>10</b>. The hook is used to attach the watercraft <b>10</b> to a dock when the watercraft is not in use or to attach to a winch when loading the watercraft <b>10</b> on a trailer, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An exterior surface of the hull <b>12</b> is provided with a combination of strakes <b>66</b> and chines <b>68</b>. A strake <b>66</b> is a protruding portion of the hull <b>12</b>. A chine <b>68</b> is the vertex formed where two surfaces of the hull <b>12</b> meet. The combination of strakes <b>66</b> and chines <b>68</b> provide the watercraft <b>10</b> with its riding and handling characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Sponsons <b>70</b> are located on both sides of the hull <b>12</b> near the transom <b>54</b>. The sponsons <b>70</b> preferably have an arcuate undersurface that gives the watercraft <b>10</b> both lift while in motion and improved turning characteristics. The sponsons <b>70</b> are preferably fixed to the exterior surface of the hull <b>12</b> and can be attached to the hull by fasteners or molded therewith. Sometimes it may be desirable to adjust the position of the sponson <b>70</b> with respect to the hull <b>12</b> to change the handling characteristics of the watercraft <b>10</b> and accommodate different riding conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The helm assembly <b>60</b> is positioned forwardly of the seat <b>28</b>. The helm assembly <b>60</b> has a central helm portion <b>72</b>, which may be padded, and a pair of steering handles <b>74</b>, also referred to as a handlebar. One of the steering handles <b>74</b> is preferably provided with a throttle operator (not shown), which allows the rider to control the engine <b>200</b>, and therefore the speed of the watercraft <b>10</b>. The throttle operator can be in the form of a thumb-actuated throttle lever (as shown), a finger-actuated throttle lever, or a twist grip. The throttle operator is movable between an idle position and multiple actuated positions. The throttle operator is preferably biased towards the idle position, such that when the driver of the watercraft lets go of the throttle operator, it will move to the idle position. The other of the steering handles <b>74</b> may be provided with a lever <b>77</b> used by the driver to control a jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As known, the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> pressurizes water to create thrust. The water is first scooped from under the hull <b>12</b> through an inlet <b>86</b>, which has an inlet grate. The inlet grate prevents large rocks, weeds, and other debris from entering the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b>, which may damage the system or negatively affect performance. The inlet grate could be omitted. Water flows from the inlet <b>86</b> through a water intake ramp <b>88</b>. The top portion <b>90</b> of the water intake ramp <b>88</b> is formed by the hull <b>12</b>, and a ride shoe (not shown) forms its bottom portion <b>92</b>. Alternatively, the intake ramp <b>88</b> may be a single piece or an insert to which the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> attaches. In such cases, the intake ramp <b>88</b> and the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> are attached as a unit in a recess in the bottom of hull <b>12</b>. The jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> will be described in greater details below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> may be provided with a reverse gate which is movable between a stowed position where it does not interfere with a jet of water being expelled by the steering nozzle <b>37</b> and one or more positions where it redirects the jet of water being expelled by the steering nozzle <b>37</b> (described in greater detail below).</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The general construction of a sport boat <b>100</b> in accordance with this invention will now be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It should be understood that the sport boat <b>100</b> could be another type of boat, and could have a construction other than the one described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sport boat <b>100</b> has a hull <b>112</b> and a deck <b>114</b> supported by the hull <b>112</b>. The deck <b>114</b> has a forward passenger area <b>122</b> and a rearward passenger area <b>124</b>. A right console <b>126</b> and a left console <b>128</b> are disposed on either side of the deck <b>114</b> between the two passenger areas <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. A passageway <b>130</b> disposed between the two consoles <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> allows for communication between the two passenger areas <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. A door <b>131</b> is used to selectively open and close the passageway <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Two engines (not shown) are located between the hull <b>112</b> and the deck <b>114</b> at the back of the boat <b>100</b>. The two engines power two jet propulsion units <b>300</b><i>a </i>and <b>300</b><i>b</i>. The engines and water jet propulsion units <b>300</b><i>a </i>and <b>300</b><i>b </i>are of similar construction as the engine <b>200</b> and the water jet propulsion unit <b>300</b>, respectively, of the personal watercraft <b>10</b> described above, and will be described in greater details below with respect to the engine <b>200</b> and the water jet propulsion unit <b>300</b>, respectively. It is contemplated that, the boat <b>100</b> could have only one engine powering only one jet propulsion system.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Two reverse gates <b>110</b> (only one being shown) are operatively mounted to the hull <b>112</b>. The reverse gates <b>110</b> are well known in the art, and will therefore not be described herein. The engines are accessible through a lid <b>132</b> located behind the rearward passenger area <b>124</b>. The lid <b>132</b> can also be used as a sundeck for a passenger of the boat <b>100</b> to sunbathe on while the boat <b>100</b> is not in operation. A reboarding platform <b>152</b> is located at the back of the deck <b>114</b> for passengers to easily reboard the boat <b>100</b> from the water.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The sports boat <b>100</b> includes other features, well known in the art that will not be described herein again.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the engine <b>200</b> will be described in greater detail. The engine of the sport boat <b>100</b> has a construction similar to that of the engine <b>200</b>, and will therefore not be described here. The engine <b>200</b> is only one possible engine that could be used. It is contemplated that other types of engines could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The engine <b>200</b> has three cylinders <b>220</b> disposed in a straight line next to each other. It is contemplated that a greater or fewer numbers of cylinders <b>220</b> could be used. All of the cylinders <b>220</b> are formed in a cylinder block <b>222</b>, which sits atop a crankcase <b>224</b>. A cylinder head assembly <b>226</b> sits atop the cylinder block <b>222</b>. A spark plug <b>228</b> is provided in the cylinder head assembly <b>226</b> for each cylinder <b>220</b>. A magneto cover <b>230</b> is bolted to the crankcase <b>224</b> on the first end of the engine <b>200</b> to cover a magneto <b>233</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and other components of the engine <b>200</b>. An oil filter housing <b>234</b> is also provided at the first end of the engine <b>200</b> on the same side as exhaust components <b>214</b> to house an oil filter (not shown). The oil filter housing <b>234</b> has a removable cap <b>238</b> provided at the top thereof to allow for easy access to the oil filter, thereby facilitating maintenance of the engine <b>200</b>. A starter motor <b>240</b> is also provided at the first end of the engine <b>200</b> alongside the cylinder block <b>222</b> on the same side as the intake components <b>212</b>. The starter motor <b>240</b> is an electrical motor which, as is known by those skilled in the art, is operatively connected to a crankshaft <b>250</b>. The starter motor <b>240</b> initiates the rotation of the crankshaft <b>250</b> to allow for the initial ignition(s) to occur, which then allows the engine <b>200</b> to run. A fuel rail <b>242</b> disposed on the air intake components <b>212</b> receives fuel from a fuel tank (not shown) and delivers it to three fuel injectors (not shown). Each fuel injector is in fluid communication with the intake passages (not shown) of each cylinder <b>220</b>. The engine <b>200</b> also includes a coolant intake pipe, a coolant exhaust pipe, and a thermostat, well known in the art and not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An oil tank <b>260</b> is connected to the engine <b>200</b> on an intake side of the engine <b>200</b> below the air intake components <b>212</b>. The oil tank <b>260</b> is shaped such that it follows the contour of the cylinder block <b>222</b> and the crankcase <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a piston <b>298</b> is housed inside each cylinder <b>220</b> and reciprocates therein. For each cylinder <b>220</b>, the walls of the cylinder <b>220</b>, the cylinder head assembly <b>226</b> and the top of the piston <b>298</b> form a combustion chamber. The pistons <b>298</b> are linked to the crankshaft <b>250</b>, which is housed in the crankcase <b>224</b>, by connecting rods <b>210</b>. Explosions caused by the combustion of an air/fuel mixture inside the combustion chambers make the pistons <b>298</b> reciprocate inside the cylinders <b>220</b> which causes a crankshaft <b>250</b> to rotate inside the crankcase <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The crankshaft <b>250</b> is supported for rotation in the crankcase <b>224</b> by five plain bearings (not shown). The crankshaft <b>250</b> has three crankpins <b>221</b> (only one being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) onto which the connecting rods <b>210</b> are connected. Each crankpin <b>221</b> has a pair of corresponding counterbalance weights <b>223</b> (only two being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) opposite thereto to counteract the forces generated by the reciprocating pistons <b>298</b>. The space between the counterbalance weights <b>223</b> is selected such that the connecting rod <b>210</b> which is connected to the corresponding crankpin <b>221</b> can pass therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A sprocket <b>229</b> is disposed on the crankshaft <b>250</b>. The sprocket <b>229</b> engages a timing chain <b>231</b>, so as to drive a first camshaft <b>232</b>. The timing chain <b>231</b> is disposed at least in part inside a timing chain case <b>274</b> located at the end of the engine <b>200</b> opposite to the end where the magneto cover <b>230</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The cylinder head assembly <b>226</b> has two camshafts (only a first camshaft <b>232</b> being shown). The first camshaft <b>232</b> and second camshaft are generally horizontal and parallel to the crankshaft <b>250</b>. Sprockets (not shown) disposed at one end of the two camshafts engage the timing chain <b>231</b> such that the first camshaft <b>232</b> and the second camshaft are driven by the sprocket <b>229</b> of the crankshaft <b>250</b>. As they rotate, the camshafts cause intake and exhaust valves of the engine <b>200</b> to open and close.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The engine <b>200</b> includes other features well known in the art and not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the water jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> will now be described in greater detail. The water jet propulsion units <b>300</b><i>a</i>, <b>300</b><i>b </i>of the sports boat <b>100</b> have a similar construction.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As mentioned above, the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> pressurizes water to create thrust. The jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> is partially located in a formation in the hull <b>12</b>, referred to as the tunnel <b>94</b>. The tunnel <b>94</b> is defined at the front, sides, and top by walls formed by the hull <b>12</b> and is open at the transom <b>54</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The bottom of the tunnel <b>94</b> is closed by a ride plate <b>96</b>. The ride plate <b>96</b> creates a surface on which the watercraft <b>10</b> rides or planes at high speeds. This configuration reduces the projection of the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> from the back of the watercraft <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The jet propulsion unit <b>300</b> includes a jet pump <b>330</b>. The forward end of the jet pump <b>330</b> is connected to a front wall <b>95</b> of the tunnel <b>94</b>. The jet pump includes an impeller <b>371</b> and a stator <b>373</b>. The impeller includes blades <b>372</b> that extend from a center portion <b>375</b>. The impeller <b>371</b> is coupled to the engine <b>200</b> by a driveshaft <b>368</b>. An end <b>368</b><i>b </i>of the driveshaft <b>368</b> is operatively connected to the engine <b>200</b> via the crankshaft <b>250</b>, as will be described below. The engine <b>200</b> powers the impeller <b>371</b>, which pressurizes the water. The water then moves over the stator <b>373</b> that is made of a plurality of fixed stator blades <b>376</b>. The role of the stator blades <b>376</b> is to decrease the rotational motion of the water so that almost all the energy given to the water is used for thrust, as opposed to swirling the water. Once the water leaves the jet pump <b>330</b>, it goes through a venturi <b>389</b> that is connected to the rearward end of the jet pump <b>330</b>. Since the venturi's <b>389</b> exit diameter is smaller than its entrance diameter, the water is accelerated further, thereby providing more thrust.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The steering nozzle <b>37</b> is rotationally mounted relative to the venturi <b>389</b>, so as to pivot about a steering axis <b>93</b>. The steering nozzle <b>37</b> is operatively connected to the helm assembly <b>60</b> preferably via a push-pull cable (not shown) such that when the helm assembly <b>60</b> is turned, the steering nozzle <b>37</b> pivots about the steering axis <b>93</b>. This movement redirects the pressurized water coming from the venturi <b>389</b>, so as to redirect the thrust and steer the watercraft <b>10</b> in the desired direction. It is contemplated that the steering nozzle <b>37</b> could be omitted, in which case an alternative means may be provided for steering the watercraft <b>10</b>. For example, the watercraft <b>10</b> may alternatively be steered by one or more rudders, or by having two laterally spaced jet pumps that are selectively powered to steer the watercraft <b>100</b> in the desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As mentioned above, the driveshaft <b>368</b> is connected to the crankshaft <b>250</b> for transmitting the power generated by the engine <b>200</b> to the jet propulsion unit <b>300</b>. The driveshaft <b>368</b> extends through the top portion <b>90</b> of the water intake ramp <b>88</b> into the inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b>. To that effect, the top portion <b>90</b> includes a front wall <b>91</b> which has an aperture <b>83</b>, through which the driveshaft <b>368</b> extends. A through-hull fitting <b>350</b> extends in an inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b> from the front wall <b>91</b> and surrounds the aperture <b>83</b>. The wall <b>91</b> has a connecting part <b>85</b> around the aperture <b>83</b> to connect to the through-hull fitting <b>350</b>. The through-hull fitting <b>350</b> is a tube disposed around a portion of the driveshaft <b>368</b>. It is contemplated that the through-hull fitting <b>350</b> could include more than one tube, as well as other components. It is also contemplated that the connecting part <b>85</b> could be omitted. It is contemplated that the through-hull fitting <b>350</b> could be omitted, or could be integrally formed with the connecting part <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a first embodiment of a connection between the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft <b>250</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the driveshaft <b>368</b> is coupled to the crankshaft <b>250</b> via a crankshaft adapter <b>360</b>. It is contemplated that the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> could be omitted. For example, the driveshaft <b>368</b> could be coupled to the crankshaft <b>250</b> via complimentary threaded surfaces. It is also contemplated that the driveshaft <b>368</b> could be coupled to the crankshaft <b>250</b> via complimentary threaded surfaces in addition to the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> is generally cylindrical. The crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> is located partially inside the engine casing <b>203</b>, and more precisely, partially inside a crankcase cover <b>366</b>, also referred to as a PTO (Power Take-Off) cover. The crankcase cover <b>366</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> has a first end <b>360</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>360</b><i>b</i>. The first end <b>360</b><i>a </i>extends beyond the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. It is contemplated that the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> could be completely located inside the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. The second end <b>360</b><i>b </i>of the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> extends partially inside the engine casing <b>203</b>. It is contemplated that the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> could not extend inside the engine casing <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The first end <b>360</b><i>a </i>of the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> has female splines <b>361</b><i>a </i>engaged with male splines <b>367</b> of the end <b>368</b><i>b </i>of the driveshaft <b>368</b>. The splines <b>367</b> of the end <b>368</b><i>b </i>of the driveshaft <b>368</b> are cambered so as to accommodate a degree of relative movement between the crankshaft <b>250</b> and the jet pump <b>330</b>. It is contemplated that the splines <b>367</b> of the end <b>368</b><i>b </i>of the driveshaft <b>368</b> could be cambered. It is also contemplated that the end <b>368</b><i>b </i>of the driveshaft <b>368</b> could be connected to the first end <b>360</b><i>a </i>of the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> in a different manner. The second end <b>360</b><i>b </i>of the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> has female splines <b>361</b><i>b </i>engaged with male splines <b>251</b> of the crankshaft <b>250</b>. It is contemplated that the second end <b>360</b><i>b </i>of the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> could be connected to the crankshaft <b>250</b> in a different manner. For example, the second end <b>360</b><i>b </i>of the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> could be press-fit to the crankshaft <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A rubber piece <b>253</b> is located inside the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> between the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft <b>250</b>. The rubber piece <b>253</b> prevents impacts between ends of the driveshaft <b>368</b> and crankshaft <b>250</b>, which are facing each other.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The sealing unit <b>500</b> comprises a first sealing sub-unit and second sealing sub-unit. The first sealing sub-unit includes a first boot <b>510</b> and the first sealing sub-unit includes a second boot <b>512</b>. The first boot <b>510</b> and the second boot <b>512</b> are disposed around a portion of the driveshaft <b>368</b> located in the inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The first boot <b>510</b> and the second boot <b>512</b> are made of rubber. It is contemplated that the boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> could be made of a different material. For example, the boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> could be made of another type of elastic polymer. The rubber being a flexible material, it allows the boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> to expand depending on the amount of fluid present inside or outside the boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, which is exerting pressure on the boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>. The boot <b>510</b> is designed to sustain the particular conditions of water flow in the water intake ramp <b>88</b>. The pressure of the water exerted on the boot <b>510</b> varies with the driving conditions of the watercraft <b>10</b>. The boot <b>510</b> allows for these variable conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> have a generally annular cross-section.

It is contemplated that the boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> could have no circumferential ripples. It is also contemplated that the flexible boots <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> could not be boots. For example, as shown in phantom lines, the flexible boot <b>512</b> could be replaced by a tubular seal <b>513</b>. The tubular seal <b>513</b> could be connected to the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> by friction fit.

It is contemplated that the tubular seal <b>513</b> could be made of a same rubber as the second flexible boot <b>512</b> or could be made of a rubber more flexible than the second flexible boot <b>512</b>. It is contemplated that the tubular seal <b>513</b> could be connected to the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> by other means. For example, the tubular seal <b>513</b> could be connected to the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> by a boot clamp or a spring loaded ring. It is contemplated that the tubular seal <b>513</b> could be sufficiently stiff so as to keep the driveshaft <b>368</b> from contacting the crankshaft <b>250</b>, such that the rubber piece <b>253</b> could be omitted. The second flexible boot <b>512</b> is smaller (in length and diameter) than the first flexible boot <b>510</b> and is disposed inside the first flexible boot <b>510</b>.

The second end <b>512</b><i>b </i>is connected to the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> by a spring loaded ring <b>529</b><i>b</i>. The spring loaded rings <b>529</b><i>a</i>, <b>529</b><i>b </i>are equilibrated in order to not unbalance the driveshaft <b>368</b> during its rotation. It is contemplated that the ends <b>512</b><i>a</i>, <b>512</b><i>b </i>could be connected to the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> by other means (e.g. split ring shaft clamp). It is also contemplated that the second end <b>512</b><i>b </i>could be connected to the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. In that case, the second end <b>512</b><i>b </i>would be connected to the crankcase cover <b>366</b> by a seal pack to allow the second flexible boot <b>512</b> to rotate with the driveshaft <b>368</b> and the crankshaft <b>250</b>. A seal pack is an assembly of a plurality of seals that allow relative rotation of their inner and outer races.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The second flexible boot <b>512</b> has a lip <b>515</b> extending outwardly from the second end <b>512</b><i>b</i>. The lip <b>515</b> abuts to the engine casing <b>203</b> and provides a seal for the water coming in an inside <b>530</b> of the first flexible boot <b>510</b> toward the engine <b>200</b>. The inside <b>530</b> of the first boot <b>510</b> is axially delimited by the first boot <b>510</b>, the driveshaft <b>368</b>, and the second flexible boot <b>512</b>. It is contemplated that, the outward extending lip <b>515</b> could also provide a seal for the engine oil coming from an inside of the engine <b>200</b>. It is contemplated that the lip <b>515</b> could be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Three seals <b>580</b> are disposed inside the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. The seals <b>580</b> surround the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> and extend outwardly to connect with the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. The seals <b>580</b> prevent engine oil from flowing from the engine <b>200</b> to the inside <b>13</b> of hull <b>12</b> (or more precisely to the inside <b>530</b> of the first flexible boot <b>510</b>). It is contemplated that more or less than three seals <b>580</b> could be used. It is also contemplated that the seals <b>580</b> could be omitted or be replaced by other types of seals. The seals <b>580</b> are U-cup seals and are biased toward the crankshaft adapter <b>360</b> by circumferential springs (not shown). Two of the seals <b>580</b> form a recess <b>581</b> therebetween. The recess <b>581</b> is a channel which collects small amounts of liquid which has leaked through the two seals <b>580</b> disposed on the left of the recess <b>581</b> (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), or engine oil which has leaked through the seal <b>580</b> disposed on the right of the recess <b>581</b> (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), can collect. Water or oil which accumulates in the recess <b>581</b> is drained into a space within the hull <b>12</b> via a hole (not shown) extending downward from the recess <b>581</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a second embodiment of a sealing unit <b>500</b>&#x2032; for the driveshaft <b>368</b>&#x2032; will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The sealing unit <b>500</b>&#x2032; is disposed around the driveshaft <b>368</b>&#x2032; and extends between the through-hull fitting <b>350</b> and the engine casing <b>203</b>. The sealing unit <b>500</b>&#x2032; comprises a boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and a seal <b>512</b>&#x2032;. The boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; are integrally formed with each other. It is contemplated that the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; could be two separate sealing sub-units.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; is similar to the flexible boot <b>510</b>. The boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; fluidly isolates the inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b> from water coming from the water intake ramp <b>88</b> via the aperture <b>83</b> in the wall <b>91</b>. The seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; has a function similar to that of the second boot <b>512</b>. Seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; fluidly isolates the inside <b>13</b> of the hull <b>12</b> from engine oil coming from different lubricated parts of the crankshaft <b>250</b> and other parts of the engine <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and the seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; are made of rubber. It is contemplated that the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and the seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; could be made of a different material. For example, the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and the seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; could be made of another type of elastic polymer. The flexible material allows the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; (to a lesser extent) to expand depending on the amount of liquids present inside the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; which are exerting pressure on the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and seal <b>512</b>&#x2032;. The boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; has a plurality of circumferential ripples (not shown) along its length. It is contemplated that the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; could have no circumferential ripples.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; has a first end <b>510</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; connected to the through-hull fitting <b>350</b> by a boot clamp <b>528</b>&#x2032;, and a second end <b>510</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; connected to the driveshaft <b>368</b> via a seal pack <b>525</b>&#x2032;. The seal pack <b>525</b>&#x2032; connects to the driveshaft <b>368</b>&#x2032; by friction fit, and allows the driveshaft <b>368</b>&#x2032; to rotate, without inducing rotation of the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032; and the seal <b>512</b>&#x2032;. It is contemplated that the first end <b>510</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; could be connected to the through-hull fitting <b>350</b> by a worm gear clamp or wire clamp. The second end <b>510</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; is connected to the seal pack <b>525</b>&#x2032; by a boot clamp <b>529</b>&#x2032;. It is contemplated that the second end <b>510</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; could be connected to the seal pack <b>525</b>&#x2032; by a worm gear clamp or wire clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The seal <b>512</b>&#x2032; has a first end <b>512</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and a second end <b>512</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. The second end <b>512</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; is connected to the crankcase cover <b>366</b> by a boot clamp <b>527</b>&#x2032;. The first end <b>512</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; is adjacent to the second end <b>510</b><i>b</i>&#x2032;. It is contemplated that the second end <b>512</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; could be connected to engine casing <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A seal <b>580</b>&#x2032; is disposed inside the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. The seal <b>580</b>&#x2032; surrounds the crankshaft <b>250</b>&#x2032; and extends outwardly from the crankshaft <b>250</b>&#x2032; to connect with the crankcase cover <b>366</b>. The seal <b>580</b>&#x2032; additionally prevents engine oil to enter an inside <b>530</b> of the boot <b>510</b>&#x2032;. It is contemplated that more than one seal <b>580</b>&#x2032; could be used. It is also contemplated that the seal <b>580</b>&#x2032; could be omitted or be replaced by other types of seals.</p>
