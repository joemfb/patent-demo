<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an easy-open and reclosable package with a discrete laminate having a panel section with an easy-open sealant, and to methods of making the package.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Food and non-food products, including produce, snack foods, cheese and the like have long been packaged in containers such as pouches, bags, or lidded trays or formed webs made from various thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyester (PET). These containers can be formed from a web or webs of thermoplastic material on packaging equipment, using various packaging processes, at a processing/packaging facility. Such equipment and processes includes horizontal form/fill/seal (HFFS), vertical form/fill/seal (VFFS), thermoforming/lidstock, and continuous horizontal packaging (sometimes referred to as Flow-wrap). In each case, the product is manually or automatically placed in a pouch, bag, formed web, tray, etc., the filled container is optionally vacuumized or gas flushed, and the mouth of the container is hermetically or non-hermetically sealed to close and finish the package.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Opening of the finished package (i.e. opening with the use of tools such as scissors or knives) can provide access to the product by the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common in the industry is the use of plastic zipper closures; press-to-close or slide zippers; interlocking closures; reclosable fasteners with interlockable fastener elements; interlocking rib and groove elements having male and female profiles; interlocking alternating hook-shaped closure members, and the like. These terms appear in the patent literature, and to some extent may overlap in meaning. These features provide reclosability, and in some cases may provide an easy-open feature to the package. However, such features are not always easy to open or reclose.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also relatively common is the use of pressure sensitive adhesive to provide a reclosability feature to a package. However, based on the position of the adhesive relative to the package, the adhesive can sometimes be contaminated by the contained product before the package is opened, or once the package is opened, when product is removed from the package and comes in contact with the adhesive. This phenomenon can compromise the reclosability of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is need in the marketplace for a package, and methods of packaging that can be used in a manner that requires little or no modification to the packager's packaging equipment, while providing a manually (i.e. by hand, without the need for tools such as scissors or knives) openable and easy to reclose feature, optionally while maintaining hermeticity of the package when made, and without the use of a plastic zipper closure; press-to-close or slide zipper; interlocking closure; reclosable fastener with interlockable fastener elements; interlocking rib and groove elements having male and female profiles; interlocking alternating hook-shaped closure members, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some retail packages currently do not offer an easy-open and/or reclosable feature. Examples are some produce bags and snack food bags. In the produce market, there is a need for a cost-effective way to manually open, and repeatably reclose, retail produce bags, e.g. a package made in HFFS, VFFS, thermoforming/lidstock, or continuous horizontal packaging processes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to a package, and methods of making the package, which package is manually openable, and reclosable, i.e. can be opened and reclosed a number of times and adapted to package non-food products, as well as food products such as e.g. produce, snack foods, cheese, luncheon meat, sausage, culinary nuts, trail mix, etc. The package optionally maintains a hermetic seal until the package is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is also a need in the marketplace for a discrete laminate that can be anchored to a processor's packaging material of choice to provide easy-open and reclosable functionalities to a package made from that web/laminate combination, with only relatively minor modifications to the processor's packaging material, packaging process or equipment.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0531">&#x201c;Anchored&#x201d;, &#x201c;anchoring&#x201d; and the like herein refers to sealing or adhering two surfaces together, and refers to the resulting bond between surfaces. Sealing is done by means of a sealant. Adhering is done by means of PSA.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0532">In processes described herein where a discrete laminate is anchored to a web or side panel, either during the process wherein the web and discrete laminate are advanced, or when a discrete laminate has been pre-anchored to the web before the start of the process, anchoring can be done by use of any suitable continuous or discontinuous sealing or adhesive material and method. Such anchoring is done to hold the discrete laminate to the web or panel during the relevant packaging process.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0533">In some embodiments, wherein the anchor is already relatively strong or continuous, e.g. a heat seal that constitutes either a relatively strong heat seal, or an easy-open seal as defined herein, the anchor functions not only to hold the discrete laminate to the web or panel during the relevant packaging process, but also as a final seal of that surface of the discrete laminate to the web (lay-flat or folded) or panel made from the web.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0534">Any subsequent disclosed or recited step in the process of sealing one of the surfaces (i.e. the anchored surface) of the discrete laminate to a web or panel, is already completed by the anchoring step. In these embodiments, then, contact of a seal device, e.g. a seal bar in the region of the anchor, in a subsequent step, may add no further or separate seal to that surface of the discrete laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0535">Any subsequent step in the process of sealing the other surface of the discrete laminate to a web or panel, then, may in some embodiments add no further or separate seal to the anchored surface of the discrete laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0536">In some embodiments where the bond is a relatively weak or discontinuous one, e.g. a discontinuous seal, spots or narrow stripes of adhesive. etc., in a subsequent step of sealing one of the surfaces of the discrete laminate to the web or panel, a seal bar that seals one of the surfaces of the discrete laminate to the web or panel can contact the web or panel in the region where the anchor is already disposed. The seal in that region may be either enhanced, or initially created, by the subsequent sealing step.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0537">Sealing of a surface of the discrete laminate to a web or panel, as a process step disclosed or recited herein, should be understood in this light.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0538">&#x201c;Clear area&#x201d; herein refers to a selected portion or portions of a first surface of the base strip that has substantially no PSA thereon. The clear area(s) can be provided by 1) not applying PSA to the selected portion(s), or 2) applying the PSA over the entire first surface of the strip, followed by removing most or all of the PSA in the selected portion(s), e.g. by scraping the PSA off the strip by suitable means such as a shim or scraper; removal of most or all of the PSA in this manner will typically be done before the PSA has been cured; or 3) applying the PSA relatively uniformly over the entire first surface of the base strip, as is done in the manufacture of labels, followed by masking or deadening the PSA in the selected portion(s) by any suitable means. Masking or deadening agents that are used will substantially reduce or nullify the adhesive effect of the PSA in the selected portion(s), compared with the adhesive effect of the PSA in portions of the first surface adjacent to the selected portion(s). In general, deadening or masking of the PSA is done after the PSA has been cured; removal of most or all of the PSA is done before the PSA has been cured.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0539">&#x201c;Die cut&#x201d; herein refers to methods of cutting or scoring materials, including rotary die, steel rule die, platen die cutting, and laser cutting or scoring, and/or the resultant cut or score, other than a die cut used to create the perimeter of a lay-flat web, tape, base strip, or panel section of the invention, or to make a hole in the lay-flat web, tape, base strip, or panel section for a hang-tab, gusset or the like. A package of the invention in several embodiments is absent a die cut, absent a die cut in the panel section, and/or absent a die cut in the first side panel.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0540">&#x201c;Discrete&#x201d; with respect to the discrete laminate is used herein to mean independently made (the discrete laminate is not an integral part of the web when the web is made,) or constituting a separate entity from the web, and from a first or second side panel made from the web.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0541">&#x201c;Easy-open&#x201d; herein refers to a package that can be manually opened relatively easily. The physical mode of opening may include any one or more of a) actual peeling at the base strip/web interface (adhesive failure), or b) a sealant layer of the base strip breaking completely through, and peeling then occurring between the sealant layer and an adjacent layer within the strip (delamination failure), or c) breaking within a sealant layer by rupturing of the sealant material itself (cohesive failure), or d) simply peeling of a flap away from the PSA, the flap comprising the panel section. The peel force required to open the package can be measured by an evaluation of seal strength or peel strength in accordance with the test procedure set out in ASTM F88, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, using a crosshead speed of 8 to 12 inches/minute and an initial jaw gap of from 1.00 inch to 2.00 inch. Typical peel forces for opening the package of the invention can range from e.g. 25 grams/inch to 3 pounds/inch, e.g. from 100 grams/inch to 2 pounds/inch, such as from 200 grams/inch to 1.5 pounds/inch. In some cases, the sealant may actually peel away from the surface to which it is adhered (adhesive failure), or breakage of the sealant and delamination along an adjacent layer interface may occur (delamination failure) or a rupture of the sealant can occur (cohesive failure). Depending on the design and geometry of the seal, peel forces can in some embodiments be higher than 3 pounds/inch, e.g. 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5 pounds/inch, or values intermediate these values.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0542">&#x201c;Easy-open seal&#x201d; herein refers to a seal involving the base strip or web or panel section in which materials and sealing conditions are chosen for the base strip or web or panel section such that the package is easy-open with a physical mode of opening that includes any one or more of adhesive failure, delamination failure, or cohesive failure as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0543">&#x201c;Easy-open sealant&#x201d; herein refers to a material chosen for one or both surfaces of the base strip or web or panel section, such that when such surface is sealed, it provides a package that is easy-open with a physical mode of opening that includes any one or more of adhesive failure, delamination failure, or cohesive failure as described herein.</p>

The LLDPE+LDPE layer typically acts as the heat sealant layer of the finished laminate, and in packaging made from the laminate, the LLDPE+LDPE will form the inner or sealant surface of the package, facing the contained product, and the BOPP will form the outer or skin surface of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0577">T7225B&#x2122; film has the construction EAO/EAO/LLDPE tie/nylon/EVOH/nylon/EVA tie/EVA tie/nylon. The first layer of EAO typically acts as the heat sealant layer of the film, and in packaging made from the laminate, the EAO will form the inner or sealant surface of the package, facing the contained product, and the nylon of the last layer will form the outer or skin surface of the package. T7225B&#x2122; is used as a lidstock (non-forming) web.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0578">Referring to the drawings, the first side panel <b>12</b> has a top portion <b>9</b>, a first side edge <b>31</b>, a second side edge <b>33</b>, and a lower portion <b>17</b>. The second side panel <b>14</b> has a top portion <b>11</b>, a first side edge <b>35</b>, a second side edge <b>37</b>, and a lower portion <b>18</b>. The first and second side panels <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are joined together along their respective first and second side edges by a seal. As shown, first side edge <b>31</b> of first side panel <b>12</b> is joined to first side edge <b>35</b> of second side panel <b>14</b> by a seal <b>30</b>. Second side edge <b>33</b> of first side panel <b>12</b> is joined to second side edge <b>37</b> of second side panel <b>14</b> by a heat seal <b>32</b>. The second end <b>34</b> of the pouch <b>7</b> can be either a seal or a fold. Where a single web is used to make the pouch, second end <b>34</b> will typically be a fold, although even after the web is folded, a seal such as a heat seal can optionally be installed in the area of the fold. Where two webs of film are used to make panels <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, second end <b>34</b> will be a seal that joins panels <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> together along their respective lower portions <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. The two webs can be from the same material, or can be different in composition, structure, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0579">B. Discrete Laminate</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0580">A discrete laminate <b>4</b> includes a panel section <b>6</b>, and a tape <b>8</b> including a base strip <b>10</b> and a PSA layer <b>19</b>. Discrete laminate <b>4</b> is anchored to the first end of first panel <b>12</b>. The laminate, panel section, tape, base strip, and PSA layer can each be of any suitable dimension and shape, and will typically be longer in length than in width, with the length being e.g. greater than two times the width, e.g. greater than 3, 4, or 5 times the width. A typical dimension for the discrete laminate is a width of from about 1 to 1.5 inches and a length of about 4 to 10 inches. The strip <b>10</b> will be shorter in one dimension than the pouch and package. For example, the strip can extend across the transverse width of a pouch made in e.g. a HFFS or VFFS process, but will be significantly narrower than the length of the package (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). In one embodiment, the strip will occupy less than 50%, such as less than 40%, less than 30%, less than 20%, or less than 10% of the length of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0581">Panel section <b>6</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27D</figref>) provides a device that can be manually grasped and pulled away to open the package, and access the contents of the package. The size of the package, type of materials used for the pouch and the strip, the seal strength of the materials used in the strip, and the type of product being packaged can all have some effect on the choice of the optimal length and dimensions of the various components of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0582">Base strip <b>10</b> comprises a first surface <b>23</b> and a second surface <b>25</b>. In one embodiment, at least one of these first and second surfaces comprises a sealant. In another embodiment, both of these first and second surfaces comprises a sealant. The first surface <b>23</b> is optionally sealed to the inner surface <b>27</b> of the first side panel <b>12</b>, and the second surface <b>25</b> is optionally sealed to the inner surface <b>29</b> of the second side panel <b>14</b>. Either or both of the sealants are in one embodiment an easy open sealant. In another embodiment, only the first layer comprises a sealant, either an easy-open sealant, or a relatively strong sealant. The strip can be of multilayer or monolayer construction.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0583">When a product <b>24</b> is placed in the pouch <b>7</b>, by any suitable process such as processes herein disclosed, and the pouch <b>7</b> is closed, the package <b>5</b> is made.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0584">The base strip and the PSA layer can each be of any suitable thickness. The base strip can for example have a thickness of between 2.0 and 5.0 mils, such as between 2.5 and 4.5 mils, between 3.0 and 4.0 mils, or any thicknesses therebetween. Factors such as the composition of the base strip, arrangement of layers within the base strip, and flexural modulus of the materials used may affect the choice of appropriate thickness of the base strip. The PSA can also have any suitable thickness, typically 0.5 mils, e.g. between 0.1 mil and 1 mil, or 0.2 mils and 0.8 mils, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0585">Any suitable web, including any of the hybrid materials of the type described herein for web materials, e.g. H7225B or a non-barrier analog of such material, can be used to make the panel section <b>6</b> and base strip <b>10</b>, provided that the material chosen for the panel section exhibits an easy-open functionality as described herein. In embodiments where no seal is required between surfaces <b>25</b> and <b>29</b>, a seal between surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>27</b> can be made either before or after the finished package is made.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0586">In some embodiments, the PSA layer covers the entire first outer surface <b>23</b> of the base strip. The PSA serves to adhere the base strip to the inner surface <b>67</b> of the panel section <b>6</b>. In accordance with the invention, the PSA layer also provides, after a package has been made, a reclosability function as described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0587">The discrete laminate <b>4</b> is anchored to the first side panel. In one embodiment, base strip <b>10</b> is anchored to the inner surface <b>27</b> of first side panel <b>12</b> in anchor region &#x201c;A&#x201d;. In embodiments where the PSA covers the entire first outer surface <b>23</b>, there is no clear area on the outer surface of the base strip.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0588">In the embodiments disclosed in the drawings, a second portion of the first outer surface of the base strip is substantially free of pressure sensitive adhesive, and the first portion of the first outer surface of the base strip closer to the first end of the pouch than the second portion. The second portion of the first surface is anchored to the inner surface of the first side panel at anchor region &#x201c;A&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0589">In some embodiments, the first portion of the first outer surface of the base strip is closer to the first end of the pouch than the second portion. The portion of the first surface coated with PSA can be at one terminal portion of the strip, either closest to the first end of the package, or furthest from the first end of the package. Alternatively, the first portion can be disposed intermediate from, and spaced apart from, the two longitudinal (with respect to the first and second ends of the package) ends of the strip, such that clear areas of the base strip are present on both sides of the intermediate portion coated with PSA. Thus, the PSA layer can be coextensive with the first surface of the base strip, or can extend along only one or more terminal or intermediate portions of the strip, and the first surface of the strip can consequently have no clear areas, one clear area, or two or more clear areas.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0595">C. Opening Mechanisms and Strip Construction</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0596">The package of the invention can be easily manually opened. Any suitable mechanism or combination of mechanisms for obtaining this functionality and feature can be used according to the invention. The following are examples of such mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0597">1. Adhesive Failure</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0598">In this embodiment, second surface <b>25</b> of base strip <b>10</b> and inner surface <b>29</b> of second side panel <b>14</b> each comprises a polymeric composition that, when surface <b>25</b> is sealed to surface <b>29</b>, forms an easy-open seal. This seal provides an interface that breaks apart upon manually opening the package. The interlaminar bonds between layers of the base strip itself (where the strip is of multilayer construction), the cohesive strength of each layer within the strip or of the single layer of a monolayer strip, and the anchor that holds first surface <b>23</b> of base strip <b>10</b> to inner surface <b>27</b>, are stronger than the seal that holds surface <b>25</b> to surface <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0599">In some embodiments, the polymeric composition of surfaces <b>25</b> and <b>29</b> will be the same or similar. Useful in these embodiments are the peel systems disclosed in U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0158" num="0600">In other embodiments, the composition of surfaces <b>25</b> and <b>29</b> will differ, i.e. dissimilar sealants are used. Useful in these embodiments are the peel systems disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,655,503 (Stanley et al.) (LDPE or MDPE sealed to polypropylene (PP), EPC, saran, nylon 6, polycarbonate (PC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene oxide (PEO); PP sealed to saran, nylon 6, PC, PVC, PEO, IO, phenoxy, or EVA; or nylon sealed to IO); U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0159" num="0601">Alternatively, the seal between surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>27</b>, instead of or in addition to the seal between surfaces <b>25</b> and <b>29</b>, can function as the easy-open seal.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0602">In some embodiments, surface <b>25</b> is not sealed to surface <b>29</b>, and strip <b>10</b> thus remains unattached to second side panel <b>14</b> in the finished package, except for any side seals in the package that hold the two ends of base strip <b>10</b> between the first and second side panels.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0603">2. Delamination Failure</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0604">In this embodiment, one of the interlaminar bonds between layers of the base strip itself (where the strip is of multilayer construction) can be broken. Thus, the interlaminar bond provides the interface that will break apart upon manually opening the package. The seal between surfaces <b>25</b> and <b>29</b>, and between surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>27</b>, and the cohesive strength of each layer within the strip, are stronger than the interlaminar bond. Useful in this embodiment are the peel systems disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,944,409 (Busche et al.), this patent incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0605">3. Cohesive Failure</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0606">In this embodiment, one of the layers of the base strip itself (where the strip is of multilayer construction) or the monolayer base strip, fractures when the package is opened. The seal between surfaces <b>25</b> and <b>29</b>, and between surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>27</b>, and the interlaminar bonds between layers of the strip itself (where the strip is of multilayer construction) are stronger than the layer that fractures. Useful in this embodiment is the peel system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,476,137 (Longo) (internal rupture of a sealant layer comprising a blend of an ionomer having a melt flow index of less than 5, and a modified ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer having a substantially higher melt flow index, where the melt flow indices of the two polymers in the seal layer differ by at least 10), this patent incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0607">Other peel systems useful in connection with the present invention are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,058,632 (Evans et al.), U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0166" num="0608">4. Failure Involving PSA</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0609">In some embodiments, a package can be made where easy-open functionality is provided in the package by the presence of an easy-open seal and an easy-open sealant, acting in combination with the PSA. Opening can involve e.g. the PSA preferentially adhering to one of two surfaces, as the two surfaces are pulled apart; or adhering to both of two surfaces as the two surfaces are pulled apart. These embodiments are used in combination with displacing or removing the panel section. When the panel section is displaced or removed, at least a portion of the pressure sensitive adhesive, as well as at least a portion of the first end <b>28</b> of the base strip is exposed, i.e. is visible to the viewer facing the first side panel. By grasping the first end <b>28</b> of the base strip after removing the panel section, and pulling towards the user, the package contents can be accessed. The package can thereafter be reclosed by adhering one of the first and second panels, or panel section, to the pressure sensitive adhesive. &#x201c;First end of the base strip&#x201d; herein means the end <b>28</b> of the base strip closest to the first end of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0610">Optionally, especially for applications where hermeticity of the package is required before the package is first opened, a supplemental seal, of any suitable geometry, is disposed near the first end of the package, and seals the panel section to the first end of the base strip. See e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, region &#x201c;D&#x201d;. This seal reduces the possibility that, if the pressure sensitive adhesive becomes partially unadhered, oxygen from outside the package can enter the package. This supplemental seal is an easy-open seal. The supplemental seal can be located in the area of the base strip between the pressure sensitive adhesive and the first end of the base strip, or can be located in the area of the pressure sensitive adhesive itself. Thus, &#x201c;the supplemental seal seals the panel section to the first end of the base strip&#x201d; is used herein to mean sealing of the panel section to the base strip either in the region of the pressure sensitive adhesive (whether or not the pressure sensitive adhesive extends to the first end of the base strip) or in an area of the base strip between the pressure sensitive adhesive and the first end of the base strip. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> shows an area near the first end of the base strip not coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive, and within which the supplemental seal is made.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0611">Some clear areas may be present in the first portion of the base strip (such as an area to accommodate the supplemental seal), provided the easy-open and reclosable functionality of the package is substantially maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0612">The base strip <b>10</b> can have any suitable number of layers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a strip <b>10</b> has two layers. Layer <b>20</b> comprises a polymeric composition that in one embodiment provides an easy-open seal when sealed at surface <b>25</b> to inner surface <b>29</b>. Layer <b>22</b> comprises a polymeric composition that exhibits a relatively strong seal when sealed at surface <b>23</b> to inner surface <b>27</b>. In any strip construction, alternatively layer <b>22</b> or its equivalent can provide the easy-open seal, and layer <b>20</b> or its equivalent can provide the relatively strong seal, when sealed to respective web inner surfaces. Alternatively, both <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> or their equivalents provide an easy-open seal.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0613">Alternatively, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), base strip <b>10</b> is of monolayer construction. Layer <b>20</b> comprises a polymeric composition and includes first outer surface <b>23</b> and second outer surface <b>25</b> that can be like those disclosed herein for a multilayer base strip.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0614">In any of these alternatives, the surface of the strip facing inner surface <b>29</b> in some embodiments is not sealed to inner surface <b>29</b> except at any side seals of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0615">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, strip <b>10</b> is adhered to a portion of the inner surface <b>67</b> of panel section <b>6</b>, with a PSA, at adhesive region &#x201c;B&#x201d;. During manufacture of the package, discrete laminate <b>4</b> is anchored to a portion of first side panel <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, strip <b>10</b> is anchored to the inner surface <b>27</b>, e.g. with a relatively strong heat seal, at anchor region &#x201c;A&#x201d;. The second surface <b>25</b> of strip <b>10</b> is in one embodiment sealed to inner surface <b>29</b> of second side panel <b>14</b> with an easy-open seal.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0616">A representative film structure &#x201c;A1&#x201d; suitable for use as the base strip <b>10</b> according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In one embodiment, this film has the composition shown in Table 1.</p>

These are each alternative choices for making base strip <b>10</b> or panel section <b>6</b>. The coextruded barrier film is in each case laminated, by a polyurethane adhesive or the like, to a biaxially oriented, chemically treated PET film. The easy-open layer of the coextruded barrier film faces the interior of the final package. The layer of the coextruded barrier film on the opposite face of the film from the easy-open sealant, is adhered via the polyurethane adhesive to the PET film. In the discrete laminate of the invention, PSA is disposed on the outer surface of the PET, and a panel section comprising any suitable material having an easy-open sealant or providing an easy-open functionality, is adhered by the PSA to the PET.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0620">The H52XXBZ, and H72XXBZ are sold as primary packaging materials, i.e. webs that form the main body of the package, but not as a base strip or panel section of a discrete laminate, as described herein, to be used in combination with a primary packaging material.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0621">Materials that can be used as a base strip or panel section of a discrete laminate of the invention can include the H52XXBZ, and H72XXBZ materials described herein, such as H5225BZ, H5230BZ, H5235BZ, or H5240BZ, having an overall thickness of 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mils respectively, and a thickness of the coextruded barrier film of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 mils respectively. When used according to the invention, the easy-open sealant layer <b>122</b> of A1 exhibits a peel force of typically about 2 pounds/inch (ASTM F88). Layer <b>128</b> of A1 yields a peel force of typically 8 pounds/inch.</p>

The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> offers the benefit of more usable space inside the package, because there is no seal (except at the sides of the package) of surface <b>25</b> to surface <b>29</b>, and therefore more space is available for product.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0648">For many products, it is important to ensure hermeticity of the package during storage and distribution. Hermeticity is achieved in various embodiments of the invention where a seal (either easy-open or strong seal) adheres the first side panel to the strip in region &#x201c;A&#x201d;, and a seal adheres the second side panel to the strip (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>); or where a seal adheres the first side panel or panel section to the strip in regions &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d;, even though no seal adheres the second side panel to the strip (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) except at the side edges of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0649">In each of the embodiments of the package and process disclosed herein, a non-hermetic or hermetic package can be made in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0650">In one embodiment, layer <b>20</b> comprises a sealant that provide a relatively strong seal when layer <b>20</b> is sealed to surface <b>27</b>. An example of a material suitable as a base strip for this embodiment is a barrier film with a sealant that provides a relatively strong seal, and is currently used as, a barrier/sealant component of various laminated materials that also include a polyester film component, sold commercially by the Cryovac business unit of Sealed Air Corporation, under designations including H52XXB, and H72XXB. These are sold as primary packaging materials, i.e. webs that form the main body of the package, not as a base strip to be used in combination with a primary web.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0651">2. Method of Making a Package</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0652">A. Horizontal Form/Fill/Seal (HFFS)</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0653">HFFS packaging systems are generally well known to those of skill in the packaging industry, and can be used to make packages of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0654">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, and <b>9</b>A through <b>9</b>C, lay-flat web <b>300</b> is unwound from roll <b>302</b>, then advanced to forming plow <b>304</b> to convert lay-flat web <b>300</b> to folded web <b>305</b> (typically a centerfold film). The second end of each of the pouches to be made will comprise a second end fold <b>306</b>. Second end fold <b>306</b> therefore is equivalent to second end <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This second end fold can be optionally sealed, or left as a folded second end of the pouch. Side seals <b>308</b> are made to define a plurality of vertically arranged pouches <b>309</b>. Each pouch <b>309</b> is cut off from the trailing edge of web <b>300</b> by an appropriate cutting mechanism (not shown) such as a knife, at position <b>311</b>, a product (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, but see product <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>) is inserted or dropped into the open mouth <b>312</b> of each pouch, and the pouch mouth <b>312</b> is then closed by a suitable sealing mechanism such as a heat sealer (not shown) to create a seal <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0655">Discrete laminate <b>310</b>, equivalent to discrete laminate <b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, can be introduced into the HFFS process in a number of ways. For example, discrete laminate <b>310</b> can be unwound from a roll <b>315</b> in the vicinity of roll <b>302</b>, and disposed on lay-flat web <b>300</b> prior to, or as web <b>300</b> is being folded into folded web <b>305</b>. The discrete laminate is disposed on the web such that the discrete laminate overlaps the lay-flat web sufficient to allow the discrete laminate to be anchored to the web. Discrete laminate <b>4</b> in this embodiment becomes part of the folded web.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0656">Discrete laminate <b>310</b> includes a base strip, at least a first portion of the first surface of the base strip coated with a pressure sensitive adhesive, and a second portion of the first surface of the base strip optionally substantially free of PSA. The first portion is closer to a longitudinal end of the pouch, e.g. the first end of the pouch, than the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0657">The first portion of the first surface of the strip is adhered by the pressure sensitive adhesive to the panel section (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>). The second portion of the first surface of the base strip is anchored to the inner surface of the folded web at a second location on the folded web, by a suitable sealing mechanism such as a heat sealer (not shown). Optionally, the second surface of the strip is sealed to the inner surface of the folded web. Discrete laminate <b>310</b> would thus be installed on the pouch in the same overall HFFS process that achieves production of the pouch, loading of a product into the pouch, and completion of the final package. Discrete laminate <b>310</b> is incorporated onto the pouch material and after cutting and sealing as described hereinabove, comprises an extension of the first side panel of each pouch as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0658">Alternatively, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, discrete laminate <b>310</b> is shown as being preinstalled on the lay-flat web prior to the start of the HFFS packaging process. This can be accomplished off-site from the processor, e.g. by the supplier of the web roll <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0659"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a perspective view of a section of folded web as shown in the HFFS process and apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9A</figref>, as the lay-flat web is folded to create folded web <b>305</b>. The discrete laminate <b>310</b> is shown disposed, and optionally attached to, an inner surface <b>27</b> of one panel <b>12</b> of the folded web <b>305</b>, such that upon sealing the web to create a pouch, the discrete laminate functions as an extension of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0660">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, but additionally shows an optional gusset <b>400</b> that can be made in the second end fold <b>306</b> of the folded web. The gusset can be optionally thereafter heat sealed. A gusseted second end provides a stand-up pouch feature in the final package. Gusseting can be accomplished by any suitable means known to those of skill in the art, such as a second forming plow (not shown) placed in-line in the manufacturing line at a position downstream of the forming plow <b>304</b>. The bottom area of the folded web takes on a generally &#x201c;W&#x201d; shape, i.e. a gusseted shape, in cross-section, with the outside legs of the &#x201c;W&#x201d; extending upwardly, and two parallel reverse folds to create the gusseted bottom. Seal opening or holes are previously punched in the inner legs of the &#x201c;W&#x201d; shape and aligned with one another so that the two outside plies can be sealed together through these holes. When the seals are made the panels are sealed to one another through the holes. One or more static plows may be mounted above the seal zone to form the gussets. Gusset holes can be die punched by a static die at a hole-punch station which intermittently punches at least two holes at a predetermined position designed to be in general alignment with the side seal, adding rigidity to the gusset portion of the final package. This added rigidity enables the final package to stand up by itself when placed on a flat surface.</p>

These extended areas in some embodiments serve as areas that can be anchored to a web or first side panel of a package of the invention; or, in the case of the panel section, serve as an upper or end portion of a first side panel of a package that can function as part of an opening or removable flap. In some embodiments, both the first and second ends of the panel section can extend beyond the first and second ends respectively of the base strip.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0671">Although for purposes of illustration <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows the first and side edges of the base strip as extending beyond the first and side edges of the panel section, typically in packages of the invention the first and second side edges of the panel section will be congruent with the first and second edges respectively of the base strip. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a first or leading pouch &#x201c;L&#x201d; includes a transverse bottom and top seals <b>78</b>, folded side edges <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>, and longitudinal seal <b>47</b>. Second or trailing pouch &#x201c;T&#x201d; has features similar to leading pouch &#x201c;L&#x201d;. Leading pouch &#x201c;L&#x201d; is severed from upstream pouch &#x201c;T&#x201d; at cut line <b>80</b>, and the seals <b>78</b> are made by suitable sealing equipment commonly used in VFFS packaging processes, such as heat sealing equipment, not shown.

A finished package made according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> will thus look like the packages of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, when these are viewed at right angles to their position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, i.e. with the discrete laminate <b>4</b> to the right side of each package, and the second end <b>34</b> representing a fold. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> thus provides a method of producing packages on a VFFS apparatus where the longitudinal seal of the package effectively becomes the first end of the finished package (discounting any unsealed material between the longitudinal seal and the top edge of the package). The apparatus and methodology of U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,073 (Caudle) this patent incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, can be utilized in combination with the teachings herein, to produce packages according to this embodiment. A point of distinction is that in the present invention, the transverse seals will typically (although not necessarily) be rectilinear, whereas the trans-verse seals disclosed in Caudle '073 are wavy or sinusoidal.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0673">Alternatively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), a package like the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is shown, but where a lap seal <b>503</b> is shown.

A finished package <b>5</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> has a product therein; the two longitudinal ends of the package are each closed by a transverse seal; the lap seal runs down the middle or spine of the package, bounded on both ends by the transverse seals; and the discrete laminate is anchored to an interior surface of the folded web.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0674">C. Lidstock/Formed Web</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0675"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref>, <b>20</b>, and <b>21</b> illustrate in another embodiment the use of a formed web, e.g. a tray, and a non-formed web, e.g. a lidstock, used in connection with the invention. Tray <b>602</b> will typically be made during the packaging process. Thermoforming equipment, available from e.g. Multivac, Tiromat, Ulma or Rapid Pak, is used to convert flat thermoplastic forming web into formed pockets to create trays for containing product such as food, various industrial and consumer items and sterile medical products. Trays are formed from a lower web by heat and pressure, and can be loaded with product manually or automatically on the machine. After that, the packages are vacuumized or backflushed with modified atmosphere (if required), hermetically sealed to an upper web, separated, and removed for distribution or storage. Alternatively, pre-formed trays can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0676">Each tray <b>602</b> has a tray bottom <b>604</b>, tray sides <b>606</b>, and a tray flange <b>608</b> along its perimeter to which the lidstock <b>612</b> can be sealed. Tray bottom <b>604</b> and tray sides <b>606</b> define tray cavity <b>610</b>. Prior to any thermoforming step, tray <b>602</b> can be of any suitable thickness, e.g. from 2 to 30 mils thick, and any suitable construction.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0677">If a pre-made tray is used according to the invention, it can be rigid or semi-rigid, can be in the form of a flat or shaped tray, and can be made from any suitable material, including solid or expanded embodiments, such as PP, polystyrene, polyamide, 1,4-polymethylpentene (e.g. TPX&#x2122; available from Mitsui), or crystallized polyethylene terephthalate (CPET). A tray liner can optionally be used that adheres to the surface of the pre-made tray on which the product is to be placed. This liner can be of any suitable design, and can be a multi-layer structure with at least one layer with gas-barrier properties. Such a liner can be adhered to the tray by heat lamination, extrusion lamination, extrusion coating, adhesives, corona treatment, etc. Tray <b>602</b> can be a flexible or semi-rigid, or rigid formed web.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0678">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, a package includes tray <b>602</b> to which lidstock <b>612</b> has been sealed with perimeter seal <b>614</b>. Lidstock <b>612</b> includes a lay-flat web <b>611</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) formulated to function as a lid on a formed web, and can be any suitable monolayer or multilayer thermoplastic film as described herein with respect to webs useful in connection with the present invention. Lidstock <b>612</b> also includes discrete laminate <b>616</b> having an easy-open sealant on the inner surface thereof. Discrete laminate <b>616</b> has the easy-open characteristics and composition such as discussed herein with respect to the discrete laminate of HFFS or VFFS packages. The panel section (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>) can be pulled away from the package, and the first side panel can be grasped in the area below PSA layer <b>19</b> so that the package is easily opened and product can be removed as desired. After removing the product, the package can be reclosed, where the formed web is flexible, by folding the flexible formed web over, contacting the PSA. The formed web will typically have a flange or header that extends from the web. In some embodiments, e.g. where the formed web is rigid or semi-rigid, a line of weakness such as a series of perforations, slits, etc. can be installed on the underside of the formed web in the area of the flange. When the panel section is removed to open the package, the package can be reclosed by folding the formed web over at the line of weakness, allowing the formed web to contact the PSA to reclose the package. In the case of a flexible formed web, it may not be necessary to install a line of weakness in the formed web to facilitate reclosing of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0679">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, discrete laminate <b>616</b> has a first lateral edge <b>111</b>.

Lines <b>107</b> represent what will become the side edges and seals of individual packages when lidstock <b>612</b> is advanced into a packaging system where it is progressively fed over filled trays, sealed to the trays, and cut to create finished packages. Lines <b>111</b> and <b>140</b> also represent what will become the first and second end respectively of individual packages. Lay-flat web <b>611</b>, as rolled up, and as it feeds into thermoforming equipment, has a first lateral edge <b>140</b>. Discrete laminate <b>616</b> can be preanchored on lay-flat web <b>611</b> by the supplier of the lidstock, as in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>.

<p id="p-0231" num="0682">In another embodiment, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, the package of the invention can be made using a continuous HFFS process and apparatus such as those used for packaging bakery and other goods, sometimes known as Flow Wrap, Flow-Wrap or Flow wrapping machines or systems, and available from manufacturers/suppliers such as Ilapak, ULMA, and Bosch.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0683"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows such a process and apparatus <b>700</b>, but one in which a discrete laminate <b>724</b> is installed into a package. Lay-flat web <b>702</b> is drawn from roll <b>704</b> and advanced to forming device <b>710</b>. As this occurs, a series of products <b>706</b> is advanced along conveyor <b>708</b> to forming device <b>710</b>, and discrete laminate <b>724</b> is drawn from roll <b>726</b> and advanced to forming device <b>710</b>. Web <b>702</b>, with the discrete laminate in some embodiments anchored thereto either before or during forming of the web in the forming device, is formed by forming device <b>710</b> into folded web <b>712</b>. The discrete laminate becomes part of the folded web. This folded web will be like the folded web described above with respect to VFFS embodiments, but in a substantially horizontal orientation. Folded web <b>712</b> wraps around products <b>706</b>. A longitudinal sealing device that can be part of forming device <b>710</b> forms a lap or fin seal (of the type disclosed above with respect to VFFS embodiments) on the folded web, typically at the bottom of the folded web. The lap or fin seal is typically a heat seal. An alternative is to have a separate sealing device <b>714</b> to produce the lap or fin seal. The products travel downstream from forming device <b>710</b> or sealing device <b>714</b> to trans-verse sealing device <b>716</b> where the folded web is transversely sealed in areas of the folded web between adjacent products. Such seals are typically heat seals. The products are advanced from transverse sealing device <b>716</b> to cutting device <b>718</b><i>a </i>and <b>718</b><i>b</i>, where the formed and longitudinally and transversely sealed folded web is severed in areas of the folded web between adjacent products, in or near the transverse seals, such that individual packages <b>720</b> are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0684">Alternatively, the sealing function of transverse sealing device <b>716</b> and the cutting function of cutting device <b>718</b><i>a </i>and <b>718</b><i>b </i>can be combined at a single station, rather than being performed at separate locations on the production path.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0685">Web <b>702</b> and discrete laminate <b>724</b> can be of any suitable dimension and composition, such as those disclosed herein. As discrete laminate <b>724</b> is fed to forming device <b>710</b>, it can be brought into contact with, and optionally anchored to a surface of web <b>702</b>. This embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</figref>, where discrete laminate <b>724</b> is shown as anchored to web <b>702</b> as it progresses toward forming device <b>710</b>. First longitudinal edge <b>703</b> of discrete laminate <b>724</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Alternatively, discrete laminate <b>724</b> can be fed into forming device <b>710</b>, and then incorporated into folded web <b>712</b> by anchoring the discrete laminate to the interior or exterior surface of the web, in a manner and format analogous to the embodiment of the VFFS pouch and package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>, but in a horizontal rather than vertical position. In another embodiment, discrete laminate <b>724</b> can be pre-applied to web <b>702</b> by the supplier of the web, analogous to the embodiment of the VFFS pouch and package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>, and the HFFS pouch and process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0686">E. Side Seal Bags</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0687">In one embodiment, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, the package of the invention can be made using otherwise conventional bag making equipment and processes. Bags are often made as side seal bags. The side seal bag has a factory-made heat seal at opposite bag edges. The bag bottom is formed by one of two folds of film created during the extrusion of bag tubing during manufacture. The opposite fold of film is slit to form a bag mouth. The bag is typically made from a long length of bag tubing. A method of making side seal bags is disclosed in US 2008/0138478 A1 (Ebner et al.), this patent incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> together, side seal bag <b>180</b> comprises a web <b>182</b>, first edge <b>184</b> defining an open mouth, edge fold <b>190</b>, first side seal <b>192</b>, and second side seal <b>194</b>. Discrete laminate <b>191</b> is installed on the individual bag, or on a slit bag tube that is then cut and sealed at predetermined intervals to make a series of side seal bags <b>180</b>, by any suitable process such as any of those disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0689">A bag can be made by extruding a thermoplastic tube to make a bag tubing; slitting the tubing at one longitudinal edge thereof to make a slit bag tubing; anchoring the discrete laminate as described herein to the slit bag tubing; and transversely cutting and sealing the bag tubing at predetermined intervals to make a plurality of individual bags each with the discrete laminate disposed thereon. The discrete laminate can function as described herein for other embodiments and processes, in providing an easy-open and reclosable package. Some of the steps set out in US 2008/0138478 A1, for making a bag, are optional with respect to the present invention; such steps including irradiation and orientation of the tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0690">In the various embodiments disclosed herein, the discrete laminate can be anchored to the first side panel of a web, pouch, or package in a number of different configurations.

<p id="p-0247" num="0698">In opening the package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27D</figref>, an end or edge of panel section <b>6</b> is manually grasped and pulled away from the package. The end of strip <b>10</b> closest to the first end <b>39</b> of the package is then grasped and pulled away from the second side panel <b>14</b>, breaking through the easy-open seal (if any) between the second surface <b>25</b> of base strip <b>10</b>, and the inner surface <b>29</b> of the second side panel <b>14</b>, to access product in the interior <b>57</b> of the package. During this opening sequence, the anchor in region &#x201c;A&#x201d; between surfaces <b>23</b> and <b>27</b> of first side panel <b>12</b> will typically remain intact, such that a portion of the strip <b>10</b> stays on and in contact with surface <b>27</b>. PSA layer <b>19</b> is exposed when the package is opened in each of these embodiments. To reclose the package, and depending on the geometry of the respective components of the package, a portion of the second side panel can be folded over to contact the PSA; or the upper portion of the second side panel, along with an upper portion of the first side panel with the base strip anchored thereto, can be folded over such that the PSA contacts the outer surface of the first side panel. The package can typically be opened and reclosed several times. When the package is opened, the PSA is positioned facing the outside of the package. This is useful especially with food products where it is undesirable to have the PSA facing the interior of the package, and thus potentially in contact with the product.</p>

To facilitate opening, an unsealed area <b>251</b> can be installed in a corner of panel section <b>6</b> at its first end <b>15</b>, where it contacts the second side panel. This area can be used to initiate opening. Panel section <b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), now functioning as an opening flap <b>509</b>, is peeled away along the easy-open seal from the first end of the package and is completely removed. The PSA layer <b>19</b> is thus exposed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>). The tape <b>8</b> is then pulled away from the second side panel to access the contents of the package. The package can be reclosed as described herein for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0700">In an alternative mode, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28D and 28E</figref>, the panel section <b>6</b> can overlap the first side panel. The panel section can then be removed by grasping the lower edge of the panel section and pulling it up over the PSA layer and toward the first end of the package, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28E</figref>. The panel section is completely removed, and the resultant opened package will appear as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0701">Method of Applying a PSA Layer to a Base Strip</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0702"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> shows a method of applying a PSA layer to a base strip to make a tape, comprising the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0703">1) advancing base strip <b>10</b> by suitable motive means (not shown, and well known in the art, such as a motor) from roll <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0704">2) Optionally, corona treating surface <b>23</b> using a conventional corona treater <b>92</b> in preparation for the application of a PSA to the treated surface. The PSA may adhere to strip <b>10</b> without corona treatment. However, in this embodiment, depending on the materials chosen, the PSA may, upon opening of a package, exhibit cohesive failure, or alternating adhesive failure, i.e. some of the PSA may adhere to strip <b>10</b>, and some to surface <b>67</b> of panel section <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0705">3) applying a coating of PSA <b>19</b> to substantially the entire surface <b>23</b> of strip <b>10</b>. A conventional PSA applicator <b>94</b> is shown applying PSA to now corona treated surface <b>23</b>. As an alternative, a release liner, such as a silicone-coated liner can be coated with PSA, and the PSA-coated liner is then laminated to corona treated strip <b>10</b>. When the liner is removed, the PSA remains with the strip <b>10</b>. The PSA can be of any suitable composition and thickness. The thickness of the coating of PSA may vary from one portion of the coated surface to another. This is acceptable as long as the finished package functions in its intended way with respect to its reclosability.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0706">4) optionally providing, in a selected portion of surface <b>23</b>, a clear area.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0707">5) curing the coating of PSA. Curing can be accomplished by any suitable process, taking into account the type of PSA being used, including hot air drying by a conventional hot air dryer <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0708">6) advancing resulting tape <b>8</b> to take-up roll <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0709">The application of PSA to the strip, and the assembling of a package incorporated a panel section and a PSA coated strip, can be done at a single location, but more practically will typically be done at two or more separate locations, with the assembling of the package by a packager using pre-provided discrete laminate prepared elsewhere and provided in advance of the packaging process.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0710">Method of Applying a Panel Section to a Tape to Make a Discrete Laminate</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0711"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a method of applying a panel section to a tape to make a discrete laminate, comprising the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0712">1) advancing tape <b>8</b> including base strip <b>10</b> and PSA layer <b>19</b> by suitable motive means (not shown, and well known in the art, such as a motor) from roll <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0713">2) advancing panel section <b>6</b> from roll <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0714">3) bringing tape <b>8</b> and panel section <b>6</b> together at nip rolls <b>181</b>,<b>182</b>, such that the PSA adheres the tape to the panel section.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0715">4) advancing resulting discrete laminate <b>4</b> to take-up roll <b>185</b>. A seal could optionally be used to attach the tape to the panel section.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0716">Method of Application of the Discrete Laminate to a Web</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0717">The discrete laminate can be applied to a web such as a lay-flat web in a number of ways.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0718">In one embodiment, the discrete laminate can be completely assembled, either at the package facility where it will be used to make packages, or at a supplier or converter location. The discrete laminate can then be adhered or anchored to a web as disclosed herein. Anchoring in this embodiment is accomplished e.g. by sealing an extended second end of the panel section of the discrete laminate to a surface of the web, and/or by anchoring an extended second end of the base strip of the discrete laminate to a surface of the web.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0719">In another embodiment, the panel section and tape are not brought together initially, and the panel section is sealed to one surface of a web, and the tape is separately anchored to an opposite surface of the web, so that the PSA on the base strip adheres to an inner surface of the panel section. Attachment of the panel section and tape to the web can be done simultaneously, or sequentially with attachment of the panel section either before or after attachment of the tape. In this embodiment, the panel section and tape can be congruent, although they do not have to be.</p>
