<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of sex toys and in particular, to sex toys which are used to stimulate the female sexual organs either during masturbation or sexual intercourse. The present invention relates to the field of sex toys used for labial, clitoral, penetrative and&#x201c;G&#x201d; spot stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, sex toys are known in the prior art. One example of a sex toy used for giving labial, clitoral, penetrative and &#x201c;G&#x201d; spot stimulation to a female is set forth in UK Patent GB 2 401 551 B and its corresponding European Patent No. EP 1 477 149 A1 and Canadian Patent CA 2412525. In this device, there is disclosed a female stimulation aid comprising a first handle portion and a second penetrative shaft portion connected together at their respective proximal ends to form a generally U-shaped stimulation device which is fairly rigid and thick in configuration and requires firm gripping of a handle portion to facilitate penetration of the device at a curved hook end into a female. The device also has an inner face with transverse ribs to provide additional stimulation. Although the patent talks in general about other variations, there is only illustrated and discussed in detail the single, fairly rigid and thick U-shaped curved device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a significant need for an improved sex toy which provides numerous other alternative features to aid in female sexual stimulation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, it should be understood that such embodiments are by way of example only and merely illustrative of but a small number of the many possible specific embodiments which can represent applications of the principles of the present invention. Various changes and modifications obvious to one skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the present invention as further defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>, there are illustrated perspective, front, rear, right side, left side, top, bottom and cross-sectional views of the present invention flexible multi-configuration sexual stimulation device <b>10</b>. The device <b>10</b> has a first section <b>20</b> and a flexible second section <b>60</b> interconnected by a flexible interconnecting section <b>80</b>. Although described in three sections, the device <b>10</b> is one integral unit formed out of flexible material selected from the group consisting of soft rubber and silicone. The first section has an exterior surface <b>22</b> having an interior face <b>24</b> and an exterior face <b>30</b>. The interior face <b>24</b> has a multiplicity of stimulation mechanisms <b>26</b> protruding from the interior face <b>24</b>. The stimulation mechanisms include a multiplicity of randomly spaced generally round bumps <b>26</b>A and a multiplicity of generally oval spaced protrusions <b>26</b>B interspersed within the multiplicity of generally round bumps <b>26</b>A. It will be appreciated that the shapes of the stimulation mechanisms can be any desired shape in addition to round and oval, including but not limited to square, rectangular, ellipsoidal, pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal. While illustrated as located adjacent to the flexible interconnecting section <b>80</b>, it will be appreciated that the stimulation mechanisms <b>26</b> can be positioned at any desired location or locations on the interior face <b>24</b> of exterior surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first section <b>20</b> of device <b>10</b> is intended to be used as a handle by which the device can be grasped. The first section <b>20</b> is retained in the palm of one hand and encircled by at least some of the fingers of the hand. An activation mechanism <b>42</b> such as a push button extends out of the top surface <b>40</b> adjacent a distal end <b>28</b> of the first section <b>20</b> of device <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the device <b>10</b> includes an interior chamber <b>50</b> within first section <b>20</b>, the chamber retaining a power supply <b>52</b> which can be one or a multiplicity of batteries <b>54</b>A, <b>54</b>B and <b>54</b>C. The power supply <b>52</b> is in electrical communication with a vibrator <b>56</b> which in turn is connected to a vibration transmitting mechanism <b>58</b> which, by way of example, can be a copper wire <b>58</b>A extending from the vibrator <b>56</b> through the interior of the device <b>10</b>, extending through the flexible interconnecting section <b>80</b> and into the second section <b>60</b> and terminating adjacent the distal end <b>62</b> of flexible second section <b>60</b>. When the activation mechanism <b>42</b> is activated such as pushing down on the push button, the vibrator <b>56</b> is activated causing the vibration mechanism <b>58</b> to vibrate within the device <b>10</b>, thereby causing the first section <b>20</b>, interconnecting section <b>80</b> and second section <b>60</b> to vibrate. The vibration will continue until the activation mechanism <b>42</b> is once against activated such as pushing on the pushbutton to turn off the vibrator <b>56</b>. Alternatively, to save battery life, the period of time of activation of the vibrator <b>56</b> can be preset after activation such as one minute, two minutes, etc., and the vibrator <b>56</b> will automatically turn off after the preset period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The flexible second section <b>60</b> has an exterior surface <b>64</b> having an interior face <b>66</b> and an exterior face <b>68</b>. The interior face <b>66</b> has a multiplicity of stimulation mechanisms <b>70</b> protruding from the interior face <b>66</b>. The stimulation mechanism includes a multiplicity of randomly spaced generally round bumps <b>70</b>A and a decorative design <b>70</b>B which as illustrated is a butterfly. It will be appreciated that the stimulation mechanism <b>70</b> can be of any shape and of any decorative design. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>8</b>, the distal end <b>62</b> of second section <b>60</b> is rounded and extends in an arcuate manner relative to interior face <b>66</b>, projecting away from interior face <b>66</b> and having an interior rounded tip <b>62</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A key innovation of the present invention is the inclusion of a multiplicity of longitudinally projecting protrusions <b>72</b> extending away from exterior face <b>68</b> of second section <b>60</b>. The longitudinally projecting protrusions <b>72</b> are separated by longitudinal spaces <b>74</b>. The longitudinal protrusions <b>72</b> act as lubricant retaining barriers for lubricant <b>100</b> which is retained in the spaces <b>74</b> between the longitudinally projecting protrusions <b>72</b>. The longitudinal protrusions <b>72</b> and spaces <b>74</b> form a lubricant reservoir. As a result, lubricant <b>100</b> applied to the exterior face <b>68</b> of the second section <b>60</b> is retained in the lubricant retaining barriers formed of the longitudinally extending protrusions <b>72</b> and spaces <b>74</b> therebetween so that the device can be used for several minutes without having to replenish lubricant <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another unique feature of the present invention device <b>10</b> is the incorporation of the flexible interconnecting section <b>80</b> having a first end <b>84</b> which is adjoined to proximal end <b>34</b> of the first section <b>20</b> and a second end <b>86</b> which is adjoined to proximal end <b>76</b> of second section <b>60</b>. The flexible interconnecting section <b>80</b> enables the device <b>10</b> to be twisted, contorted and bent into any desired multiplicity of shapes. By way of example, the device can be twisted into the shape of a question mark <b>10</b>A as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, where the first section <b>20</b> is the stem of the question mark and is grasped in one hand, the interconnecting section <b>80</b> is the center of the question mark and the second flexible section <b>60</b> is the arcuate part of the question mark.
