<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A load carrier has a flat tray-like body that attaches to a vehicle by load bars. Multiple components may be installed on the tray body in many locations on the tray body, for containing and/or supporting cargo. One component is a cargo container that is captured and locked in one of several possible positions on the tray body. Other components are cargo posts that include one or more upending towers for supporting cargo by capturing generally vertical portions of the cargo between the towers, wherein the cargo posts may be non-pivotal, pivotal, slidable and/or adjustable. Another component is a hooked or curved depending assembly that suspends cargo from the edges of the tray body.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a load carrying system mounted to cargo load bars of a motor vehicle, such as rooftop load bars, truck-bed bars (pick-up or otherwise), and/or other cargo support structure that is provided on the exterior of a vehicle. More specifically, the invention is a load carrying system comprising a four-sided pan or tray-shaped load carrier body designed as a template for inter-fitting modular components, such as cargo containers and cargo posts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many motorists depend upon their vehicles to support their livelihoods as well as their lifestyles, whether making a cross-town commute, conducting daily business, traveling long distance, or pursuing weekend recreation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the passenger compartment and interior of a vehicle has reached its cargo-carrying limit, or the motorist wishes to routinely transport a wide variety of cargo items, many motorists turn to their vehicle's rooftop or truck-bed exterior cargo-carrying capabilities to meet their needs. These situations can include transport of industrial, utility or construction equipment, such as toolboxes, large tools, ladders, lumber, plumbing pipes, buckets, or carrying bulky personal items such as luggage, furniture, boxes, bags, and recreational equipment, including bicycles, skis, kayaks, canoes, surfboards, windsurfing and other oddly-shaped, oversized apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Odorous, wet or soiled cargo items are also commonly transported on vehicle rooftops or in or above a truck-bed, for example. These items include spare vehicle tires, tire jacks, automotive accessories, fuel cans, large coolers, power tools, heavy clothing, wetsuits, fishing gear, and related sports equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Over the years, a number of external cargo-carrying systems and styles have been created for vehicles for different cargo-carrying needs. One or more load bars mounted to vehicle rooftops, camper tops, or truck-beds, for example, enable motorists to secure various cargo items, such as ladders and lumber, directly to these load bars, supporting the cargo above the vehicle or camper exposed rooftop, or above the truck-bed, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some styles of load bars are factory-installed, while others are custom-mounted on vehicle rooftops or above a truck-bed. Load bars can vary in size, shape, load-bearing capacity, rooftop/truck-bed placement, mounting hardware, style and design. Load bars also enable motorists to attach a variety of available cargo carrying systems and components to the load bars and their vehicles. Load bars typically span the length and/or width of a vehicle rooftop surface, or the length and/or width of the truck-bed. Affixed to each end of a load bar is a load bar foot mounted to the vehicle rooftop or truck-bed walls and/or floor, using bolts, pins, rivets, clasps, hooks or other fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Heavy duty, construction, service and industrial application racks are generally open frame, scaffold-style beams or similar structures, mounted into pickup beds to allow overhead loading, transport, and unloading of long, heavy items such as ladders, plumbing materials, lumber and plywood.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For service industry and construction workers, toolboxes and gearboxes are often mounted in pickup beds. Trucks and vans, such as contractor, plumbing, and utility service vehicles, are commonly customized to include side-opening doors configured into locker style compartments incorporated within the vehicle. This arrangement allows the user easy access to tools, toolboxes, hardware and other equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For travel and recreational enthusiasts, and those motorists seeking a variety of cargo-carrying solutions, many roof/truck-bed rack systems depend upon cargo specific mounts or components, such as bicycle mounts, ski mounts, and watercraft mounts, attached by a bracket or clamp to the roof/truck-bed load bars of their vehicles. Cargo specific components, when mounted to a vehicle's load bars, are designed to suspend specific cargo items above a vehicle's rooftop or above a vehicle's truck-bed. Motorists then load and secure and/or lock cargo items to these components directly, using customized locking mechanisms or conventional tie-down devices, such as ropes, straps, and bungee hooks.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With many cargo-carrying systems, separate mounts are designed for different cargo items such as bicycles, skis, snowboards, kayaks, canoes, surfboards, and fishing poles. Most specialized components include a combination of moving parts in their design, which can be difficult to manipulate in cold temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another popular load carrier is the enclosed cargo container, which is also mounted directly to the roof/truck-bed load bars of vehicles. Cargo containers can be detached from vehicle load bars when not in use, or they can be left locked in place. Mounting and dismounting of these containers generally depends upon brackets and clamps mounted to the interior floor panel of the containers. This process is substantially easier when the container is first emptied of its cargo contents.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Cargo containers generally include one large top access door with a hinging mechanism on one side, however, the cargo container may comprise one or more doors on said top side for access to the interior of said cargo container. Cargo containers can be square shaped, or curved in pursuit of more aerodynamic function and stylized appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Some load carriers are open structures in more or less basket style configurations. These can have wire sides or tubular or rod pieces jointed together to form a basket shaped, open top structure. The open nature of the basket design allows for transport of bulky items such as fuel cans, spare tires, boxes, furniture and bags.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various cargo-specific components are also available, designed to attach directly to basket-style load carriers, including individual mounts for bicycles, skis, snowboards, kayaks, canoes, surfboards, and fishing poles. When cargo is secured to these mounts, cargo items are suspended above the basket, limiting available cargo space within the basket itself. Straps from gear or duffel bags, backpacks, and smaller, odd shaped items can slip through the floor and sides of basket style load carriers, potentially coming into contact with and damaging surfaces of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some load carriers are pan or tray-shaped, with four short sidewalls and generally solid floor panels. The open configuration of a pan or tray-style load carrier enables the user to carry mixed loads of bags, boxes, or other bulky items, reducing the possibility of cargo items contacting the vehicle's surfaces. The user secures cargo items directly to the load carrier floor panels, rails and fixed anchor points, including eyelets and hardware that commonly protrude from the load carrier pan. Securing cargo loads requires tie-down devices such as straps, ropes, cargo netting, tarps and bungee hooks.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The load carriers and cargo systems described above have certain limitations, and a different type of vehicle-exterior load carrying system is needed to solve problems with the structures and/or the use of the prior art, and to fill many needs. The invented system meets many or all needs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention comprises a pan/tray-shaped load carrier body designed as a template for inter-fitting modular components, optimizing available vehicle-exterior cargo space and enabling the user to safely and routinely transport a wide range of cargo items on a vehicle roof-top, on a truck or pick-up bed, and/or on any support bars/structure that is conventionally provided in or on a vehicle. The inter-fitting modular components may comprise upending cargo posts, a cargo container, and/or a bracket or hook depending from an edge of the pan/tray-shaped load carrier body. The cargo posts may be slidable in a track system, and/or otherwise adjustable relative to each other, and/or pivotal to a flattened storage position, for increasing versatility of the invention. The cargo container may be interfit with the load carrier body by mating walls at the front and/or the rear of the system, and may be removable and preferably rollable on a ground (including a road, concrete, or other surface).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The cargo posts may secure many different pieces of cargo to the pan/tray-shaped load carrier body, for example, a bicycle in an upright orientation with both bicycle wheels left intact and installed on the bicycle. Transporting a bicycle upright protects its moving parts and paint, and transporting a bicycle with both wheels intact and installed eliminates cumbersome wheel removal and wheel reattachment by the user. Cargo posts may also be designed to accept skis, snowboards or other large, long items, including lumber and plumbing pipes. Items may be secured or locked to one cargo post, or multiple cargo posts used in conjunction or alignment with one another, configured and mounted within the load carrier. The cargo post can secure many types and sizes of cargo items, enabling the user to transport a variety of cargo without switching components. In alternative approaches to carrying a bicycle with the wheels still mounted on the bicycle, users may chose to remove the bicycle wheels and utilize a fork mount block to hold and stabilize the bicycle, which fork mount block may be attached to the invented load carrier in various locations on the pan/tray-shaped load carrier body, for example. Fork mount blocks are well-known and available commercially, and may be installed on the load carrier body by bolts or other fasteners, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The versatility of the invention may also, or instead, be enhanced by use of one or more hooked or curved assemblies that depend from one or more side edges or the tray/pan (&#x201c;body&#x201d;). These depending assemblies may be used to suspend objects from one or more side edges of the body of the device. For example, a single assembly may be used to suspend one or more objects, but more frequently, two assemblies will be used to suspend opposite ends of an elongated object such as a ladder or a surfboard, and thus, to suspend the entire object.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The preferred tray/pan, cargo posts, cargo container, and/or depending assemblies, may be configured relative to each other at the user's discretion, or readily detached from each other. Removing the cargo posts and cargo container from the load carrier body (tray/pan) will leave the load carrier body empty, low profile, and ready to transport larger, bulky items such as sports equipment, fuel cans, spare tires, tools, furniture, bags and boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further objects of the invention, and features of the preferred embodiments, and will be apparent after reading the description of the drawings and the preferred embodiments, included hereafter in this document.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The load carrying system of the invention is configured for attachment to the load bars or other exterior cargo-carrying structure of motor vehicles, including pickups, vans and SUVs. These conventional load-bars or other exterior cargo-carrying structures are typically mounted to a roof of a vehicle, a roof of a camper, or to the floor and/or sides of a pick-up bed (to form a standing structure that upends from the truck-bed to a level above the upper walls/perimeter of the truck-bed). Such a vehicle would typically be one on which rooftop load bars or truck-bed bars/supports are already attached. These can be reinforced, after-market bars/supports made for attachment to vehicles for carrying cargo. Such bars/supports can also be factory mounted during the construction of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Load bars are generally mounted on the rooftop area above passenger compartments of vehicles, or on uprights that are installed in/on a truck-bed. They can also be mounted to camper tops covering the truck-beds of pickups, or mounted in a combination of these locations.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The load carrier body of the preferred embodiment, also called herein a &#x201c;tray&#x201d;, &#x201c;pan&#x201d;, or &#x201c;platform&#x201d;, is mounted to vehicle load bars by affixing braces, brackets, clamps or u-bolts around the vehicle load bars, and attaching said braces, brackets, clamps or u-bolts to the underside of the load carrier body. Customized or conventional fasteners such as bolts and nuts can be used. A variety of customized clamps are commonly available and designed to fit around load bars of different vehicles. The load carrier body may also be attached to vehicle load bars using straps, rope, or other secure tie-down devices.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The preferred load carrier body includes a &#x201c;floor panel&#x201d; (which is the large, main top platform surface of the body), and four generally-upending walls, from 2-12 inches in height. The load carrying body is pan or tray-shaped, having a generally flat, planar floor panel that is generally continuous, with the exception of apertures or passages for attachment or strapping of components or cargo. Two side walls upend from right and left side edges of the floor panel, and attach to front and rear walls where they abut generally at the four corners of the floor panel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The front and rear end walls are preferably positioned at supplementary angles to each other relative to the flat panel of the load carrying body, to deflect the wind, and to position cargo items in place. For example, the front end wall of the load carrier body is preferably slated rearward over the front edge of the load carrying body floor panel, so that it is at 30 degrees to said floor panel. For example, the rear end wall is preferably slated rearward away from the rear edge of the floor panel, so that is may be described as 150 degrees from the floor panel. Thus, these two angles add to 180 degrees, or, are supplementary to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Another way to describe the front and rear end walls is that they are both sloped/slanted rearward, relative to the plane of the floor panel, for example, sloped/slanted rearward to be 25-60 degrees relative to the plane of the floor panel. Because the floor panel is typically generally horizontal when installed, one could describe the front and rear end walls are sloping/slanted rearward at 25-60 degrees to horizontal. The slanted/sloping front end wall and rear end wall of the load carrier body serve to secure modular components in place, such as a cargo container. This slanted/sloping design also reduces wind friction on the load carrier body.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Apertures or &#x201c;passages&#x201d; are provided, preferably throughout the load carrier body, including the floor panel, side walls, and end walls. The design and placement of the passages throughout the load carrier body serve as mounting locations for accessories such as load-securing components, including an inter-fitting cargo container and/or cargo posts and/or bracket/hook assemblies that depend from one or more edges of the device. The passages are designed to receive, and preferably allow locking of, the load-securing components to the load carrier body. The passages are designed to accept rigid tabs, shafts, or bolts, that are built into or other provided with the inter-fitting modular components. Also, the passages may be used for threading, looping or otherwise securing conventional cargo tie-down devices such as straps, ropes and bungee hooks. Also, the passages function as water, ice and snow drainage sites and attachment sites.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the preferred embodiment, passages are circular or oval in shape, to reduce pinching of cargo tie-down devices such as straps or webbing routed or looped through said passages. These passages are generally between &#x215b; inch and 5 inches in diameter, which are small passages/apertures compared to the dimensions of the flat floor panel. Therefore, it may be noted, the preferred load carrying body floor panel and walls are more solid and continuous than a grate, mesh, or frame, and will tend to be more rigid and strong than grates, mesh, or frame systems.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A lip or &#x201c;flange&#x201d; portion may extend from the upper edge of the upending left and right side walls and/or rear and front end walls, so that the lip/flange is oriented to be horizontal when the device is installed on a vehicle. The lip/flange of one or more of the walls may comprise apertures for connection of depending assemblies, ties, straps, bungee-cords, or other fasteners or attachments.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Preferred inter-fitting cargo components comprise a cargo container, a cargo post(s), and depending suspension assemblies. These cargo components may include interfitting rigid tabs and/or fasteners that fit through the passages cut throughout the load carrier body along its floor panel, front end, rear end, or side walls, allowing for connection of the cargo components, and hence cargo, in multiple locations in/on the load carrier body. Once protruding through a chosen passage, a tab and/or fastener may be secured and locked into place with a padlock, pin or locking mechanism. Other attachment mechanisms may be used for said cargo container, cargo post, and/or suspension assemblies, as will be understood later in this document.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The removable cargo container offers a versatile, portable alternative to many conventional cargo containers. The preferred cargo container incorporates hinged top and side doors, allowing access to the top, left and right sides of the container, depending upon which side of the load carrier body, and the vehicle, the container is positioned. The container can include removable drawers and cargo space separators, and a removable tote wheel assembly for maneuvering the cargo container when it is not attached to the load carrier body.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The preferred cargo container has four sides, a top and a bottom. The cargo container fits securely within the load carrier body by abutting under the load carrier front end wall, preventing forward movement of the container, while also abutting the load carrier rear end wall, where the container is locked into place. The front lower end panel, also called the nose, of the cargo container, fits securely under the load carrier body front end wall, preventing forward movement of the container and/or upward swinging of the front of the container, relative to the load carrier body. The rear lower end panel of the cargo container abuts against, and is contoured/shaped to mate or &#x201c;inter-fit&#x201d; with, the load carrier body rear end wall, also serving to position the cargo container in place.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Once in position, a rigid tab mounted on the exterior of the cargo container lower rear end panel may be provided, which tab may protrude through the load carrier body rear end wall at one of several passages along the load carrier body rear end wall, enabling the user to secure and lock the cargo container into place relative to the carrier body using a padlock or pin. A snug or tight-fitting lock system, with the length of the tab designed appropriately, may prevent upward pivoting of the rear end of the cargo container. Thus, the cargo container is constrained from forward, rearward, or upward movement relative to the load carrying body, as it is captured at its front end by the interfitting shapes of the cargo container and the front wall, and locked at its rear end by the interfitting shapes and lock of the cargo container and the rear end. These interfitting shapes and lock systems will also inhibit or prevent lateral movement of the cargo container, but additional tabs and locks, and/or bolts, straps or other fasteners, may be used to further prevent lateral or other movement, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The cargo container rear lower tab also may accept a removable tote wheel assembly with a rigid suspension, enabling the user to more easily maneuver the cargo container when it is dismounted from the load carrier body. The tote wheel assembly attaches to the tab mounted on the container's rear end panel using a bolt or pin mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Depending upon materials used in the construction of the load carrying system, and its preferred components, including aluminum, steel, or high impact plastic, for example, the design and function of system and the components will serve different load carrying capacities and cargo needs. For example, a cargo container made of steel or aluminum can be configured to function as a removable equipment box, locking power tools and fuel cans safely within, yet still outside of, the user's vehicle. A cargo container molded from high impact plastic that is lighter in weight is designed for recreational cargo, such as sports equipment, basic tools and automotive accessories. The cargo container may include a combination of removable and configurable cargo drawers and cargo space separators within the cargo container.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The multiple passages on the load carrier rear end wall enable the user to choose which side of their vehicle to attach the cargo container, and from which side they will access cargo items within the container. This can be the left, center, or right side of the load carrier and the vehicle. For example, in an urban area, the user can position the cargo container on the passenger (sidewalk) side of the load carrier and their vehicle, accessing cargo safely away from traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Side access doors are mounted within the cargo container side walls and include a hinge, allowing the access door to suspend above a side wall of the load carrier, creating a flat workspace and cargo staging platform for the user. Side access doors of the container are held open by restraints such as chains or cables mounted to either or both interior end surfaces of a side access door. Depending upon which side hinges are located, one or more top access doors of the cargo container will open toward the left or right side of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Cargo container top access doors are held open by restraints such as chains or cables mounted to either or both interior end surfaces of a top access door, or more preferably, by gas shocks or other strut-members. Top access doors of the container are generally larger than side access doors, allowing loading and unloading of larger cargo items. Access door handles on the cargo container are recessed into the surface of the side and top access doors, and include key or combination locks.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The user configures the interior space of the cargo container to arrange removable drawers and cargo space separators, held in place by frames built within the container's interior. For example, the user can carry power tools in a separate compartment from fuel cans, or business paperwork in a separate drawer from hand tools or hardware. The user can optimize the container's cargo space by removing its drawers and separators altogether, in order to carry long or bulky items.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The cargo container can be constructed as aerodynamic and curved in design and appearance, or it can be constructed as square or box-like, depending upon the cargo carrying requirements of the user. The cargo container can include tote handles on its front end, rear end and/or side walls. Tote handles are generally recessed, designed as a one-piece mold, or they can pivot outward from the body of the container, utilizing a built-in hinge. Tote handles facilitate maneuvering of the container when it is dismounted from the load carrier body.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Another preferred modular component is a cargo post, designed to secure a variety of cargo items, rather than being cargo-item-specific in nature, as are many current, conventional cargo rack systems. Each cargo post comprises a base plate for securement to the load carrier body floor panel, and one or two upright parallel towers. The towers are generally fin-shaped, accepting cargo items within the space created between two towers, or, alternatively for some cargo, accepting cargo bolted or strapped to a single upright tower. Items that are particularly conducive to being mounted in cargo posts include a bicycle's front or rear wheel (with the bicycle frame still attached) or skis, snowboards, lumber, ladders or plumbing pipes. The bottom side of the cargo post base plate may include rigid tabs, or threaded passages drilled to accept separate pins, bolts, knobs, locks, or a combination of these devices. The cargo post base plate preferably is mounted on the top surface of the load carrier floor panel, then secured or locked underneath the floor panel using a pin, bolt, knob, padlock or combination of locking mechanisms and fasteners. Once a cargo post is mounted in place on the load carrier body, the user secures or locks various cargo items to the towers and/or the load carrier body directly, using cinching and locking straps or other attachment devices.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Multiple cargo posts can be aligned if necessary to secure longer items within the load carrier body, such as lumber, plumbing pipes or ladders. Cargo items may be held in place between the cargo post upright towers, whether two &#x201c;facing&#x201d; cargo towers are attached to each other or separate but movable near to each other. In other words, the opposing towers may be two portions of a single unit that fixed in relation to one another or that are adjustable in proximity to one another. Or, the opposing towers may be separate units that are moveable toward or away from each other as needed. One or more of these options will serve well to allow the user to secure almost any-size cargo item firmly between the towers. Either of these types of cargo posts and towers, and especially the type wherein opposing towers are separate but moveable, may be movable in a track system provided in the load carrier body. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref> show an embodiment with cargo posts that comprise a single tower per cargo post slide across the floor panel of the load carrier body by means of a track system. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref> also includes cargo posts wherein the tower <b>287</b> is rigidly connected to its respective base plate <b>297</b> (as in right-most cargo posts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, and as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref> also includes cargo posts wherein the tower <b>288</b> is pivotal relative to its base plate <b>296</b> to a flattened storage position (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref>, <b>18</b>, left two and center two cargo posts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref> also illustrate depending hook assemblies that allow suspension of cargo from edges of the load carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The load carrying system has a number of advantages over prior vehicle cargo load carrying systems. With conventional mounts, a cargo-specific bicycle mount directly attached to a vehicle's load bars limits the user to carrying only a bicycle in that particular mount. And, the removal of one of a bicycle's wheels is often required to use conventional load bar bicycle mounts. To carry skis, a separate conventional ski mount typically needs to be mounted to the vehicle's load bars. For a user to carry other cargo items on their load bars, such as snowboards, or a kayak, the purchase of separate, cargo-specific components, requiring additional cost, is common.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When these conventional mounts are not in use, but left in place on the vehicle load bars, the cargo-carrying capacity of the vehicle is limited to securing alternate cargo items to the available space remaining along its load bars, again leaving the vehicle's rooftop exposed and susceptible to potential damage from cargo items during loading, unloading and transport.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Mounting a conventional cargo container directly to a vehicle's load bars often prevents the user from simultaneously carrying bulky or awkward cargo that does not fit within the mounted cargo container, such as large luggage bags, watercraft, or bulky items such as furniture or spare vehicle tires.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When using a conventional basket-style rack, cargo must be additionally secured with conventional devices such as bags, cargo nets, tarps, straps or rope. Attaching a cargo-specific mount directly to a basket style rack can limit the cargo carrying capacity within the basket. In the case of some conventional ski mounts for basket style racks, the rooftop mounted skis can prevent the user from carrying additional items within the basket, namely items that are taller than the sides of the basket.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the case of some conventional basket rack bicycle mounts, the removal of one of the bicycle's wheels is often required.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The preferred embodiments of the invented load carrying system address many or all of the above-mentioned shortcomings. The inter-fitting design of the components within the load carrier body enables the user to optimize available rooftop cargo space, transporting a combination of cargo items of different types and sizes within a versatile rooftop cargo carrying system.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">There are a number of available products well suited for use in conjunction with the preferred embodiments. All-in-one cinching and locking cables/straps can help prevent unintentional detachment of cargo items secured to the load carrier, when compared with conventional tie-down devices. Using adjustable tension, the user cinches and locks these cables or straps&#x2014;and the cargo items&#x2014;securely into place anywhere on the load carrier body.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Another available product well-suited to the present invention is a removable tire step, which can be suspended over a vehicle's tires, creating a raised platform for easier loading and unloading of cargo to and from the load carrier body, cargo container, and cargo posts.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Now referring specifically to the drawings:</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the preferred embodiment of one embodiment of the invention, load carrier body <b>10</b>. It may be comprised of a number of materials and a combination of materials, including metals such as aluminum or steel, and high impact plastics, depending upon the size, shapes and weight of cargo items being transported.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Load carrier body <b>10</b> can be a single unit, as a product of plastic injection molding, or it can comprise panels or pieces welded together, as a product of metal fabrication. Load carrier body <b>10</b> includes a generally solid and continuous planar floor panel <b>12</b>, adjoining backwardly sloping front end wall <b>16</b>, which is angled toward the center of load carrier body <b>10</b> at approximately 20-60, and more preferably 30-50 degrees. Also adjoining floor panel <b>12</b> is sloping rear end wall <b>18</b>, which is angled away from the center of load carrier body <b>10</b> at approximately 120-160, and more preferably 130-150 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">At the top of front end wall <b>16</b> and rear end wall <b>18</b> is a lip or flange structure, called hereafter &#x201c;end wall top rail <b>24</b>&#x201d;. Each top rail <b>24</b> is a rigid beam, with one being affixed preferably to the top edge of front end wall <b>16</b> and one affixed preferably to rear end wall <b>18</b>, along the entire length of wall <b>16</b> and wall <b>18</b>. Each top rail <b>24</b> is preferably parallel to the plane of the floor panel <b>12</b>, and forms a flat, top surface on front end wall <b>16</b> and rear end wall <b>18</b>. Top rail <b>24</b> may include top rail passages <b>34</b>, which are passages drilled to facilitate attachment of tie-down devices, including bungee straps and hooks.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Also adjoining floor panel <b>12</b> are left side wall <b>20</b> and right side wall <b>22</b>, which upend from load carrier body <b>10</b> and may include side wall top rail <b>26</b> in their design. Each of the top rails <b>26</b> is a lip/flange that extends from the top edge of its respective side wall, at or approximately perpendicularly to the plane of its respective generally vertical side wall. Thus, the flat top surface of side top rail <b>26</b> may be created by bending the edge of either side wall at a right angle, away from the interior of load carrier body <b>10</b>, creating a flat top rail surface between &#xbd; to 4 inches wide. The edge of this top rail surface is preferably again bent at a right angle, thus creating a downwardly-depending narrow lip portion to facilitate the attachment of tie-down hooks, clasps, or other tie-down devices.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Top rails <b>26</b> may include top rail passages <b>34</b>, located at various locations along the length of top rail <b>26</b>. Top rail passages <b>34</b> are approximately &#x215b; to &#xbe; inches in diameter, drilled through top rail surface <b>26</b> to facilitate attachment of tie-down devices such as bungee straps and hooks.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Top rail <b>26</b> may be fitted with an edge or rail trim of rubber or plastic molding reinforced with a pliable metal infrastructure. The rail trim grips and covers the overhanging edge of top rail <b>26</b>, creating a buffer/cushion between the top rail surface and cargo items that come into contact with it, especially when a user is lifting or sliding said cargo items onto the load carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Cut throughout load carrier floor panel <b>12</b> are floor panel large passages <b>28</b>, which are approximately 1-4 inches in diameter. Floor panel small passages <b>30</b> are placed within &#xbd; inch to 3 inches of floor panel large passage <b>28</b>, orbiting large passages <b>28</b>, as seen to best advantage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 3</figref>. Floor panel small passages <b>30</b> are approximately &#x215b; inch to 1 inch in diameter. Both floor panel large passages <b>28</b> and small passages <b>30</b> serve as tie-down attachment points along floor panel <b>12</b>. Attachment tie-down devices including ropes or straps, or cinching and locking steel cables <b>86</b>, and cinching and locking steel straps <b>124</b>, may be threaded and routed between floor panel large passages <b>28</b>. The small passages will often be used for the hooks of bungee cords, or smaller cables or fasteners. Bungee cords will typically utilize both floor panel large passage <b>28</b> and floor panel small passage <b>30</b> simultaneously, as the cords will be passed through the large passages <b>28</b> and around cargo, and their attached hooks will be inserted through the small passages <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The positioning of floor panel large passages <b>28</b> in pairs forms a &#x201c;bridge&#x201d; between large passages <b>28</b>. These bridges <b>38</b> serve as large passage anchor points, which are secure anchoring locations for various attachment tie-down devices including straps, cables and rope.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Load carrier front end wall <b>16</b> is sloping, backwardly angled toward the center of load carrier body <b>10</b> at an angle of about 30-50 degrees. Load carrier rear end wall <b>18</b> is sloping, backwardly angled away from the center of load carrier body <b>10</b> at an angle of approximately 130-150 degrees. Both front end wall <b>16</b> and rear end wall <b>18</b> are approximately the same height, about 2-12 inches. The supplementary angles of front end wall <b>16</b> and rear wall <b>18</b> serve to deflect the wind, while sloping rear end wall <b>18</b> helps facilitate loading and unloading of cargo to and from the rear end of load carrier body <b>10</b>. The sloping angles of the front and rear end walls also facilitate securing cargo components, including cargo container <b>52</b>, into position on load carrier body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In alternative embodiments, rear end wall <b>18</b> may be constructed as upright. Rear end wall <b>18</b> can also include a hinge, or bolt and pin mechanism, along its bottom edge to allow said end wall to swing down, or be removed completely from load carrier body <b>10</b>, allowing loading and unloading of cargo items directly onto floor panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Left side wall <b>20</b> and right side wall <b>22</b> are positioned upright, and are approximately 2-12 inches in height.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A series of mounting brace assemblies, including mounting brace top plate <b>40</b> and mounting brace base plate <b>42</b>, is used to attach load carrier body <b>10</b> to vehicle load bar <b>48</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.) Load bar foot <b>50</b> is an upright post that is attached to, and supports, load bar <b>48</b> on both ends of each load bar <b>48</b>. A minimum of (2) load bars <b>48</b> is required for proper attachment of load carrier body <b>10</b> to a vehicle rooftop.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows an example of a rail pad <b>130</b> being attached to the load carrier front end wall <b>16</b> by rail pad attachment straps <b>132</b>. The rail pad assembly (a watercraft pad version shown) facilitates attachment and transport of longer items placed on load carrier body <b>10</b>, including surfboards, kayaks, and canoes. Various shapes and contours of rail pads may be provided for one or more of the load carrier body walls, ideally to guide the cargo during loading and unloading and cradle and cushion the cargo during transit. Rail pad <b>130</b> and straps <b>132</b> are generally comprised of foam and nylon, serving as a buffer between load carrier body <b>10</b> and various cargo items that the user wishes to protect from scratching or other damage resulting from prolonged contact with hard surfaces. Rail pad straps <b>132</b> may incorporate plastic or metal buckles, snaps, Velcro&#x2122; or other fasteners in their construction.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">To secure rail pad <b>130</b> to load carrier body <b>10</b>, the user positions the concave interior portion of the pad over the load carrier end wall top rail <b>24</b> or side wall top rail <b>26</b>, then routes or loops one buckled end&#x2014;the &#x2018;male&#x2019; or &#x2018;female&#x2019; end&#x2014;of rail pad strap <b>132</b>, through load carrier wall small passage <b>36</b>. The end of strap <b>132</b> is then fastened to its complimentary &#x2018;male&#x2019; or &#x2018;female&#x2019; buckled end of rail pad strap <b>132</b>. The user then cinches said strap, and pad, tightly to the load carrier wall, thus securing rail pad <b>130</b> to load carrier body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Large passages <b>32</b> provided in the upending walls of the carrier body may also be utilized in the fastening of rail pad <b>130</b> to load carrier <b>10</b>. Once rail pad <b>130</b> is secured to load carrier body <b>10</b>, an additional attachment device, such as cinching steel cable locking strap <b>124</b>, can be used to lock cargo items directly to load carrier body <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Cinching and locking strap <b>124</b> may also be incorporated into the design of rail pad strap <b>132</b>, to facilitate securing and locking of cargo items to load carrier body <b>10</b> without requiring an additional attachment or tie-down device.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a close-up perspective of load carrier body <b>10</b> attached to a vehicle load bar <b>48</b>, utilizing a mounting brace assembly. Mounting brace bolt <b>46</b> is first routed through mounting brace top plate <b>40</b>, through the top side of floor panel <b>12</b>, passing underneath floor panel <b>12</b> and around load bar <b>48</b>, passing through mounting brace base plate <b>42</b>, and finally secured with mounting brace fastener <b>44</b>. Mounting brace bolt <b>46</b> can also be routed upward from underneath floor panel <b>12</b>, passing through mounting brace base plate <b>42</b>, around load bar <b>48</b>, through floor panel <b>12</b>, through mounting brace top plate <b>40</b>, and finally secured atop floor panel <b>12</b> with mounting brace fastener <b>44</b>. Fastener <b>44</b> may be a nut, wing nut, butterfly nut or other fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the preferred embodiment, mounting brace top plate <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) is generally flat and recessed into floor panel <b>12</b>. Mounting brace top plate <b>40</b> and mounting brace base plate <b>42</b> secure vehicle load bar <b>48</b> between them. Mounting brace base plate <b>42</b> is generally curved to contour the shape of load bar <b>48</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In alternative embodiments, a locking mechanism can be incorporated into the mounting brace assembly, locking load carrier body <b>10</b> to load bar <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a close-up of load carrier left side wall <b>20</b>, and the underside of load carrier floor panel <b>12</b>. The large passages <b>32</b> are cut into load carrier body side walls and end walls. The preferred embodiment of these large passages <b>32</b> is oval or round in shape, to reduce pinching and friction exerted upon cargo tie-down devices, such as nylon straps or rope. Large passages <b>32</b> are approximately 2-6 inches in length and &#xbd; to 3 inches in width.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Small passages <b>36</b> are also provided in the load carrier body walls, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>3</b>, and are generally oval or round in design. Small passages <b>36</b> may accept the rail pad attachment straps <b>132</b> discussed earlier, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The small passages <b>36</b> are preferably at or very near the plane of the floor panel, and therefore serve well as drainage sites for rainwater atop load carrier body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one or more floor panel hat channel <b>14</b> is/are preferably affixed to the underside of floor panel <b>12</b>, but hat channels <b>14</b> may alternatively or additionally be affixed to the upper surface of floor panel <b>12</b>. Hat channels <b>14</b> are bracing beams that extend the length and/or width of floor panel <b>12</b>. Each hat channel <b>14</b> extends approximately &#x2153; to 3 inches from the surface to which it is affixed, and about 2 to 8 inches wide. Hat channel <b>14</b> includes slanted edge walls where it adjoins floor panel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Affixing a hat channel <b>14</b> comprised of metal to a metal floor panel <b>12</b> is done by welding or fastening with bolts, rivets or other hardware. The affixing of a high impact plastic hat channel <b>14</b> to a high impact plastic floor panel <b>12</b> is accomplished during the plastic injection molding process, when fabricating load carrier body <b>10</b> as one solid unit. Hat channel <b>14</b> can also be glued or affixed to load carrier body <b>10</b> when floor panel <b>12</b> is made of plastic, using bolts, rivets or other hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Attaching one or more hat channels <b>14</b> to the top or underside of load carrier floor panel <b>12</b> increases the rigidity of floor panel <b>12</b>, enabling heavier loading of cargo items within load carrier body <b>10</b>, thus reducing bowing of floor panel <b>12</b>, compared with a load carrier floor panel <b>12</b> that does not incorporate hat channels <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a rear perspective of load carrier body <b>10</b>, attached to load bars <b>48</b>, with cargo container <b>52</b> secured to/within load carrier body <b>10</b>. To secure container <b>52</b> to load carrier body <b>10</b>, the user slides container <b>52</b> along floor panel <b>12</b> in the center, left or right side of load carrier body <b>10</b>. Sliding container <b>52</b> along floor panel <b>12</b> is facilitated with slide tabs <b>106</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Slide tabs <b>106</b> are comprised of strips, squares or pieces of high impact plastic material, and are mounted to the exterior of container front lower panel <b>60</b> (or &#x201c;nose panel&#x201d; <b>60</b>) with adhesives, rivets or other fastening device. Slide tabs <b>106</b> are generally &#xbd; to several inches wide, and attach along the bend/corner where cargo container front panel <b>60</b> adjoins cargo container floor panel <b>56</b>. Slide tabs <b>106</b> can also be mounted to the exterior of cargo container rear lower panel <b>68</b> and riveted, bolted, or adhered along the bend formed where container rear lower panel <b>60</b> adjoins cargo container floor panel <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Container nose <b>60</b> fits snugly under sloping load carrier front end wall <b>16</b>. This &#x201c;interfitting&#x201d; design prevents cargo container <b>52</b> from moving forward when positioned in load carrier body <b>10</b>. Rear lower panel <b>68</b> of cargo container <b>52</b> incorporates the same angle as rear end wall <b>18</b> of load carrier body <b>10</b>. This allows cargo container rear lower panel <b>68</b> to abut load carrier rear end wall <b>18</b>. This &#x201c;interfitting&#x201d; design inhibits container <b>52</b> from moving in reverse when positioned in load carrier body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">To secure and lock cargo container <b>52</b> to load carrier body <b>10</b>, a rear tab <b>92</b> depending from the rear lower panel <b>68</b> is utilized. Tab <b>92</b> is permanently mounted and centered on rear lower panel <b>68</b>. Tab <b>92</b> is generally about &#xbc; inch to several inches in diameter, and may be semi-spherical, rounded, knob-like, bulb-shaped, or other shapes. The tab preferably is sized and shaped to extend through the small passages <b>36</b>. The tab preferably depends a distance that allows a lock to urge the cargo carrier downward against the load carrier rear end wall, or that at least does not allow a lot of leeway for the cargo carrier to &#x201c;jump&#x201d; very far off of the load carrier body. In the preferred embodiment best illustrates in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, tab <b>92</b> is a rounded shape, with tab passage <b>94</b> formed through the midsection of tab <b>92</b>. Passage <b>94</b> is generally &#x215b; inch to &#xbe; inch in diameter to allow for a variety of padlocks, pins, or other locking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">When cargo container <b>52</b> is set into place in load carrier body <b>10</b>, tab <b>92</b> protrudes through chosen load carrier wall small passage <b>36</b>, located along load carrier rear wall <b>18</b>. Small passages <b>36</b> along the lower edge of load carrier rear wall <b>18</b> may be widened or otherwise modified to specifically to accept tab <b>92</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.) Once set in place through rear wall <b>18</b> at small passage <b>36</b>, tab <b>92</b> is fitted with a pin or padlock <b>114</b>, which is routed through tab passage <b>94</b>. Once locked in place, padlock <b>114</b> (or similar pin mechanism) prevents tab <b>92</b> from withdrawing from wall small passage <b>36</b>. In turn, cargo container <b>52</b> is prevented from withdrawing from load carrier body <b>10</b>. The inter-fitting relationship of tab <b>92</b>, rear end wall <b>18</b>, wall small passage <b>36</b> and padlock <b>114</b> prevents cargo container <b>52</b> from sliding vertically or laterally along floor panel <b>12</b> and rear panel <b>18</b>. The result is a secure, interlocking fit of container <b>52</b> within load carrier body <b>10</b>, using one locking mechanism. Alternative embodiments of a locking mechanism can be constructed and mounted directly to load carrier <b>10</b>, to facilitate locking of cargo container <b>52</b> to load carrier body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As mentioned in the paragraph above, modifications to small passages <b>36</b> may be made to enhance cooperation between small passage <b>36</b> and tab <b>92</b>. Tab, and cooperating passages, may be round, oval, cross, x-shape, or crescent shape, for example. This modification may be accomplished by cutting a larger or differently-shaped perimeter to form passage <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the preferred embodiment of cargo container <b>52</b>.

One or more channels/ridges may extend the length of floor panel <b>56</b>, continuing upward, into adjoining front lower panel <b>60</b> and rear lower panel <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The cargo container's front lower panel <b>60</b> and rear lower panel <b>68</b> also incorporate said channel design in their construction, allowing the flow of liquid, such as rainwater, beneath container <b>52</b> and out of load carrier floor panel passages <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and wall small passages <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The container's front end panel upper panel <b>64</b>, and rear upper panel <b>76</b>, may curve or slope at an angle to horizontal, as shown to best advantage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. This curvature makes the container more aerodynamic.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Cargo container <b>52</b> includes a left side wall <b>80</b> and a right side wall <b>84</b> that are positioned upright, and are joined to the container's front lower and rear lower panels. Left side wall <b>80</b> and right side wall <b>84</b> can be continuous and solid, or they can incorporate one or more framed openings in their design to accommodate one or more side access doors <b>96</b>. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, side access doors <b>96</b> are preferably provided on both right and left sides of the container, for access from either the right or left of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">One or more cargo container top access doors <b>88</b> may form the top wall of the container, and/or be provided in a top wall of the container. In the preferred embodiment, one top door <b>88</b> forms all, or substantially all, of the top wall of the container, and, thus, is provided at or near the top of the container's two side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Side access doors <b>96</b> and top access door <b>88</b> may be pivotally connected to the container, using a door hinge <b>90</b> along one edge of each door. Side and top access doors may include door suspension chains <b>104</b> or gas shocks or other struts, affixed to their interiors, to support or suspend the access doors when in the open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Side and top access doors include one or more locking handles <b>98</b>, which are recessed into their respective access doors.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Another preferred feature of container <b>52</b> is drawer <b>100</b>. There can be one or more drawers <b>100</b>, which slide along drawer frame <b>102</b>. Drawer <b>100</b> can be accessed from either side of container <b>52</b> when right and/or left side access doors <b>96</b> are open. Drawer <b>100</b> can be removed to optimize bulk cargo space inside container <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Another feature container <b>52</b> is space separator <b>108</b>, held in place within space separator frame <b>110</b>. Space separator <b>108</b> can be removed to optimize bulk cargo space inside container <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Side access doors <b>96</b> and top access door(s) <b>88</b> can include edge and rail trim <b>112</b>, which may be an overhanging, depending lip and/or may comprise a rubber/polymeric sealing material, along interior edges to impede water from entering container <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Cargo container <b>52</b> includes tote handles <b>122</b> to facilitate lifting and carrying of the container, as well as facilitate the mounting and dismounting of container <b>52</b>, from load carrier body <b>10</b>. Tote handles <b>122</b> can include spring mechanisms to allow said handles to pivot or slide outward when in use and return to a position flush with the container's side walls or end panels when not in use. Tote handles <b>122</b> may also comprise recessed handholds incorporated into the side panels and end panels of container <b>52</b>, which recessed wells or handholds would typically remove the need for pivoting, spring assisted.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a close-up rear perspective of the mechanical relationship between the rear portions of cargo container <b>52</b> and load carrier body <b>10</b>. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the inter-fitting and locking relationship of cargo container rear lower tab <b>92</b>, permanently mounted on container rear lower panel <b>68</b>, designed to fit into load carrier wall small passage <b>36</b>, and be secured by padlock <b>114</b>. One will note that the plane of the rear end wall <b>18</b> matches (is parallel to) the plane of rear lower panel <b>68</b>, that is, wall <b>18</b> and panel <b>68</b> are at the same or nearly the same angle relative to the floor panel <b>12</b>, and container floor panel <b>56</b>, respectively. Also, one will note that the plane of top rail <b>24</b> matches (is parallel to) the plane of panel portion <b>72</b>, that is, the angle of the bend/weld that connect panel <b>68</b> to panel portion <b>72</b> is the same or close to the same as the angle of the bend/weld that connects wall <b>18</b> to rail <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Cargo container front lower panel <b>60</b>, also called the cargo container nose, fits securely under load carrier front end wall <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, while cargo container rear lower panel <b>68</b> simultaneously abuts load carrier rear end wall <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This inter-fitting relationship of load carrier body <b>10</b> and cargo container <b>52</b> accomplishes a secure fit of container <b>52</b> within load carrier body <b>10</b>, minimizing shifting of the container, vibration and noise associated with vehicle movement and wind friction.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Cargo container drainage plug receiver <b>144</b> is a threaded port mounted in cargo container floor panel <b>56</b>, at the rear of container <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Drainage plug <b>142</b> is a push-in or screw-in stopper or insert, comprised of rubber and metal. Plug <b>142</b> is designed to fit into drainage plug receiver <b>144</b>, preventing liquid from entering the container from the container's underside. Plug <b>142</b> can be removed by the user when draining liquid, including water, mud or other debris, from within cargo container <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a close-up perspective of the mechanical relationship between cargo container rear lower panel tab <b>92</b>, permanently mounted to the exterior of cargo container rear lower panel <b>68</b>, and one embodiment of a cargo container tote wheel assembly <b>152</b>. Once secured to tab <b>92</b>, removable tote wheel assembly <b>152</b> enables the user to more easily maneuver and transport container <b>52</b> on the ground, when the container is dismounted from load carrier <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Tote wheel assembly <b>152</b> attaches to cargo container tab <b>92</b> by the following procedure: The top surface of tote wheel block <b>136</b> includes upper passage <b>140</b>, incorporating a concave, molded shape complimentary to tab <b>92</b>, allowing tab <b>92</b> to fit within upper passage <b>140</b>. The top surface of tote wheel block <b>136</b> in turn fits flush against the flat surface of cargo container rear lower panel <b>68</b>. Once the tab is received in wheel block passage <b>140</b>, the user installs tote wheel tab bolt <b>138</b> through upper passage <b>140</b> and tab passage <b>94</b>. A secured fastener <b>120</b>, such as a nut, wing nut or other fastener, is installed on the exposed, protruding end of tab bolt <b>138</b> to retain bolt <b>138</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">One or more tote wheels <b>116</b> are rotatably connected to tote wheel block <b>136</b>. One tote wheel <b>116</b> is secured to one end of suspension rod <b>118</b> by a fastener <b>120</b>. The opposing end of suspension rod <b>118</b> is inserted through tote wheel block <b>136</b> at tote wheel block lower passage <b>146</b>. Suspension rod <b>118</b> protrudes to the exterior of tote wheel block <b>136</b>, where an additional tote wheel <b>116</b> is attached to suspension rod <b>118</b> with a fastener <b>120</b>. Alternative attachment systems may be used to rotatably connect the tote wheels to the cargo container. For example, tote wheels may be mounted independently onto the container. For example, with each wheel and its axle/push-pin may be housed in an independent housing portion or space, wherein said independent housing portions/spaces are preferably at opposite (right and left) sides of the container. Other wheel axle and mounting systems may be used, and the tote wheels may be removable and replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Once secured to container <b>52</b>, tote wheel assembly <b>152</b> enables the user to maneuver and transport container <b>52</b> in a manner similar to maneuvering a wheelbarrow, without an assistant. The user lifts the container's front end, holding onto cargo container tote handles <b>122</b>. As the user pushes or pulls container <b>52</b> over smooth and semi-smooth ground surfaces, the tote wheel assembly <b>152</b> acts as a fulcrum, supporting the container's rear end, bearing the load of container <b>52</b>, facilitating easier movement of the container <b>52</b> when compared with a container without a tote wheel assembly <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a top perspective of load carrier body <b>10</b>, utilizing one embodiment of a cargo post <b>54</b>. When comprised of metal, cargo post <b>54</b> comprises several plates welded together to form one unit. When comprised of plastic, cargo post <b>54</b> can be injection molded to form one unit. As will be discussed later in this document, alternative cargo posts may be provided that comprise multiple towers that are adjustable in position relative to each other. Or, other alternative cargo posts may each comprise only one tower, but the cargo posts are adjustable in position relative to each other to move two &#x201c;facing&#x201d; cargo towers near each other for receiving cargo between the individual towers. Specifically, it is desirable that the cargo not pivot/rotate around an axis parallel to the longitudinal axes of the towers, and the large, flat inner surfaces of the towers prevent such pivoting/rotations. This way, an elongated cargo item may be secured between the towers in an orientation parallel to the length of the load carrier and the vehicle, and not pivot or rotate out of that parallel orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The cargo post towers are preferably plate structures that are longer than they are wide, and much longer and wider than they are thick. The preferred towers have substantial (at least 3 inches) of surface area on their inner surfaces (facing a cooperating tower), so this substantial flat surface area contacts and/or otherwise retains cargo without gouging the cargo and without allowing the cargo to rotate/pivot in the cargo posts.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Cargo post <b>54</b> includes base plate <b>58</b>, which supports two upright towers juxtaposed to one another in parallel, symmetrical formation. Cargo post left side tower <b>148</b> and cargo post right side tower <b>150</b> rise from base plate, with a space provided between the two towers, for accepting cargo items in said space. The cargo may be varying widths, heights and lengths, as long as the width fits in said space. Examples of cargo are a bicycle wheel still mounted on a bicycle <b>126</b>, or skis, ski poles, snowboards, lumber, ladders, plumbing pipes, and various cargo items.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the preferred embodiment, cargo post <b>54</b> includes side small passages <b>74</b>, middle small passages <b>78</b>, and long passages <b>82</b>, located along left side tower <b>148</b> and right side tower <b>150</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. These passages are of various lengths, approximately &#x215b; to &#xbd; inches in diameter. These passages serve as attachment sites for bungee hooks, straps, ropes, or other attachment devices, such as cinching locking cable <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the preferred embodiment, bicycle <b>126</b> is secured and locked to cargo post <b>54</b> utilizing cinching cable lock <b>86</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. To accomplish this, one end of cable lock <b>86</b> is threaded into cargo post middle small passage <b>78</b>, then threaded through the front or rear wheel of bicycle <b>126</b>, then routed through the bicycle's suspension forks and/or around its frame. The cable end is finally threaded into the receiving head of cable lock <b>86</b>, where the excess cable is then cinched tightly and locked into place with a key or combination mechanism. This procedure secures and locks bicycle <b>126</b> to cargo post <b>54</b>, inhibiting movement or detachment of bicycle <b>126</b> from within load carrier body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In alternative embodiments of cargo post <b>54</b>, left side tower and right side tower can be positioned at various distances from one another to &#x2018;squeeze&#x2019; cargo items of varied widths between the opposing towers. In these embodiments, a track system or slots, in which the towers may slide and preferably be locked, is provided in/on the base plate of the cargo post. The track/slot system allows for sliding and securing of one or both towers closer to, or farther from one another, similar to that of a vise, to allow secure positioning of cargo items of various widths between the opposing towers. One of skill in the art will recognize how such a track or slot system may be made, after viewing and reading this disclosure and the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">An especially-preferred embodiment is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref> portray an alternative embodiment of the invented load carrying system, which may include cargo posts that are adjustable in position in a track provided in the load carrying body (tray/platform), cargo posts with towers that are pivotal to be parallel to the top surface of the carrying body, and/or depending hook assemblies that may be used to suspend cargo from edges of the carrying body.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of load carrier <b>200</b>, having floor panel <b>202</b>, front end wall <b>206</b>, rear end wall <b>208</b>, left side wall <b>210</b> and right side wall <b>212</b>. Floor panel <b>202</b> is a generally flat and continuous surface, except that passages are provided for attachment of cargo carrying components and for drainage. The passages, however, account for less than 50 percent of the surface (and preferably less than 25 percent) of the floor panel <b>202</b>, and so the panel <b>202</b> may be called a tray, plan, or platform with passages or apertures, but preferably does not have so many apertures or such large apertures that the panel <b>202</b> may be described as a screen, mesh, frame, or basket. The panel <b>202</b> may be described as a panel or tray wherein the solid structure between the apertures has substantially greater dimensions than the apertures; this way, the panel <b>202</b> may be differentiated from a screen, mesh, frame or basket wherein the bars, strips, rods, crosspieces, sticks, dowels, weave members or other rigid or generally rigid members forming said screen, mesh, frame, or basket, are transversely thinner than the diameter or width of the apertures/spaced between said rigid or generally rigid members.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Cargo items can be secured to floor panel <b>202</b> with cargo posts comprised of cargo post base plates <b>296</b>, <b>297</b> that are connected to cargo post towers <b>288</b>, <b>287</b> (respectively). While cargo posts are only shown connected to track assemblies in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref>, it will be understood from description earlier in this document and from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that cargo posts may be attached in regions of the floor panel other than the track assemblies. In some embodiments, cargo post base plates <b>296</b>, <b>297</b> may be attached to floor panel <b>202</b> over any of the paired floor panel large passages <b>218</b>, for example, passages <b>218</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 32</figref>. Cargo post base plate <b>296</b>, <b>297</b> may be mated to floor panel <b>202</b> with the use of a hand tightened bolt <b>280</b> passing from the top surface of cargo post base plate <b>296</b>, through base plate bolt passage <b>308</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) and threaded into a nutsert <b>223</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) or other threaded receptacle fastened to floor panel underside of the floor panel at small passages <b>220</b> or otherwise provide on/in the floor panel.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Before tightening the bolt <b>280</b> relative to the carriage bolt body <b>278</b> of the track system, the user slides the bolt <b>280</b> plus carriage bolt body <b>278</b> along the track to a desired location. Also, before tightening the bolt in body <b>278</b>, cargo post base plate <b>297</b> (or other types of base plates), may rotate because it is in loose engagement with floor panel <b>202</b> and carriage bolt body <b>278</b>; this provides additional adjustment of the orientation and position of the cargo post. After the position of the cargo post along the track system is adjusted and the cargo post is rotated to face the desired direction, the user then tightens hand bolt <b>280</b> to secure the cargo post base plate <b>297</b> (or alternatively plate <b>296</b>) firmly in the desired position upon load carrier floor panel <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">One or several floor panel of the track assemblies <b>268</b> may be welded, fastened or attached, preferably to the underside of the load carrier floor panel <b>202</b>. By providing the components of the track system underneath the floor panel <b>202</b>, the floor panel has few or no upward protrusions that might snag cargo being slid across the floor panel <b>202</b>. For each track assembly <b>268</b> is provided a channel <b>270</b> or other slot cut through floor panel <b>202</b>. Channel <b>270</b> preferably measures from &#x215b;-1 inch across, allowing for hand tightened bolt <b>280</b> to fit through channel <b>270</b> and engage the components of the floor panel track assembly <b>268</b> that reside underneath the floor panel <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Bolt carriage body <b>278</b>, which may be approximately the size and general shape of a playing domino, slides freely within carriage bolt pocket <b>276</b> created by opposing brackets <b>273</b>, <b>273</b>&#x2032; welded to the underside of load carrier floor panel <b>202</b>. Each of the opposing brackets <b>273</b>, <b>273</b>&#x2032; comprises a 90-degree bend to form the L-shape. Bolt carriage pocket <b>276</b> is not completely housed, as the opposing brackets <b>273</b>, <b>273</b>&#x2032; are spaced apart without their inner edges contacting each other. Thus, pocket <b>276</b> is open at its bottom (understandable by rotating the bottom view, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, 180 degrees so that the track assembly is positioned as it is during use). This open bottom of the track assembly allows the end of hand-tightened bolt <b>280</b> to thread or pass through bolt carriage body <b>278</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. This open-bottomed, and preferably partially-open-ended, L-bracket <b>273</b>, <b>273</b>&#x2032; system for track assembly <b>268</b> prevents water, snow or debris collected on floor panel <b>202</b> from clogging floor panel track assembly <b>268</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Bolt carriage pocket <b>276</b> comprises stops at each end of the pocket, preferably in the form of carriage stop hardware <b>286</b>, such as a removable bar, shaft, or other member that extends transversely between the L-brackets <b>273</b>, <b>273</b>&#x2032;. Removing carriage stop hardware <b>286</b> allows the user to remove or insert bolt carriage body <b>278</b> from, or into, bolt carriage pocket <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The distance between opposing cargo post towers (<b>288</b> at the left of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, and <b>287</b> at the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) is set depending upon the width of the cargo items being secured, because each tower is connected to its own separate base plate, rather than two towers being fixed and immovable on a common base plate. Thus, the towers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-39</figref> can be adjusted by sliding their respective cargo post base plates <b>296</b>, <b>297</b> laterally along the floor panel track assembly <b>268</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Alternatively, the track assembly or additional track assemblies, may be provided parallel to the longitudinal axis of the load carrier <b>200</b> (parallel with the length of the vehicle).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The cargo post towers have apertures <b>294</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) along a longitudinal axis of the tower, and, in at least one tower of each cooperating pair of towers, the apertures <b>294</b> are threaded so that they threadably receive a bolt <b>280</b>. In the right-most pair of cargo posts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> and in the detail view of <b>26</b>, for example, one of the towers <b>288</b> has threaded apertures, while the apertures of the cooperating tower <b>289</b> needs not and preferably does not have threading. One may see in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> that a bolt extends from left to right in the left pair of cargo posts, and from right to left in the right pair of cargo posts; the tower closest to the head of the bolt need not be threaded.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Friction between the underside of cargo post base plate <b>296</b>, <b>297</b> and floor panel <b>202</b> may reduced by using cargo post base plate cover/cushion <b>298</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>), which may be made of UHMW plastic or other abrasion-resistant material, which material preferably has a slick/low-friction surface for contacting the floor panel <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>, cargo post hinge assembly <b>300</b> connects cargo post tower <b>288</b> to cargo post base plate <b>296</b>, using cargo post hinge attachment hardware <b>302</b> and cargo post hinge attachment passages <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The preferred position of each tower <b>288</b> relative to its base plate <b>296</b>, when securing cargo items such as snowboard <b>232</b>, is in an upright position, preferably about 90 degrees to the base plate <b>296</b>. Cargo post tower hinge stop tab <b>306</b> prevents cargo post tower <b>288</b> from inclining at greater than an approximately 90-degree angle, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref>. Preferably the hinge assembly <b>300</b> is adapted to allow the tower to swing between an upright, in-use position and a lowered storage position, which are preferably about 90 agrees (typically 85-95 degrees) apart, with a bracing feature to hold the tower in the upright position when desired. Preferably, the hinge assembly is not adapted to allow the tower to be adjusted to various positions between the upright position and the storage position; in other words the hinge assembly is typically not an adjustment for fitting various types of cargo, but is for employing the tower or storing the tower in two positions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Cargo post tower cover <b>301</b> may be provided, and is preferably a thin piece of UHMW plastic or other abrasion resistant, cushioning or otherwise protective material. A cover <b>301</b> may be mounted to one or both sides of cargo post tower <b>288</b> to protect cargo items from damage during loading and especially during transport.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Pivotal cargo post towers <b>288</b> can be positioned flat when not in use, by pivoting the towers <b>288</b> relative to their base plates <b>296</b>, and, hence, relative to the floor panel <b>202</b>. This may be accomplished by using cargo post hinge assembly <b>300</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. When in the flat storage position, cargo post towers <b>288</b> can be secured to the floor panel with common attachment devices including bungee strap with hook end <b>230</b>. When cargo post towers <b>288</b> are positioned flat and secured to floor panel <b>202</b>, air friction over load carrier <b>200</b> and cargo posts <b>288</b> is reduced, compared to transporting cargo post towers <b>288</b> in an upright position upon floor panel <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>19</b>, and <b>36</b>-<b>39</b> show to best advantage two embodiments of a depending suspension assembly, also called a &#x201c;rail bracket assembly&#x201d;. Rail bracket assembly <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>) is a generally J-hook-shaped assembly, while rail bracket assembly <b>264</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref>, <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>) is a generally L-hook-shaped assembly. The upper portions of the assemblies may be the same, and the lower portions (the hooks) may be interchangeable in the upper portions.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The upper portion of both assembly <b>310</b> and assembly <b>264</b> may be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 39</figref>. The upper portion may be constructed of one contiguous or molded piece of metal, mold or composite, or may be constructed of separate plates/members connected together by conventional means such as welding. Top plate <b>240</b> is attached to rear plate <b>246</b>, which is attached to bottom plate <b>238</b> and left and right side plates <b>248</b>. One or more panel passages <b>250</b> may be cut or otherwise provided in these plates to facilitate cargo attachment devices such as a bungee strap or ratchet strap.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Top plate <b>240</b> of the upper portion of assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b> may be fastened to the underside of load carrier top rail <b>214</b> using rail bracket top plate attachment hardware <b>244</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). When an assembly <b>264</b>, <b>310</b> is attached to load carrier <b>200</b>, side plates <b>248</b> extend outward beyond top rail <b>214</b> and left side wall <b>210</b> and right side wall <b>212</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 21</figref>. The load carrier body is sized so that its top rails <b>214</b> and the left and right sides walls <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> preferably do not extend out past the farthest-left and farthest-right extremities of the vehicle. Said rails <b>214</b> and walls <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> are located so that their footprint (viewed from the top) is about the same or slightly less than the top surface of the roof. For example, the footprint of the cargo carrier (except for the assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b>) is inside (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>), matching, or only very slightly beyond the outer perimeter of the roof VR (or truck-bed, as the case may be). On the other hand, assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b> (and especially the upper portions of the assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b>), are sized and positioned so that the assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b> extend out past the perimeter (RP) of the roof (particularly, past the farthest-left and farthest-right extremities of the vehicle) and below the perimeter (and the horizontal plane, RPL in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) of the rooftop. This enables large cargo items such as kayak <b>238</b> or ladder <b>236</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b>), to be carried and secured in the assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b> far enough away from the vehicle that damage to either cargo or vehicle is prevented. In other words, contact between cargo and vehicle during loading, unloading, and especially during transport of cargo items (particularly on rough roads) is prevented or avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Hook housing <b>252</b> is located at a lower end of the upper portion of assemblies <b>264</b>, <b>310</b>, for slidably receiving the upper portion/shaft <b>256</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>). The shaft <b>256</b> may be secured in the housing <b>252</b>, for example, by a lock pin <b>260</b> inserted through pin passages <b>254</b> of the housing <b>252</b> and through any of several passages <b>258</b> through shaft <b>256</b>. Thus, the length of the hook is adjustable relative to the upper portion of the assembly. On the ends of both hooks, of assemblies <b>264</b> and <b>310</b>, is a terminal end eyelet <b>266</b>, intended to receive attachment devices including bungee strap <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 19</figref>) to assist in securing cargo items to the assembly bracket assemblies <b>310</b> and <b>264</b>, and hence to load carrier <b>200</b>. The end of bungee strap <b>230</b> that opposes that in eyelet <b>266</b> may hook to passages <b>226</b> or wall passages <b>224</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, ends of kayak <b>228</b> may be connected to load carrier <b>200</b> using rail bracket assembly <b>310</b>. Assembly <b>310</b> may be made from one piece of molded metal, preferably steel or heavy aluminum, or several pieces welded or formed together. As best illustrated in, and understood from, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, the rail bracket top plate fits snugly underneath load carrier top rail <b>214</b>, abutting against load carrier left side wall <b>210</b> or right side wall <b>212</b>, and abutting the overhanging edge of load carrier top rail <b>216</b>. Cargo hook bottom J-shaped section <b>262</b> is designed to cradle and carry cargo items with round shaped ends, such as kayak <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As best illustrated in, and understood from, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref>, <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, L-shaped rail bracket assembly <b>264</b> is designed to cradle and carry cargo items with square shaped ends, such as ladder <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The preferred embodiments provide a versatile system for carrying a variety of cargo items. Unlike prior art systems, the load carrier body incorporates passages in its design that accept configurable, versatile cargo containers that lock to the load carrier body, as well as cargo posts designed and movable to accept a wide range of cargo items. Thus, rather than being only cargo-specific in nature, the cargo carrying system is adaptable and adjustable, due to its many apertures and its interfitting and movable components.</p>
