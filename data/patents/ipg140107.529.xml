<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a surface cleaning apparatus that delivers cleaning fluid to a surface to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Extractors are well-known devices for deep cleaning carpets and other fabric surfaces, such as upholstery. Most carpet extractors comprise a fluid delivery system and a fluid recovery system. The fluid delivery system typically includes one or more fluid supply tanks for storing a supply of cleaning fluid, a fluid distributor for applying the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned, and a fluid supply conduit for delivering the cleaning fluid from the fluid supply tank to the fluid distributor. The fluid recovery system usually comprises a recovery tank, a nozzle adjacent the surface to be cleaned and in fluid communication with the recovery tank through a working air conduit, and a source of suction in fluid communication with the working air conduit to draw the cleaning fluid from the surface to be cleaned and through the nozzle and the working air conduit to the recovery tank. An example of an extractor is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237 to Kasper et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The U.S. Pat. No. 6,158,081 to Kasen et al. discloses an upright extraction cleaner that has a clean water tank and a detergent tank. A variable solution mixing valve is connected between the outlets from the two tanks and a fluid distributor to create cleaning solution mixtures of variable constituent ratios. A control knob on the outside of the water extraction cleaning machine is connected to the variable solution mixing valve to vary the size of one of the detergent fluid inlet and the clean water inlet so that the ratio of constituent elements can be altered depending upon the cleaning application.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A surface cleaning apparatus according to the invention comprises a housing and a fluid delivery system mounted to the housing. The fluid delivery system includes a first fluid supply tank for holding a supply of a first fluid; a at least one additional or second fluid supply tank for holding a supply of at least one second fluid different than the first fluid; a dispenser for distributing at least one of the first and second fluids from the respective first and second supply tanks to the surface to be cleaned; and a mixing manifold having an inlet for the first fluid, at least two selectively controllable valved inlets for the second fluid, and an outlet coupled to the dispenser, wherein the proportion of the at least one second fluid delivered to the dispenser can be selectively controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment, the valved inlets are of different size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the valved inlets each include an electrically controlled valve. The housing can comprise a base and a handle mounted to the base, and the handle can have at least one switch electrically connected to the electronically controlled valves. The at least one switch can be mounted on at least one of a front surface of the handle adjacent to a grip on the handle and an upper portion of the handle adjacent to the grip on the handle. Optionally, the electrically controlled valve comprises a shape memory alloy actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the valved inlets each include a mechanically controlled valve. The surface cleaning apparatus can further comprise a knob rotatably mounted to the housing and coupled to the mechanically controlled valves to control operation of each of the mechanically controlled valves. The knob can comprise a cam surface coupled to the mechanically controlled valves for controlling the operation of each of the mechanically controlled valves. The cam surface can be configured to simultaneously control the mechanically controlled valves.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment, the first fluid is water, and the second fluid is a detergent.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the mixing manifold further comprises between the inlets and the outlet a mixing chamber where the first and second fluids supplied through the inlets mix to form a mixture that flows through the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another embodiment, the proportion of the second fluid delivered to the dispenser through the valved inlets can be controlled to provide three discrete, increasing amounts of the second fluid that mix with a given amount of the first fluid for light, normal, and heavy cleaning modes. The mixing manifold can comprise two of the valved inlets of different size, one being a smaller valved inlet for flow therethrough of a relatively small amount of the second fluid and one being a larger valved inlet for flow therethrough of a relatively large amount of the second fluid as compared to the relatively small amount of the second fluid, whereby the second fluid flows through only the smaller valved inlet in the light cleaning mode, the second fluid flows through only the larger valved inlet in the normal cleaning mode, and the second fluid flows through both the smaller and the larger valved inlets in the heavy cleaning mode. In one embodiment, the fluid fluid is water, and the second fluid is a detergent. Optionally, in one embodiment, none of the second fluid flows through the valved inlets in a rinse mode such that only water is delivered to the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment, the mixing manifold comprises two of the valved inlets, each having a metering orifice. The metering orifices can be of different sizes for controlling the proportion of the second fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the surface cleaning apparatus further comprises between the first fluid supply tank and the mixing manifold an in-line fluid heater that heats the first fluid supplied from the first fluid supply tank to the mixing manifold.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring now to the drawings and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, an upright extractor <b>10</b> according to the invention comprises a housing having a foot assembly <b>12</b> for movement across a surface to be cleaned and a handle assembly <b>14</b> pivotally mounted to a rearward portion of the foot assembly <b>12</b> for directing the foot assembly <b>12</b> across the surface to be cleaned. The extractor <b>10</b> includes a fluid delivery system for storing cleaning fluid and delivering the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned and a fluid recovery system for removing the spent cleaning fluid and dirt from the surface to be cleaned and storing the spent cleaning fluid and dirt. The components of the fluid delivery system and the fluid recovery system are supported by at least one of the foot assembly <b>12</b> and the handle assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the foot assembly <b>12</b> comprises a base assembly <b>20</b> that supports a recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> at a forward portion thereof, forward being defined as relative to the mounting location of the handle assembly <b>14</b> on the foot assembly <b>12</b>, and a solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> at a rearward portion thereof. Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> comprises a tank housing <b>30</b> with an open top covered by a removable lid <b>70</b> and an open bottom sealed by a bottom plate <b>38</b> having a central aperture <b>40</b>. Together, the tank housing <b>30</b> and the bottom plate <b>38</b> form a recovery chamber <b>32</b> sized to receive a flexible cleaning fluid supply assembly <b>43</b> comprising a flexible bladder <b>44</b> having an inlet funnel <b>47</b> on an upper surface thereof and an outlet (not shown) on an opposite, lower surface and defining a cleaning fluid supply chamber <b>45</b>. The flexible bladder <b>44</b> is utilized as a cleaning fluid supply tank. A suitable bladder <b>44</b> is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237 to Kasper et al., which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The tank housing <b>30</b> comprises a funnel receiver <b>50</b> located at the open top for capturing the inlet funnel <b>47</b> and thereby securing an upper portion of the cleaning fluid supply assembly <b>43</b> within the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. The tank housing <b>30</b> further includes a pair of first and second bladder positioning members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> that protrude a predetermined distance into the recovery chamber <b>32</b> for, along with the funnel receiver <b>50</b>, limiting vertical movement of the bladder <b>44</b> within the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. The bladder outlet (not shown) is aligned with the central aperture <b>40</b> in the bottom plate <b>38</b> and is secured to a valve mechanism <b>48</b> in the central aperture <b>40</b> for controlling flow of the cleaning fluid from the cleaning fluid supply chamber <b>45</b> of the bladder <b>44</b> and for securing the bladder <b>44</b> to the bottom plate <b>38</b> in the manner described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237 to Kasper et al. The bottom plate <b>38</b> also includes a downwardly projecting tank leveling member <b>42</b>, whose purpose will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, a float chamber <b>57</b> is formed by a pair of spaced L-shaped, opposed vertical float walls <b>56</b> projecting inward towards the recovery chamber <b>32</b> from a sidewall of the tank housing <b>30</b> to slidingly receive a float <b>60</b>, as best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8A</figref>. The float <b>60</b> comprises a generally flat L-shaped upper portion <b>62</b> and a buoyant rectangular lower portion <b>64</b>. The lower portion <b>64</b> is captured within the float chamber <b>57</b> by the float walls <b>56</b>, while the upper portion <b>62</b> extends above the lower portion <b>64</b> and out of the float chamber <b>57</b> between the float walls <b>56</b>. The float walls <b>56</b> and the float <b>60</b> are sized to accommodate vertical movement of the float <b>60</b> within the float chamber <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring now to FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>A-<b>10</b>B, the tank housing <b>30</b> has an elongated vertical recess <b>34</b> formed in a rear wall thereof and a tank latch <b>36</b> mounted in the recess <b>34</b> for releasably securing the lid <b>70</b> to the tank housing <b>30</b> with a sealing gasket assembly <b>58</b> therebetween. The tank latch <b>36</b> is preferably an over-center latch having a body <b>35</b> with an upper hook portion <b>37</b> and a lower grip portion <b>33</b>, and the latch <b>36</b> is movably mounted to the tank housing <b>30</b> through a pivot member <b>39</b>. In one embodiment, the sealing gasket assembly <b>58</b> is formed by a commonly know resilient elastomeric rope material that is placed between the tank housing <b>30</b> and the tank lid <b>70</b>. In another embodiment, the sealing gasket assembly <b>58</b> is a single piece formed of a resilient elastomeric material to effectively seal the recovery chamber <b>32</b> from air and water leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The lid <b>70</b> has a depending locking flange <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) on a rear, lower portion thereof that is received in the recess <b>34</b> of the tank housing <b>30</b> for releasably mating with the tank latch <b>36</b> when the lid <b>70</b> is connected to the tank housing <b>30</b>. The locking flange <b>68</b> terminates at a hook <b>69</b> sized to receive the hook portion <b>37</b> on the tank latch <b>36</b>. To release the tank latch <b>36</b>, the user pulls the grip portion <b>33</b> and pivots the body <b>35</b> about the pivot member <b>39</b> until the body <b>35</b> reaches an over-center position and the hook portion <b>37</b> disengages from the hook <b>69</b>. In this condition, the tank latch <b>36</b> is unlatched from the hook <b>69</b>, and the lid <b>70</b> can be removed from the tank housing <b>30</b>. To lock the lid <b>70</b> to the tank housing <b>30</b>, the hook portion <b>37</b> is aligned with the hook <b>69</b>, and the user pivots the grip portion <b>33</b> about the pivot member <b>39</b> towards the tank body <b>30</b> until the body <b>35</b> reaches the over-center position and snaps into a latched condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>B, and <b>9</b>, the lid <b>70</b> further comprises a pair of flanges <b>72</b> on an upper surface thereof for pivotally mounting a recovery tank handle <b>74</b> that can be used to transport the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> to and from the extractor <b>10</b>. A cavity <b>76</b> formed in an upper surface of the lid <b>70</b> has a generally straight section <b>78</b> that extends from the rear of the lid <b>70</b> and merges with a generally circular section <b>80</b> near a front portion of the lid <b>70</b>. The cavity <b>76</b> has an open top and is bounded on all other sides, except for an opening in a left side wall (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>B) of the straight section <b>78</b> to form a tank inlet <b>82</b> in fluid communication with the recovery chamber <b>32</b> when the lid <b>70</b> is mounted to the tank housing <b>30</b>. The lid <b>70</b> also includes a tank outlet <b>84</b> formed in the rear wall thereof and adjacent to the cavity <b>76</b>. A tank outlet conduit <b>122</b> is mounted to the rear of the lid <b>70</b> at the tank outlet <b>84</b> and has an inlet <b>124</b> that mates with the tank outlet <b>84</b> and a downward facing outlet <b>126</b> oriented orthogonal to the inlet <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The lid <b>70</b> supports a generally horizontal separator plate <b>116</b> beneath the cavity <b>76</b> and the tank outlet <b>84</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8B</figref>, the separator plate <b>116</b> extends beyond the cavity <b>76</b> on both sides of the generally straight section <b>78</b> and mates with a baffle <b>86</b>. The baffle <b>86</b> extends down from an upper portion of the lid <b>70</b> and forward from a rear wall of the lid <b>70</b> to join with the circular section <b>80</b> of the cavity <b>76</b> to form an outlet chamber <b>88</b> between the baffle <b>86</b>, the right wall (relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8B</figref>) of the cavity <b>76</b>, the separator plate <b>116</b>, and the upper portion of the lid <b>70</b>. The tank outlet <b>84</b> is positioned in the rear wall of the lid <b>70</b> such that it is in fluid communication with the outlet chamber <b>88</b> and functions as an outlet for the outlet chamber <b>88</b>. The baffle <b>86</b> has an inlet opening <b>87</b> that functions as an inlet for the outlet chamber <b>88</b> and mounts a screen <b>118</b> that prevents undesirable particles from entering the outlet chamber <b>88</b>. The separator plate <b>116</b> supports a lower portion of the screen <b>118</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and also supports a float door <b>120</b> rotatably mounted thereto through a pivot pin <b>119</b> and sized to cover the screen <b>118</b>. Because the pivot pin <b>119</b> is off-center from the center of mass of the float door <b>120</b>, the float door <b>120</b> naturally rotates clockwise relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to a normally open position. However, the float door <b>120</b> comprises a stop <b>121</b> that contacts a bottom surface of the separator plate <b>116</b> to prevent the float door <b>120</b> from rotating beyond the generally horizontal, open position, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, wherein the float door <b>120</b> does not block access to the screen <b>118</b> and, accordingly, the outlet chamber <b>88</b>. In the open position, the float door <b>120</b> is oriented above the upper portion <b>62</b> of the float <b>60</b>. As fluid level increases in the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, the buoyant float <b>60</b> rises with the rising fluid. At a predetermined fluid level, the upper portion <b>62</b> of the float <b>60</b> contacts a lower surface of the float door <b>120</b> to force the float door <b>120</b> to rotate counterclockwise relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> about the pivot pin <b>119</b>. Once the float door <b>120</b> rotates a predetermined amount, airflow at the tank outlet <b>84</b> draws the float door <b>120</b> to a vertical closed position, whereby the float door <b>120</b> mates with the screen <b>118</b> and closes the opening <b>87</b> to terminate fluid communication between the outlet chamber <b>88</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the internal structure of the lid <b>70</b> forms a circulation path A within the lid <b>70</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. The circulation path A begins at the tank inlet <b>82</b> and moves laterally before flowing down and around the separator plate <b>116</b> and into the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. The circulation path A then proceeds laterally beneath the separator plate <b>116</b> toward the opposite side of the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and flows up and around the opposite side of the separator plate <b>116</b>, through the screen <b>118</b>, and into the outlet chamber <b>88</b>. The circulation path A then flows out of the outlet chamber <b>88</b> through the tank outlet <b>84</b> and into the tank outlet conduit <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>10</b>A, and <b>10</b>B, the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> further comprises a recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> that overlies the lid <b>70</b> and the tank housing <b>30</b> and has an upper portion <b>92</b> and a lower portion <b>94</b> joined together to form an arched fluid flow path therebetween. The recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> has a forward, nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> that terminates at a nozzle conduit inlet <b>98</b> and a rearward, accessory conduit section <b>100</b> that terminates at an accessory conduit inlet <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> is integral with the lid <b>70</b>. In another embodiment, the tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> is selectively removable from the lid <b>70</b> to facilitate cleaning of the tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>. In either embodiment, the arched shape of the inlet conduit <b>90</b> adds structural rigidity to the tank lid <b>70</b> to thereby strengthen the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b>. The nozzle conduit inlet <b>98</b>, when assembled with the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b>, is coplanar with the bottom plate <b>38</b>, and the accessory conduit inlet <b>102</b> aligns with the rear wall of the lid <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> and the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> meet at a circular opening <b>104</b> formed in both the upper portion <b>92</b> and the lower portion <b>94</b>. The circular opening <b>104</b> opens into the cavity <b>76</b> and is in fluid communication with the recovery tank inlet <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A diverter valve <b>106</b> is rotatably mounted within the circular opening <b>104</b> and selectively communicates one of the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> and the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> with the cavity <b>76</b> and thereby the tank inlet <b>82</b>. The diverter valve <b>106</b> comprises a generally circular diverter body <b>108</b> with a gripping handle <b>112</b> and a depending peripheral flange <b>110</b> having a diverter inlet <b>114</b> formed therein. The peripheral flange <b>110</b> resides at least partially within the space between the upper and lower portions <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> of the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> and defines a downwardly facing outlet for the diverter valve <b>106</b>. The diverter valve <b>106</b> can be manually rotated between an accessory cleaning mode and a floor cleaning mode within the circular opening <b>104</b> by rotating the gripping handle <b>112</b>. In the accessory cleaning mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, the diverter inlet <b>114</b> aligns with the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> and fluidly communicates the fluid flow path in the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> with the cavity <b>76</b> and the tank inlet <b>82</b>. Additionally, the peripheral flange <b>110</b> blocks fluid communication between the fluid flow path in the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> and the cavity <b>76</b>. Conversely, in the floor cleaning mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the diverter inlet <b>114</b> aligns with the nozzle conduit section <b>92</b> and fluidly communicates the fluid flow path in the nozzle conduit section <b>92</b> with the cavity <b>76</b> and the tank inlet <b>82</b>. In this mode, the peripheral flange <b>110</b> blocks fluid communication between the fluid flow path in the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> with the cavity <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8A</figref>, the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> further comprises a pair of upper side rails <b>130</b> mounted to opposite sides of the tank housing <b>30</b>. Each upper side rail <b>130</b> is defined by an arcuate front edge <b>132</b> and a rear edge <b>134</b> joined by spaced upper and lower edges <b>136</b>, <b>138</b>. Furthermore, each upper side rail <b>130</b> includes a mount located on an interior surface thereof and comprising a pair of spaced screw boss receivers <b>140</b>A and a positioning flange receiver <b>140</b>B between the screw boss receivers <b>140</b>A. The mount on the upper side rails <b>130</b> mates with a complementary side rail mount located on the exterior of the tank housing <b>30</b> and comprising a pair of screw bosses <b>66</b>A and an elongated positioning flange <b>66</b>B between the screw bosses <b>66</b>A. In particular, the screw boss receivers <b>140</b>A receive the corresponding screw bosses <b>66</b>A, and the positioning flange receiver <b>140</b>B receives the positioning flange <b>66</b>B. To secure the upper side rails <b>130</b> to the tank housing <b>30</b>, screws or other mechanical fasteners are inserted through the screw boss receivers <b>140</b>A and the screw bosses <b>66</b>A from a lower side thereof. The upper side rails <b>130</b> are preferably angled relative to the tank housing <b>30</b> (i.e., the upper and lower edges <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are not parallel to the bottom plate <b>38</b>) and project below the bottom plate <b>38</b>. The upper side rails <b>130</b> facilitate mounting the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> to the base assembly <b>20</b>, as will be described in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>11</b>A, and <b>11</b>B, the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> is removably received by a foot assembly cover <b>26</b> mounted to the base assembly <b>20</b>. The solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> comprises a solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> that defines a solution supply chamber <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). The solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> includes an arcuate depression <b>154</b> in a front wall thereof, a grip depression <b>151</b> in a rear wall thereof to facilitate handling by the user, and an outlet <b>156</b> in a bottom wall thereof. The outlet <b>156</b> receives a valve mechanism <b>158</b> for controlling flow of fluid from the solution supply chamber <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The foot assembly cover <b>26</b> is mounted to a rear portion of the base assembly <b>20</b> through mounting tabs <b>159</b> and conceals various components mounted on the base assembly <b>20</b>, which will be described in detail below. As best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the foot assembly cover <b>26</b> is formed by a generally vertical front wall <b>160</b>, spaced side walls <b>162</b>, each having a semicircular cutout <b>168</b>, and a sloped upper wall <b>164</b> that transitions to a rear wall <b>166</b> having a plurality of cooling air vents <b>313</b> formed therein. A handle retainer <b>180</b> formed at the juncture between one of the side walls <b>162</b> and the upper wall <b>164</b> includes an arcuate detent <b>184</b> positioned in front of a ramp <b>182</b>. The handle retainer <b>180</b> interacts with the handle assembly <b>14</b> to retain the handle assembly <b>14</b> in the upright position, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. The upper wall <b>164</b> and the rear wall <b>166</b> form a cavity <b>165</b> shaped and sized to receive the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>.

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The front wall <b>208</b> and the agitator housing upper wall <b>210</b> define a downwardly facing agitator chamber <b>212</b> sized to receive an agitator assembly <b>214</b>, which will be described in more detail hereinafter. An upper surface of the agitator housing upper wall <b>210</b> includes a pair of spray tip receivers <b>216</b> that removably mount a pair of spray tips <b>218</b> that function as a dispenser for distributing fluid onto the surface to be cleaned. Each spray tip receiver <b>216</b> is formed by a pair of spaced, inclined side walls <b>148</b> joined by a rearward wall <b>149</b> and a forward wall <b>147</b>.

In an alternative embodiment, the working exhaust air can be directed away from the surface to be cleaned, as more fully shown in U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A-17C</figref>, the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> comprises a motor <b>590</b> and a fan <b>592</b>, wherein the motor <b>590</b> drives the fan <b>592</b> to create the working air flow through the extractor <b>10</b>. The fan <b>592</b> has an inlet <b>594</b> centrally located on a downwardly tapering bottom wall <b>597</b> and a plurality of tangential outlets <b>596</b> circumferentially spaced around a peripheral wall <b>598</b>. The outlets <b>596</b> are oriented to direct the working air exhaust in a counterclockwise direction relative to the orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>. The motor <b>590</b> is connected to a top wall <b>599</b> of the fan <b>592</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> further includes a gasket <b>600</b> that surrounds the peripheral wall <b>598</b> of the fan <b>592</b>. As best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the gasket <b>600</b>, which is preferably made of a resilient material, comprises an upper cylindrical wall <b>602</b> joined to a concentric lower cylindrical wall <b>604</b> of a smaller radius by a generally orthogonal step <b>606</b>. The upper cylindrical wall <b>602</b> includes a plurality of arcuate apertures <b>608</b> formed therein and a circumferential flange <b>610</b> disposed on an upper edge thereof. The gasket <b>600</b> further comprises a plurality of circumferentially spaced L-shaped ribs <b>612</b> projecting radially from the upper and lower circular walls <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>. Each rib <b>612</b> has a generally vertical rib <b>614</b> and a generally horizontal rib <b>616</b>. The generally vertical rib <b>614</b> extends from the sealing flange <b>610</b> downwardly along one end of a corresponding one of the arcuate apertures <b>608</b> to a position below the step <b>606</b>, and the generally horizontal rib <b>616</b> extends orthogonally from a lower end of the vertical rib <b>614</b> and along the lower cylindrical wall <b>604</b> a distance slightly less than the length of the corresponding arcuate aperture <b>608</b>. The horizontal rib <b>616</b> of one rib <b>612</b> is spaced from the vertical rib <b>614</b> of an adjacent rib <b>612</b> to form an arcuate opening <b>618</b> therebetween. Further, each horizontal rib <b>616</b> is spaced from the step <b>606</b> to form an arcuate channel <b>620</b> therebetween. The arcuate channel <b>620</b> is in fluid communication with the arcuate opening <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the gasket <b>600</b> surrounds the fan <b>592</b>, as best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17C</figref>, the top, peripheral, and bottom walls <b>597</b>, <b>598</b>, <b>599</b> of the fan <b>592</b> are received between the sealing flange <b>610</b> and the step <b>606</b> to securely hold the fan <b>592</b> and prevent vertical movement thereof. Additionally, the outer arcuate apertures <b>608</b> are in register with the outlets <b>596</b> of the fan <b>592</b> such that the outlets <b>596</b> direct the working air exhaust through the arcuate apertures <b>608</b> and towards the corresponding vertical rib <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> is mounted within the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>, as best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref>, the inlet <b>594</b> in the bottom wall <b>597</b> of the fan <b>592</b> abuts the sealing gasket <b>252</b> on the outlet <b>246</b> of the horizontal conduit <b>244</b>, and the lower cylindrical wall <b>604</b> overlaps but is spaced from the inner peripheral wall <b>242</b> of the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>. The ribs <b>612</b> abut an inner surface of the outer peripheral wall <b>240</b> of the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b> to space the upper cylindrical wall <b>602</b> from the outer peripheral wall <b>240</b>. Furthermore, the sealing flange <b>610</b> rests on an upper edge of the outer peripheral wall <b>240</b> to form a seal therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As a result of this configuration, the gasket <b>600</b> creates a convoluted working air exhaust path between the fan outlets <b>596</b> and the working air exhaust vents <b>250</b> located between the inner peripheral wall <b>242</b> and the outlet <b>264</b> of the horizontal conduit <b>244</b> of the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>. The working air exhaust path, shown with arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17C</figref>, extends from the outlet <b>596</b> and through the arcuate apertures <b>608</b> into a first space <b>622</b> between the upper cylindrical wall <b>602</b> of the gasket <b>600</b> and the outer peripheral wall <b>240</b> of the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>. The first space <b>622</b> is defined vertically between the sealing flange <b>610</b> and the horizontal rib <b>616</b>. The working air exhaust flows toward the vertical rib <b>614</b>, which directs the working air exhaust downward and into the channel <b>620</b> between the step <b>606</b> and the horizontal rib <b>616</b>. The working air exhaust path changes direction and extends along the channel <b>620</b> and through the opening <b>618</b> into a second space <b>624</b> between the lower cylindrical wall <b>604</b> and the outer peripheral wall <b>240</b>. The second space <b>624</b> is defined vertically between the horizontal rib <b>616</b> and the bottom wall <b>202</b> of the base housing <b>190</b>. The working air exhaust flows below a lower end of the lower cylindrical wall <b>604</b> before turning upward between the lower cylindrical wall <b>604</b> and the inner peripheral wall <b>242</b> of the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>. Thereafter, the working air exhaust flows over the inner peripheral wall <b>242</b> and then downward towards the working air exhaust vents <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The gasket <b>600</b> of the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> serves several functions. The convoluted working air path formed by the gasket <b>600</b> reduces fan noise by forcing the working air exhaust to make several turns prior to exiting the extractor <b>10</b> at the working air exhaust vents <b>250</b>. Additionally, the resilient material of the gasket <b>600</b> dampens vibration of the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>. Preferably, the resilient material is a thermoplastic or thermoset rubber, and most preferably, the resilient material is ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) elastomer. The gasket <b>600</b> also holds the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> in a stabile axial position (i.e., a generally vertical position wherein a rotational axis of the fan <b>592</b> is generally perpendicular to the bottom wall <b>202</b> of the base housing <b>190</b>) within the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>. Furthermore, the sealing flange <b>610</b> seals the fan <b>592</b> with the outer peripheral wall <b>240</b> of the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b> to prevent undesired escape of working air exhaust from the motor and fan assembly housing <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>B, the agitator assembly <b>214</b> comprises dual horizontal axis brushrolls <b>280</b> oriented generally parallel to one another and parallel to the front wall <b>208</b> of the base housing <b>190</b>. An axle <b>281</b> extends throught the entire longitudinal axis of each brushroll <b>280</b> and is fixedly mounted to a corresponding axle support <b>265</b> on a corresponding end arm <b>282</b>, <b>286</b> so that the brushrolls <b>280</b> rotate about their respective fixed axles <b>281</b>. The end arms <b>282</b>, <b>286</b> further comprise a pivot boss <b>263</b> at one end thereof. The pivot boss <b>263</b> of each end arm <b>282</b>, <b>286</b> is pivotally attached to the corresponding side wall <b>204</b> of the base housing <b>190</b> on a corresponding end arm pivot pin <b>261</b>. Pivotal movement of the end arms <b>282</b>, <b>286</b> about the pivot pins <b>261</b> is limited in the upward direction by an upper stop <b>267</b> on the side wall <b>204</b> above the pivot pin <b>261</b> and in the downward direction by a lower stop <b>269</b> on the side wall <b>204</b> below the pivot pin <b>261</b>. The assembly comprising the brushrolls <b>280</b>, the axles <b>281</b>, and the end arms <b>282</b>, <b>286</b> forms a structure that maintains horizontal rigidity while minimizing end to end flexing or twisting by allowing the brushrolls <b>280</b> to rotate about the pivot pins <b>261</b> and thereby float over the surface to be cleaned and result in better cleaning performance. Alternatively, the agitator assembly <b>214</b> can be configured for manual height adjustment to accommodate the surface to be cleaned. For example, the brushrolls <b>280</b> should optimally be set at a higher height for a deep plush carpet than for a Berber carpet. Any suitable type of agitator height adjustment mechanism, such as those known for use with vacuum cleaners, can be employed for adjusting the height of the brushrolls <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The agitator assembly <b>214</b> is operably connected to a pinion gear <b>285</b> affixed to a drive shaft <b>284</b> of the agitator motor <b>220</b> through a main drive belt <b>283</b> coupled to a drive gear <b>287</b> on one end of one of the brushrolls <b>280</b>, as is well known in the extractor and vacuum cleaner arts. The motor drive shaft <b>284</b> and the pinion gear <b>285</b> extend through the side wall <b>204</b> of the base housing <b>20</b> for connecting with the main drive belt <b>283</b>. Additionally, the agitator assembly <b>214</b> comprises a brushroll belt <b>289</b> that rotatably couples the brushrolls <b>280</b> to one another so that rotation of the brushroll <b>280</b> connected to the main drive belt <b>283</b> induces rotation of the other brushroll <b>280</b>. Optionally, the brushroll belt <b>289</b> can be adapted to rotate the brushrolls <b>280</b> in the same or opposite directions.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">One advantage of the described dual belt drive system is that twisting of the brushrolls <b>280</b> in a longitudinal direction is minimized and this feature, in combination with the pivoting floating feature previously described, provides more even contact of the brushrolls <b>280</b> across the surface to be cleaned, resulting in improved cleanability. Additional improvements in cleanability are obtained by using two or more brushrolls <b>280</b>, thereby increasing the weight of the agitator assembly <b>214</b> which provides a higher agitation force on the surface to be cleaned, thereby further improving brushroll <b>280</b> engagement with the surface to be cleaned that results in better cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The agitator cavity <b>212</b> is accessible for replacing or repairing the agitator assembly <b>214</b>. An end cap <b>288</b> is removably mounted to each of the base housing <b>190</b> by mechanical fasteners, such as with screws or detents. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>18</b>, the end caps <b>288</b> have an elongated oval shape with curved front and rear ends <b>290</b>, <b>292</b> and carry agitators in the form of stationary, optionally removable edge brushes <b>294</b>.

The locking action of the retaining pin <b>487</b> in the detent <b>184</b> ensures that the accessory conduit fitting <b>483</b> and the accessory conduit connector <b>170</b> are sealingly mated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) when the handle assembly <b>14</b> is in the upright position so that there is not a loss of suction at this juncture when the extractor <b>10</b> is operated in the accessory cleaning mode.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As mentioned above, the extractor <b>10</b> comprises the fluid delivery system for storing the cleaning fluid and delivering the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned. For visual clarity, the various electrical and fluid connections within the fluid delivery system are not shown in the drawings described above but are depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the fluid delivery system comprises the bladder <b>44</b> for storing a first cleaning fluid and the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> of the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> for storing a second cleaning fluid. The first and second cleaning fluids can comprise any suitable cleaning fluid, including, but not limited to, water, concentrated detergent, diluted detergent, and the like. Preferably, the first cleaning fluid is water, and the second cleaning fluid is concentrated detergent. The first and second cleaning fluids are dispensed from the bladder <b>44</b> and the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> through the respective valve mechanisms <b>48</b>, <b>158</b>, which are received by the respective valve seats <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> when the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> and the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>, respectively, are mounted to the base assembly <b>20</b>. Preferably, the valve mechanisms <b>48</b>, <b>158</b> are normally closed, and the valve seats <b>314</b>, <b>318</b> open the valve mechanisms <b>48</b>, <b>158</b> when the valve mechanisms <b>48</b>, <b>158</b> are received by the valve seats <b>314</b>, <b>318</b>.

The mixing manifold <b>510</b> forms a conduit having three inlets and one outlet for fluid communication of the first cleaning fluid between a first fluid inlet <b>510</b>A and an outlet <b>510</b>B and also includes two second cleaning fluid inlets <b>510</b>C, <b>510</b>D corresponding to outlets of the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, respectively, and that communicate with the outlet <b>510</b>B. The second cleaning fluid inlets <b>510</b>C, <b>510</b>D fluidly communicate with the conduit and with the first cleaning fluid in a mixing chamber <b>510</b>E for mixing the first and second fluids. The first cleaning fluid always flows through the mixing chamber <b>510</b>E while the second cleaning fluid is selectively supplied to the mixing chamber <b>510</b>E depending on the operational mode of the metering valve assembly <b>330</b>. The heater <b>222</b> can be any suitable heater that can heat fluids and is preferably an in-line heater. Exemplary valve mechanisms and heaters are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237 and U.S. Patent Application No. 60/521,693, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The second cleaning fluid flows from the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> to a manifold <b>512</b> so that the second cleaning fluid can flow to both the first metering valve <b>332</b> and the second metering valve <b>334</b>. The first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are preferably solenoid valves in electrical communication with the cleaning mode switch <b>390</b>. Alternatively, the first and second metering valves can be mechanically operated valves actuated from either the handle assembly <b>14</b> or the foot assembly <b>12</b>. As stated above, the outlets of the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> have metering orifices (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25D</figref>) of different size that meter the amount of fluid that flows therethrough. Preferably, the first metering valve <b>332</b> has a first metering orifice <b>333</b> that is smaller than a second metering orifice <b>335</b> for the second metering valve <b>334</b> so that a larger amount of fluid can flow through the second metering valve <b>334</b> in a given period of time. In other words, the fluid flows through the second metering valve <b>334</b> at a higher flow rate than though the first metering valve <b>332</b>. The operation of the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> is controlled by the user through the cleaning mode knob <b>384</b> that is operably coupled to the cleaning mode switch <b>390</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25D</figref>, where fluid conduits having fluid flowing therethrough are indicated with relatively thick lines compared to the relatively thin lines utilized to represent fluid conduits without fluid actively flowing therethrough, the user can preferably select from four cleaning modes: a rinse mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>), wherein the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are closed so that none of the second cleaning fluid can flow therethrough; a light cleaning mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>), wherein the first metering valve <b>332</b> is open and the second metering valve <b>334</b> is closed so that the second cleaning fluid can flow through only the first metering valve <b>332</b>; a normal cleaning mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>), wherein the first metering valve <b>332</b> is closed and the second metering valve <b>334</b> is open so that the second cleaning fluid can flow through only the second metering valve <b>334</b>; and a heavy cleaning mode (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25D</figref>), wherein the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are open so that the second cleaning fluid can flow through both the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>. Hence, the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> can be operated to control the concentration of the second cleaning fluid relative to the first cleaning fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">When the cleaning mode knob <b>384</b> is set to one of the light, normal, and heavy cleaning modes, the second cleaning fluid flows through the appropriate metering valve(s) <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> to the mixing chamber <b>510</b>E through one or more of the first and second metering valve fluid inlets <b>510</b>C, <b>510</b>D, depending on the cleaning mode, of the mixing manifold <b>510</b>. In the mixing chamber <b>510</b>E, the second cleaning fluid mixes with first cleaning fluid flowing therethrough. When rinse mode is selected, only the first cleaning fluid flows through the mixing chamber <b>510</b>E. After flowing through the mixing manifold <b>510</b>, the mixture of the first and second cleaning fluids or the first cleaning fluid alone, depending on the selected cleaning mode and hereinafter referred to and the cleaning fluid, flows to the pump assembly <b>234</b>, which pressurizes the cleaning fluid. The pump assembly <b>234</b> is operatively connected to the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> for operation of a primer stack portion thereof, as described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Downstream from the pump assembly <b>234</b>, the cleaning fluid flows through a tee <b>516</b> to deliver the cleaning fluid to the accessory tool handle <b>432</b>, which can be equipped with an accessory tool, such as the power brush accessory tool <b>400</b>, and to deliver the cleaning fluid to the spray tip valve <b>224</b>. The spray tip valve <b>224</b> is also preferably a solenoid valve, but can alternatively be a mechanically operated valve, and is controlled by the trigger switch <b>462</b> in the handle assembly <b>14</b>. When a user depresses the fluid trigger <b>460</b> on the handle assembly <b>14</b>, the trigger switch <b>462</b> opens the spray tip valve <b>224</b> to deliver the cleaning fluid to the spray tips <b>218</b> for dispensation onto the surface to be cleaned. Optionally, the spray tips <b>218</b> can be oriented to dispense the cleaning fluid onto the agitator assembly <b>214</b> for delivering the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned. When the user desires to deliver the cleaning fluid through the accessory tool attached to the accessory tool handle <b>432</b>, the user depresses the accessory tool handle fluid trigger <b>434</b>. As a result of the configuration of the cleaning delivery system, pressurized cleaning fluid is delivered to both the accessory tool and to the spray tips <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As will be recognized by one skilled in the extractor art, various modifications can be made to the fluid delivery system. For example, the heater <b>222</b> and the pump assembly <b>234</b> are optional, or the heater <b>222</b> can be positioned downstream of the pump assembly <b>234</b> either before or after the tee fitting <b>516</b> that directs fluid to the accessory tool handle <b>432</b> and the spray tips <b>218</b>, as indicated in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Additionally, the spray tips <b>218</b> can be replaced with another type of fluid distributor, such as a distribution bar.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, the number of metering valves and corresponding inlets to the mixing manifold <b>510</b> can be increased depending on the desired cleaning modes. For example, adding one metering valve and one inlet to the configuration described above results in three of the metering valves, three of the inlets for the second cleaning fluid, and eight cleaning modes. The first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> can also be replaced by a variable mixing valve, such as that disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237. However, the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are preferred because they advantageously enable formulation of the cleaning fluid with of a controlled and precise concentration of the second cleaning fluid relative to the first cleaning fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, including the first and second metering orifices <b>333</b>, <b>335</b>, and the fluid inlets <b>510</b>C, <b>510</b>D for the second cleaning fluid together form valved inlets for the mixing manifold <b>510</b>. The valved inlets function to meter the amount of the second cleaning fluid that enters the mixing chamber <b>510</b>E of the mixing manifold <b>510</b>. The valved inlets can have any suitable configuration to achieve this function. For example, the metering orifices <b>333</b>, <b>335</b> can be associated with the fluid inlets <b>510</b>C, <b>510</b>D rather than the valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As mentioned above, the extractor <b>10</b> comprises the fluid recovery system for removing the spent cleaning fluid and dirt from the surface to be cleaned and storing the spent cleaning fluid and dirt. The fluid recovery system comprises the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> which draws a vacuum on the recovery chamber <b>32</b> through the horizontal conduit <b>244</b>, the motor and fan assembly inlet conduit <b>230</b>, the transfer conduit <b>232</b>, the tank outlet conduit <b>122</b>, and the outlet chamber <b>88</b> in the lid <b>70</b> of the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b>. Depending on the position of the diverter valve <b>106</b>, the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> draws a vacuum on either the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> or the accessory tool handle <b>432</b> and the accessory tool attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">When the diverter valve <b>106</b> is positioned in the floor cleaning mode, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a working air conduit is formed from the nozzle opening <b>348</b>, through the fluid flow path <b>346</b> in the nozzle assembly <b>340</b>, out the elongated outlet <b>350</b> of the nozzle assembly <b>340</b>, through the nozzle conduit inlet <b>98</b> to the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> of the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>, through the diverter inlet <b>114</b>, into the cavity <b>76</b>, and through the tank inlet <b>82</b> into the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. The working air conduit continues, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, around the separator plate <b>116</b> in the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and through the screen <b>118</b> into the outlet chamber <b>88</b>, through tank outlet <b>84</b> into the tank outlet conduit <b>122</b>, and through the transfer conduit <b>232</b> and the horizontal conduit <b>244</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 15</figref>) before reaching the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> at the horizontal conduit outlet <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">When the diverter valve <b>106</b> is positioned in the accessory cleaning mode and the handle assembly <b>14</b> is in the upright position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a working air conduit is formed from the accessory tool on the accessory tool handle <b>432</b>, through the accessory hose <b>430</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) and the accessory hose coupling <b>486</b> to the accessory conduit coupling <b>484</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), from the accessory conduit coupling <b>484</b> to the accessory conduit <b>482</b> in the handle assembly <b>14</b>, through the accessory conduit <b>482</b> and the accessory conduit coupling <b>483</b> to the accessory conduit connector <b>170</b>, through the outlet <b>172</b> of the accessory conduit connector <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) to the accessory conduit inlet <b>102</b> of the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> of the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>, through the diverter inlet <b>114</b>, into the cavity <b>76</b>, and through the tank inlet <b>82</b> into the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. The working air path continues from the recovery chamber <b>32</b> in the same manner as described above with respect to the floor cleaning mode.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">It is apparent in the above description that the handle assembly <b>14</b> must be in an upright position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, for the working air conduit to be complete for accessory cleaning. When the handle assembly <b>14</b> is upright, the accessory conduit fitting <b>483</b> at the end of the accessory conduit <b>482</b> sealingly mates with the inlet <b>174</b> of the accessory conduit connector <b>170</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, to establish fluid communication between the accessory hose <b>430</b> and recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>. When the handle assembly <b>14</b> is pivoted away from the upright position, the working air conduit disconnects and, therefore, suction cannot be applied at the accessory tool handle <b>432</b>. As a result of this configuration, the accessory hose <b>430</b> can always be connected the handle assembly <b>14</b>, and the user can easily switch between floor and accessory cleaning modes without having to connect and disconnect the accessory hose <b>430</b> from the handle assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">An exemplary description of the operation of the extractor <b>10</b> follows. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the extractor art that the operation can proceed in any logical order and is not limited to the sequence presented below. The following description is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">To operate the extractor <b>10</b>, the user fills the bladder <b>44</b> and the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> with the first and second cleaning fluids, respectively. To fill the bladder <b>44</b>, the user removes the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> from the base assembly <b>20</b> by pivoting the recovery tank handle <b>74</b> and lifting the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> from the base assembly <b>20</b> to release the valve mechanism <b>48</b> from the valve seat <b>314</b> and to separate the tank outlet conduit <b>122</b> from the transfer conduit <b>232</b>. The forward shell <b>470</b> of the lower handle <b>372</b> is designed to allow removal of the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> when the handle assembly <b>14</b> is in the upright or inclined position.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Once the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> is removed, it can be set on a flat surface. The tank assembly <b>22</b> rests on the tank leveling member <b>42</b> and a forward portion of the upper side rails <b>130</b>. Without the tank leveling member <b>42</b>, the tank assembly <b>22</b> would rest on the entire lower edges <b>138</b> of the upper side rails <b>138</b> and thereby tilt rearwardly at a fairly severe angle, which could result in undesirable flow of fluid from the recovery chamber <b>32</b> through the tank outlet <b>84</b>. The tank leveling member <b>42</b> raises the rear side of the tank assembly <b>22</b> to position the tank housing <b>30</b> to prevent any fluid in the recovery chamber <b>32</b> from undesirably flowing out of the tank housing <b>30</b> through the tank outlet <b>84</b>. The tank leveling member <b>42</b> can level the recovery chamber <b>32</b> or can position the recovery chamber <b>32</b> such that the recovery chamber <b>32</b> tilts forwardly or rearwardly at a slight angle.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Next, the user removes the lid <b>70</b> from the tank housing <b>30</b> by releasing the tank latch <b>36</b> and pulling the lid <b>70</b> off of the tank housing <b>30</b> to expose the funnel <b>47</b>. The first cleaning fluid is poured into the bladder <b>44</b> through the funnel <b>47</b>. The lid <b>70</b> is replaced on the tank housing <b>30</b> and secured thereto by engaging the tank latch <b>36</b>. The user then re-mounts the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> with the full bladder <b>44</b> onto the base assembly <b>20</b> by aligning the upper side rails <b>130</b> with the lower side rails <b>264</b> and the base housing side walls <b>204</b>, which function as guide surfaces for the upper side rails <b>130</b>, and aligning the tank leveling member <b>42</b> with the slot <b>309</b> in the base housing cover <b>192</b>. The user gently pushes the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> on to the base assembly <b>20</b> to connect the valve mechanism <b>48</b> with the valve seat <b>314</b> and the tank outlet conduit <b>122</b> with the transfer conduit <b>232</b>. When the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> is mounted to the base assembly <b>20</b>, the upper side rails <b>130</b> straddle the base assembly <b>20</b> to thereby position and retain the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> on the base assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">To fill the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> with the second cleaning fluid, the user removes the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> from the base assembly <b>20</b> by simply lifting the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> therefrom, thereby separating the valve mechanism <b>158</b> from the valve seat <b>318</b>. The extractor <b>10</b> is designed to allow removal of the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> when the handle assembly <b>14</b> is in the upright or inclined position. Once the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> is removed from the base assembly <b>20</b>, the valve mechanism <b>158</b> is removed from the tank outlet <b>156</b>, which also functions as a tank inlet for filling the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> with the second cleaning fluid. After the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> is filled, the user replaces the valve mechanism <b>158</b> on the tank outlet <b>156</b> and mounts the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> to the base assembly <b>20</b>, thereby coupling the valve mechanism <b>158</b> with the valve seat <b>318</b>. With the bladder <b>44</b> and the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> filled with the first and second cleaning fluids, respectively, the user can operate the extractor <b>10</b> in the floor cleaning mode or the accessory cleaning mode.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">To operate the extractor <b>10</b> in the floor cleaning mode, the user turns the diverter valve <b>106</b> to the floor cleaning mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, so that the diverter inlet <b>114</b> aligns with the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b>. The user then actuates the main power switch <b>386</b> to supply power from a power source <b>393</b>, such as the home power supply, to the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>, the pump assembly <b>234</b>, and the agitator motor <b>220</b>, as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Power to the agitator motor <b>220</b> is also controlled by the agitator motor switch <b>236</b> in the foot assembly <b>14</b>. The agitator motor switch <b>236</b> is normally in a closed position to supply power to the agitator motor <b>220</b>. However, when the handle assembly <b>14</b> is in the upright position, the agitator motor switch actuator <b>495</b> depresses the actuation button <b>239</b> of the agitator motor switch <b>236</b> to open the agitator motor switch <b>236</b> so that no power is supplied to the agitator motor <b>220</b>. When the user pivots the handle assembly <b>14</b> away from the upright position, the agitator motor switch actuator <b>495</b> rotates away from the actuation button <b>239</b> to thereby return the agitator motor switch <b>236</b> to its normally closed position and supply power to the agitator motor <b>220</b> for floor cleaning. If the user desires heated cleaning, then the user actuates the heater switch <b>388</b> to power the heater <b>222</b>, and the heater indicator <b>478</b> communicates the operational status of the heater <b>222</b> to the user. Next, the user selects a desired cleaning mode through the cleaning mode knob <b>384</b>. Typically, the user initially performs one of the light, normal, or heavy cleaning modes and then follows with a rinse mode. Optionally, the user can change modes during use when encountering a lightly soiled surface (i.e., change to the light cleaning mode) or a heavily soiled surface (i.e., change to the heavy cleaning mode).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">With the handle assembly <b>14</b> pivoted and agitator motor <b>220</b> powered, the user moves the extractor <b>10</b> along the surface to be cleaned while applying the cleaning fluid when desired by depressing the fluid trigger <b>460</b> with the same hand that holds the handle grip <b>440</b> at the hand section <b>452</b>. The cleaning fluid is dispensed through the spray tips <b>218</b>, and the surface to be cleaned is agitated by the brushrolls <b>220</b> and the edge brushes <b>294</b>. The spent cleaning fluid and dirt on the surface to be cleaned are removed through the nozzle opening <b>348</b> and flow through the working air conduit described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) into the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, where the spent cleaning fluid and dirt are removed from the working air. The working air continues along the working air conduit out of the recovery chamber <b>32</b> to the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>, and the exhaust air from the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> leaves the foot assembly <b>14</b> through the vents <b>250</b> in the manner described in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">To operate the extractor <b>10</b> in the accessory cleaning mode, the user pivots the handle assembly <b>14</b> to the upright position to thereby deactivate the agitator motor <b>220</b> and connect the accessory conduit fitting <b>483</b> with the inlet <b>174</b> of the accessory conduit connector <b>170</b>. Next, the user selects the desired cleaning mode through the cleaning mode knob <b>384</b> and rotates the diverter valve <b>106</b> to the accessory cleaning mode to align the diverter inlet <b>114</b> with the accessory conduit connector <b>170</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. With a desired accessory tool mounted to the stem <b>438</b> of the accessory tool handle <b>432</b>, the user cleans the surface to be cleaned by applying the cleaning fluid, if desired and suitable for the selected accessory tool, through depression of the accessory tool handle fluid trigger <b>434</b> and removing the spent cleaning fluid and dirt through the working air conduit described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). The spent cleaning fluid and dirt enters the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, where the spent cleaning fluid and dirt are removed from the working air. The working air continues along the working air conduit out of the recovery chamber <b>32</b> to the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>, and the exhaust air from the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> leaves the foot assembly <b>14</b> through the vents <b>250</b> in the manner described in detail above.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">As the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> operates with the extractor <b>10</b> in either the floor cleaning mode or accessory cleaning mode, cooling air for the motor <b>590</b> flows through a passageway for cooling the motor <b>590</b> and also heating the second cleaning fluid in the solution supply chamber <b>152</b>. In particular, cooling air enters the motor cavity in the motor and fan assembly cover <b>304</b> through the cooling air inlet apertures <b>306</b>, flows over the motor <b>590</b> of the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>, and is exhausted through the cooling air exhaust aperture <b>307</b>. Because the cooling air removes heat from the motor <b>590</b> of the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>, the cooling air exhaust is warm. As shown by arrows B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, the warm cooling air exhaust flows from the cooling air exhaust aperture <b>307</b>, into the cooling air exhaust conduit <b>311</b>, and ultimately to the atmosphere through the cooling air vents <b>313</b>. Because the cooling air exhaust conduit <b>311</b> is partially defined by the solution supply tank support <b>167</b> and is thereby located adjacent the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>, the warm cooling air exhaust is in heat exchange with the solution supply chamber <b>152</b> and advantageously heats the second cleaning fluid contained therein. In this embodiment, the solution supply tank support <b>167</b> conducts the heat from the cooling air exhaust to the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>, including the solution supply chamber <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The cooling air exhaust conduit <b>311</b> can be routed in any suitable manner to facilitate heat exchange between the warm cooling air exhaust and the solution supply chamber <b>152</b>. For example, the foot assembly cover <b>26</b> can include additional cooling air vents <b>313</b>A in the solution supply tank support <b>167</b>, as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, for directing the warm cooling air exhaust towards the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>. When the foot assembly cover <b>26</b> has the cooling air vents <b>313</b>A, the cooling air vents <b>313</b> can be omitted whereby more of the warm cooling air exhaust is directed toward the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>. Further, the lower end of the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> can be spaced from the solution supply tank support <b>167</b> so that the warm cooling air exhaust can easily flow through the cooling air vents <b>313</b>A. The cooling air vents <b>313</b>A can have any suitable configuration ranging from a plurality of relatively small apertures (relative to the size of the solution supply tank support <b>167</b>) to a single, relatively large aperture (relative to the size of the solution supply tank support <b>167</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As another example, the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> can be configured so that the warm cooling air exhaust flows through the cooling air vents <b>313</b>A and around or through the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b>. To achieve this flow of the cooling air exhaust, the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> can have, for example, a depression that defines an air flow path around the outside of the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> or form one or more conduits that extend through the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Optionally, the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> can be mounted on a thermally conductive body that absorbs heat from the warm cooling air exhaust and transfers the heat to the second cleaning fluid in the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b>. In another embodiment, an auxiliary heater can be positioned downstream from the motor <b>590</b>, for example, in the cooling air exhaust conduit <b>311</b>, to further heat the cooling air exhaust that is in heat exchange with the solution supply chamber <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In another embodiment, the cooling air vents <b>313</b> are located on a bottom surface of the base housing <b>190</b> in a manner similar to the working air exhaust vents <b>250</b> to aid in heating and drying the surface that is being cleaned. An example of an extractor with vents that direct the motor cooling air exhaust toward the surface to be cleaned is disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,467,122.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Alternatively, cooling air exhaust from a motor other than the motor <b>590</b> of the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> can be utilized to heat the second cleaning fluid in the solution supply chamber <b>152</b> in a manner similar to that described above. For example, the motor can be the agitator motor <b>220</b> or any other motor known for use in an extraction cleaner, including a drive motor that provides power for moving the extraction cleaner over a surface to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">During operation in either the floor cleaning mode or the accessory cleaning mode, the bladder <b>44</b> empties and compresses, due to its flexibility, as the recovery chamber <b>32</b> fills with the spent cleaning fluid and dirt. If the spent cleaning fluid and dirt in the recovery chamber <b>32</b> reaches a predetermined level, the float <b>60</b> rises such that the upper portion <b>62</b> contacts the float door <b>120</b>. As the fluid level continues to rise, the float <b>60</b> forces the float door <b>120</b> to pivot toward the tank outlet screen <b>118</b> until, at a predetermined position, the working air flow draws the float door <b>120</b> to the generally vertical, closed position in contact with the screen <b>118</b> to block fluid communication between the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and thereby prevent the recovery chamber <b>32</b> from overfilling. When the user turns off power to the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>, the working air flow ceases and no longer holds the float door <b>120</b> in the closed position. As a result, the float door <b>120</b> pivots about the pivot pin <b>119</b> and returns to the generally horizontal, open position. To empty the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, the user removes the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> from the base assembly <b>20</b> as described above. With the lid <b>70</b> removed from the tank housing <b>30</b>, the user can empty the contents of the tank housing <b>30</b> through the open top of the tank housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">If desired, the user can remove the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> for replacement, repair or cleaning. Preferably, the nozzle assembly <b>340</b>, the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>, and the lid <b>70</b> are made of a transparent or translucent material so that a user can visually observe the interior regions of these components. Additionally, the user can remove the spray tips <b>218</b> for replacement, repair, or cleaning thereof and the end caps <b>288</b>, which can also be made of a transparent or translucent material, for accessing the agitator assembly <b>214</b> from a side of the foot assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">An alternative embodiment of a metering valve assembly <b>530</b> according to the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-32</figref>. The metering valve assembly <b>530</b> replaces the metering valve assembly <b>330</b> and the cleaning mode knob <b>384</b> and the corresponding cleaning mode switch <b>390</b> of the first embodiment. Consequently, the fluid delivery system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is the same for the alternative embodiment, except that the components downstream of the heater <b>222</b> and the valve mechanism <b>158</b> and upstream of the pump assembly <b>234</b> are replaced with the metering valve assembly <b>530</b>, which incorporates a mixing manifold with a mixing chamber. The remaining components of the foot assembly <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> are substantially identical to those shown and described with respect to the first embodiment and are therefore identified with the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The alternative metering valve assembly <b>530</b> comprises a first metering valve <b>532</b> and a second metering valve <b>534</b> and is supported by a generally U-shaped valve bracket <b>536</b> comprising a platform <b>535</b> with a circular mounting aperture <b>539</b> and a pair of depending legs <b>537</b> mounted to the base housing cover <b>192</b> by fasteners that extend through terminal flanges <b>528</b>. An upper portion of the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> is formed by a valve housing <b>540</b> comprising a hollow first valve body <b>542</b>, a hollow second valve body <b>544</b>, and a connecting wall <b>538</b> therebetween. The first and second valve bodies <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> comprise radially oriented valve inlets <b>548</b> in fluid communication with the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> and leading to a respective first and second metering orifice <b>333</b>, <b>335</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>) within the first and second valve bodies <b>542</b>, <b>544</b>. In particular, the first metering valve <b>532</b> comprises the first metering orifice <b>333</b>, and the second metering valve <b>534</b> comprises the second metering orifice <b>335</b>, which is larger than the first metering orifice <b>333</b> for the same reasons as described above for the first embodiment metering valve assembly <b>330</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A</figref>, <b>31</b>B, and <b>32</b>, the first and second valve bodies <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> include an exterior shoulder <b>550</b> an interior shoulder <b>552</b>. The interior shoulder <b>552</b> is disposed at approximately half the height of the valve bodies <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> such that the interior of the valve bodies <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> below the interior shoulder <b>552</b> has a larger diameter than above the interior shoulder <b>552</b>. An annular gasket <b>554</b> is positioned below the interior shoulder <b>552</b> in sealing contact therewith. The valve inlets <b>548</b> and the corresponding metering orifice <b>333</b>, <b>335</b> are located above the interior shoulder <b>552</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">A valve platform <b>556</b> comprises a platform <b>563</b> that sealingly mates with a lower surface of the valve housing <b>540</b> to form a lower portion of the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>. The valve platform <b>556</b> comprises on a lower side thereof a first cleaning fluid inlet <b>558</b> in fluid communication with the bladder <b>44</b> and an outlet <b>560</b> and, on an upper side thereof, a pair of generally cylindrical upstanding valve body receivers <b>562</b>. The valve body receivers <b>562</b> project into the respective first and second valve bodies <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> to a position where their upper end is slightly spaced from the gasket <b>554</b>. Additionally, the valve body receivers <b>562</b> include apertures <b>564</b> oriented such that they face one another and are in fluid communication with a mixing chamber <b>546</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) formed between the platform <b>562</b> and the connecting wall <b>538</b> of the valve housing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Each of the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> further comprise a valve stem <b>566</b> having a plunger <b>568</b> that depends from a generally perpendicular control knob interface plate <b>570</b>. The plunger <b>568</b>, which is slidingly received within the respective hollow valve body <b>542</b>, <b>544</b>, includes an upper circumferential notch <b>572</b> and a lower notch <b>574</b> formed in a plurality of radially extending fins <b>576</b>. A terminal disk <b>578</b> at the lower end of the fins <b>576</b> defines the lower end of the lower notch <b>574</b>. A commonly known O-ring seal <b>580</b> seated within the upper circumferential notch <b>572</b> of the plunger <b>568</b> creates a seal between the plunger <b>568</b> and an inner surface of the respective valve body <b>542</b>, <b>544</b> above the interior shoulder <b>552</b> and the respective metering orifice <b>333</b>, <b>335</b>. The annular gasket <b>554</b> is positioned within the lower notch <b>574</b> on the fins <b>576</b> of the plunger <b>568</b> and has an inner diameter slightly less than the diameter of the lower notch <b>574</b> to form an annular fluid passageway therebetween. Thus, a fluid passageway is formed from the valve inlet <b>548</b>, through the respective metering orifice <b>333</b>, <b>335</b>, axially along and between the fins <b>576</b> of the plunger <b>568</b>, and in the annular space between the annular gasket <b>554</b> and the plunger <b>568</b>, as indicated by an arrow labeled <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The valve stem <b>566</b> is biased upward to a closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> by a biasing member, such as a spring <b>582</b> disposed between a lower surface of the control knob interface plate <b>570</b> and the exterior shoulder <b>550</b> of the respective valve body <b>542</b>, <b>544</b>. In this position, the terminal disk <b>578</b> abuts the annular gasket <b>554</b>, thereby limiting upward movement of the valve stem <b>566</b> and creating a seal between the annular gasket <b>554</b> and the terminal disk <b>578</b>. Consequently, the fluid passageway described above terminates at this seal. Corresponding flows of the first and second cleaning fluids when the valve stem <b>566</b> is in the closed position are indicated by arrows labeled <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">When the plunger <b>568</b> shifts downward within the respective valve body <b>542</b>, <b>544</b>, the terminal disk <b>578</b> moves downward to an open position to form a vertical space between the annular gasket <b>554</b> and the terminal disk <b>578</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>. Consequently, the fluid passageway described above continues from the annular space between the annular gasket <b>554</b> and the plunger <b>568</b> and into the valve body receiver <b>562</b> and the mixing chamber <b>546</b>. Thus, the second cleaning fluid that flows through the fluid passageway mixes with the first cleaning fluid that enters through the first cleaning fluid inlet <b>558</b>. Flows of the second cleaning fluid when the valve stem <b>566</b> is in the open position is indicated by arrows labeled <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Vertical movement of the valve stem <b>566</b> and thereby the plunger <b>568</b> is effected by a cleaning mode knob <b>584</b> mounted in the mounting aperture <b>539</b> of the bracket platform <b>525</b> and positioned above the valve stems <b>566</b>. The cleaning mode knob <b>584</b> comprises an upper portion <b>586</b> that extends above the valve bracket <b>536</b> and projects through the foot assembly cover <b>26</b>. The upper portion <b>586</b> includes a grip <b>588</b> accessible to the user for rotation of the cleaning mode knob <b>584</b>. A lower portion <b>585</b> of the cleaning mode knob <b>584</b> extends below the valve bracket <b>536</b> and interacts with the control knob interface plates <b>570</b> of both of the valve stems <b>566</b> to simultaneously control the operation of the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>. The lower portion <b>585</b> terminates in a cam surface <b>587</b> having a plurality of projections <b>589</b>, and each projection <b>589</b> is sized to depress the control knob interface plate <b>570</b> when in register therewith for moving the corresponding plunger <b>568</b> downward and thereby opening the corresponding metering valve <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The operation of the metering valve assembly <b>530</b> will now be described with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-32</figref> and additional reference to the schematic views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25D</figref>. The second cleaning fluid from the fluid supply tank assembly <b>24</b> is available at the valve inlets <b>548</b>, while the first cleaning fluid from the bladder <b>44</b> flows in the first cleaning fluid inlet <b>558</b>, through the mixing chamber <b>546</b>, and out the outlet <b>560</b> to the pump assembly <b>234</b>. When the extractor <b>10</b> is operated in the rinse mode, the user rotates the grip <b>588</b> and thereby the cleaning mode knob <b>584</b> to a corresponding rinse position, in which both of the valve stems <b>566</b> are in the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>. As described above, when the valve stems <b>566</b> are in the closed position, the terminal disk <b>578</b> abuts the annular gasket <b>554</b> to terminate the fluid passageway at the annular space between the annular gasket <b>554</b> and the plunger <b>568</b>. Thus, the second cleaning fluid does not pass through either of the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>. Meanwhile, the first cleaning fluid enters the first cleaning fluid inlet <b>558</b>, as indicated by arrows labeled <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, and only the first cleaning fluid is dispensed at the outlet <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">For operation of the extractor <b>10</b> in one of the light, normal, and heavy cleaning modes, the user rotates the grip <b>588</b> and thereby the cleaning mode knob <b>584</b> to a corresponding position to open the first metering valve <b>532</b> for the light cleaning mode, the second metering valve <b>534</b> for the normal cleaning mode, or both the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> for the heavy cleaning mode. These cleaning modes and the rinse mode are functionally the same as the cleaning modes schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25D</figref> of the first embodiment. When the second metering valve <b>534</b> is opened for the normal cleaning mode, the valve stem <b>566</b> is in the open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>. As described above, the valve stem <b>566</b> is displaced downward to form a vertical space between the terminal disk <b>578</b> and the annular gasket <b>554</b> to thereby fluidly communicate the valve inlet <b>548</b> with the interior of the valve body receiver <b>562</b> and the mixing chamber <b>546</b>. Thus, the second cleaning fluid, whose flow is indicated by arrows labeled <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>, mixes with the first cleaning fluid to form the cleaning solution before exiting at the outlet <b>560</b>, as indicated by arrows labeled <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31B</figref>. During the light cleaning mode, the first metering valve <b>532</b> opens in the same fashion, and both the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> open in the same fashion for the heavy cleaning mode. The positions of the first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> in the heavy cleaning mode are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, where flow of the first cleaning fluid is indicated by arrows labeled <b>1</b>, flow of the second cleaning fluid is indicated by arrows labeled <b>2</b>, and flow of a mixture of the first and second cleaning fluids is indicated by arrows labeled <b>3</b>. In each mode, the amount of second cleaning fluid that mixes with the first cleaning fluid is determined by the sizes of the first and the second metering orifices <b>333</b>, <b>335</b> of the corresponding first and second metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b> and progressively increases for a more concentrated cleaning solution.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The metering valve assembly <b>530</b> can be modified in any suitable manner. For example, the metering valve assembly <b>530</b> can include more than two of the metering valves <b>532</b>, <b>534</b>, depending on the desired number of cleaning modes. For example, adding one metering valve with a corresponding inlet to the configuration described above results in three of the metering valves, three of the inlets for the second cleaning fluid, and eight cleaning modes.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The operation of the extractor <b>10</b> with the alternative metering valve assembly <b>530</b> is substantially identical to the operation described above for the first embodiment. The primary difference is that the user rotates the cleaning mode knob <b>584</b> located on the foot assembly <b>12</b> to switch between cleaning modes.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Whereas, the invention has been described with respect to two fluid tanks, it is within the scope of the invention to meter three or more fluids from three or more separate tanks with metering valve assemblies according to the invention. For example, in addition to the water and cleaning solution tanks, a third tank can comprise a carpet or bare floor protectant and a fourth tank can contain a miticide. Thus, the invention in it broader terms in not limited to the metering of fluids from only two tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">It is within the scope of the invention to alter various components of the extractor <b>10</b> or to add other features to the extractor <b>10</b>. Examples of alterations and additions follow.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> rather than the agitator assembly <b>214</b> can be configured to float on the surface to be cleaned. Because the agitator assembly <b>214</b> has moving parts, it can be somewhat complicated to make the agitator assembly <b>214</b> the floating component. By fixing the vertical position of the agitator assembly <b>214</b> and allowing the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> to float, which does not have any moving parts, the design is simplified while still allowing both the brushrolls <b>281</b> and the nozzle opening <b>348</b> are in contact with the surface to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> comprises a flexible bellows <b>640</b> at an upper end thereof, and the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> is coupled to the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> at the flexible bellows <b>640</b>. The flexible bellows <b>640</b> can be configured to be removably mounted to the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> so that the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> can be separated from the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> when the recovery tank assembly <b>22</b> is removed from the base assembly <b>20</b>. The flexible bellows <b>340</b> contracts when the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> moves upward and expands as the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> moves downward relative to the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>. Furthermore, the nozzle assembly mounting openings <b>295</b> in the end caps <b>288</b> can be elongated to allow for vertical movement of the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> relative to the end caps <b>288</b> as the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> floats over the surface to be cleaned. Optionally, the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> can include a biasing element to apply downward pressure on the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> against the surface to be cleaned, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,622,254, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The nozzle assembly <b>340</b> can also be configured to pivot to create the desired floating effect.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35A</figref>, the nozzle assembly <b>340</b> can be adapted to include a squeegee roller <b>650</b> mounted in the nozzle opening <b>348</b>. In particular, the squeegee roller <b>650</b> is rotatably mounted on an axle <b>652</b> such that the squeegee roller <b>650</b> rotates when the user moves the extractor <b>10</b> in forward and rearward directions. The squeegee roller <b>650</b> is centered within the nozzle opening <b>348</b> so that air, liquid, and debris can be lifted from the surface to be cleaned and flow in front of and behind the squeegee roller <b>650</b> regardless of the direction of movement of the extractor <b>10</b> across the surface to be cleaned. The squeegee roller <b>650</b> can be a soft covered roller that is safe to use on carpets and bare floors. Advantageously, the squeegee roller <b>650</b> has a larger surface area in contact with the surface to be cleaned compared to conventional wiper blade squeegees, and, as a result, additional force can be distributed over a larger area to improve water recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35B-35D</figref>, the squeegee roller <b>650</b> can alternatively be configured to slide within the nozzle opening <b>348</b> so that the nozzle opening <b>348</b> is formed only on the rear side of the squeegee roller <b>650</b> when the extractor <b>10</b> is moved rearwardly, as indicated by arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>, or only on the front side of the squeegee roller <b>650</b> when the extractor <b>10</b> is moved forwardly, as indicated by arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35D</figref>, the axle <b>652</b> can be mounted within a track <b>654</b> formed in the forward and rearward sections <b>342</b>, <b>344</b> of the nozzle assembly <b>340</b>. The axle <b>652</b> can slide forward and rearward within the track <b>654</b> to slide the squeegee roller <b>650</b> forward and rearward within the nozzle opening <b>348</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The agitator assembly <b>214</b> has been shown and described as comprising the pair of horizontal axis brushrolls <b>280</b>. Alternatively, the agitator assembly <b>214</b> can comprise other types of commonly known agitators and agitation drive mechanisms, including, but not limited to, vertical axis brushes, scrubbing pads, sponges, clothes, and the like. Furthermore, the agitator assembly <b>214</b> can comprise multiple types of agitators. For example, the agitator assembly <b>214</b> can comprise one of the horizontal axis brushrolls <b>280</b> and a row of vertical axis brushes, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,009,593, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The horizontal axis brushroll <b>280</b> can be parallel with the row of vertical axis brushes and can be positioned in front of or behind the row of vertical axis brushes. The horizontal axis brushroll <b>280</b> and the row of vertical axis brushes can be driven by the same power source, such as the agitator motor <b>220</b>, or separate power sources. The horizontal axis brushroll <b>280</b> and the row of vertical axis brushes can be coupled so that rotation of one induces rotation of the other. Optionally, the row of vertical axis brushes can be configured to oscillate back and forth to ensure that both side of the carpet are cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The extractor <b>10</b> can further comprise a speed sensor that detects the relative speed of the foot assembly <b>12</b> relative to the surface to be cleaned and generates a signal representative of the speed and an indicator coupled to the speed sensor to display to the user an indication representative of the signal. An example of the speed sensor and indicator are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,140, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The indicator communicates to the user whether the speed of the foot assembly <b>12</b> is within an optimal speed range for optimal cleaning performance. The optimum speed range for a standard soil level can be preprogrammed into a microprocessor coupled to the speed sensor and the indicator, or the optimum speed range can be determined by other factors, examples of which are provided in the incorporated '140 patent. Optionally, the user can input a soil level, and the microprocessor can be programmed with a plurality of optimum speed ranges corresponding to different soil levels. For example, the soil level can be input by selecting the cleaning mode through the cleaning mode knob <b>384</b>, and the cleaning mode switch <b>386</b> communicates the soil level to the microprocessor. Alternatively, the extractor <b>10</b> can comprise a separate selector mounted on the foot assembly <b>12</b> or the handle assembly <b>14</b> for inputting the soil level.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A and 36B</figref>, the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b> has been described as comprising the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> that fluidly couples the nozzle opening <b>348</b> to the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> that fluidly couples the accessory house <b>430</b> to the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, and the diverter valve <b>106</b> selectively blocks fluid communication between the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and one of the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> and the accessory conduit section <b>100</b>. As shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36A</figref>, the peripheral flange <b>110</b> of the diverter valve <b>106</b> blocks the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> in the floor cleaning mode so that the working air path, as indicated by arrows, extends from the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> and into the recovery chamber <b>32</b> (in a direction into the page). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, the peripheral flange <b>110</b> blocks the nozzle conduit section <b>96</b> in the accessory cleaning mode so that the working air path, as indicated by arrows, extends from the accessory conduit section <b>100</b> and into the recovery chamber <b>32</b> (in a direction into the page).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">An alternative diverter valve assembly <b>660</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36C and 36B</figref>. The diverter valve assembly <b>660</b> comprises a nozzle door <b>662</b> and an accessory door <b>664</b> movable mounted within the recovery tank inlet conduit <b>90</b>. The nozzle door <b>662</b> is pivotable between an opened position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref>, to allow fluid communication between the nozzle opening <b>348</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and a closed position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36D</figref>, to block fluid communication between the nozzle opening <b>348</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. Similarly, the accessory door <b>664</b> is pivotable between a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref>, to block fluid communication between the accessory hose <b>430</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b> and an opened position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36D</figref>, to allow fluid communication between the accessory hose <b>430</b> and the recovery chamber <b>32</b>. When the nozzle door <b>662</b> is in the opened position, the accessory door <b>664</b> is in the closed position for the floor cleaning mode, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36C</figref>. Conversely, when the accessory door <b>664</b> is in the opened position, the nozzle door <b>662</b> is in the closed position for the accessory cleaning mode, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>. The nozzle door <b>662</b> and the accessory door <b>664</b> can be coupled so that the doors <b>662</b>, <b>664</b> move in concert for conversion between the floor and accessory cleaning modes. The doors <b>662</b>, <b>664</b> can be mechanically coupled or electrically coupled, and movement of a single switch, which can be located on the foot assembly <b>12</b> or the handle assembly <b>14</b>, by the user can convert the diverter valve assembly <b>660</b> from the floor cleaning mode to the accessory cleaning mode. Advantageously, because the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b> are positioned downstream from the recovery chamber <b>32</b>, the door <b>662</b>, <b>664</b> that is in the closed position is maintained in the closed position by the suction forces generated by the motor and fan assembly <b>228</b>. The nozzle conduit section <b>90</b> can include door stops <b>666</b> that the doors <b>662</b>, <b>664</b> abut when in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">An alternative heater <b>680</b> for heating the cleaning fluid is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 37B</figref>. The heater <b>680</b> is similar to the heater disclosed in the aforementioned and incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,237 in that the heater <b>660</b> comprises a metallic body <b>682</b>, such as an aluminum body, that forms a serpentine fluid channel <b>684</b> with an open upper end and houses a heating element <b>686</b>. The heater <b>680</b> further comprises a polymeric cover <b>688</b> mounted to the body <b>682</b> by mechanical fasteners <b>690</b>, such as screws, with a gasket <b>692</b> therebetween. The cover <b>688</b> comprises a fluid inlet port <b>694</b> and a fluid outlet port <b>696</b>, which are preferably integrally molded with the cover <b>688</b>. When the cover <b>688</b> is mounted to the body <b>682</b>, the cover <b>688</b> closes the open upper end of the fluid channel <b>684</b>, and the fluid inlet port <b>694</b> and the fluid outlet port <b>696</b> provide an inlet and an outlet, respectively, to the fluid channel <b>684</b>. During operation, the cleaning fluid flows through the fluid inlet port <b>694</b> into the fluid channel <b>684</b> and exits the fluid channel <b>684</b> through the fluid outlet port <b>696</b>. As the cleaning fluid flows through the fluid channel <b>684</b>, heat from the heating element <b>686</b> conducts through the body <b>682</b> and to the cleaning fluid to thereby heat the cleaning fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The fluid delivery system can further comprise a manual pre-treat tool <b>710</b> mounted to the extractor <b>10</b> for manually applying the cleaning fluid to the surface to be cleaned. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, which schematically illustrates a portion of the fluid delivery system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the pre-treat tool <b>710</b> can be fluidly connected to the fluid delivery system at a plurality of locations, such as, for example, downstream from the solution supply tank assembly <b>24</b> and upstream of the metering valve assembly <b>330</b>, downstream from the bladder <b>44</b> and upstream of the mixing manifold <b>510</b>, downstream from the mixing manifold <b>510</b> and upstream of the pump assembly <b>234</b>, and downstream of the pump assembly <b>234</b> and upstream of the tee <b>516</b>. When the pre-treat tool <b>710</b> is coupled to the fluid delivery system downstream of the pump assembly <b>234</b>, the cleaning fluid provided to the manual pre-treat tool <b>710</b> is pressurized by the pump assembly <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A and 39B</figref>, the pre-treat tool <b>710</b> can be mounted to the handle assembly <b>14</b> and comprise a hand-held applicator <b>712</b> fluidly coupled to the fluid delivery system by a conduit <b>714</b>. When not in use, the pre-treat tool <b>710</b> can be stored in a pocket <b>716</b> mounted to the handle assembly <b>14</b>. The conduit <b>714</b> can be folded into the pocket <b>716</b> when the pre-treat tool <b>710</b> is not in use, or the conduit <b>714</b> can be retractable into the handle assembly <b>14</b>. Optionally, if the cleaning fluid is not provided to the pre-treat tool <b>710</b> in a pressurized condition, the applicator <b>712</b> can include a manual pump operable by a trigger <b>718</b> similar to conventional manual spray pumps for dispensing fluids from bottles. During operation, if the user detects a heavily soiled area, the user can remove the applicator <b>712</b> from the pocket <b>716</b> and apply the cleaning fluid to the heavily soiled area before using the extractor <b>10</b> to clean the heavily soiled area. After the cleaning fluid is applied to the heavily soiled area with the pre-treat tool <b>710</b>, the user replaces the applicator <b>712</b> in the pocket <b>716</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref>, the extractor <b>10</b> can comprise a storage compartment <b>730</b> for storing a user's manual <b>732</b>. The storage compartment <b>730</b> can be disposed in any suitable location on the extractor <b>10</b> and is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40A and 40B</figref> as located on the handle assembly <b>14</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40A</figref>, the storage compartment <b>730</b> is illustrated as being located on a front side of the handle assembly <b>14</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40B</figref> shows the storage compartment <b>730</b> on a rear side of the handle assembly <b>14</b>. The storage compartment <b>730</b> can be constructed of any suitable materials and is shown in the figures as a mesh bag. Because the user's manual <b>732</b> can be stored directly on the extractor <b>10</b>, the user can readily refer to the user's manual <b>732</b> when needed rather than searching for the user's manual <b>732</b> in an alternate location in the home.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">As stated above, the extractor <b>10</b> can be used with any type of accessory, such as the power brush accessory tool <b>400</b>, in the accessory cleaning mode. An alternative power brush accessory tool <b>740</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> and comprises a main body <b>742</b> that houses a motor (not shown) for powering an agitator <b>744</b> disposed in an agitator chamber <b>746</b> formed by an arcuate, downwardly facing agitator housing <b>748</b> that extends forwardly from the main body <b>742</b> and terminates at a generally flat, rectangular edge <b>754</b> to define at a rear edge thereof a rear portion of a suction nozzle opening. In the illustrated embodiment, the agitator <b>744</b> is a horizontal axis brushroll <b>750</b> that supports a plurality of radially extending bristles <b>752</b> as is well-known in the vacuum cleaner and extractor art. The brushroll <b>750</b> is driven by the motor through a well-known belt drive <b>766</b> and sprocket <b>768</b> on the brushroll <b>750</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The power brush accessory tool <b>740</b> further includes a brush height mechanism comprising a height adjustor <b>756</b> rotatably mounted within the agitator chamber <b>746</b>. The height adjuster <b>756</b> comprises a pair of end walls <b>758</b> coupled together through a front wall <b>770</b> and manually rotatable about an axis coincident with the rotational axis of the agitator <b>744</b>. The front wall <b>770</b> has a flat edge that forms a front portion of the suction nozzle opening. Rotation of the height adjustor <b>756</b> is accomplished by rotation of an adjustor knob <b>760</b> mounted on one end of the agitator housing <b>748</b>. Each of the end walls <b>758</b> is a generally circular disc having a generally flat bottom edge <b>762</b> that rotates with the front wall <b>770</b> relative to the rectangular flat edge <b>754</b> of the agitator housing <b>748</b> when the height adjustor <b>756</b> rotates relative to the agitator housing <b>748</b> via rotation of the adjustor knob <b>760</b>. The relative positioning of the rectangular flat edge <b>754</b> and the front edge <b>772</b> determines a height of the agitator <b>744</b> relative to the surface to be cleaned; this concept is more clearly shown in the schematic illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, when the height adjustor <b>756</b> is positioned so that the flat edges <b>754</b>, <b>762</b> are generally parallel, the power brush accessory tool <b>740</b> rests on the flat edge <b>762</b> of the height adjustor <b>756</b>, and the agitator <b>744</b> is located at a minimum height H<sub>1 </sub>relative to the surface to be cleaned, which is identified with reference numeral <b>764</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A and 42B</figref>. As a result, a maximum surface area of the bristles <b>752</b> contacts the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b>. In the schematic illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, the portion of the bristle <b>752</b> shown in dotted lines represents the portion of the bristle <b>752</b> that can either flex on top of the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b> and/or penetrate carpet fibers when the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b> is carpet.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>, when the height adjustor <b>756</b> is rotated so that the flat edges <b>754</b>, <b>762</b> are not parallel, the power brush accessory tool <b>740</b> rests partially on the height adjustor <b>756</b> and partially on the agitator housing <b>748</b>, which raises the agitator <b>744</b> to a height H<sub>2 </sub>greater than the minimum height H<sub>1 </sub>relative to the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b>. Consequently, less surface area of the bristles <b>752</b> contacts the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b>. As with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, the portion of the bristle <b>752</b> shown in dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref> represents the portion of the bristle <b>752</b> that can either flex on top of the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b> and/or penetrate carpet fibers when the surface to be cleaned <b>764</b> is carpet.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The height adjustor <b>756</b> can be utilized in surface cleaning devices other than the power brush accessory tool <b>740</b>. For example, the height adjustor <b>756</b> can be utilized in foot assemblies of upright vacuum cleaners and other accessory tools. Additionally, the end walls <b>758</b> of the height adjustor <b>756</b> can have any suitable shape and are not limited to circular discs. For example, the end walls <b>758</b> can be triangular or rectangular.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A-43D</figref>, the heater indicator <b>478</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> for communicating the operational status of the heater <b>222</b> to the user can be replaced with a flow indicator <b>780</b> that communicates to the user when the cleaning fluid is flowing through the fluid delivery system to the surface to be cleaned. The flow indicator <b>780</b> can be positioned in any suitable location in the fluid delivery system schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> and can indicate when the cleaning fluid is supplied to the spray tips <b>218</b>, the accessory tool handle <b>432</b>, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A-43C</figref>, the flow indicator <b>780</b> comprises a generally cylindrical indicator housing <b>782</b> formed by an upper housing <b>784</b> and a lower housing <b>786</b> that mate to form a generally hollow fluid conduit that extends from a fluid inlet <b>788</b> to a fluid outlet <b>790</b>. The indicator housing <b>782</b> includes a central section <b>792</b> having a relatively large inner diameter, terminal sections <b>794</b>, <b>796</b> that form the fluid inlet <b>788</b> and the fluid outlet <b>790</b>, respectively, and have a relatively small inner diameter, and an intermediate section <b>798</b> between the inlet terminal section <b>794</b> and the central section <b>792</b> and having an inner diameter between those of the central and terminal sections <b>792</b>, <b>794</b>, <b>796</b>. The upper housing <b>784</b> is at least partially transparent or translucent and includes a pair of longitudinal ribs <b>800</b> disposed in the central section <b>792</b> and extending from the intermediate section <b>798</b> to about half the distance between the intermediate section <b>798</b> and the outlet terminal section <b>794</b>. The lower housing <b>786</b> includes a light aperture <b>802</b> formed in the central section <b>792</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref>, the flow indicator <b>780</b> further comprises a piston <b>804</b> slidably mounted in the indicator housing <b>782</b>. The piston <b>804</b> comprises a generally semi-cylindrical body <b>806</b> having a smaller diameter portion <b>808</b> that terminates at a generally circular piston member <b>810</b> and a larger diameter portion <b>812</b> having an elongated light opening <b>814</b> formed therein and terminating at a generally circular endwall <b>816</b> having a central fluid opening <b>818</b>. The smaller diameter portion <b>808</b> is sized for receipt within the intermediate section <b>798</b> of the indicator housing <b>782</b>, and the larger diameter portion <b>812</b> is sized for receipt within the central section <b>792</b> of the indicator housing <b>782</b>. A biasing member <b>820</b> disposed in the central section <b>792</b> between the outlet terminal section <b>796</b> and the endwall <b>816</b> of the piston <b>804</b> biases the piston <b>804</b> toward the intermediate section <b>798</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref>, the flow indicator <b>780</b> further comprises an illumination source <b>822</b>, such as a light emitting diode (LED), mounted within an illumination source housing <b>824</b>. The illumination source housing <b>824</b> is in register with the light aperture <b>802</b> in the lower housing <b>786</b> so that light from the illumination source <b>822</b> can transmit through the light aperture <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The flow indicator is operable between a non-flow condition illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref> and a flow condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43D</figref>. In the non-flow condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>, the cleaning fluid does not flow through the conduit between the fluid inlet <b>788</b> and the fluid outlet <b>790</b>, and the biasing member <b>830</b> biases the piston <b>804</b> into the intermediate section <b>798</b> such that the piston member <b>810</b> is received within the intermediate section <b>798</b>. The piston member <b>810</b> is sized to prevent fluid flow through the intermediate section <b>798</b> and into the central section <b>792</b>, regardless of its positioning within the intermediate section <b>798</b>. When the piston <b>804</b> is in this position, the light opening <b>814</b> is longitudinally offset from the light aperture <b>802</b> in the lower housing <b>786</b>. Thus, light from the illumination source <b>822</b>, which can always be illuminated, is not viewable through the upper housing <b>784</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">When the cleaning fluid flows into the fluid inlet <b>788</b> during operation of the extractor <b>10</b>, the pressure of the fluid against the piston member <b>810</b> pushes the piston <b>804</b> against the bias of the biasing member <b>820</b> to the flow condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43D</figref>. Once the piston <b>804</b> moves a distance sufficient to remove the piston member <b>810</b> from the intermediate section <b>798</b> and position the piston member <b>810</b> in the central section <b>792</b>, the cleaning fluid can flow from the inlet terminal section <b>794</b> and the intermediate section <b>798</b> into the central section <b>792</b>, as shown by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43D</figref>. The cleaning fluid flows around the piston member <b>810</b> to enter the central section <b>792</b>, through the fluid opening <b>818</b> in the piston endwall <b>816</b> to continue flowing through the central section <b>792</b>, and through the outlet terminal section <b>796</b> to exit the flow indicator <b>780</b> through the fluid outlet <b>790</b>. When the piston <b>804</b> is in this position, the light opening <b>814</b> is in register with the light aperture <b>802</b> in the lower housing <b>786</b>. Thus, light from the illumination source <b>822</b> is viewable through the upper housing <b>784</b> and thereby communicates to the user that the cleaning fluid is flowing through the fluid delivery system.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A-44D</figref> illustrate a fluid valve <b>840</b> that can be utilized in the fluid delivery system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The fluid valve <b>840</b> can replace one or both of the first and second metering valves <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> of the metering valve assembly <b>330</b> or the spray tip valve <b>224</b>. In general, the fluid valve <b>840</b> at least partially controls the flow of fluid from the solution supply tank housing <b>150</b> to the fluid dispenser, which can be the spray tips <b>218</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A and 44B</figref>, the fluid valve <b>840</b> comprises a generally cylindrical, hollow housing <b>842</b> defining an internal chamber <b>860</b> and having an open upper end <b>844</b> and a closed lower end <b>846</b>. Near the upper end <b>844</b>, the housing <b>842</b> has an internal upper annular shoulder <b>848</b> that supports a disc-like cap <b>850</b> having a pair of spaced parallel slits <b>852</b>. Near the lower end <b>846</b>, the housing <b>842</b> includes a fluid inlet conduit <b>854</b> and a fluid outlet conduit <b>856</b> extending radially from the housing <b>842</b> in diametrically opposite directions. Thus, the housing <b>842</b> forms a fluid conduit through the fluid inlet conduit <b>854</b>, the internal chamber <b>860</b>, and the fluid outlet conduit <b>856</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44C</figref>, the housing <b>842</b> further includes an internal lower annular shoulder <b>858</b> disposed vertically between the fluid inlet conduit <b>854</b> and the fluid outlet conduit <b>856</b>. The lower annular shoulder <b>858</b> supports an annular valve seat <b>862</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The fluid valve <b>840</b> further comprises a valve assembly <b>864</b> having a valve member or valve body <b>866</b> and a valve actuator in the form of a wire <b>868</b> made of a shape memory alloy. The valve body <b>866</b> comprises a bracket <b>870</b> around which the wire <b>868</b> can be wrapped to couple the wire <b>868</b> to the valve body <b>866</b>. The bracket <b>870</b> extends upward from a valve disc <b>872</b> having a plurality of radially extending arms <b>874</b>. The wire <b>868</b> is generally U-shaped and is coupled to a pair of electrical contacts <b>876</b> at its ends. The wire <b>868</b> can be made of any suitable shape memory alloy, examples of which include nickel-titanium, which is commonly referred to as Nitinol, copper-aluminum-nickel, copper-zinc-aluminum, iron-manganese-silicon, gold-cadmium, and brass alloys. Shape memory alloys undergo a solid state phase change at a transition temperature, and volumetric changes accompany the solid state phase change.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">When the fluid valve <b>840</b> is assembled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44A and 44C</figref>, the electrical contacts <b>876</b> of the wire <b>868</b> are received by the slits <b>852</b> of the cap <b>850</b> to suspend the wire <b>868</b> from the cap <b>850</b> in the internal chamber <b>860</b>. The valve body <b>866</b> is suspended from the wire <b>868</b>, and the wire <b>868</b> wraps around the bracket <b>870</b> of the valve body <b>866</b> in a taut or spring loaded fashion so that there is no slack in the wire <b>868</b>. The wire <b>868</b> is coupled to an electrical circuit <b>880</b> having the power source <b>393</b> and a switch <b>882</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44C</figref>, the valve body <b>866</b> sits on the valve seat <b>862</b> with the valve disc <b>872</b> contacting the valve seat <b>862</b> to block fluid flow through the internal chamber <b>860</b> from the fluid inlet conduit <b>854</b> to the fluid outlet conduit <b>856</b>. When the valve body <b>866</b> is in the position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44C</figref>, the fluid valve <b>840</b> is in a closed condition.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">To move the fluid valve <b>840</b> to an opened condition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44D</figref>, the switch <b>882</b> closes to apply electrical current to the electrical contacts <b>876</b> and thereby heat the wire <b>868</b> above the solid state phase change transition temperature. As the temperature of the wire <b>868</b> goes through the transition temperature, the wire <b>868</b> changes phase and thereby undergoes a volumetric change. As a result, the wire <b>868</b> shrinks and lifts the valve body <b>866</b> upward within the internal chamber <b>860</b>. The valve disc <b>872</b> raises from the valve seat <b>862</b>, and the cleaning fluid can flow from the fluid inlet conduit <b>852</b>, into the internal chamber <b>860</b>, around the valve disc <b>872</b> between the arms <b>874</b>, through the valve seat <b>862</b>, and into the fluid outlet conduit <b>854</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">To close the fluid valve <b>840</b>, the switch <b>882</b> opens to remove the electrical current from the wire <b>868</b>, and the wire <b>868</b> cools to below the transition temperature. As a result, the wire <b>868</b> expands and returns to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44C</figref> to lower the valve body <b>866</b> into contact with the valve seat <b>862</b> and thereby close the fluid valve <b>840</b>. The cooling of the wire <b>868</b> can be facilitated by the cleaning fluid in the internal chamber <b>860</b>. Alternatively, air can be fed into the internal chamber <b>860</b> to facilitate fast cooling of the wire <b>868</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Various features of the fluid valve <b>840</b> can be modified to adjust the time required for opening and closing the fluid valve <b>840</b>. According to one embodiment of the invention, the fluid valve <b>840</b> opens in about one second and closes in about one second. Examples of modifications include, but are not limited to, looping the wire <b>868</b> around the bracket <b>870</b> more than once to increase the force applied to the valve body <b>866</b> or to utilize multiple small wires rather than a single wire.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The various features of the extractor <b>10</b> described here are not limited for use in an upright extractor. Rather, the features can be employed for any suitable surface cleaning apparatus, including, but not limited to, hand-held extractors, canister extractors, upright and canister vacuum cleaners, shampooing machines, mops, bare floor cleaners, and the like.</p>
