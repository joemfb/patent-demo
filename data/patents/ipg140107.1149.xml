<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mill liner assembly for mounting on an inner diameter of a shell of a grinding mill. The mill liner assembly includes one or more shell plates for engagement with the shell, each of the shell plates having a cooperating portion thereof, and one or more lifter bars, each of the lifter bars having a mounting portion thereof, the mounting portion being receivable on the cooperating portion. The mill liner assembly also includes one or more layers having one or more substantially non-resilient materials and a substantially non-sticking surface. The layer is at least partially positioned on at least a first selected one of the cooperating portion and the mounting portion, to position the non-sticking surface thereof for engagement with a second selected one of the cooperating portion and the mounting portion, to impede adhesion of the shell plate and the lifter bar to each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to a mill liner assembly to be mounted on a shell of a grinding mill, the mill liner assembly including a layer providing a substantially non-sticking surface for impeding adhesion of elements of the mill liner assembly with each other or with the shell.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As is well known in the art, an inner diameter of a shell of a grinding mill typically is lined with a mill liner, for wear protection, i.e., to protect the shell. The mill liner may include, for instance, shell plates positioned on the inner diameter so as to substantially cover the shell's inner diameter, and lifter bars spaced apart from each other, with the shell plates positioned between the lifter bars and the shell. The heads of bolts extending through the shell are held in the lifter bars respectively, so that tightening nuts on the portions of the bolts extending outside the shell urges the lifter bars against the shell plates and ultimately the shell, for securing the lifter bars and shell plates to the shell. The lifter bars are positioned to press onto portions of the shell plates, to hold the shell plates against the inner diameter. As is known, the shell plates and the lifter bars typically are made of various materials, for instance, the shell plates may be made of steel and/or a rubber or rubber-like material, and the lifter bars may be made of steel, and/or rubber or rubber-like material.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, once the mill liner has become worn to a certain extent, all or part of the mill liner is replaced. Often, only a part of the mill liner is to be replaced. For instance, the lifter bars may have a substantially shorter useful life than the shell plates on which the lifter bar is at least partially positioned. In this situation, when the lifter bars have become worn, it is sometimes intended to replace only the lifter bars, i.e., where the shell plates still have a substantial portion of their useful life remaining. However, in practice, removal of the lifter bars alone (i.e., without removing some or all of the shell plates) is usually very difficult. This is because each lifter bar, and the shell plates with which the lifter bar is engaged, tend to become relatively securely fused or bonded to each other over time. It appears that the mechanism which results in parts of the mill liner adhering together after use over a period of time has not been studied in detail. It is thought that, where the fused elements include one or more elastomeric materials, the elements tend to adhere together over time due to compression set.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for an improved mill liner assembly in which elements thereof are readily separable from each other after use over a time period.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In its broad aspect, the invention provides a mill liner assembly for mounting on an inner diameter of a shell of a grinding mill. The mill liner assembly includes one or more shell plates for engagement with the shell, each of the shell plates having a cooperating portion thereof, one or more lifter bars, each of the lifter bars having a mounting portion thereof, the mounting portion being receivable on the cooperating portion, and one or more layers having one or more substantially non-resilient materials and a substantially non-sticking surface. The layer is at least partially positioned on at least a first selected one of the cooperating portion and the mounting portion, to position the non-sticking surface thereof for engagement with a second selected one of the cooperating portion and the mounting portion, to impede adhesion of the shell plate and the lifter bar to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of the present invention provides a mill liner assembly for mounting on an inner diameter of a shell of a grinding mill. The mill liner assembly includes one or more shell plates for engagement with the shell, each of the shell plates having a cooperating portion thereof, one or more lifter bars, each of the lifter bars having a mounting portion thereof, the mounting portion being receivable on the cooperating portion, and two or more layers, each of the layers having one or more substantially non-resilient materials and a substantially non-sticking surface. The layers are respectively positioned, at least partially, on the cooperating portion and the mounting portion, to position the respective non-sticking surfaces of the layers for engagement with each other, to impede adhesion of the shell plate and the lifter bar to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of forming a mill liner assembly for mounting on an inner diameter of a shell of a grinding mill.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the attached drawings, like reference numerals designate corresponding elements throughout. Reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>7</b>A-<b>10</b> to describe an embodiment of a mill liner assembly of the invention referred to generally by the numeral <b>20</b>. The mill liner assembly <b>20</b> is for mounting on an inner diameter <b>22</b> of a shell <b>24</b> of a grinding mill <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). In one embodiment, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes one or more shell plates <b>28</b> for engagement with the shell <b>24</b>, each shell plate <b>28</b> having a cooperating portion <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D, <b>4</b>B, <b>7</b>B). It is also preferred that the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> includes one or more lifter bars <b>32</b>, each lifter bar <b>32</b> having a mounting portion <b>34</b> thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The mounting portion <b>34</b> preferably is receivable on the cooperating portion <b>30</b>, as will be described. Preferably, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> also includes one or more layers <b>36</b> including one or more substantially non-resilient materials and a substantially non-sticking (i.e., non-adhesive) surface <b>38</b>. In one embodiment, it is preferred that the layer <b>36</b> is at least partially positioned on at least a first selected one of the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and the mounting portion <b>34</b>, to position the non-sticking surface <b>38</b> thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D</figref>, <b>4</b>B) for engagement with a second selected one (i.e., the other one) of the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and the mounting portion <b>34</b>, to impede adhesion of the shell plate <b>28</b> and the lifter bar <b>32</b> with each other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>1</b>D). As will be described, because of the layer <b>36</b> positioned therebetween, the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> are relatively easily separable from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, it is also preferred that the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> also includes one or more fastener subassemblies <b>40</b>, for at least partially securing the shell plates <b>28</b> and the lifter bars <b>32</b> to the shell <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be understood that the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes a number of shell plates <b>28</b> and a number of lifter bars <b>32</b> that, once installed, are positioned around a circumference of the inner diameter <b>22</b> of the shell <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The shell plates <b>28</b> preferably engage a shell surface <b>29</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) at least partially defining the inner diameter <b>22</b>. For clarity of illustration, only a portion of the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. A cross-section of a portion of an embodiment of the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is an exploded view from which the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> has been omitted, for clarity of illustration. As will be described, in one embodiment, the lifter bar <b>32</b> preferably is positioned on two shell plates, designated <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> for convenience. However, it will be understood that the single lifter bar <b>32</b> may alternatively be positioned on a single shell plate <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, the layer <b>36</b> is shown mounted on the cooperating portion <b>30</b> of the shell plate(s) <b>28</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1D</figref>, the substantially non-sticking surface <b>38</b> is positioned for engagement with the mounting portion <b>34</b> of the lifter bar <b>32</b>. Accordingly, in the embodiment of the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1D</figref>, the &#x201c;first selected one&#x201d; (i.e., of the cooperating and mounting portions <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>) is the cooperating portion <b>30</b>. Also, the &#x201c;second selected one&#x201d; is the mounting portion <b>34</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the layer <b>36</b> is shown mounted on the mounting portion <b>34</b> of the lifter bar <b>32</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the substantially non-sticking surface <b>38</b> is positioned for engagement with the cooperating portion <b>30</b> of the shell plate(s) <b>28</b>. Accordingly, in the embodiment of the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the &#x201c;first selected one&#x201d; (i.e., of the cooperating and mounting portions <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>) is the mounting portion <b>34</b>. Also, the &#x201c;second selected one&#x201d; is the cooperating portion <b>30</b>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another embodiment, in which layers <b>36</b> are mounted on both the cooperating and the mounting portions <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> (as will be described), is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various arrangements are possible. For instance, the lifter bars may be mounted directly onto the shell, or the shell plates may be formed so that separate lifter bars are not required, as will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1D</figref>, in one embodiment, the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and the lifter bar <b>32</b> preferably are both made of rubber. Those skilled in the art would be aware of the types of rubber that would be suitable. Also, those skilled in the art would be aware that the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and/or the lifter bar <b>32</b> may be made of other suitable materials (e.g., steel and/or other suitable materials), and/or combinations of such suitable materials. It will be understood that references to shell plates <b>28</b> and lifter bars <b>32</b> do not imply that they are necessarily made of any particular material(s) (e.g., rubber or steel or a combination thereof) unless the context otherwise indicates.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As can be seen, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the shell <b>24</b> preferably includes a shell body <b>42</b> and a conventional elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the shell body <b>42</b> preferably is made of a suitable steel, and the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is intended to protect the shell body <b>42</b>, e.g., from any corrosive compounds that may be introduced inside the shell. Preferably, the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is made of any suitable rubber. It is preferred that the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is relatively thin, e.g., about 3-5 mm. The elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> preferably is glued to the shell body <b>42</b>, using any suitable glue.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the shell body <b>42</b> preferably includes an interior surface <b>46</b> that is generally concave. Accordingly, when the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is positioned on the interior surface <b>46</b>, the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> defines the inner diameter <b>22</b>, which is generally parallel to the interior surface <b>46</b>, and is also generally concave. The elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is at least partially defined by an outer side <b>48</b> thereof and an opposed inner side <b>50</b>. The outer side <b>48</b> of the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> engages the interior surface <b>46</b>, and the inner side <b>50</b> of the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> defines the inner diameter <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, in one embodiment, the layer <b>36</b> is at least partially positioned on the cooperating portion <b>30</b> to position the non-sticking surface <b>38</b> thereof for engagement with the mounting portion <b>34</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1D</figref>, the mounting portion <b>34</b> is engaged by the non-sticking surface <b>38</b> when the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate <b>28</b> are secured to each other and to the shell <b>24</b> by the fastener subassembly <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For the purposes hereof, &#x201c;adhesion&#x201d; means the act of sticking (to something) or the state of being stuck together. As described above, the layer <b>36</b> preferably includes substantially non-resilient material(s), and also preferably includes a substantially non-sticking surface <b>38</b> that, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B-1D</figref>, engages the mounting portion <b>34</b> of the lifter bar <b>32</b>. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, after the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> has been in use for some time, upon loosening and/or at least partially removing the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> so that it no longer secures the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate <b>28</b> to the shell <b>24</b>, the lifter bar <b>32</b> is relatively easily separable from the shell plate <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> that the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> are secured to the shell <b>24</b>, i.e., with the layer <b>36</b> located at least partially between the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> preferably includes a bolt <b>52</b> extending between a head portion <b>54</b> and a threaded portion <b>56</b>. The head portion <b>54</b> is positionable in an insert element <b>58</b> which is an integral part of the lifter bar <b>32</b>. When the lifter bar <b>32</b> is positioned on the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> to be secured to the shell <b>24</b>, the head portion <b>54</b> is positioned in the insert element <b>58</b>, and the bolt <b>52</b> is at least partially positioned in a passage <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C</figref>, <b>1</b>D), so that the threaded portion <b>56</b> extends past an outer surface <b>62</b> of the shell <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the passage <b>60</b> is between the shell plates <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, and also extends through the shell <b>24</b>. The fastener subassembly <b>40</b> preferably also includes a nut <b>64</b> threadably engagable with the threaded portion <b>56</b>, and one or more washers <b>66</b> for positioning between the nut <b>64</b> and the outer surface <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> are to be secured to the shell <b>24</b>, the nut <b>64</b> is tightened, pulling the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> in the direction indicated by arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, i.e., against the shell <b>24</b>, to secure the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> to the shell <b>24</b>. When the lifter bar <b>32</b> is to be replaced, the nut <b>64</b> is removed (i.e., the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> is released), and the lifter bar <b>32</b> is removable from the shell plate(s) <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To remove the lifter bar <b>32</b> from the shell plate(s) <b>28</b>, the lifter bar <b>32</b> is separated from the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and moved in the direction indicated by arrow &#x201c;B&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As described above, because the lifter bar <b>32</b> is relatively easily separated from the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> (i.e., due to the layer <b>36</b> positioned therebetween), the lifter bar <b>32</b> can be removed when it is worn, and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> can be reused, thereby saving significant costs. Also, significant costs typically incurred in the prior art due to the difficulty of removing the lifter bar from the shell plate(s) are avoided, because of the relatively easy separation of the lifter bar from the shell plate(s) in the invention herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Various materials are suitable materials to be included in the layer <b>36</b>. It will be understood that the layer <b>36</b> may include any suitable substantially non-resilient material(s). For instance, in one embodiment, the substantially non-resilient material preferably is ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the substantially non-resilient material includes polytetrafluoroethylene. The non-resilient material(s) may provide the substantially non-sticking surface. However, the non-sticking surface may alternatively be provided by additional material(s) included in the layer <b>36</b>, as will be described. Preferably, the layer <b>36</b> is relatively thin. For instance, where the layer <b>36</b> is an adhesive tape (as described below), it may have a thickness of approximately 0.07 mm (2.7 mil). In one embodiment, the layer <b>36</b> may be applied in the form of a coating. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, because the layer <b>36</b> is relatively thin, it can be retrofit (i.e., included in a mill liner of the prior art that was not specifically designed to accommodate the layer) to provide improved performance. Also, the layer <b>36</b> preferably is sufficiently thin that it does not materially affect the extent to which the lifter bars and the shell plates are securable to the shell by the fastener subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The layer <b>36</b> is securable to the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and/or the mounting portion <b>34</b> by any suitable means.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is also preferred that the layer <b>36</b> includes one or more substantially water-repellent material. This can be advantageous where, for instance, a slurry inside the shell is corrosive.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, in another alternative embodiment, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes layers <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B at least partially positioned on the mounting portion <b>34</b> and the cooperating portion <b>30</b> respectively, to position the non-sticking surface <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B of each layer <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B respectively for engagement with each other, to impede adhesion of the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and the lifter bar <b>32</b> to each other.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the layers <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B include respective substantially non-sticking surfaces <b>38</b>A, <b>38</b>B and respective backing surfaces <b>39</b>A, <b>39</b>B. Preferably, the backing surfaces <b>39</b>A, <b>39</b>B are adhesive, to secure the layers <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B to the mounting and cooperating portions <b>34</b>, <b>30</b> respectively. The layer <b>36</b>B preferably is moved onto the cooperating portion <b>30</b> (i.e., in the direction indicated by arrow &#x201c;E&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>), to locate the layer <b>36</b>B on the cooperating portion <b>30</b>.

It will be understood that the fastening subassembly <b>40</b> is omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> for clarity of illustration. After the layers <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B are attached to the mounting and cooperating portions <b>34</b>, <b>30</b> respectively, the lifter bar <b>32</b> is positioned on the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> (i.e., engaging the layers <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B with each other), and the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> is inserted and tightened, to result in the assembly <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the layer <b>36</b> of the substantially non-resilient material preferably is an adhesive tape having an adhesive backing on the backing surface <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), for bonding the tape <b>36</b> to the first selected one of the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and the mounting portion <b>34</b>, to position the adhesive tape <b>36</b> for engaging the non-sticking surface <b>38</b> thereof with the second selected one of the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and the mounting portion <b>34</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the layer <b>36</b> (i.e., adhesive tape) is shown prior to its positioning on the mounting portion <b>34</b>. (The thickness of the adhesive tape as illustrated is exaggerated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> for clarity of illustration.) In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the adhesive backing <b>39</b> of the adhesive tape <b>36</b> is positioned for adhesion or bonding to the mounting portion <b>34</b>. The adhesive tape <b>36</b> is shown positioned on the mounting portion <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As noted above, the adhesive tape <b>36</b> preferably is relatively thin, e.g., with a thickness of approximately 0.07 mm (2.7 mil).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, it is preferred that the adhesive tape is a metallic foil tape. Where the adhesive tape <b>36</b> is foil tape, the non-sticking surface <b>38</b> is provided by the metallic foil portion thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The metallic foil tape has been found to be effective as the layer <b>36</b>. However, it has also been found that the adhesive tape works well where the substantially non-sticking surface is provided by other materials, e.g., nylon.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, the shell <b>24</b> preferably includes the shell body <b>42</b>, which is partially defined by the interior surface <b>46</b>, and also includes the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> positioned on the interior surface <b>46</b> to define the inner diameter <b>22</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, in another embodiment, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes one or more outer elements <b>68</b> positionable between the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>. It is preferred that the outer element <b>68</b> includes a substantially non-adhesive surface <b>70</b> positioned for engagement with the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>, to impede adhesion of the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> with each other. Preferably, the outer element <b>68</b> also includes one or more non-resilient materials. The same materials that are suitable for the layer <b>36</b> are also suitable for the outer element <b>68</b>. It is also preferred that the outer element <b>68</b> be relatively thin, e.g., as thin as the layer <b>36</b>. This facilitates use of the outer element <b>68</b> in retrofitting. Also, because it is relatively thin, the outer element <b>68</b> is unlikely to materially affect the extent to which the lifter bars and the shell plates are securable to the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the prior art, separation of the shell plates <b>28</b> from the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> can be difficult after a prior art mill liner has been in use for a period of time, probably due (at least in part) to compression set. However, it is desirable to minimize the risk of damage to the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>, because the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> protects the shell body <b>24</b>. As described above, the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> typically is a relatively thin sheet of a suitable material, usually a suitable rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, where the outer element <b>68</b> is positioned between the shell plate <b>28</b> and the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> as described above, separation of the shell plate <b>28</b> from the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is relatively easily achieved. This is because the substantially non-adhesive surface <b>70</b> engages the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>, when the shell plate <b>28</b> is secured to the shell <b>22</b>. The outer element <b>68</b> and the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> substantially do not adhere to each other, even after the shell plate <b>28</b> has been secured to the shell <b>22</b> for some time. Because of this, the shell plate <b>28</b> and the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> substantially do not adhere to each other. Accordingly, when the shall plates <b>28</b> are to be removed, they are relatively easily separated from the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be understood that the mill liner assembly <b>20</b>, in one embodiment, includes one or more layers <b>36</b> as well as the outer element <b>68</b>. Alternatively, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> may include only the outer element <b>68</b>, i.e., without the layer(s) <b>36</b>. For instance, another embodiment of the mill liner assembly <b>20</b>, including the layers <b>36</b>A, <b>36</b>B and also the outer element <b>68</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes one or more protective elements <b>72</b> attached to the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> for engagement with the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> when the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> is secured to the shell <b>24</b>. Preferably, the protective element <b>72</b> includes one or more substantially tear-resistant (i.e., tough) materials, for protecting the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>. Because the protective element <b>72</b> is intended to resist abrasion or tearing when the shell plate is moved relative to it, the protective element <b>72</b> preferably is relatively tough. The protective element <b>72</b> preferably is at least partially made of any suitably tough, and/or tear-resistant material. Those skilled in the art would be aware that various materials are suitable. For instance, it has been found that high-density polyethylene is suitable. The protective element <b>72</b> preferably has a thickness between approximately 12 mm and approximately 15 mm. (The protective element <b>72</b> is relatively thick compared to the layer <b>36</b> because of the significant weight of the steel shell plates <b>28</b>, i.e., to enable the protective element <b>72</b> to resist tearing when steel shell plates are installed.) The protective element <b>72</b> preferably is secured to the shell plate in any suitable manner, e.g., by a suitable glue.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Because the protective element <b>72</b> preferably is relatively thin and relatively flexible, it can be retrofit (i.e., used with prior art elements not specifically designed to accommodate the layer). Also, including the protective element <b>72</b> in the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> does not materially affect the extent to which the lifter bars and the shell plates are securable to the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As noted above, the shell plate <b>28</b> may be made of any suitable material. For instance, shell plates are often made of a suitable rubber, one or more suitable steels or other metals, or one or more suitable ceramics, or combinations thereof. In practice, it has been found that, where the shell plates <b>28</b> are very heavy (e.g., because they are made of steel), there is a tendency to pierce or tear the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> as such shell plates <b>28</b> are installed or removed. For instance, the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> may be damaged when the heavy shell plates <b>28</b> are dragged over the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b>, to make small adjustments in the shell plates' positions. Accordingly, the invention provides the protective element <b>72</b>, for further protecting the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> in this situation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> preferably are secured to the shell <b>24</b> by the fastener assembly <b>40</b>. As can be seen, for instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> includes the bolt <b>52</b> which is at least partially positioned in the passage <b>60</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that the passage <b>60</b> includes an opening <b>74</b> in the shell <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the shell <b>22</b> includes the opening <b>74</b>, in which the fastener subassembly <b>40</b> is at least partially positionable, as described above, to secure the shell plate(s) (and the lifter bar) to the shell <b>22</b>. Preferably, and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the protective element <b>72</b> includes one or more apertures <b>76</b> positioned to register with the opening <b>74</b> in the shell <b>22</b>, to permit the fastening subassemblies <b>40</b> to be positioned at least partially in the apertures <b>76</b>. Advantageously, with the apertures <b>76</b> preformed in the protective element <b>72</b> to register with the openings before the protective element <b>72</b> is attached to the shell plate(s) <b>28</b>, the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> are more quickly installed than in the prior art. (In the prior art, apertures intended to register with the openings typically are manually formed during installation, in a labor-intensive process.)</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It will be understood that the protective element <b>72</b> may be used regardless of whether the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> includes any one or more of the layers <b>36</b>. From the foregoing it can be seen that, because of the protective element <b>72</b>, the risk of damage to the elastomeric sheet <b>44</b> is significantly decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In use, the mill liner assembly <b>20</b> is formed by an embodiment of a method <b>101</b> of the invention including the steps of providing one or more shell plates <b>28</b> for engagement with the shell <b>22</b>, each shell plate <b>28</b> including the cooperating portion <b>30</b> thereof (step <b>103</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The method <b>101</b> also includes the step of providing one or more lifter bars <b>32</b>, each lifter bar <b>32</b> including the mounting portion <b>34</b> thereof, the mounting portion <b>34</b> being receivable on the cooperating portion <b>30</b> (step <b>105</b>). Also, the method <b>201</b> includes the step of positioning one or more layers <b>36</b> including the substantially non-resilient material and the substantially non-sticking surface <b>38</b> on at least the first selected one of the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and the mounting portion <b>34</b>, to position the non-sticking surface <b>38</b> thereof for engagement with the second selected one of the cooperating portion <b>30</b> and the mounting portion <b>34</b>, to impede adhesion of the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> and the lifter bar <b>32</b> to each other (step <b>107</b>). Because of the layer <b>36</b>, the lifter bar <b>32</b> and the shell plate(s) <b>28</b> are relatively easily separable from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain steps of the method <b>101</b> may be performed in an alternative sequence.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In another embodiment, a mill liner assembly <b>720</b> of the invention includes one or more lifter bars <b>732</b> for engagement with a shell surface <b>729</b> defining an inner diameter <b>722</b> of a shell <b>724</b> of a grinding mill <b>726</b>. Each of the lifter bars <b>732</b> includes a mounting portion <b>734</b> which is receivable on the shell surface <b>729</b>. Preferably, the mill liner assembly <b>720</b> also includes one or more layers <b>736</b> including one or more non-resilient materials, and a substantially non-sticking surface <b>738</b> that is at least partially positioned on a first selected one of the mounting portion <b>734</b> and the shell surface <b>729</b>, to position the non-sticking surface <b>738</b> for engagement with a second selected one (i.e., the other one) of the mounting portion <b>734</b> and the shell surface <b>729</b>, to impede adhesion of the lifter bar <b>732</b> and the shell <b>724</b> to each other. Because of the layer <b>736</b>, the lifter bar <b>732</b> is relatively easily separable from the shell <b>724</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, in the mill liner assembly <b>720</b>, the lifter bar <b>732</b> is designed to be mounted directly on the shell <b>724</b>. It will be understood that fastener subassemblies are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> for clarity of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the layer <b>736</b> is mounted on the lifter bar <b>732</b>, so that the non-sticking surface <b>738</b> is positioned for engagement with the shell surface <b>729</b>.

Due to the non-sticking surface <b>738</b>, the lifter bar <b>732</b> can relatively easily be separated from the shell (i.e., from the shell surface <b>729</b>), resulting in lower installation costs.</p>
