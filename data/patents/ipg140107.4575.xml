<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application is related to U.S. Patent Application entitled &#x201c;EDGE DEVICE RECEPTION VERIFICATION/NON-RECEPTION VERIFICATION LINKS TO DIFFERING DEVICES, having application Ser. No. 12/172,130, filed Jul. 11, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to video/audio content transport, and more particularly to the preparation, transportation, and receipt of such video/audio content.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The broadcast of digitized video/audio information (multimedia content) is well known. Limited access communication networks such as cable television systems, satellite television systems, and direct broadcast television systems support delivery of digitized multimedia content via controlled transport medium. In the case of a cable modem system, a dedicated network that includes cable modem plant is carefully controlled by the cable system provider to ensure that the multimedia content is robustly delivered to subscribers' receivers. Likewise, with satellite television systems, dedicated wireless spectrum robustly carries the multi-media content to subscribers' receivers. Further, in direct broadcast television systems such as High Definition (HD) broadcast systems, dedicated wireless spectrum robustly delivers the multi-media content from a transmitting tower to receiving devices. Robust delivery, resulting in timely receipt of the multimedia content by a receiving device is critical for the quality of delivered video and audio.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some of these limited access communication networks now support on-demand programming in which multimedia content is directed to one, or a relatively few number of receiving devices. The number of on-demand programs that can be serviced by each of these types of systems depends upon, among other things, the availability of data throughput between a multimedia source device and the one or more receiving devices. Generally, this on-demand programming is initiated by one or more subscribers and serviced only upon initiation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Publicly accessible communication networks, e.g., Local Area Networks (LANs), Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), Wireless Wide Area Networks (WWANs), and cellular telephone networks, have evolved to the point where they now are capable of providing data rates sufficient to service streamed multimedia content. The format of the streamed multimedia content is similar/same as that that is serviced by the limited access networks, e.g., cable networks, satellite networks. However, each of these communication networks is shared by many users that compete for available data throughput. Resultantly, streamed multimedia content is typically not given preferential treatment by these networks.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Generally, streamed multimedia content is formed/created by a first electronic device, e.g., web server, personal computer, user equipment, etc., transmitted across one or more communication networks, and received and processed by a second electronic device, e.g., personal computer, laptop computer, cellular telephone, WLAN device, or WWAN device. In creating the multimedia content, the first electronic device obtains/retrieves multimedia content from a video camera or from a storage device, for example, and encodes the multimedia content to create encoded audio and video frames according to a standard format, e.g., Quicktime, (motion picture expert group) MPEG-2, MPEG-4, or H.264, for example. The encoded audio and video frames are placed into data packets that are sequentially transmitted from the first electronic device onto a servicing communication network, the data packets addressed to one or more second electronic device(s). The sequentially transmitted sequence of encoded audio/video frames may be referred to as a video stream or an audio/video stream. One or more communication networks carry the data packets to the second electronic device. The second electronic device receives the data packets, reorders the data packets if required, and extracts the encoded audio and video frames from the data packets. A decoder of the second electronic device decodes the encoded audio and/or video frames to produce audio and video data. The second electronic device then stores the video/audio data and/or presents the video/audio data to a user via a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The audio/video stream may be carried by one or more of a number of differing types of communication networks, e.g., LANs, WANs, the Internet, WWANs, WLANs, cellular networks, etc. Some of these networks may not support the audio/video stream reliability and/or with sufficient data rate, resulting in poor quality audio/video at the second electronic device. Thus, a need exists for structures and operations for the formation, transmission, and receipt of audio/video streams across such networks. Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations for video stream processing/wireless link alteration based upon location/motion of a destination wireless device according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The operations <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> commence with a video processing system receiving video frames of a video stream (Step <b>102</b>). The video stream may also be referred to as video data without departing from the present invention with the video data or video stream received from a video source. Operations <b>100</b> continue with the video processing system buffering the video frames of the video stream (Step <b>104</b>). Buffering the video frames may be done in system memory or in a dedicated video frame buffer of the video processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Operation continues with the video processing system anticipating a Quality of Service (QoS) available for video stream delivery based upon position and/or motion information regarding a remote wireless device to which the video stream is to be delivered (Step <b>106</b>). While reference is made herein to position/motion information, such reference may mean only position information in some embodiments, only motion information in other embodiments, and both position and motion information in still other embodiments. Based upon the anticipated QoS available that was determined based upon the position/motion information regarding the remote wireless device, the video processing system may perform one or both of Steps <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. With the operation of Step <b>108</b>, the video processing system attempts to alter wireless transmission parameters used to service the wireless device because the anticipated QoS is insufficient to service transport of the video stream. Thus, with the operation of Step <b>108</b>, the video processing system, knowing that the anticipated QoS determined at Step <b>106</b> is insufficient to service the transported video streams to the remote wireless device, attempts to obtain a differing QoS by altering the wireless transmission parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a different or additional operation of the operations <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the video processing system processes the video frames based upon the anticipated QoS as determined at Step <b>106</b> in order to cause a throughput of the video stream to correspond to the anticipated QoS (Step <b>110</b>). Because the anticipated QoS of a servicing wireless network may change over time based upon then current position/motion of the wireless device, the anticipated QoS may be insufficient to service transport of video streams from the video processing system to the remote wireless device at any point in time. In such case, the video processing system processes the video frames of the video stream/video data based upon determined video processing parameters to produce an output video stream that meets the anticipated QoS. According to the anticipated result of the operations of Step <b>110</b>, the servicing transport stream supported by the servicing wireless network will be sufficient to transport an output video stream to the remote wireless device. Finally, the video processing system transmits the output video stream to the remote wireless device (Step <b>112</b>). Various embodiments of the operations <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref> herein. Structures employed to service the operations <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described further herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations for wireless video stream delivery QoS map generation and delivery according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The operations <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> commence with the delivery of streamed video to one or more serviced wireless devices (Step <b>202</b>). The operations of Step <b>202</b> may include the delivery of differing streamed video to a plurality of wireless devices within a common serviced area, the delivery of a common video stream to multiple wireless devices, or a combination thereof. Operations <b>200</b> continue with, for each of a plurality of serviced wireless devices, receiving position/motion information and corresponding serviced QoS for the respective wireless devices during delivery of the streamed video (Step <b>204</b>). The operations <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are performed for a plurality of serviced wireless devices during delivery of streamed video to the wireless devices. Thus, during the delivery of the streamed video to the wireless devices at Step <b>204</b>, the video processing system or another device may request and receive position information and corresponding serviced QoS for each of the plurality of wireless devices during the delivery of the streamed video. Alternately, the wireless devices upload their position/motion information without being queried. The position/motion information in one embodiment will be Global Positioning System (GPS) information captured by each of the wireless devices and returned with respective QoS determined by the wireless devices. The QoS information may be determined by the wireless devices or by another component(s) within the transport path or another component(s) monitoring the video stream delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Operations <b>200</b> continue with the video processing system consolidating the QoS and position/motion information collected during video stream delivery (Step <b>206</b>). The consolidation of the collected information will be performed for all or a subset of the collected QoS/position/motion information captured over a period of time that is considered to be representative of the operations of the respective wireless network within the particular service area. Then, operations <b>200</b> include producing a QoS map for the service area that relates directly to video stream delivery (Step <b>208</b>). As is generally known, video stream delivery has its own unique transport requirement. The transport of video stream requires fairly large bandwidth as compared to other types of data delivered in a wireless network and such bandwidth must be generally continuously available in order to meet the delivery requirements for the transported video stream. For example, as compared to a bulk data delivery to a wireless device, the video stream delivery must have regular access to a transport path to a remote wireless device in order to avoid starvation of a decoder buffer of the wireless device. Further, delivery of video frames of the video stream must be serviced with a fairly uniform Round Trip Delay (RTD) and with fairly low jitter. Consistent RTD allows the video processing system to minimize buffer starvation risk. By delivering the video frame to the video stream with a fairly low jitter, a decoder of the remote wireless device is able to reconstruct a system clock regarding the video stream such that the video stream may be presented to a user with acceptable quality. When the jitter is large, the decoder clock of the wireless device may be unable to adequately reconstruct a system clock resulting in poor video quality and/or decoder buffer starvation or overflow.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Finally, after the QoS map is generated for the respective service area, the video processing system downloads the QoS map for the service area to a requesting wireless device (Step <b>210</b>). The characteristics of a QoS map regarding video stream delivery will be described further herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. An example of the collection of QoS information and respective position and motion information will be described further herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Use of the QoS map by the requesting wireless device will be described further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The operations <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are be repeated over time such that an accurate QoS map for any particular time period is captured and may be downloaded to a requesting wireless device. A user of the requesting wireless device may use the downloaded QoS map in order to alter position and/or motion of the wireless device. For example, if a user of the wireless device is attempting to establish a video conference, the user may determine that acceptable QoS is not available at a current location. In such case, the user of the wireless device may travel to a differing location with a higher QoS available to service the video conference. Further, the QoS map may indicate that a higher QoS for servicing the video conference will be available if the user reduces a rate of motion of the wireless device. In such case, the user of the wireless device may use the QoS map and information contained therein by reducing mobility of the wireless device and achieving an acceptable QoS to service the video conference. As the reader will appreciate, a user of the wireless device may use the QoS map for other purposes as well. For example, the user may use the QoS map in order to determine whether or not to initiate a video streaming operation at all. Further, the user may determine that a cost associated with the video stream delivery based upon the QoS map (cost information may be included with QoS map) is not warranted due to a poor available QoS at a current location/mobility of the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a system diagram illustrating a communication system that operates according to one or more embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a plurality of communication networks <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, and <b>310</b> that service a plurality of electronic devices <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b>. These communication networks include the Internet/World Wide Web (WWW) <b>302</b>, one or more Wide Area Networks/Local Area Networks (WANs/LANs) <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>, and one or more Wireless Wide Area Networks/Wireless Local Area Networks/Cellular networks (WLANs/WWANs/Cellular networks) <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>. The Internet/WWW <b>302</b> is generally known and supports Internet Protocol (IP) operations. The WANs/LANs <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> support electronic devices <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, and <b>320</b> and support IP operations. The WLANs/WWANs/Cellular networks <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> support wireless devices <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The WLAN/WWAN/Cellular networks <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> operate according to one or more wireless interface standards, e.g., IEEE 802.11x, WiMAX, GSM, EDGE, GPRS, WCDMA, CDMA, 1xEV-DO, 1xEV-DV, etc. The WLAN/WWAN/Cellular networks <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> include a back-haul network that couples to the Internet/WWW <b>302</b> and service wireless links for wireless devices <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b>. In providing this wireless service, the WLAN/WWAN/Cellular networks <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> include infrastructure devices, e.g., Access Points and base stations to wirelessly service the electronic devices <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, <b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, and <b>334</b>. The wireless links serviced by the WLAN/WWAN/Cellular networks <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> are shared amongst the wireless devices <b>324</b>-<b>334</b> and are generally data throughput limited. Such data throughput limitations result because the wireless links are shared, the wireless links are degraded by operating conditions, and/or simply because the wireless links have basic data throughput limitations. According to some aspects of embodiments of the present invention, wireless transmission parameters of the wireless links are altered so that sufficient QoS is established to support video streaming operation.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one particular construct of the wireless device <b>400</b>, dedicated hardware is employed for video processing operations and QoS operations. In such case, the wireless device <b>400</b> includes decoding/encoding circuitry <b>434</b> and QoS circuitry <b>436</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the wireless device <b>400</b> services video stream operations and QoS operations using non-dedicated resources. In such case, these operations of wireless device <b>400</b> are serviced by processing circuitry <b>404</b>. The processing circuitry <b>404</b> performs, in addition to its PC operations, video stream operations <b>438</b>, and QoS operations <b>440</b>. In such case, particular hardware may be included in the processing circuitry <b>404</b> to perform the operations <b>438</b> and <b>440</b>. Alternatively, video stream operations <b>438</b> and QoS operations <b>440</b> are performed by the execution of software instructions using generalized hardware (or a combination of generalized hardware and dedicated hardware).

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Generally, the wireless device <b>400</b> receives a video stream (video/audio stream) that is carried by data packets via the network interface <b>408</b> and processes the received video stream.

The video processing system <b>502</b> performs the video processing system operations previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and that will be further described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-12</figref>. The video processing system <b>502</b> includes processing circuitry <b>504</b>, memory <b>506</b>, network interfaces <b>508</b> and <b>510</b>, user device interfaces <b>512</b>, and may include video processing circuitry <b>518</b> and QoS Operations Circuitry <b>520</b>.

Memory <b>506</b> may be any type of digital memory, volatile, or non-volatile, capable of storing digital information such as RAM, ROM, hard disk drive, Flash RAM, Flash ROM, optical drive, or other type of digital memory. The first network interface <b>508</b> supports WAN/WWAN/Internet interface operations while the second network interface <b>510</b> supports LAN and WLAN interface operations. Of course, in differing embodiments a single network interface may service all necessary communication interface operations and in still other embodiments, additional network interfaces may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To accomplish its operations, the video processing system <b>502</b> may employ specialized circuitry, i.e., the video processing circuitry <b>518</b> and the QoS operations <b>520</b>. The operations of the video processing system <b>502</b> may also/otherwise be implemented by the processing circuitry <b>504</b>. In such case, the processing circuitry <b>504</b>, in addition to its normal operations, may perform video processing operations <b>522</b>, wireless link operations <b>524</b>, and QoS Map operations <b>525</b>. In its operations, the processing circuitry <b>504</b> retrieves software instructions from memory and executes these software instructions, which include video processing instructions <b>512</b>, QoS/position/motion instructions <b>514</b>, QoS Map operations <b>515</b>, and wireless link parameter instructions <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations for video stream processing based upon location/motion of a destination wireless device according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The operations <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> commence with the video processing system receiving video frames of a video stream from a video source (Step <b>602</b>). The video processing system then buffers the video frames for future use (Step <b>604</b>). The video processing system then receives position/motion information regarding a remote wireless device (Step <b>606</b>). Then, based upon the position/motion information regarding the remote wireless device, the video processing system anticipates a QoS available for servicing transport of the video stream to the wireless device (Step <b>608</b>). Then, based upon the characteristics of the video stream itself and of the anticipated QoS available for servicing of the video stream, the video processing system determines video processing parameters that may be used to process the video stream (Step <b>610</b>). The video processing system then processes the video frames based upon the video processing parameters to produce an output video stream that differs from the received video stream (Step <b>612</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Generally, the processing performed at Step <b>612</b> upon the video stream reduces bandwidth required to transport the video stream from the video processing system to the remote wireless device. Thus, the anticipated QoS available for servicing the video stream for transporting the video stream to the remote wireless device will be sufficient to service transport of the output video stream. Finally, the video processing system transmits the video processed video frames of the output video stream to the remote wireless device (Step <b>614</b>). The reader should appreciate the transport or transmission of the processed video frames of the video stream to the wireless device at Step <b>614</b> may be serviced by only a wireless link as is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> between video processing device <b>106</b> and wireless device <b>330</b>, for example. Alternatively, transport or transmission of the output video stream to the remote wireless device may be made from video processing device <b>206</b>A to wireless device <b>334</b>, for example. In such case, the output video stream is transported via WAN/LAN <b>306</b>, Internet/WWW <b>320</b>, WLAN/WWAN/cellular network <b>310</b>, and via wireless access device <b>108</b>. In such case, the transport path may be bandwidth limited by the wireless link between wireless access device <b>108</b> and wireless device <b>334</b>. Alternatively, bandwidth may be limited via other components along the transport path from video processing system <b>206</b>A to wireless device <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In anticipating the QoS available based upon position and motion information of the wireless device at Step <b>608</b>, the operations <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may include determining a QoS currently available for servicing and transmission to the remote wireless device based upon current position and motion information of the wireless device. Alternatively, the video processing system may anticipate QoS available based upon a predicted future location of the remote wireless device and historical QoS location information. Thus, the operations <b>608</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may consider not only the current position of the wireless device but also where the wireless device is anticipated to be over duration of receipt of the video stream. Thus, in such case, the operations <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> consider that the anticipated QoS will change over time with changing positions of the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations for altering a video stream according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the operations of <b>612</b> are further described. The operations <b>612</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> include a number of particular processing operations. These processing operations may be individually, partially, or fully employed in processing of the incoming video data to produce the outgoing video stream that is subsequently transferred to the remote wireless device. Some or all these operations <b>612</b> may be performed at any given time. Further, in some operations, none of these video processing operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> are required because the edge device simply passes an incoming video stream as an outgoing video stream for delivery to the remote wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The operations <b>612</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may include altering a frame rate of an incoming video stream (video data) to produce an outgoing video stream (Step <b>702</b>). Generally, when the frame rate of the incoming video stream is altered to produce the outgoing video stream, PCRs may/should be required to be altered based upon the alteration of frame rate of the incoming video stream (Step <b>702</b>). Operation <b>612</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may also/alternately include altering a pixel resolution of video frames of the incoming video stream (video data) to produce the output video stream (Step <b>706</b>). In altering the pixel resolution of the video frames of the incoming video stream, the edge device may simply reduce the number of pixels of video frames of the video stream by combining pixel data. For example, if an incoming video stream has a pixel resolution of 700&#xd7;600, the operation of Step <b>706</b> may include altering the pixel resolutions from 700&#xd7;600 to 400&#xd7;300, for example. Of course, altering pixel resolution of the video frames may include moving from one standard pixel resolution to another standard pixel resolution, the second pixel resolution having lesser resolution than the first.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The operation <b>612</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may further include altering a color resolution of video frames of the incoming video stream to produce the output video streams (Step <b>708</b>). The operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may also include removing color content of video frames of the incoming video stream to produce the output video stream (Step <b>710</b>). By reducing the color resolution of the video frames or removing color from the video frames to produce black and white video frames, the data size of the output video stream as compared to the incoming video stream is reduced. Generally, processing of the video stream may be required in order to cause the output video stream to comply with a data throughput support provided by the servicing wireless network (supported QoS).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations for altering wireless transmission parameters of a transport path carrying a video stream to a wireless device in response to anticipated QoS based upon location/motion information received from the wireless device according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The operations <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> commence with the video processing system receiving video frames of a video stream (Step <b>802</b>). The video processing system then buffers the video frames for processing or subsequent transmission to the remote wireless device (Step <b>804</b>). Then, operations <b>800</b> continue with the video processing system receiving position/motion information regarding the remote wireless device to which the video stream will be transported (Step <b>806</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Then, based upon the position/motion information regarding the wireless device, the video processing system determines that sufficient QoS will not be available using first wireless transmission parameters (Step <b>808</b>). Then, the video processing system alters wireless transmission parameters to alter the available QoS to service transport of the video stream to the remote wireless device (Step <b>810</b>). In such case, the wireless transmission parameters that were previously employed to service the video stream or anticipated for servicing the video stream will be altered to second wireless transmission parameters. The second wireless transmission parameters are set or established to a level that is sufficient to service transport of the video stream to the remote wireless device at Step <b>810</b>. Examples of wireless parameters that are altered at Step <b>810</b> will be described further herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Then, operation concludes with the video processing system transporting or transmitting the buffered video frames to the wireless device using the second wireless transmission parameters (Step <b>812</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The operations <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> will be employed throughout transport of the video stream by the video processing system to the remote wireless device. Thus, the video processing system receives position/motion information regarding the wireless device at Step <b>806</b> to duration of transport of the video stream. Then, the video processing system alters wireless transmission parameters over time in order to service transport of video stream to the remote wireless device at an acceptable QoS. The reader should appreciate that only a single iteration of the Steps <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be required for delivery of the video stream. The reader should also appreciate that multiple iterations of the Steps <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be employed during servicing of the video streams by the video processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to various aspects of the operations of Step <b>810</b>, the video processing system may initiate handoff of the remote wireless device from one servicing wireless access device to another servicing access device of the same servicing wireless network. Further, the video processing system may initiate handover of the remote wireless device from one servicing wireless network to another servicing wireless network. Moreover, in altering the wireless transmission parameters the video processing system may initiate differing protocol stack layer operations by effectively passing the QoS availability between the protocol layers of the servicing protocol stack.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations for establishing/altering wireless link parameter(s) according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the various operations of Step <b>810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are described. Some or all of the operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are employed when altering or establishing wireless transmission parameters. The reader should understand that these wireless transmission parameters may be singularly or multiply set and altered according to various operations of embodiments of the present invention. According to some of these operations, the wireless transmission parameters may be established or changed by setting or altering slot assignment parameters of the wireless link servicing the remote wireless device (Step <b>902</b>). Wireless transmission parameters may also be established or changed by setting or altering channel assignment parameters (Step <b>904</b>), by setting or altering transmit power allocation parameters (Step <b>906</b>), by setting or altering beam forming parameters (Step <b>908</b>) and/or by setting or altering Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) parameters (Step <b>910</b>). The wireless transmission parameters may also be established or modified by setting or altering modulation parameters (Step <b>912</b>) and/or by setting or altering channel coding/block coding parameters (Step <b>914</b>). Further, wireless transmission parameters may be altered by handing off a serviced wireless device from a first wireless access device to a second wireless access device (Step <b>916</b>). Further, at Step <b>916</b>, the wireless transmission parameters may be altered by handing over servicing of the wireless device from a first servicing network to a second servicing network.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations of a wireless device for receiving and displaying a QoS map relating to video stream delivery according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. The operations <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> commence with a wireless device requesting a QoS map regarding video stream delivery (Step <b>1002</b>). Such request may be received by a video processing system as was previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>. In response to a query by the video processing system, the wireless device may send its position/motion vector information to the video processing system (Step <b>1004</b>). The transmission of the position/motion vector information from the remote wireless device video processing system may occur in conjunction with the QoS map request at Step <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In response to its request, the video processing system transmits the QoS map regarding video stream delivery to the remote wireless device (Step <b>1006</b>). The QoS map will have contained thereon indications of location areas within a service area and, for each indicated location area of the service area, corresponding QoS available for video stream delivery. Finally, the operations <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> include the wireless device displaying or presenting the QoS map to a user via display of the remote wireless device (Step <b>1008</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The QoS map, as will be further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, may include QoS information respective to geographic areas identified on the QoS map. Further, the QoS map may indicate to the user the QoS available within a plurality of geographic areas at particular motion levels. For example, the QoS map may indicate to the user of the remote wireless device that a first QoS is available for a stationary wireless device while second QoS is available at a particular mobility of the wireless device. For example, the user of a wireless terminal may receive a lesser QoS when operating the wireless device within a moving car as compared to a stationary use of the wireless device. Further, the QoS map may simply indicate relative QoS qualities available within differing portions of the service area. While the QoS available may not be an absolute number, the relative QoS illustrated will show where a better or worse QoS is available within the service area and potentially within neighboring service areas. For example, as an absolute number, the QoS may indicate a video resolution that is supportable by the wireless device at that location/area/mobility, e.g., 720p, 1080p, etc. Further, the QoS may indicate a frame rate that is supportable by the wireless device at that location/area/mobility. As examples of relative QoS, the QoS map may indicate relative quality levels of streamed video at the various areas/mobility indicated on the QoS map.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a partial wireless network diagram used to describe operations for collecting QoS information for a plurality of serviced wireless devices receiving video streams. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wireless access devices <b>1102</b> and <b>1106</b> service cells <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b>, respectively. Cell <b>1104</b> is divided into sectors A, B, and C, each serviced by wireless access device <b>1102</b>. Served within sector A by wireless access device <b>1102</b> are wireless devices <b>1110</b> and <b>1112</b>. Wireless access device <b>1102</b> serves wireless devices <b>1114</b> and <b>1116</b> within sector C of cell <b>1104</b> and services wireless devices <b>1120</b> and <b>1118</b> within sector B of cell <b>1104</b>. Wireless access device <b>1106</b> services sectors A, B, and C of cell <b>1108</b>. Serviced within sector A of cell <b>1108</b> are wireless devices <b>1122</b> and <b>1124</b>. Wireless access device <b>1106</b> services wireless devices <b>1126</b> and <b>1128</b> within sector B and services wireless device <b>1130</b> within sector C.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, cells <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b> overlap at the intersection of sector B of cell <b>1104</b> and sector C of cell <b>1108</b>. Wireless devices <b>1132</b> and <b>1134</b> are serviced within the intersection of cells <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With the collection of QoS information by a video processing system, the video processing system receives location/motion information of the various wireless devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and their particular serviced supported QoS during video stream delivery to the wireless devices. This information is used according to the methodology of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to create a QoS map for the service area of sectors <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b>. When wireless access devices <b>1102</b> and <b>1106</b> and their respective service cells <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b> are of a common service area, wireless devices <b>1132</b> and <b>1134</b> may be handed off between the sectors B and C of cells <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b>, respectively, to alter wireless transmission parameters. When the wireless access devices <b>1102</b> and <b>1106</b> are of differing service areas, wireless devices <b>1132</b> and <b>1134</b> may be handed over between the differing service areas cells <b>1104</b> and <b>1108</b> when altering wireless transmission parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a display of a wireless device upon which a video stream delivery QoS map is presented according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a display <b>1202</b> of a wireless device <b>1200</b> as shown and displayed thereupon is a QoS map for a service area within which the wireless device <b>1200</b> operates. The QoS map illustrates a current location of the wireless terminal exhibited by a circle/cross <b>1204</b>. Various dividing lines on the QoS map indicate various QoS levels available within particular portions of the service area identified. For example, the QoS map shows QoS levels 1, 2, and 3. With the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, QoS level 1 is the highest while QoS level 3 is the lowest. These may be relative QoS levels, absolute QoS levels, or a combination of absolute and relative QoS levels within the service area. Further identified in the QoS map are geographic features such as buildings <b>1208</b> and <b>1214</b>, monument <b>1210</b>, and road <b>1206</b>. These particular representations of physical features within the service area illustrated by QoS map provide the user the ability to move within the portion of the service area to reach differing QoS level areas.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The QoS levels may include additional information indicating available QoS based upon mobility of the wireless device. The QoS levels indicated may be based upon a current motion of the wireless device. Alternatively, the QoS levels may be based upon a stationary wireless device. Further, the QoS's illustrated on the QoS map may include differing levels within each a plurality of geographic areas, with each of the QoS levels based upon a particular motion of the wireless device, for example. With the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the wireless device presents the QoS map to the user and the user makes decisions on whether and/or what type of video stream session to initiate. Further, with the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the use may choose to alter the motion of the wireless device or to move the wireless device to another location where the user may initiate a video stream session.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other information that may be presented via the QoS map is cost information. For example, in some operations, the QoS map may provide cost of service information, e.g., cost per data unit, that would be charged to the wireless device for the servicing of a video stream at a current and/or various other locations within the service area. The cost of servicing the video stream may be a function of the location of the wireless device within the service area. For example, the QoS map may indicate that it is less expensive to service the video stream within lightly loaded portions of the service area. The user of the wireless device may use this cost information in determining whether to and when to initiate a video stream, e.g., a video conference.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations of a wireless device for receiving and using QoS map information for video stream delivery according to one or more embodiments of the present invention. As contrasted to the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, with the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the wireless device itself makes some/all decisions regarding whether to initiate a video stream session based upon the QoS map. Thus, in combination, the operations described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> describe a range of operations that may be performed using the QoS map received by the wireless device. Based upon the QoS map, the wireless device may simply present the QoS map to the user and allow the user to base decisions upon information presented by the QoS map. In other operations, the wireless device itself makes decisions based upon the QoS map and its current location.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, operations <b>1300</b> begin with the wireless device receiving a QoS map regarding video stream delivery (Step <b>1302</b>). The QoS map received may include information that was previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and prior FIGs. The QoS map need not be displayed to the user. The wireless device may simply use the information contained therein without presenting the information to the user of the wireless device. The wireless device then determines its position based upon GPS receiver access (step <b>1304</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Based upon its position and the QoS map information, the wireless device determines Video Stream Delivery Quality/Options (Step <b>1306</b>) and provides the video stream service options to a user via the user interface (Step <b>1308</b>). These options may include, for example, a resolution currently supportable, e.g., 720p, 1080p, etc., a frame currently supportable, or other information that can currently be supported by the wireless device based upon anticipated QoS (gained from the QoS map information). Other options may include, for example, accepting or rejecting a video call, delaying initiation of a video call, or otherwise affecting servicing of a video stream. Other information that may be presented to a user is the cost of servicing the video stream at a current location of the wireless device and/or at other locations of the wireless device. Based upon the video stream service options presented at Step <b>1308</b>, the wireless device receives user input regarding the video stream service (Step <b>1310</b>). Examples of such input could be direction to initiate a video conference, to receive a video stream, to enter a wait state wherein the wireless device notifies the user when the wireless device enters a portion of the service area having better QoS, to enter a wait state wherein the wireless device notifies the user when the wireless device enters a portion of the service area having lower cost of service, to simply exit its QoS/location operations, and/or a combination of these operations, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">If directed to do so, the wireless device services transmission and/or receipt of a video stream, e.g., servicing a video conference, downloading a video stream movie, uploading a video stream, etc. (Step <b>1312</b>). The operations <b>1300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1300</figref> may be performed multiple times. Such multiple iterations of the operations <b>1300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1300</figref> may be performed during a single video stream session. Alternately, these multiple iterations may occur for differing video stream sessions.</p>
