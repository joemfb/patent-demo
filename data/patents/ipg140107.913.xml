<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to hangers for supporting pipes between building members, such as wall studs, and in particular to a pipe hanger system having a pair of flexible brackets which extend between the building members and a pipe connection member which is selectively slidable along the brackets and then securable in position relative to the brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Stub-outs for faucets, showerheads, and the like are typically supported between wall studs by a plumbing support bracket. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,550,451 to Hubbard discloses a simple bracket having pipe receiving openings spaced along its entire length. The bracket is attachable to the outer edges of adjacent studs by inserting fasteners such as nails or screws through fastener openings located intermediate the pipe receiving openings. The pipe for the stub-out is typically soldered to the bracket in order to fix it in position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Plumbing support brackets of this type have several shortcomings. Firstly, the brackets can be difficult to position in such a manner that the pipe is in the exact location desired. No matter how many pipe openings are provided, the position of the pipe is not universally adjustable. If the bracket is fastened to the studs and no pipe opening is in the desired position, the bracket must be taken down and relocated. Even then, there is no guarantee that the pipe can be properly positioned. Also, soldering the pipes to the bracket is labor intensive and can result in failure of the pipe. In order to allow pipes to be soldered to the brackets, prior art support brackets have been coated with copper oxide after fabrication, a process which produces a very thin layer of copper which can easily burn off during soldering, thereby exposing the steel and creating the potential for galvanic action with the pipes, which can cause leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,882 discloses a valve fixture which includes a valve mounting plate slidably moveable along a pair of mounting straps extending between adjacent wall studs. The straps have relatively wide faces and relatively thin edges. The straps are nailed to the outer edges of the studs so that faces of the of the straps lie generally in the same plane. A valve, such as a shut-off valve for a faucet or commode is mounted on the valve mounting plate and connected to a water supply line. The valve mounting plate may be moved along the straps in order to position the valve into any desired location between the studs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fixture disclosed by the '882 patent provides universal adjustment of the location of the valve, but has a problem with lack of rigidity of the fixture. Because the straps are relatively thin and generally coplanar, they provide little resistance to flexion in a direction perpendicular to the wall, allowing for in and out movement of the valve and its associated supply pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a system for mounting a pipe which provides rigidity and universal adjustability of the pipe position, plus the ability to fix the pipe in position without soldering.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention comprises a pipe hanger system for suspending a pipe between adjacent first and second building members. The system includes a pair of brackets and a pipe connection member selectively slidable along the brackets. The brackets are oriented with their wide dimensions lying in generally parallel planes lying perpendicular to the plane of the wall. In this orientation, the brackets provide excellent rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The brackets may each include an elongate leg and a foot extending outwardly from the leg at a first end thereof. The leg of each bracket is preferably longer than the distance between the building members. The feet of the brackets are first fastened to an inside surface of the first building member, which is typically a vertically extending wall stud or the like. The brackets are typically positioned with one above the other such that the brackets may be referred to as upper and lower brackets. The pipe connection member can then be slid onto the brackets and into the desired position. The pipe connection member is then fixed to the brackets in the desired position using one of several disclosed fixing means. The leg of the upper bracket is then bent upwardly and secured to the inside surface of the second building member. The leg of the lower bracket is similarly bent in a downward direction and secured to the inside surface of the second building member. The bending of the legs serves to add rigidity to the installation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, the brackets may each include a center section of a length selected to fit between adjacent building members on standard spacing and a pair of mounting tabs positioned on opposite ends of the center section. Inward of each mounting tab, the center section preferably includes a respective transverse leg which acts to offset the center section rearwardly from the mounting tabs. Inward of each transverse leg the center section further includes a respective ninety degree twist. The twists rotate the mounting portion such that it lies in a plane substantially perpendicular to a plane defined by the mounting tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The pipe connection member includes pipe support means for supporting a pipe in an orientation extending generally parallel to the planes defined by the legs of the two brackets. The pipe connection member also includes means for fastening the pipe to the pipe connection member. For example, the pipe connection member may include front and rear clamping members positioned on opposite sides of the brackets, each of the clamping members including a respective pipe receiving opening sized to receive and support the pipe. The clamping members may be interconnected by at least one threaded fastener adapted for drawing said front and rear clamping members toward one another and against the brackets to fix the pipe connection member in position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, an elastomeric ferrule is captured between the front and rear clamping members and concentric with the pipe receiving openings. In another embodiment, a collet formed integrally with one of the clamping members replaces the ferrule. In either of these embodiments, when the clamping members are drawn toward one another, the ferrule or collet is compressed against the pipe to fasten it to the pipe connection member. Other embodiments of the pipe connection member are also disclosed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. The drawings constitute a part of this specification and include exemplary embodiments of the present invention and illustrate various objects and features thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Certain terminology will be used in the following description for convenience in reference only and will not be limiting. For example, the words &#x201c;upwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;downwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;rightwardly,&#x201d; and &#x201c;leftwardly&#x201d; will refer to directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The words &#x201c;inwardly&#x201d; and &#x201c;outwardly&#x201d; will refer to directions toward and away from, respectively, the geometric center of the embodiment being described and designated parts thereof. Said terminology will include the words specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof and words of a similar import.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to the drawings in more detail, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reference number <b>1</b> generally designates a pipe hanger system according to the present invention. The system <b>1</b> includes a pair of elongate brackets <b>3</b>, and a pipe connection member <b>5</b> which is slidably mounted on the brackets <b>3</b>. The system <b>1</b> is used for suspending a pipe <b>6</b>, such as a pipe used as a stub-out for a tub spout, faucet or shower head, between adjacent building members, such as wall studs <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. As used herein, the word &#x201c;pipe&#x201d; is to be construed to include any tubular structure, which may be either substantially rigid or flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The brackets <b>3</b> are formed of a rigid yet bendable material such as steel flat stock having a pair of faces <b>9</b> and a pair of edges <b>10</b>. Each of the brackets <b>3</b> is generally L-shaped and includes a foot <b>11</b> which extends at a right angle to a respective leg <b>13</b> at a proximate end <b>14</b> thereof. A plurality of fastener receiving openings <b>15</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are formed through each of the brackets <b>3</b> and extend between the faces <b>9</b> of the respective bracket <b>3</b>. At least one of the fastener receiving openings <b>15</b> extends through the foot <b>11</b> of each bracket <b>3</b> and the remainder of the openings <b>15</b> are spaced along the length of the leg <b>13</b>. Each leg <b>13</b> includes a distal end <b>16</b> opposite the foot <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the pipe connection member <b>5</b> generally comprises a pair of clamping members including a front clamping member <b>17</b> and a rear clamping member <b>19</b> which are interconnected by threaded fasteners <b>21</b> (two fasteners <b>21</b> shown). In a first embodiment of the pipe connection member <b>5</b>, each of the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> comprises a plate having an inner face <b>23</b> and an outer face <b>25</b>. The inner face <b>23</b> of each of the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> has a pair of parallel grooves or channels <b>27</b> formed therein. The grooves <b>27</b> are sized to receive the edges <b>10</b> of the brackets <b>3</b>. The threaded fasteners <b>21</b> each extend through an opening <b>29</b> in the front clamping member <b>17</b> and threadably engage either a receiver <b>31</b> in the rear clamping member <b>19</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), or alternatively, a nut <b>32</b> positioned behind the receiver <b>31</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> are inserted between the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> and in engagement with the grooves <b>27</b>, such that the pipe connection member <b>5</b> is selectively slidably moveable along the brackets <b>3</b>. When the fasteners <b>21</b> are loosely installed the pipe connection member <b>5</b> is freely movable along the brackets <b>3</b>. When the fasteners <b>21</b> are tightened, the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are compressed against the brackets <b>3</b>, thereby preventing the pipe connection member <b>5</b> from sliding relative to the brackets <b>3</b>. It should be noted that the pipe connection member <b>5</b> holds the two brackets <b>3</b> with the respective faces <b>9</b> thereof in a parallel relation to each other. This places the width of each bracket <b>3</b> (between the edges <b>10</b> thereof) in a horizontal orientation which gives the system <b>1</b> additional front-to-back rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to enhance the ability of the fasteners <b>21</b> to lock the pipe connection member <b>5</b> relative to the brackets <b>3</b>, one or more of the openings <b>29</b> in the front clamping member <b>17</b> may include a countersink or counterbore <b>33</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which intersects a respective one of the grooves <b>27</b> such that a portion of the head of a fastener <b>21</b> seated in the countersink or counterbore <b>33</b> will bear directly against one of the edges <b>10</b> of the respective bracket <b>3</b>, thereby allowing the head of the fastener <b>21</b> to bite into the bracket <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pipe connection member <b>5</b> further includes pipe connection means for fixing the pipe <b>6</b> to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> may each include a respective pipe receiving opening <b>35</b> having a minimum diameter sized to receive the pipe <b>6</b>. The openings <b>35</b> are positioned in alignment with one another such that the pipe <b>6</b> may be simultaneously received through both openings <b>35</b>. Concentric with the pipe receiving opening <b>35</b> in each clamping member is a larger diameter counterbore <b>36</b> terminating in an annular flange or shoulder <b>37</b> proximate the outer face <b>25</b> of the respective clamping member <b>17</b> or <b>19</b>. An elastomeric ferrule <b>39</b> having an inner surface <b>41</b>, an outer surface <b>43</b> and opposed ends <b>45</b> is inserted into the counterbores <b>36</b> in the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> from the inner faces <b>23</b> thereof such that the ends <b>45</b> bear against the shoulders <b>37</b>. The inner diameter of the ferrule <b>39</b> is sized to receive the pipe <b>6</b> when the ferrule <b>39</b> is in a relaxed or uncompressed state. As the fasteners <b>21</b> are tightened down, the ferrule <b>39</b> is compressed between the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> and the inner diameter of the ferrule <b>39</b> is thereby caused to be reduced such that the inner surface <b>41</b> bears against a pipe <b>6</b> extending therethrough. The force of the ferrule <b>39</b> bearing against the pipe <b>6</b> is sufficient to fix the pipe <b>6</b> relative to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the counterbores <b>36</b> in the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> may be tapered inwardly toward the shoulders <b>37</b>, and the outer surface <b>43</b> of the ferrule <b>39</b> may be similarly inwardly tapered toward the ends <b>45</b> thereof. This tapered design acts to evenly disperse and thus maximize the clamping forces between the ferrule <b>39</b> and the pipe <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> may be made from a relatively strong plastic such as ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), or glass filled nylon. It is also foreseen that he clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> may be stamped or otherwise formed of steel since copper pipe <b>6</b> may be isolated from the clamping members <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> by the elastomeric ferrule <b>39</b>, thereby eliminating any risk of galvanic action between the dissimilar metals.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, to install a stub-out using the system <b>1</b>, a plumber first takes a vertical measurement along the stud <b>7</b> and makes a mark <b>47</b> on the stud <b>7</b> corresponding to the desired height of the stub-out. The system <b>1</b> is preferably initially oriented with the pipe connection member <b>5</b> close to the feet <b>11</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> such that the plumber can accurately line up the center of the pipe receiving opening <b>35</b> in the front clamping member <b>17</b> with the mark <b>47</b>. Once so aligned, the plumber installs a pair of fasteners <b>49</b>, such as screws, through the fastener receiving openings <b>15</b> in the feet <b>11</b> and into an inner face of the stud <b>7</b>, thereby fixing the height of the stub-out. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plumber then slides the pipe connection member <b>5</b> along the brackets <b>3</b> while taking a horizontal measurement along one of the brackets <b>3</b> to determine the desired location of the stub-out between the studs <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, and makes a mark <b>51</b> on one of the brackets <b>3</b> to indicate the position of the clamping member <b>5</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pipe <b>6</b> for the stub-out is then inserted through the pipe receiving openings <b>35</b> and ferrule <b>39</b>. The fasteners <b>21</b> are then tightened while keeping the clamping member <b>5</b> in alignment with the mark <b>51</b>, thereby simultaneously fixing the horizontal location of the stub-out and locking the pipe <b>6</b> relative to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Once the pipe connection member <b>5</b> is fixed to the brackets <b>3</b>, the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> are bent outwardly until their respective distal ends <b>16</b> can be brought into contact with the inner face of the stud <b>8</b>. Fasteners <b>49</b> are then installed through one or more of the fastener receiving holes <b>15</b> proximate the distal end <b>16</b> of each leg <b>13</b> and into the stud <b>8</b>, thereby securing the brackets <b>3</b> to the studs <b>8</b>. The outward angle created by bending the legs <b>13</b> adds additional bracing to the installation and increases the rigidity of the brackets <b>3</b> relative to the studs <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a first alternative embodiment of the pipe connection member <b>5</b> is used for supporting flexible pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032;, such as PEX (cross-linked Polyethylene) tubing, and is designated herein as pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032;. As was the case with the pipe connection member <b>5</b>, the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032; includes a front clamping member <b>17</b>&#x2032; and a rear clamping member <b>19</b>&#x2032; connected by threaded fasteners <b>21</b>&#x2032;. The rear clamping member <b>19</b>&#x2032; is similar to the rear clamping member <b>19</b> of the pipe connection member <b>5</b> and includes an inner face <b>23</b>&#x2032; having a pair of parallel grooves or channels <b>27</b>&#x2032; formed therein. A plurality of fastener receivers <b>31</b>&#x2032; and a pipe receiving opening <b>35</b>&#x2032; extend through the rear clamping member <b>19</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The front clamping member <b>17</b>&#x2032; includes a plate <b>53</b> and a tubing support <b>55</b> which is rigidly attached to the plate <b>53</b>. The support <b>55</b> extends rearwardly from the front clamping member <b>17</b>&#x2032; and through the pipe receiving opening <b>35</b>&#x2032; in the rear clamping member <b>19</b>&#x2032;. The plate <b>53</b> includes a pair of rearwardly extending side flanges <b>57</b> spaced apart to receive the brackets <b>3</b> therebetween. The tubing support <b>55</b> generally comprises an arcuate trough sized to receive the flexible pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; and support it through a ninety degree bend. The support <b>55</b> is generally semicircular in cross section and presents a pair of opposed edges <b>59</b> defining an elongate trough opening <b>61</b>. The plate <b>53</b> includes a notch <b>62</b> intersecting the pipe receiving opening <b>35</b>&#x2032; through which the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; may be passed laterally into the support <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The support <b>55</b> is preferably shaped such that the flexible pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; may be snapped into the opening <b>61</b> and retained therein in a bent configuration without additional clamping. Toward this end, the support <b>55</b> includes a pair of end portions <b>63</b> wherein the trough opening <b>61</b> is oriented to one side and a center portion <b>65</b> wherein the trough opening <b>61</b> is oriented upwardly, or at right angles to its orientation in the end portions <b>63</b>. In the end portions <b>63</b> of the support <b>55</b> the edges <b>59</b> act to keep the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; bent. In the center portion <b>65</b> of the support <b>55</b> the edges <b>59</b> keep the pipe from slipping sideways out of the support <b>55</b>. The friction between the support <b>55</b> and the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; is generally sufficient to keep the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; from pulling easily out of the support <b>55</b> in an axial direction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When using the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032;, the system <b>1</b> is installed in the same manner as described above for the pipe connection member <b>5</b>, except that since the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; is flexible, it may be connected to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032; either before or after it is moved into its final position along the brackets <b>3</b>. Also, the tightening of the fasteners <b>21</b>&#x2032; to lock the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032; relative to the brackets <b>3</b> does not also lock the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; relative to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032;. The tubing support <b>55</b> serves as the pipe connection means for fixing the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A second alternative embodiment of the pipe connection member, pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2033; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2033; is of a one-piece molded construction and includes upper and lower bracket receivers <b>27</b>&#x2033; for receiving the brackets <b>3</b> and a pipe receiving opening <b>35</b>&#x2033; for receiving the pipe <b>6</b>. The pipe receiving opening <b>35</b>&#x2033; is sized to be an interference fit with the pipe <b>6</b> and includes a slot <b>67</b> which allows the opening <b>35</b>&#x2033; to expand to receive the pipe <b>6</b>. The pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2033; is preferably molded of a material with sufficient resilience that the opening <b>35</b>&#x2033; will return to approximately its original size after the pipe <b>6</b> is inserted and thereby clamp around the pipe <b>6</b> to fasten the pipe <b>6</b> to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2033;, thereby serving as the pipe connection means for fixing the pipe <b>6</b> to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2033;. It is also foreseen that the pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2033; could be formed of the same material as the pipe <b>6</b> (for example ABS or PVC) and solvent welded to the pipe <b>6</b> using conventional adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A third alternative embodiment of the pipe connection member, pipe connection member <b>105</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>. Pipe connection member <b>105</b> is similar to pipe connection member <b>5</b> except that instead of having a separate ferrule (such as elastomeric ferrule <b>39</b>) which is compressed between front and rear clamping members, the pipe connection means of the pipe connection member <b>105</b> comprises a collet <b>139</b> which is integrally formed with either a front clamping member <b>117</b> or a rear clamping member <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the clamping members <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> has an inner face <b>123</b> and an outer face <b>125</b>. The inner face <b>123</b> of each of the clamping members <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> has a pair of parallel grooves or channels <b>127</b> formed therein. The grooves <b>127</b> are sized to receive the edges <b>10</b> of the brackets <b>3</b>. Threaded fasteners <b>21</b> each extend through an opening <b>129</b> in the front clamping member <b>117</b> and threadably engage either a receiver <b>131</b> in the rear clamping member <b>119</b>, or alternatively, engage a nut (not shown) positioned behind the receiver <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The clamping members <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> each include a respective pipe receiving opening <b>135</b> sized to receive the pipe <b>6</b>. The openings <b>135</b> are positioned in alignment with one another such that the pipe <b>6</b> may be simultaneously received through both openings <b>135</b>. The collet <b>139</b> is formed around one of the openings <b>135</b> (shown as the opening <b>135</b> in the rear clamping member <b>119</b>) and includes a plurality of axially extending fingers <b>140</b> (eight shown). The fingers <b>140</b> each include a concave inner surface <b>141</b> shaped for abutment against the outer surface of the pipe <b>6</b> and an outer surface <b>143</b> which tapers inwardly along the length of the fingers <b>140</b> and away from the inner face <b>123</b> of the respective clamping member <b>117</b> or <b>119</b>. The opening <b>135</b> in the other clamping member <b>117</b> or <b>119</b> includes an inwardly tapered counterbore <b>136</b> sized to receive the distal ends of the fingers <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The pipe connection member <b>105</b> is installed generally as described above in relation to the pipe connection member <b>5</b>. When the threaded fasteners <b>21</b> are tightened with the distal ends of the fingers <b>140</b> received in the counterbore <b>136</b> and a pipe <b>6</b> extending through the openings <b>135</b>, the fingers <b>140</b> of the collet <b>139</b> are compressed radially inwardly against the pipe <b>6</b> and thereby clamp the pipe <b>6</b> in position relative to the pipe connection member <b>105</b>. Simultaneously, tightening of the fasteners <b>21</b> draws the clamping members <b>117</b> and <b>119</b> together and clamps the brackets <b>3</b> therebetween, thereby fixing the position of the pipe connection member <b>105</b> along the brackets <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A fourth alternative embodiment <b>205</b> of the pipe connection member is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-13</figref> and includes a mounting block <b>206</b> used in combination with a drop-ear elbow <b>207</b>. Drop-ear elbows such as the elbow <b>207</b> are well known in the art and are commonly used for mounting shower arms and the like. The elbow <b>207</b> includes a body <b>208</b> having a vertical inlet <b>209</b> and a horizontal outlet <b>210</b>. The inlet <b>209</b> may be configured to connect to pipe <b>6</b> of various types, including having a sweat connection for rigid copper pipe or a barb for receiving PEX tubing <b>6</b>&#x2032;, as shown. The outlet <b>210</b> is typically internally threaded to receive a pipe <b>6</b> with external threads, such as a shower arm. A pair of horizontal mounting ears <b>211</b> extend outwardly from the body <b>208</b> on opposite sides thereof and a vertical mounting ear <b>212</b> extends outwardly perpendicular to the horizontal ears <b>211</b> and opposite the inlet <b>209</b>. Each of the ears <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> includes a mounting hole <b>213</b> for receiving a respective threaded fastener <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The mounting block <b>206</b> is used to mount the drop-ear elbow <b>207</b> on the brackets <b>3</b> and includes a pair of parallel transverse slots <b>227</b> for slidably receiving the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b>. A pair of fastener receivers <b>229</b> provided in the mounting block <b>206</b> are positioned for receiving the fasteners <b>221</b> extending through the mounting holes <b>213</b> in the horizontal ears <b>211</b>. An additional fastener receiver <b>231</b> formed in the mounting block <b>206</b> is positioned to receive the fastener <b>221</b> extending through the mounting hole <b>213</b> in the vertical mounting ear <b>212</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the fastener receiver <b>231</b> intersects one of the transverse slots <b>227</b> such that the fastener <b>221</b> installed through the vertical mounting ear <b>212</b> of the drop ear elbow <b>307</b> also bites into the face of the leg <b>13</b> of the respective bracket <b>3</b> inserted in the transverse slot <b>227</b> (not shown) and thereby fixes the position of the mounting block <b>206</b> relative to the brackets <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The mounting block <b>206</b> is installed by sliding the block <b>206</b> onto the brackets <b>3</b> with the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> extending through slots <b>227</b> in the block <b>206</b>. The drop-ear elbow <b>207</b> may be mounted to the mounting block <b>206</b> using fasteners <b>221</b> installed through the mounting holes <b>213</b> in the horizontal ears <b>211</b> either before or after the block <b>206</b> is slid onto the brackets <b>3</b>. The block <b>206</b> is fixed in position by installing a fastener <b>221</b> through the mounting hole <b>213</b> in the vertical mounting ear <b>212</b>. A pipe <b>6</b> (such as a shower arm) is connected to the pipe connection member <b>205</b> by threading an end of the pipe <b>6</b> into the outlet <b>210</b> of the drop-ear elbow <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A fifth alternative embodiment <b>305</b> of the pipe connection member is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref> is used for supporting a flexible PEX pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; in a manner similar to pipe connection member <b>5</b>&#x2032; described above. Pipe connection member <b>305</b> includes a mounting block <b>306</b> and a pipe support <b>307</b> rotatably mounted to the mounting block <b>306</b> for 360 degree rotation. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the mounting block <b>306</b> is formed of sheet metal and includes a front plate <b>308</b> and upper and lower edge flanges <b>310</b>. Upper and lower bracket receivers <b>327</b> for slidably receiving the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> are each formed between the respective edge flange <b>310</b> and a pair of saddles <b>328</b> formed by dividing portions of the respective outer flange <b>310</b> and bending them inwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The pipe support <b>307</b> extends through a pipe receiving opening <b>335</b> in the front plate <b>308</b>. The support <b>307</b> is identical to the support <b>55</b> described above, however, instead of being rigidly connected to the front plate <b>308</b>, the support <b>307</b> is rotatably connected to the front plate <b>308</b> using a pair of collars <b>330</b>. One of the collars <b>330</b> is fixed to the tubing support <b>307</b> (such as by spot welding) forward of the front plate <b>308</b> and the other collar <b>330</b> is similarly fixed to the tubing support <b>307</b> rearward of the front plate <b>308</b>, such that the front plate <b>308</b> is captured between the collars <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The pipe connection member <b>305</b> is locked in position along the brackets <b>3</b> by means of tabs <b>336</b> formed on the edge flanges <b>310</b> of the mounting block <b>305</b>. The tabs <b>336</b> are each bendable relative to the respective flange <b>310</b> and include a barb <b>338</b> which is engageable with any selected one of the openings <b>15</b> in the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b>. To fix the pipe connection member <b>305</b> in position, the tabs <b>336</b> are bent inwardly until the barbs <b>338</b> are engaged with the selected openings <b>15</b>. It should be noted, therefore, that the connection member <b>305</b> is securable to the brackets <b>3</b> at increments determined by the locations of the openings <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-20</figref>, a sixth alternative embodiment <b>405</b> of the pipe connection member is a pipe connection member for flexible pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032;. The pipe connection member <b>405</b> includes a mounting block <b>406</b>, a pipe support <b>407</b> rotatably mounted to the mounting block <b>406</b>, and a locking wedge <b>408</b> for fixing the pipe connection member <b>406</b> in position relative to the brackets <b>3</b> and for securing the pipe support <b>407</b> to the mounting block <b>406</b>. The components <b>406</b>, <b>407</b> and <b>408</b> of the pipe support <b>407</b> may be formed of molded plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The mounting block <b>406</b> includes a front plate <b>409</b> and upper and lower edge flanges <b>410</b>. Upper and lower bracket receivers <b>427</b> for slidably receiving the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> are each formed through and along the respective edge flange <b>410</b>. The front plate <b>409</b> includes a pipe receiving opening <b>435</b> and a countersink <b>436</b> surrounding the pipe receiving opening <b>435</b>. The countersink <b>436</b> forms an annular shoulder <b>437</b> around the pipe receiving opening <b>435</b>. A dovetail groove <b>438</b> with opposed overhanging edges <b>439</b> is formed laterally across the front plate <b>409</b> forward of the countersink <b>436</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The pipe support <b>407</b> includes an arcuate trough <b>440</b> for receiving the flexible pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; and a circular head <b>442</b>. The head <b>442</b> includes a circular flange <b>444</b> sized to be rotatably received in the countersink <b>436</b> around the pipe receiving opening <b>435</b>. A notch <b>445</b> formed in the head <b>442</b> allows the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; to be easily inserted into the trough <b>440</b>. Retaining clips <b>446</b> integral with the pipe support <b>407</b> retain the pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; in the trough <b>440</b>. The pipe support <b>407</b> is installed in the mounting block <b>406</b> with the trough <b>440</b> extending through the pipe receiving opening <b>435</b> and the circular flange <b>444</b> seated in the countersink <b>436</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The locking wedge <b>408</b> is sized and shaped to be slidably received in the dovetail groove <b>438</b> of the mounting block <b>406</b> and retained by the overhanging edges <b>439</b> thereof. A notch <b>447</b> formed in one end of the wedge <b>408</b> is sized to provide clearance for a pipe <b>6</b>&#x2032; extending outwardly from the pipe support <b>407</b>, but the width of the notch <b>447</b> is less than the diameter of the outer flange <b>444</b> of the head <b>442</b> on the pipe support <b>407</b>. Thus, when the wedge <b>408</b> is slid into the dovetail groove <b>438</b>, the outer flange <b>444</b> of the support <b>407</b> is captured between the wedge <b>408</b> and the annular shoulder <b>437</b> that forms the bottom of the countersink <b>436</b>. The action of the wedge <b>408</b> capturing the flange <b>444</b> retains the support <b>407</b> in position relative to the mounting block <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The wedge <b>408</b> further includes a pair of ears <b>448</b> which extend outwardly from opposed sides of the wedge <b>408</b>. The ears <b>448</b> are generally wedge-shaped, having a narrow leading edge <b>449</b> and a wider trailing edge <b>450</b>. As the wedge <b>408</b> is slid into the dovetail groove <b>438</b>, the ears <b>448</b> are received into respective wedge shaped gaps <b>452</b> formed between portions of the edge flanges <b>410</b> and the edges of the brackets <b>3</b>. As the ears <b>448</b> are pressed into the gaps <b>452</b>, the wedge shape of the ears <b>448</b> acts to tighten the edges of the brackets <b>3</b> against the inside of the bracket receivers <b>427</b>, thereby fixing the position of the pipe connection member <b>405</b> relative to the brackets <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-23</figref>, a pair of alternative brackets <b>503</b> may be used in place of the brackets <b>3</b> with one of the pipe connection members <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>&#x2032;, <b>5</b>&#x2033; or <b>105</b> (pipe connection member <b>5</b> shown), or with similar pipe connection members which accept the brackets <b>3</b> or <b>503</b> laterally into the respective bracket receivers. The brackets <b>503</b> will not work with pipe connection members such as the pipe connection members <b>205</b>, <b>305</b> or <b>405</b> which require that the brackets be inserted longitudinally into the respective bracket receivers starting with an end of the respective bracket.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Like the brackets <b>3</b>, the alternative brackets <b>503</b> are formed of a rigid yet bendable material such as steel flat stock or strap having a pair of faces <b>505</b> and a pair of edges <b>507</b>. The brackets <b>503</b> each include a center section <b>509</b> and a pair of mounting tabs <b>511</b> positioned on opposite ends thereof. The center section <b>509</b> of each bracket <b>503</b> has a length selected to fit between adjacent building members on standard spacing, such as wall studs <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, and includes a mounting portion <b>513</b> which is twisted 90 degrees relative to the mounting tabs <b>511</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Looking at one of the brackets <b>503</b> in more detail, starting with the mounting tabs <b>511</b> and working inwardly therefrom, each mounting tab <b>511</b> has a length selected to generally extend across the narrow dimension of the respective building member <b>7</b> or <b>8</b> (approximately 1.5 inches for a standard 2&#xd7;4 wall stud) and includes at least one fastener receiving opening <b>515</b> (two shown) formed therethrough. The fastener receiving openings <b>515</b> receive respective fasteners <b>516</b> (such as nails or screws) for securing the bracket <b>503</b> to respective the building member <b>7</b> or <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Immediately inward of each mounting tabs <b>511</b>, the center section <b>509</b> includes a respective transverse leg <b>517</b>. The transverse legs <b>517</b> act to offset the center section <b>509</b> of the bracket <b>503</b> rearwardly a distance A from the mounting tabs <b>511</b>. The offset A provides clearance for the pipe connection member (such as pipe connection member <b>5</b> shown) between the front edge <b>507</b> of the bracket <b>503</b> and the wallboard which will be secured to the outer faces <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the building members <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. Inward of each transverse leg <b>517</b>, the center section <b>509</b> further includes a respective ninety degree twist <b>519</b>. The mounting portion <b>513</b> lies inward of the twists <b>519</b> and preferably includes a longitudinal row of openings <b>521</b> which may be used for locating the pipe connection member along the brackets <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In use, a pipe connection member, such as one of the pipe connection members <b>5</b>, <b>5</b>&#x2032;, <b>5</b>&#x2033; or <b>105</b> is selectively slidably mounted on a pair of brackets <b>503</b> with the mounting portions <b>513</b> of the brackets <b>503</b> extending through the respective bracket receiving channels or openings formed in the pipe connection member. The mounting tabs <b>511</b> are secured to respective outer faces <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the adjacent building members <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>. Because of the 90 degree twists <b>519</b>, the faces <b>505</b> of the mounting portions <b>513</b>, will each lie in a plane generally perpendicular to the plane defined by the faces <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the building members <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> (or by the planes of the mounting tabs <b>511</b>). The pipe <b>6</b> can then be installed through the pipe connection member and the pipe connection member can be fixed relative to the brackets <b>503</b> in the same manner as described above in relation to the brackets <b>3</b>. The transverse legs <b>517</b> of the brackets <b>503</b> space the pipe connection member <b>5</b> rearwardly from the mounting tabs <b>511</b><i>a </i>distance sufficient to allow wallboard to be installed against the front faces <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>a </i>of the building members <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, respectively, without the pipe connection member <b>5</b> interfering with the wallboard.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is to be understood that while certain forms of the present invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is not to be limited to the specific forms or arrangement of parts described and shown. For example, although the system <b>1</b> is been described and depicted herein as being for use in supporting a pipe <b>6</b> between adjacent wall studs, it is to be understood that the system <b>1</b> may also be used for suspending a pipe <b>6</b> below a building member, such as a joist, beam, rafter or top plate. Similarly, the system <b>1</b> may also be used to support a pipe above a joist, beam, sole plate, or the like. In these applications, the feet <b>11</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> would be fastened to the building member and the legs <b>13</b> of the brackets <b>3</b> will extend generally vertically. The distal ends <b>16</b> of the legs <b>13</b> may or may not be fastened to adjacent building members.</p>
