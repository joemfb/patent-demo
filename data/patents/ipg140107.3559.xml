<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Power isolation during time intervals of sensitive operations is disclosed. In one embodiment, a programmable chip package includes a programmable chip configured to perform a sensitive operation, and a switch configured to selectively couple a main power source to the programmable chip. The programmable chip package may also include an alternate power source and a controller that is configured to control the switch to decouple the main power source from the programmable chip during a time interval of the sensitive operation, wherein the programmable chip is configured to draw power from the alternate power source during the time interval. The controller is further configured to control the switch to couple the main power source to the programmable chip after the time interval.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments disclosed herein relate to eliminating the power signature of a programmable chip during a time interval of a sensitive operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Programmable chips, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), are widely used in various applications due to their relative speed and flexibility. Unfortunately, techniques, such as differential power analysis (DPA), have been developed for monitoring variations in an FPGA's power consumption which facilitates reverse engineering of the FPGA.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example, an FPGA may initialize from a boot read-only memory (ROM) which contains data that configures the FPGA to perform a desired function. The data on the boot ROM may be encrypted to prevent reverse engineering of the data. The FPGA, during initialization, reads the encrypted data from the boot ROM, decrypts the data, and loads the decrypted data. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned DPA techniques have enabled individuals to extract cryptographic keys during the FPGA decryption process, making encryption at best vulnerable, and at worst ineffective.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The embodiments set forth below represent the necessary information to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure and illustrate the best mode of practicing the disclosure. Upon reading the following description in light of the accompanying drawings, those skilled in the art will understand the concepts of the disclosure and will recognize applications of these concepts not particularly addressed herein. It should be understood that these concepts and applications fall within the scope of the disclosure and the accompanying claims.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an example programmable chip package <b>10</b> according to one embodiment. The programmable chip package <b>10</b> includes a programmable chip <b>12</b>, which may comprise, for example, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or other type of programmable chip. The programmable chip package <b>10</b> may also include pins, balls, or other electrical contacts (not illustrated) for facilitating communication with electronic components that are external to the programmable chip package <b>10</b> and that may be mounted along with the programmable chip package <b>10</b> on, for example, a printed circuit board <b>14</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the programmable chip package <b>10</b> may include one or more other electronic components, such as a controller <b>16</b> for facilitating functionality described below. However, it should be noted that while the controller <b>16</b> is illustrated herein as a component separate from the programmable chip <b>12</b> for ease of illustration, functionality attributed to the controller <b>16</b> may be in part, or in whole, implemented in the programmable chip <b>12</b> itself. It should also be noted that, in practice, the printed circuit board <b>14</b> would likely have a number of other electrical components mounted with respect to the printed circuit board <b>14</b> depending on the particular functionality implemented by the printed circuit board <b>14</b>, which are not illustrated herein for ease of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The programmable chip package <b>10</b> may also include an alternate power source <b>18</b>, which, as described in greater detail herein, may be used to provide power, such as electrical power, to the programmable chip <b>12</b> during one or more periods of time. The alternate power source <b>18</b> may comprise, for example, a battery, a rechargeable battery, a capacitor, or any other component capable of providing power to the programmable chip <b>12</b> for a period of time. The programmable chip package <b>10</b> may also include a switch <b>20</b> that is capable of selectively coupling a main power source <b>22</b> to the programmable chip <b>12</b>. The switch <b>20</b> may selectively couple the main power source <b>22</b> to the programmable chip <b>12</b> under control of the controller <b>16</b>. The switch <b>20</b> may comprise, for example, one or more metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) switches, or any other suitable switch or switches capable of being controlled to selectively couple the programmable chip <b>12</b> to the main power source <b>22</b>. The main power source <b>22</b> may be mounted with respect to the printed circuit board <b>14</b>, or may be external to the printed circuit board <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Assume that the programmable chip <b>12</b>, during one or more periods of operation, engages in a sensitive operation. According to one embodiment, during a time interval of the sensitive operation, the programmable chip <b>12</b> is decoupled from the main power source <b>22</b> and draws power from the alternate power source <b>18</b>, thereby isolating the programmable chip <b>12</b> and eliminating any variations in power of the programmable chip <b>12</b> during such time interval from appearing on the electrical contacts or interfaces of the printed circuit board <b>14</b>. A sensitive operation may comprise any operation deemed to be sensitive and during which it is desirable to isolate the power signature of the programmable chip <b>12</b> from that of the main power source <b>22</b>. Examples of sensitive operations include decryption operations wherein encrypted data is being decrypted, or any other operations wherein reverse engineering of such operations by a third-party would be undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The time interval during which the programmable chip <b>12</b> is decoupled from the main power source <b>22</b> may be a total amount of time required to perform the sensitive operation, or may comprise a portion of the total amount of time required to perform the sensitive operation. By way of non-limiting example, assume that the total amount of time necessary to perform the sensitive operation is 40 milliseconds (ms). The time interval may comprise 40 ms, or may comprise a portion of the total amount of time, such as 15 ms, 20 ms, or any other portion. In some embodiments, the controller <b>16</b> may control the switch <b>20</b> to decouple the main power source <b>22</b> from the programmable chip <b>12</b> during a plurality of different time intervals of the sensitive operation, wherein the programmable chip <b>12</b> is configured to draw power from the alternate power source <b>18</b> during the plurality of different time intervals. The controller <b>16</b> may also control the switch <b>20</b> to couple the main power source <b>22</b> to the programmable chip <b>12</b> after each of the plurality of different time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example process for power isolation during a time interval of a sensitive operation according to one embodiment, and will be discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Initially, the programmable chip <b>12</b> is provided power through the switch <b>20</b> from the main power source <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, block <b>100</b>). Assume that the programmable chip <b>12</b> is preparing to perform a sensitive operation. The controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to decouple the main power source <b>22</b> from the programmable chip <b>12</b> during a time interval of the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, block <b>102</b>). The programmable chip <b>12</b> is configured to draw power from the alternate power source <b>18</b> during the time interval. After completion of the time interval, the controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to couple the main power source to the programmable chip <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, block <b>104</b>). As discussed above, the time interval may comprise the entire time necessary to perform the sensitive operation, or may comprise a portion of such time.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the alternate power source <b>18</b> may be incapable of providing suitable power, such as a voltage, to the programmable chip <b>12</b> for a period of time sufficient to complete the time interval of the sensitive operation. For example, the alternate power source <b>18</b> may comprise a capacitor, or a rechargeable battery with limited power output characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is flowchart illustrating an example process for power isolation that may be used in conjunction with the process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein the programmable chip <b>12</b> may be interrupted during the time interval to recharge the alternate power source <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Assume that the controller <b>16</b> is able to monitor the power level of the alternate power source <b>18</b> during the time interval of the sensitive operation that is being performed by the programmable chip <b>12</b>. The controller <b>16</b> determines that the power level of the alternate power source <b>18</b> is at or below a threshold power level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>200</b>). The controller <b>16</b> signals the programmable chip <b>12</b> to halt the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>202</b>). The controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to couple the main power source <b>22</b> to the alternate power source <b>18</b> for recharging the alternate power source <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>204</b>). The controller <b>16</b> continues to monitor the power level of the alternate power source <b>18</b> and ultimately determines that the alternate power source <b>18</b> is recharged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>206</b>). The controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to decouple the main power source <b>22</b> from the alternate power source <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>208</b>). A controller <b>16</b> signals the programmable chip <b>12</b> to continue the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>210</b>). The process described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be performed repeatedly until the time interval completes.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example process that may be performed by the programmable chip <b>12</b> in parallel with the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to facilitate performing the sensitive operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The programmable chip <b>12</b> receives the signal from the controller <b>16</b> to halt the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, block <b>300</b>). In response, the programmable chip <b>12</b> saves a current context of the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, block <b>302</b>). The current context may include, for example, the values of various registers, variables, and/or any other information suitable to facilitate restarting the sensitive operation after the alternate power source <b>18</b> is recharged. The current context may be saved, for example, in a memory coupled to or integrated with the programmable chip <b>12</b> (not illustrated). After the alternate power source is recharged, the programmable chip <b>12</b> receives the signal from the controller <b>16</b> to continue the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, block <b>304</b>). The programmable chip <b>12</b> recovers the current context of the sensitive operation, for example, by reading the previously saved current context from the memory (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, block <b>306</b>). The programmable chip <b>12</b> then continues the sensitive operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, block <b>308</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment wherein the sensitive operation performed by the programmable chip <b>12</b> is a decryption operation. In this embodiment, the programmable chip <b>12</b> may be coupled to an external memory <b>24</b>, such as, by way of non-limiting example, a boot read-only memory (ROM). The memory <b>24</b> contains encrypted data <b>26</b> which may comprise, for example, instructions for the programmable chip <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example process for power isolation during a time interval of a decryption operation according to one embodiment, and will be discussed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Assume that a power on or reset of the programmable chip <b>12</b> occurs. Initially, the programmable chip <b>12</b> is provided power though the switch <b>20</b> from the main power source <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, block <b>400</b>). In one embodiment, the programmable chip <b>12</b> and the controller <b>16</b> may initialize in a default sensitive operation state that indicates to the programmable chip <b>12</b> and the controller <b>16</b> that the power on or reset has occurred. The default sensitive operation state may indicate to the programmable chip <b>12</b> that the programmable chip <b>12</b> should wait until the receipt of a signal from the controller <b>16</b> before proceeding.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The controller <b>16</b> determines if a power level of the alternate power source <b>18</b>, such as a voltage level, is at a threshold power level, such as a threshold voltage level, or a threshold current level. In one embodiment, upon power on or reset, the main power source <b>22</b> is electrically coupled to the alternate power source <b>18</b> and begins to charge the alternate power source <b>18</b>. Once the alternate power source <b>18</b> is at the threshold power level, the controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to decouple the main power source <b>22</b> from the programmable chip <b>12</b> for the time interval of the decryption operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, block <b>402</b>). The controller <b>16</b> may also signal the programmable chip <b>12</b> to begin the sensitive operation. The programmable chip <b>12</b> draws power from the alternate power source <b>18</b> and reads the encrypted data <b>26</b> from the memory <b>24</b>. The programmable chip <b>12</b> decrypts the encrypted data <b>26</b>, and loads the decrypted data. In one embodiment, the decrypted data may comprise instructions and other data that program the programmable chip <b>12</b> to perform a desired function. After the time interval completes, the controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to couple the main power source <b>22</b> to the programmable chip <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, block <b>404</b>). While for purposes of illustration the decryption process has been described herein as being associated with a power on or reset of the programmable chip <b>12</b>, the embodiments are not limited to any particular decryption processing.</p>

The controller <b>16</b> determines that the power level of the alternate power source <b>18</b> is at or below a threshold power level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, block <b>500</b>). The controller <b>16</b> signals the programmable chip <b>12</b> to halt the decryption operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, block <b>502</b>). The controller <b>16</b> controls the switch <b>20</b> to couple the main power source <b>22</b> to the alternate power source <b>18</b> for recharging the alternate power source <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, block <b>504</b>).

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an alternate power source <b>18</b> according to one embodiment. In this embodiment, the alternate power source <b>18</b> comprises a capacitor <b>28</b>. The controller <b>16</b> may measure the power level of the capacitor <b>28</b> by measuring the voltage drop between points <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, for example. Initially, to charge the capacitor <b>28</b>, the controller <b>16</b> may control the switches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> to close the switches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> and thereby couple the main power source <b>22</b> to the programmable chip <b>12</b> and to the capacitor <b>28</b>. The programmable chip <b>12</b> may be in a halt state awaiting a signal from the controller <b>16</b> to begin, or continue, the sensitive operation. Over a period of time, the capacitor <b>28</b> charges. The precise period of time it takes to charge may differ depending on a number of factors, such as the power supplied to the capacitor <b>28</b> by the main power source <b>22</b>, the capacitance of the capacitor <b>28</b>, parasitics associated with other electronic circuitry in the electrical path, and the like. Once charged, the controller <b>16</b> may control the switches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> to open the switches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> and thereby decouple the main power source <b>22</b> from the programmable chip <b>12</b> and the capacitor <b>28</b>. The controller <b>16</b> may also signal the programmable chip <b>12</b> to begin, or continue, the sensitive operation, by drawing power from the capacitor <b>28</b>.</p>

The alternate power source <b>46</b> may comprise, for example, a battery, a rechargeable battery, a capacitor, or any other component capable of providing power to the programmable chip <b>48</b> for a period of time. The electronic circuit <b>40</b> includes a controller <b>52</b> that is communicatively coupled to the switch <b>42</b>. The electronic circuit <b>40</b>, along with the programmable chip package <b>50</b>, may be mounted on or with respect to a substrate, such as a printed circuit board <b>54</b>. The main power source <b>44</b> may be on the printed circuit board <b>54</b>, or may be connected to the printed circuit board <b>54</b> through an appropriate electrical interface.</p>

Assume that the controller <b>52</b> makes a determination that the power level of the alternate power source <b>46</b> is at or below a threshold power level. Based on the determination, the controller <b>52</b> may control the programmable chip <b>48</b> to halt the sensitive operation. In one embodiment, the programmable chip <b>48</b> may be programmed to interface with the controller <b>52</b> and to control the programmable chip <b>48</b> to halt the sensitive operation. The controller <b>52</b> sends a signal to the programmable chip <b>48</b> directing the programmable chip <b>48</b> to halt the sensitive operation. Similar or identical to the process described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in response to such signal, the programmable chip <b>48</b> may save the current context of the sensitive operation in a memory, for example (not illustrated). In another embodiment, to control the programmable chip <b>48</b> to halt the sensitive operation, the controller <b>52</b> may halt a clock <b>56</b> that drives the programmable chip <b>48</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, the electronic circuit <b>40</b> may be used in conjunction with programmable chips <b>48</b> that have not been pre-programmed or pre-configured to operate in conjunction with the electronic circuit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the controller <b>52</b> controls the programmable chip <b>48</b> to halt the sensitive operation, the controller <b>52</b> controls the switch <b>42</b> to couple the main power source to the alternate power source <b>46</b> for recharging the alternate power source <b>46</b>. After a period of time, the controller <b>52</b> determines that the alternate power source <b>46</b> is sufficiently recharged, by, for example, determining that the power level, such as a voltage level or current level, of the alternate power source <b>46</b> is at or above a threshold power level. In other embodiments, the controller <b>52</b> may wait a predetermined period of time to allow the alternate power source <b>46</b> to recharge.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller <b>52</b> then controls the switch <b>42</b> to decouple the main power source <b>44</b> from the alternate power source <b>46</b>, and controls the programmable chip <b>48</b> to continue the sensitive operation during the time interval. In one embodiment, wherein the programmable chip <b>48</b> is programmed to interface with the controller <b>52</b>, to control the programmable chip <b>48</b> to continue the sensitive operation, the controller <b>52</b> sends a signal to the programmable chip <b>48</b> directing the programmable chip <b>48</b> to continue the sensitive operation. Similar or identical to the process described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in response to such signal, the programmable chip <b>48</b> may recover the current context of the sensitive operation from the memory, and continue the sensitive operation. In other embodiments, to control the programmable chip <b>48</b> to continue the sensitive operation, the controller <b>52</b> may free the clock <b>56</b> that drives the programmable chip <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment wherein the electronic circuit <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> decouples the programmable chip <b>48</b> during a time interval of a sensitive operation that comprises a decryption operation. In this embodiment, the programmable chip <b>48</b> may be coupled to an external memory <b>58</b>, such as, by way of non-limiting example, a boot ROM. The memory <b>58</b> contains encrypted data <b>60</b> which may comprise, for example, instructions for the programmable chip <b>48</b>. Assume that a power on or reset of the programmable chip <b>48</b> occurs. Initially, the controller <b>52</b> may control the switch <b>42</b> to provide power to the programmable chip <b>48</b>. In one embodiment, the programmable chip <b>48</b> and the controller <b>52</b> may initialize in a default sensitive operation state that indicates to the programmable chip <b>48</b> and the controller <b>52</b> that a power on or reset has occurred. The default sensitive operation state may indicate to the programmable chip <b>48</b> that the programmable chip <b>48</b> should wait until the receipt of a signal from the controller <b>52</b> before proceeding.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The controller <b>52</b> determines if a power level of the alternate power source <b>46</b>, such as a voltage level or a current level, is at a threshold power level, such as a threshold voltage level, or a threshold current level. In one embodiment, upon power on or reset, the main power source <b>44</b> is electrically coupled to the alternate power source <b>46</b> and begins to charge the alternate power source <b>46</b>. Once the alternate power source <b>46</b> is at the threshold power level, the controller <b>52</b> controls the switch <b>42</b> to decouple the main power source <b>44</b> from the programmable chip <b>48</b> for the time interval of the sensitive operation. The controller <b>52</b> may also signal the programmable chip <b>48</b> to begin the sensitive operation. The programmable chip <b>48</b> draws power from the alternate power source <b>46</b> and reads the encrypted data <b>60</b> from the memory <b>58</b> during the time interval. The programmable chip <b>48</b> decrypts the encrypted data <b>60</b>, and loads the decrypted data. In one embodiment, the decrypted data may comprise instructions and other data that programs, or otherwise configures, the programmable chip <b>48</b> to perform a desired function. After the duration of the time interval, the controller <b>52</b> controls the switch <b>42</b> to couple the main power source <b>44</b> to the programmable chip <b>48</b>.</p>
