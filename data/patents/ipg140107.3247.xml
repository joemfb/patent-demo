<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to semiconductor photosensors and methods of operation thereof and, more particularly, to CMOS sensors and methods of operation thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">CMOS image sensors are used to transform incident light energy into electrical signals, and are widely used in devices such as digital cameras and video recorders. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a typical photocell of a CMOS image sensor. The photocell includes a photodiode PD that generates carriers responsive to incident light Lin. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in an image capture cycle, carriers are transferred from the photodiode PD to a floating diffusion node FDN by a transfer transistor TTr responsive to a signal S_TG applied to a gate TG of the transfer transistor TTr. A potential developed at the floating diffusion node FDN is proportional to the amount of transferred change, and is used to drive the gate of an amplifier transistor FTr to control a current passing through a select transistor STr. A reset transistor RTr is used to reset the floating diffusion node FDN for a succeeding image capture cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a conventional CMOS photocell.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the present invention provide a sensor including a substrate, a floating diffusion node in the substrate, a photodiode in the substrate laterally spaced apart from the floating diffusion region and a transfer transistor coupling the photodiode and the floating diffusion region. The sensor further includes a photodiode control electrode disposed on the photodiode and configured to control a carrier distribution of the photodiode responsive to a control signal applied thereto. The floating diffusion region may have a first conductivity type, the photodiode may include a first semiconductor region of a second conductivity type disposed on a second semiconductor region of the first conductivity type, and the photodiode control electrode may be disposed on the first semiconductor region.

The transfer transistor may include a gate electrode on a channel region in the substrate and the photodiode control electrode and the transfer transistor gate electrode may be separately controllable. In further embodiments, the photodiode control electrode includes an extension of the transfer transistor gate electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further embodiments provide a sensor including a photodiode including a first semiconductor region having a first conductivity type disposed on a second semiconductor region having a second conductivity type and a transfer transistor having a channel coupled to the second semiconductor region.

The sensor further includes a control circuit coupled to the photodiode control electrode and the transfer transistor and configured to bias the photodiode control electrode to create a majority-carrier concentration region in first semiconductor region near the photodiode control electrode. In some embodiments, the control circuit may be configured to bias the photodiode control electrode to create a majority-carrier concentration region in the first semiconductor region near the photodiode control electrode while causing the transfer transistor to impede charge transfer through the channel of the transfer transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the control circuit may be further configured to allow charge transfer through the transfer transistor while biasing the photodiode control electrode to increase a potential across the photodiode. For example, the control circuit may be configured to bias the photodiode control electrode and a gate electrode of the transfer transistor with voltages of opposite polarities to allow charge transfer through the transfer transistor while increasing the potential across the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other embodiments, the control circuit may be further configured to allow charge transfer through the transfer transistor while biasing the photodiode control electrode to increase a minority carrier concentration in the first semiconductor region near the photodiode control electrode.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a CMOS photocell <b>500</b> according to some embodiments of the present invention. The photocell <b>500</b> includes a photodiode PD formed in a p-type substrate <b>510</b>. The photodiode PD includes a p-type region <b>522</b> disposed on an n-type region <b>524</b>. A portion of the n-type region <b>524</b> of the photodiode PD contacts a channel region CH_T of a transfer transistor <b>530</b>. The channel region CH_T is controlled by a transfer gate electrode TG disposed thereon on a front side of the substrate <b>510</b>. The channel region CH_T also contacts a floating node that receives charge from the photodiode PD, here shown as an n-type floating diffusion node FDN disposed in the substrate <b>510</b>. The photocell <b>500</b> further includes a photodiode control electrode PG disposed on the photodiode PD, adjacent the transfer gate electrode TG. The photodiode PD is configured to receive incident light Lin from a backside of the substrate <b>510</b>. A control circuit <b>540</b> is configured to separately control the photodiode control electrode PG and the transfer gate electrode TG, e.g., to apply voltages S_TG and S_PG thereto. Conceptually illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it will be understood that the control circuit <b>540</b> may be implemented in any of a number of different ways. For example, the control circuit <b>540</b> may comprise circuitry located in and/or on the substrate <b>510</b> and/or external thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, use of the photodiode control electrode PG may allow the photocell <b>500</b> to provide improved performance over conventional photocells. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, during a portion of an image capture cycle in which the photodiode is accumulating carriers responsive to the incident light Lin, the control circuit <b>540</b> may bias the photodiode control electrode voltage S_PG to a first negative voltage NEG<b>1</b> below a ground voltage GND while holding the transfer gate electrode voltage S_TG at the ground voltage GND. In this state, the transfer gate electrode TG impedes charge transfer from the photodiode PD to the floating diffusion node FDN through the channel CH_T of the transfer transistor while the negative voltage S_PG on the photodiode control electrode PG causes a majority carrier concentration to form in a portion of the p-type region <b>522</b> of the photodiode PD near the photodiode control electrode PG. Formation of this majority-carrier concentration region may help to reduce dark current of the photodiode PD. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a subsequent charge transfer phase, the control circuit <b>540</b> may drive the transfer gate electrode voltage S_TG to a higher voltage level sufficient to turn on the transfer gate transistor <b>530</b> while concurrently driving the photodiode control gate voltage S_PG to a more negative voltage NEG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Driving the photodiode control electrode PG in this manner during charge transfer may increase the potential of the photodiode PD, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a potential profile Po<b>1</b> of a conventional photocell along the lines described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> in comparison with a profile Po<b>2</b> of a photocell according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> operated along the lines described above. As can be seen, driving the photodiode control electrode PG with a negative voltage as described above may increase the potential Po<b>2</b> in comparison to the potential Pot, which may help accumulated carriers to overcome a potential barrier that may impede transfer between the photodiode PD and the floating diffusion node FDN.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to further embodiments of the present invention, improved dark current suppression and/or charge transfer efficiency may be achieved utilizing a photodiode control electrode that is coupled to the gate electrode of a transfer transistor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a CMOS photocell <b>800</b> according to some embodiments of the present invention. The photocell <b>800</b> includes a photodiode PD formed in a p-type substrate <b>810</b>. The photodiode PD includes a p-type region <b>822</b> disposed on an n-type region <b>824</b>. A portion of the n-type region <b>824</b> contacts a channel region CH_T of a transfer transistor <b>830</b>. The channel region CH_T also contacts an n-type floating diffusion node FDN disposed in the substrate <b>810</b>. The photocell <b>800</b> further includes an extended electrode TGe that includes a first portion overlying the channel region CH_T that serves as a gate electrode of the transfer transistor <b>830</b> and a second portion disposed on the photodiode PD that serves as a photodiode control electrode. The photodiode PD is configured to receive incident light Lin from a backside of the substrate <b>810</b>. A control circuit <b>840</b> is configured to control the extended electrode TGe, e.g., to apply a voltage S_TGe thereto. It will be appreciated that the control circuit <b>840</b> may be implemented in a number of different ways, for example, using circuitry located in and/or on the substrate <b>810</b> and/or external thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the extended electrode TGe may allow the photocell <b>800</b> to provide improved performance over conventional photocells. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, during a portion of an image capture cycle in which the photodiode PD is accumulating carriers responsive to the incident light Lin, the control circuit <b>840</b> may bias the extended electrode voltage S_TGe to a negative voltage NEG below a ground voltage GND. In this state, charge transfer through the channel CH_T of the transfer transistor <b>830</b> is impeded while the negative bias of the portion of the extended electrode TGe overlying the photodiode PD causes a majority carrier concentration region to form in the p-type region <b>822</b> of the photodiode PD near the extended electrode TGe. Formation of this majority-carrier concentration region may help to reduce dark current through the photodiode PD.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a subsequent charge transfer phase, the control circuit <b>840</b> may drive the extended electrode voltage S_TGe to a higher voltage sufficient to turn on the transfer transistor <b>830</b>. Driving the extended electrode TGe in this manner during charge transfer may lower a potential barrier near the transfer transistor channel CH_T by increasing a minority carrier concentration in a portion of the p-type region <b>822</b> of the photodiode PD near the extended electrode TGe, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a potential profile Po<b>1</b> of a conventional photocell along the lines described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> with the channel CH_T of a transfer transistor turned on, in comparison with a profile Po<b>2</b> of a photocell along the lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> as described above. As can be seen, driving the extended electrode with a negative voltage as described above may reduce the potential Po<b>2</b> with respect to the potential Po<b>1</b>, which may improve efficiency of charge transfer between the photodiode PD and the floating diffusion node FDN.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It will be understood that variations of the structures and operations described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref> fall within the scope of the present invention. For example, while the structures illustrated utilize photodiodes and floating nodes formed using doped regions within a substrate, photocells with similar characteristics may be formed using other structures, e.g., structures that utilize deposited regions instead of diffusion regions formed in a substrate. In other embodiments, a photodiode control electrode structure along the lines illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be controlled to provide operations similar to those described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, e.g., the photodiode control electrode PG and the transfer gate electrode TG may be driven with the same voltages along the lines shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. Although a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the claims.
