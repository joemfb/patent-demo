<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0048753, filed on Jun. 2, 2009, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, the content of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">(1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of synchronizing a driving apparatus and a display apparatus for performing the method. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a method of synchronizing a driving apparatus including a multi-chip structure, and a display apparatus for performing the method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) apparatuses have been used in various applications, such as computer games using high-resolution videos and three-dimensional (&#x201c;3D&#x201d;) images.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In these devices, a motion interpolation frame is typically inserted between a present frame, e.g., a current frame, and a previous frame to decrease motion blur when displaying high-resolution video. Generally, a high-speed frame driving method is used to insert the motion interpolation frame between the present frame and the previous frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, a frame image is divided into a left-eye image and a right-eye image, the left- and right-eye images having binocular disparity, to display a 3D image. Thus, to display the 3D image, one frame image is divided into a left-eye frame and a right-eye frame, and a high-speed frame driving method is used to display the 3D image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The high-speed frame driving method may use a driving device having a multi-chip structure including two or more timing controllers, and may operate at a frequency of about 60 hertz (Hz) or, alternatively, about 120 Hz. In the driving device having the multi-chip structure, however, an image is abnormally displayed when synchronization between the chips is not matched. In addition, waterfall defects and charge rate defects are be generated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention include a method of synchronizing a driving device, which provides benefits that include, but are not limited to, a decreased number of display defects, such as abnormal image display, as well as waterfall and charge rate defects.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a display apparatus for performing the method of synchronizing the driving device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an exemplary embodiment of a method of synchronizing a driving device, the driving device including timing controllers, the method includes receiving data enable signals from an external source. A synchronization signal is generated using a first data enable signal of the data enable signals received by a master timing controller of the timing controllers and a second data enable signal of the data enable signals received by at least one slave timing controller of the timing controllers. The synchronization signal synchronizes between the master timing controller and the slave timing controller.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an alternative exemplary embodiment, a display apparatus includes a driving part and a display panel. The driving part includes a master timing controller synchronized with at least one slave timing controller using a first data enable signal received by the master timing controller and a second data enable signal received by the slave timing controller. The display panel displays a first image on a first display block, and displays a second image on a second display block using the master timing controller.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a master timing controller of a plurality of timing controllers provides a synchronization signal to a slave timing controller of the plurality of timing controllers, and synchronization of the master and slave timing controllers is effectively controlled to substantially improve a display quality of a display apparatus.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various embodiments are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms, and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; or &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, relative terms, such as &#x201c;lower&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; or &#x201c;top,&#x201d; may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the &#x201c;lower&#x201d; side of other elements would then be oriented on &#x201c;upper&#x201d; sides of the other elements. The exemplary term &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements. The exemplary terms &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>

In an exemplary embodiment in which a capacity of the memory is large, e.g., has a capacity of storing more than eight lines of data, a compensation range for non-synchronization between data enable signals may be increased; however, this may increase costs.

When the resolution of a frame image received from the external system is different from the resolution of the display panel <b>540</b>, a scaler (not shown) may be disposed before an input of the data repetition part <b>510</b> to match the resolution of the frame image received from the external source to the resolution of the display panel <b>540</b>. A position of the scaler is not particularly limited in alternative exemplary embodiments.
