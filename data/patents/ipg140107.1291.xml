<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates in general to a support mechanism found in seating and more particularly to a back support adjustment system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Back support mechanisms for ergonomic chairs have attempted to provide sufficient support to the user's back, while providing improved functioning from other adjustment components on the chair. Typically ergonomic chairs are configured to allow for tilting of the seat and back support or backrest as a unit, or tilting of the backrest relative to the seat. However to be able to provide improved back support to a user, the chair should be able to adjust to the overall body posture and relative positioning of body parts so as to ensure comfort and minimize fatigue. The ability for the chair to adjust to the user's requirements is increasingly important, especially in the office environment since the user's tasks can vary and the work intensity of each given task can also vary. As such, the optimal position of the user's body in the chair is critical so as to ensure comfort and minimize fatigue.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore many ergonomic chairs utilize a backrest having a conventional configuration and material. Typically this backrest includes some form of frame having single or multi-density foam padding that is then covered with cloth, leather or the like. As such the backrest deforms to the user's back posture and does not provide the required support. Furthermore many back supports can not be personalized or self-adjusting to accommodate the various positions the user requires when involved in a work task.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus a back support adjustment system which allows the user to self-adjust the back support on an ergonomic chair to a desired position and to allow the back support to move with the user so as to provide constant support to the user's back is desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of one aspect of the present invention is to provide an improved back support adjustment system that can be used in a seating environment such as a chair.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a back support adjustment system including a frame and an adjustable back support system having a back support surface and a moveable tension assembly that is integral within the back support surface. Both the back support surface and the movable tension assembly are adapted to engage the frame so that the movable tension assembly adjusts the tension across the back support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a back support adjustment system having a frame and an adjustable back support system that has a housing integral with a back support surface and a tension assembly movable within the housing. Both the tension assembly and the adjustable back support system are adapted to engage the frame so that the movable tension assembly adjusts the tension of the adjustable back support system through the housing and therefore across the back support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a back support adjustment system including a flexible suspension system having an adjustable and interchangeable flexing means positioned in between a frame and a support member. The back support adjustment system further includes an adjustable back support system having a back support surface and a moveable tension assembly integral within the back support surface. Both the back support surface and the movable tension assembly are adapted to engage the frame so that the movable tension assembly adjusts the tension across the back support surface and the adjustable flexing means controls movement of the flexible suspension system.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated in a perspective view, a back support adjustment system <b>10</b> for a chair in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In the first embodiment of the present invention the back support adjustment system <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>12</b> and an adjustable back support system <b>14</b> having a back support surface <b>16</b> and a moveable tension assembly <b>18</b> that is integral within the back support surface <b>16</b>. Both the back support surface <b>16</b> and the movable tension assembly <b>18</b> are adapted to engage the frame <b>12</b> so that the movable tension assembly <b>18</b> adjusts the tension across the back support surface <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref><i>b</i>, the movable tension assembly <b>18</b> further comprises a series of securing members <b>20</b>, each having a first end <b>22</b> adapted to engage a tensioning means <b>24</b>, and a second end <b>26</b> adapted to engage a releasable locking means <b>28</b> mounted in the frame <b>12</b>. The tensioning means <b>24</b> is a series of tensioning members <b>30</b>, each having a first end <b>32</b> adapted to engage a fixing buckle <b>34</b> mounted in the frame <b>12</b>, and a second end <b>36</b> having an anchor member <b>38</b> adapted to engage the first end <b>22</b> of the securing member <b>20</b>. The anchor member <b>38</b> may be secured to the second end <b>36</b> of the tensioning member <b>30</b> by stitching, glue, screws or rivets or a combination of same. The anchor member <b>38</b> further includes a slot <b>41</b> that allows for the convenient installation and removal of the first end <b>22</b> of the securing member <b>20</b>. More specifically the first end <b>22</b> of the securing member <b>20</b> further includes a releasable attachment mechanism <b>40</b> for engaging the anchor member <b>38</b>, namely the slot <b>41</b>. The releasable attachment mechanism <b>40</b> may be further defined as a T-shaped bar head that can releasably engage the slot <b>41</b>. Furthermore the securing member <b>20</b> has setting markings <b>42</b> for adjusting the adjustable back support system <b>10</b> to different levels of tension and a stopping mechanism <b>44</b>. More specifically the stopping mechanism <b>44</b> may be further defined as a lug head that can secure the second end <b>26</b> of the securing member <b>20</b> into releasable locking means <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref> the releasable locking means <b>28</b> is a release-locking mechanism <b>46</b> and a series of channels <b>48</b> with in the frame <b>12</b>. The second end <b>26</b> is thread through the series of channels <b>48</b> so as to engage the release locking means <b>28</b>. More specifically the release-locking mechanism <b>46</b> is adapted to engage the frame <b>12</b> and is adapted to receive, engage and release the securing member <b>20</b>. Finally the tension assembly <b>18</b> may be a ratchet assembly or dial-up assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 10</figref><i>a </i>the tensioning member <b>30</b> may be a tensioning zone <b>70</b> that is integral with the back support surface <b>16</b>. The tensioning zone <b>70</b> can be made from a wide variety of material such as rigid straps, spring members, elastic webbing, polymer based material, fabric and/or plastic members by way of example only. The back support surface <b>16</b> may also be made from a variety of substances for example, polymer based material, mesh, plastic or fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref><i>a </i>typically the back support surface <b>16</b> is mounted to the frame <b>12</b> by an attachment system <b>50</b>. The attachment system <b>50</b> may further include a series of posts <b>52</b> on the frame <b>12</b> that are adapted to engage a series of apertures <b>54</b> on a reinforcing member <b>56</b> whereby the back support surface <b>16</b> is positioned in between the frame <b>12</b> and the reinforcing member <b>56</b>. The attachment system <b>50</b> may also include securing the back support surface <b>16</b> onto the frame <b>12</b> by screws or rivets, by way of example only, which are secured into apertures <b>54</b> in the frame <b>12</b>. The screws or rivets may be used in conjunction with glue, contact adhesive or Velcro&#xae; positioned on the frame <b>12</b> and/or the back support surface <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The frame <b>12</b> is interchangeable to accommodate alternative shaped frames. The frames <b>12</b> may be rigid or flexible and made out of a variety of materials such as nylon, plastic or polymer based material. The flexibility of the frame <b>12</b> allows for the dynamic movement. The ability to allow for dynamic movement is important in ergonomic seating, as it allows for the chair seat and back, and seat or chair back to move with the user. The movement can be in an aft and forward movement when viewing the chair from the side. The back of the chair can also actually twist with the user's movement. This can be observed when the user does a twisting action such as reaching back and to the side while seated in a forward position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 16</figref>, the back support adjustment system may further include a removable, head support system <b>58</b> adapted to engage the frame <b>12</b>. The removable, head support system <b>58</b> has a height positioning means <b>60</b> and an angle adjusting means <b>62</b>. Both of the angle adjusting means <b>62</b> and the height positioning means <b>60</b> are actuated by a releasable clamping means <b>64</b>. More specifically the head support system <b>58</b> further includes a positioning extrusion <b>80</b> having a head support <b>82</b> at one end. The height positioning means <b>60</b> may be further defined as vertical height positioning clamp <b>84</b>, and the angle adjusting means <b>62</b> may be further defined as a biased locking mechanism <b>86</b>. The vertical positioning clamp <b>84</b> can move the head support to at least four different heights as well as allow for the adjustment of the head support <b>82</b>. The biased locking mechanism <b>86</b> also allows for the fore and aft positioning of the head support <b>82</b>. By way of example the biased locking mechanism may be a push and release spring activated locking mechanism that allows for at least four different positions of the head support <b>82</b>. The actuation of both the vertical height positioning clamp <b>84</b> and the biased locking mechanism <b>86</b> is controlled by the releasable clamping means <b>64</b> which may be better defined as an over-centre clamp that accomplishes both actions with one component.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Finally the head support system <b>58</b> is removable from the frame <b>12</b>. When not in use a headrest attachment cover <b>88</b> conceals the insertion aperture. When the head support system <b>58</b> is required, the cover <b>88</b> is removed and the positioning extrusion <b>80</b> is secured to the inside of the frame <b>12</b> by a series of fasteners such as screws.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In operation, when the tensioning assembly <b>18</b> is a ratchet assembly arrangement by way of example, the securing member <b>20</b> may be a ratchet belt strap that has a first end and a second end. The first end is adapted to engage the tensioning means <b>24</b> or elastomeric webbing system that is adjustable to provide various positions of support for the back support surface <b>16</b>. The second end of the ratchet belt strap can engage the releasable locking means <b>28</b> that engages the frame <b>12</b>. Furthermore the elastomeric webbing system can be described as having a first end and a second end. The first end of the elastomeric webbing system can be attached to a strap fixing buckle that is mounted on one side of the frame <b>12</b>. The second end of the elastomeric webbing system is mounted the ratchet belt strap by a ratchet belt strap anchor. The ratchet belt strap anchor is adhered to elastomeric webbing system by stitching, glue, screws or rivets. The ratchet belt strap anchor may further include a slot that accepts a T-bar head at one end of the ratchet belt strap. The T-bar head of the ratchet belt strap allows for the convenient installation and removable of the ratchet belt strap. The second end of the ratchet belt strap can include markings and a stopper mechanism. Specifically the ratchet belt strap engages a series of channels on the frame and then engages the release locking mechanism or the ratchet lever system. The stopper mechanism is added to the ratchet belt strap once the ratchet belt strap is fed through the channels, therefore ensuring that the ratchet belt strap stays within the system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">By engaging the ratchet lever system namely pulling on the ratchet lever the ratchet belt strap is pulled closer to the end of the frame thereby increasing the tension on the back support surface <b>16</b>. The ratchet belt strap therefore can engage various levels of tension and is held in place by the ratchet lever system. When the ratchet lever is released by a ratchet release button, the tension is released or reduced across the back support surface <b>16</b>. Therefore the ratchet assembly allows for the tensioning across the back support surface <b>16</b> from one side of the frame <b>12</b> to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 18</figref> and in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a back support adjustment system <b>100</b> having a frame <b>110</b> and an adjustable back support system <b>112</b> that has a housing <b>114</b> integral with a back support surface <b>116</b> and a tension assembly movable <b>118</b> within the housing <b>114</b>. Both the movable tension assembly <b>118</b> and the adjustable back support system <b>112</b> are adapted to engage the frame <b>110</b> so that the movable tension assembly <b>118</b> adjusts the tension of the adjustable back support <b>116</b> system through the housing <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The movable tensioning assembly <b>118</b> is similar to the movable tensioning assembly <b>18</b> wherein the movable tensioning assembly <b>118</b> is further defined as having a series of tensioning members <b>120</b> that can be selected from a group consisting of rigid straps, spring members, elastic webbing or plastic members. More specifically the tensioning members <b>120</b> are movable within the housing <b>114</b> that is further defined as at least one channel <b>122</b> that is integral with the back support surface <b>116</b>. There could be a series of channels <b>122</b> that are integral with back support surface <b>116</b>. The tensioning members <b>120</b> therefore can move within the individual channels <b>122</b> as required.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref><i>c</i>, and in accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided a back support adjustment system <b>200</b> that includes a flexible suspension system <b>202</b> having an adjustable and interchangeable flexing means <b>204</b> positioned in between a frame <b>206</b> and a support member <b>208</b>. The back support adjustment system <b>200</b> further includes an adjustable back support system <b>210</b> having a back support surface <b>212</b> and a moveable tension assembly <b>214</b> integral within the back support surface <b>212</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The adjustable flexing means <b>204</b> further includes at least two interchangeable and elastomeric grommets <b>218</b> that are adapted to receive an adjustable fastening system <b>220</b> and are mounted in between the frame <b>206</b> and the support member <b>208</b>. The grommets <b>218</b> can have a grooved circumference <b>220</b> such that the grooved circumference <b>220</b> defines a relief <b>222</b>. The grommets <b>218</b> can have varying degrees of flexibility or durometer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The adjustable fastening system <b>220</b> may be further defined as a single bolt fastening system <b>224</b> by way of example only. The grommets <b>218</b> allow for increased movement of the structure of the frame <b>206</b>, therefore providing support to the person using the chair back when their body moves. The movement of the frame <b>206</b> takes place as a result of both the durometer of the grommets <b>218</b> and the relief area <b>222</b>. The relief area <b>222</b> allows for further movement to take place apart from the improved movement offered by the varied durometer of the grommets <b>218</b>. By changing the durometer of the grommets <b>218</b> and by tightening or loosening the single bolt fastening system <b>224</b> that attaches the frame <b>206</b> and the support member <b>208</b> together, the movement between the support member <b>208</b> and the frame <b>206</b> can be controlled.
