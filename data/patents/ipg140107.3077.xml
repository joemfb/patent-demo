<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a switch unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally available is a switch unit for detecting movement of a target object in two mutually orthogonal directions. The switch unit is used to detect, e.g., the movement (or position) of a shift lever in a motor vehicle. The switch unit of this type is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Patent Application Publication No. H9-196153.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The shift lever for a motor vehicle is moved along first, second and third shift routes L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The first shift route L<b>1</b> is used in an automatic mode (AT mode) having &#x201c;P&#x201d;, &#x201c;R&#x201d;, &#x201c;N&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d; ranges. The second shift route L<b>2</b> is connected to the &#x201c;D&#x201d; range. The second shift route L<b>2</b> is formed into a rectilinear shape to extend in a direction orthogonal to the first shift route L<b>1</b> and is used in switching an automatic shift mode and a manual shift mode (MT mode), which is called a mode switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The third shift route L<b>3</b> is provided with a &#x201c;+&#x201d; range at one end thereof, an &#x201c;S&#x201d; range connected to the second shift route L<b>2</b> and a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; range at the other end thereof. The third shift route L<b>3</b> is formed into a rectilinear shape to extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the second shift route L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">If the shift lever is moved along the second shift route L<b>2</b> from the &#x201c;D&#x201d; range of the first shift route L<b>1</b> to the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range of the third shift route L<b>3</b>, the AT mode is switched to the MT mode. Up-shift is performed by moving the shift lever along the third shift route L<b>3</b> from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;+&#x201d; range (by shifting the shift lever upwards). Down-shift is carried out by moving the shift lever from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; range (by shifting the shift lever downwards). If an external force is removed from the shift lever after the up-shift or the down-shift, the shift lever is automatically returned back to the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range (the neutral position).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the switch unit includes a first switch SW<b>1</b> for detecting the movement of the shift lever between the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range and the &#x201c;D&#x201d; range and second and third switches SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> for detecting the movement of the shift lever from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;+&#x201d; range and the &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; range.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In other words, the switch unit includes three switches, i.e., the first, second and third switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b>. The switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> are stored within three cases <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, one switch in each case. The cases <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> are accommodated in a housing H.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a terminal unit <b>104</b> is arranged within the housing H of the switch unit. The terminal unit <b>104</b> includes three terminals <b>104</b><i>a. </i>Lead wires (not shown) drawn out from the three switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> are connected to the terminals <b>104</b><i>a </i>by soldering or other bonding methods.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conventional switch unit stated above is provided with the switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> for detecting three kinds of operations, namely the mode switching operation, the up-shift operation and the down-shift operation. This poses a problem in that the number of parts becomes greater and the size of the switch unit grows bigger.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the three switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> are stored within the individual cases <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> which in turn are accommodated in the housing H. This leads to a problem in that the size of the housing H becomes larger.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the lead wires need to be connected to the respective switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> and also need to be soldered to the respective terminals <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the terminal unit <b>104</b> arranged in the housing H. This also poses a problem in that the number of parts gets increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A switch unit according to an embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 16</figref>. In the following description, the up-down direction, the left-right direction and the front-rear direction will be defined based on the directions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The front-rear direction is orthogonal to the up-down direction and the left-right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The switch unit of the present embodiment is used to detect, e.g., the movement (or position) of a shift lever (a target object) in a motor vehicle. The shift lever for a motor vehicle is moved along first, second and third shift routes L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b> just like the conventional one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first shift route L<b>1</b> is used in an automatic mode (AT mode) having &#x201c;P&#x201d;, &#x201c;R&#x201d;, &#x201c;N&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d; ranges. The second shift route L<b>2</b> is connected to the &#x201c;D&#x201d; range. The second shift route L<b>2</b> is formed into a rectilinear shape to extend in a direction orthogonal to the first shift route L<b>1</b> and is used in switching an automatic shift mode and a manual shift mode (MT mode), which is called a mode switching operation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The third shift route L<b>3</b> is provided with a &#x201c;+&#x201d; range at one end thereof, an &#x201c;S&#x201d; range connected to the second shift route L<b>2</b> and a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; range at the other end thereof. The third shift route L<b>3</b> is formed into a rectilinear shape to extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to the second shift route L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the shift lever is moved along the second shift route L<b>2</b> from the &#x201c;D&#x201d; range of the first shift route L<b>1</b> to the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range of the third shift route L<b>3</b>, the AT mode is switched to the MT mode. Up-shift is performed by moving the shift lever along the third shift route L<b>3</b> from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;+&#x201d; range (by shifting the shift lever upwards). Down-shift is carried out by moving the shift lever from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; range (by shifting the shift lever downwards). In the following description, the up-shift operation and the down-shift operation will be collectively referred to as shift changeover operation.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If an external force is removed from the shift lever after the up-shift or the down-shift, the shift lever is automatically returned back to the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range (the neutral position).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The switch unit of the present embodiment is designed to detect the operation (movement) of the shift lever moving along two mutually-orthogonal shift routes (the first shift route L<b>1</b> and the second shift route L<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Description will now be made on the configuration of the switch unit according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the switch unit of the present embodiment includes first and second movable bodies <b>21</b> and <b>31</b>, a fixed terminal block BK and a case <b>1</b> for storing the movable bodies <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> and the fixed terminal block BK. The movable body <b>21</b> is moved in concert with the shift changeover operation in the third shift route L<b>3</b>. The movable body <b>31</b> is moved in concert with the mode switching operation in the second shift route L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C, the movable body <b>21</b> includes a base <b>211</b>, a return spring <b>212</b> formed of a coil spring and arranged within the base <b>211</b>, a movable terminal stand <b>213</b> extending from the lower surface of the base <b>211</b> and a movable contact member <b>22</b> fixed to the movable terminal stand <b>213</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a rear view of the movable body <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The base <b>211</b> has groove portions <b>211</b><i>a </i>and <b>211</b><i>b </i>formed on the front and rear surfaces thereof to extend in the left-right direction. Thus, the base <b>211</b> is formed into a substantially H-like cross section. The base <b>211</b> includes a pair of substantially L-like wall portions <b>211</b><i>c </i>formed on the upper surface thereof. The wall portions <b>211</b><i>c </i>are opposed to each other with a specified gap left therebetween in the left-right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The base <b>211</b> further includes a substantially rectangular recess portion <b>211</b><i>d </i>formed substantially at the center of the rear surface thereof. The return spring <b>212</b> is held within the recess portion <b>211</b><i>d </i>in a compressed state such that the expansion/contraction direction thereof runs in the left-right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The movable terminal stand <b>213</b> includes a rectangular parallelepiped base portion <b>213</b><i>a </i>extending in the left-right direction and a connecting piece <b>213</b><i>b </i>extending upwards from the substantially central area of the left-right direction of the base portion <b>213</b><i>a </i>and joined to the substantially central area of the lower surface of the base <b>211</b>. Thus, the movable terminal stand <b>213</b> is formed into a substantially T-like shape. The movable terminal stand <b>213</b> further includes a substantially cylindrical columnar caulking projection <b>213</b><i>c </i>protruding from the substantially central area of the front surface of the base portion <b>213</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the movable contact member <b>22</b> is formed by bending about 180 degrees the longitudinal opposite ends of a strip-shaped metal plate. The movable contact member <b>22</b> includes a rectangular plate-like base plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>and bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>formed by bending the longitudinal opposite ends of the base plate <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The base plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>has an insertion hole <b>22</b><i>c </i>formed in the substantially central area thereof. The caulking projection <b>213</b><i>c </i>of the movable terminal stand <b>213</b> is inserted into the insertion hole <b>22</b><i>c </i>and is subjected to thermal caulking, whereby the movable contact member <b>22</b> is fixed to the movable terminal stand <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>are formed by bending and imparted with elasticity. Each of the bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>has a cutout <b>22</b><i>e </i>formed by cutting away the tip end portion thereof in the left-right direction. As a consequence, a pair of parallel contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f </i>is formed in the tip end portion of each of the bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>with the cutout <b>22</b><i>e </i>interposed therebetween. The tip end portions of the contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f </i>are bulged in the thickness direction thereof to form bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>having a substantially-triangular cross section. This increases the thickness direction elasticity of the contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f. </i>In the movable contact member <b>22</b>, the bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>are bent substantially 180 degrees with respect to the base plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>fixed to the movable terminal stand <b>213</b> by thermal caulking. Therefore, when the bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>of the contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f </i>make contact with fixed contact portions <b>24</b><i>a </i>to be described later, a force is applied on the base plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>in such a direction as to press the base plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>against the movable terminal stand <b>213</b>. As a result, a force acts on the movable contact member <b>22</b> in a direction opposite to the direction in which the movable contact member <b>22</b> is removed from the caulking projection <b>213</b><i>c </i>of the movable terminal stand <b>213</b>. This makes it possible to prevent the movable contact member <b>22</b> from being detached from the movable terminal stand <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the movable body <b>31</b> includes a substantially rectangular parallelepiped body portion <b>311</b>, a substantially rectangular parallelepiped operation portion <b>312</b> protruding from the front surface of the body portion <b>311</b> and a movable contact member <b>32</b> fixed to the body portion <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The body portion <b>311</b> has a substantially rectangular recess portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>formed on the upper surface thereof. The movable contact member <b>32</b> is held within the recess portion <b>311</b><i>a. </i>The body portion <b>311</b> further has a pair of slide grooves <b>311</b><i>b </i>formed on the left and right side surfaces thereof to extend in the front-rear direction. The body portion <b>311</b> includes a substantially cylindrical protrusion <b>311</b><i>c </i>formed in the substantially central area of the rear surface thereof. The protrusion <b>311</b><i>c </i>has a slant portion <b>311</b><i>d </i>whose diameter gets gradually increased from the tip end portion toward the base end portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The operation portion <b>312</b> is formed into a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape to have a thickness smaller than that of the body portion <b>311</b>. The front end portion of the operation portion <b>312</b> is chamfered into a round shape. The operation portion <b>312</b> is integrally formed with the body portion <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The movable contact member <b>32</b> includes a rectangular plate-like base plate <b>321</b> and a pair of bent piece <b>322</b> extending from one end edge of the base plate <b>321</b> in one end direction and then bent 180 degrees. Thus, the movable contact member <b>32</b> is formed into a substantially Y-like shape. The movable contact member <b>32</b> is arranged within the recess portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>with the bent pieces <b>322</b> thereof facing rearwards.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the base plate <b>321</b> has two insertion holes <b>321</b><i>a </i>spaced apart from each other in the front-rear direction. Two substantially-cylindrical columnar caulking projections <b>311</b><i>e </i>protruding from the bottom surface of the recess portion <b>311</b><i>a </i>are inserted into the insertion holes <b>321</b><i>a </i>and are subjected to thermal caulking, whereby the movable contact member <b>32</b> is fixed to the movable body <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The bent piece <b>322</b> is imparted with elasticity and formed into a substantially C-like shape. A cutout <b>322</b><i>b </i>is formed in the tip end portion of the bent piece <b>322</b> to extend in the extension direction of the bent piece <b>322</b>. As a consequence, a pair of parallel contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c </i>is formed in the tip end portion of each bent piece <b>322</b> with the cutout <b>322</b><i>b </i>interposed between the parallel contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c. </i>Bulging portions <b>322</b><i>d </i>bulging in the thickness direction of the contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c </i>are formed in the tip end portions of the contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c. </i>In the movable contact member <b>32</b>, the bent piece <b>322</b> is bent substantially 180 degrees with respect to the base plate <b>321</b> fixed to the body portion <b>311</b> by thermal caulking. Therefore, when the bulging portions <b>322</b><i>d </i>of the contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c </i>make contact with fixed contact portions <b>341</b><i>a </i>to be described later, a force is applied on the base plate <b>321</b> in such a direction as to press the base plate <b>321</b> against the body portion <b>311</b>. As a result, a force acts on the movable contact member <b>32</b> in a direction opposite to the direction in which the movable contact member <b>32</b> is removed from the caulking projections <b>311</b><i>e </i>of the body portion <b>311</b>. This makes it possible to prevent the movable contact member <b>32</b> from being detached from the body portion <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the fixed terminal block BK includes a fixed terminal stand <b>23</b> (a first substrate) arranged in the up-down direction, a fixed terminal stand <b>33</b> (a second substrate) positioned below the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b> and arranged in the front-rear direction, and a terminal holding body <b>4</b> (a third molded member) integrally formed with fixed terminal stand <b>33</b>. The fixed terminal stand <b>23</b> and the movable body <b>21</b> make up a shift detecting switch <b>2</b> for detecting the shift changeover operation.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the engaging claws <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> are formed into a substantially rectangular plate-like shape.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Next, description will be given on the operation of the switch unit of the present embodiment configured as above.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If the shift lever is initially positioned at the AT mode side in the second shift route L<b>2</b>, the shift detecting switch <b>2</b> and the mode switching switch <b>3</b> of the switch unit are kept opened. In other words, no electric connection is made between the three fixed terminals <b>242</b> and between the two fixed terminals <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Subsequently, if the shift lever is moved along the second shift route L<b>2</b> from the &#x201c;D&#x201d; range of the first shift route L<b>1</b> to the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range of the third shift route L<b>3</b>, the operation portion <b>312</b> of the movable body <b>31</b> is directly or indirectly pushed by the shift lever. In response, the movable body <b>31</b> is moved rearwards while compressing the return spring <b>36</b> and is opposed to the fixed terminal stand <b>33</b>. Then, the bulging portions <b>322</b><i>d </i>of the movable contact member <b>32</b> of the movable body <b>31</b> come into contact with the fixed contact plates <b>34</b> of the fixed terminal stand <b>33</b>. In this regard, the tip end portion of the bent piece <b>322</b> of the movable contact member <b>32</b> is bifurcated into two pairs of contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c</i>. This helps increase the contact reliability when the bulging portions <b>322</b><i>d </i>make contact with the fixed contact plates <b>34</b>. Moreover, the formation of the bulging portions <b>322</b><i>d </i>in the areas of the contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c </i>making contact with the fixed contact plates <b>34</b> assists in increasing the elasticity of the contact pieces <b>322</b><i>c </i>and further enhancing the contact reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The fixed contact terminals <b>34</b> are electrically connected to each other through the movable contact member <b>32</b>. The electric connection between the fixed contact terminals <b>34</b> is detected by an engine control unit which in turn performs a mode switching operation for switching the AT mode to the MT mode.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">When the AT mode is switched to the MT mode, an operation member (not shown) operating together with the movement of the shift lever is fitted between the wall portions <b>211</b><i>c </i>of the movable body <b>21</b>, thereby keeping the shift lever in the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range of the third shift route L<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As the shift lever is shifted up and down along the third shift route L<b>3</b>, the operation member pushes the wall portions <b>211</b><i>c </i>and causes the movable body <b>21</b> to move in the left-right direction against the biasing force of the return spring <b>212</b>. More specifically, when the shift lever is moved from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;+&#x201d; range along the third shift route L<b>3</b> (shifted up), the operation member pushes the wall portions <b>211</b><i>c </i>to the left. Thus, the movable body <b>21</b> is moved to the left. At this time, the movable contact member <b>22</b> fixed to the movable terminal stand <b>213</b> of the movable body <b>21</b> is moved to the left together with the movement of the movable body <b>21</b>. The bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable contact member <b>22</b> are slid to the left on the rear surface of the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b>. The bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>of one of the bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>(the left bent piece) come into contact with the fixed contact terminal <b>24</b>A. As a result, the fixed contact terminal <b>24</b>A is electrically connected to the fixed contact terminal <b>24</b>B that makes contact with bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>of the other bent piece <b>22</b><i>b </i>(the right bent piece). The engine control unit detects the electric connection between the fixed contact terminals <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B and performs an up-shift control operation.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Thereafter, if the biasing force is removed from the shift lever, the movable body <b>21</b> is moved to the right by the restoring force of the return spring <b>212</b> and is automatically returned to the substantially central position (neutral position). In this regard, the tip end portion of the bent piece <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable contact member <b>22</b> is bifurcated into a pair of contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f. </i>This helps increase the contact reliability when the bent piece <b>22</b><i>b </i>makes contact with the fixed contact plates <b>24</b>. Moreover, the formation of the bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>in the areas of the contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f </i>making contact with the fixed contact plates <b>24</b> assists in increasing the elasticity of the contact pieces <b>22</b><i>f </i>and further enhancing the contact reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the shift lever is moved from the &#x201c;S&#x201d; range to the &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; range along the third shift route L<b>3</b> (shifted down), the operation member pushes the wall portions <b>211</b><i>c </i>to the right contrary to the up-shift operation stated above. Thus, the movable body <b>21</b> is moved to the right. At this time, the movable contact member <b>22</b> fixed to the movable terminal stand <b>213</b> of the movable body <b>21</b> is moved to the right together with the movement of the movable body <b>21</b>. The bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable contact member <b>22</b> are slid to the right on the rear surface of the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b>. The bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>of one of the bent pieces <b>22</b><i>b </i>(the right bent piece) come into contact with the fixed contact terminal <b>24</b>C. As a result, the fixed contact terminal <b>24</b>C is electrically connected to the fixed contact terminal <b>24</b>B that makes contact with bulging portions <b>22</b><i>g </i>of the other bent piece <b>22</b><i>b </i>(the left bent piece). The engine control unit detects the electric connection between the fixed contact terminals <b>24</b>B and <b>24</b>C and performs a down-shift control operation.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If the shift lever is moved from the MT mode side to the AT mode side, the biasing force is removed from the operation portion <b>312</b>. Thus, the movable body <b>31</b> is pushed forwards by the restoring force of the return spring <b>36</b>, and the bent pieces <b>322</b> are moved away from the fixed contact plates <b>34</b>. As a result, the fixed terminals <b>342</b> are electrically disconnected from each other. Upon detecting the electric disconnection, the engine control unit switches the control modes from the MT mode to the AT mode.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the switch unit of the present embodiment described above, the up-shift operation and the down-shift operation are detected by a single switch (the shift detecting switch <b>2</b>), and the mode switching operation between the AT mode and the MT mode is detected by a single switch (the mode switching switch <b>3</b>). That is to say, three kinds of operations can be detected by two switches. As compared with the conventional switch unit having three switches corresponding to three kinds of operations, it is therefore possible for the switch unit of the present embodiment to reduce the number of parts and to simplify the structure. This makes it possible to reduce the size of the switch unit.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the switch unit of the present embodiment, it is possible to directly attach the shift detecting switch <b>2</b> and the mode switching switch <b>3</b> to the inside of the case <b>1</b> without having to store them within the case <b>1</b> independently of each other. This eliminates the need to provide different cases on a switch-by-switch basis, which makes it possible to further reduce the number of parts of the switch unit and the size of the switch unit.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the switch unit of the present embodiment, the output terminals (the fixed terminals <b>242</b> and <b>342</b>) of the respective switches <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are formed into an L-like shape. The tip end portions (the terminal portions <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>342</b><i>a</i>) of the respective output terminals are arranged side by side in the same direction within the recess portion <b>115</b> of the case body <b>11</b>. The tip end portions (the terminal portions <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>342</b><i>a</i>) and the recess portion <b>115</b> make up a socket connector C. Therefore, it is not necessary that, as in the conventional switch unit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the terminal unit <b>104</b> be provided within the housing H and the signal lines be provided between the terminals <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the respective switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b> and soldered to the terminals <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the respective switches SW<b>1</b>, SW<b>2</b> and SW<b>3</b>. Accordingly, the switch unit of the present embodiment is capable of reducing the number of parts due to the omission of such components as signal lines and capable of reducing the number of manufacturing steps due to the omission of such works as soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the switch unit of the present embodiment, the engine control unit and the respective switches can be readily connected to each other by merely connecting a plug connector of signal lines extending from a control unit such as an engine control unit to the socket connector C. In other words, the task of connecting the switch unit and the engine control unit can be easily performed through the use of connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the switch unit of the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the fixed terminal stand <b>33</b> and the terminal holding body <b>4</b> are arranged side by side in the left-right direction along the lower end portion of the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b> extending in the up-down direction. The fixed terminal stand <b>33</b> is provided at the rear side of the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b> to extend in the front-rear direction. The terminal holding body <b>4</b> is provided to extend in a parallel relationship with the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b> (in the up-down direction). The movable body <b>21</b> is arranged in an opposing relationship with the rear surface of the fixed terminal stand <b>23</b>. Therefore, a space E contiguous to the movable body <b>21</b> in the up-down direction and contiguous to the fixed terminal stand <b>33</b> in the left-right direction is formed at the rear side of the terminal holding body <b>4</b>. Within the space E, the respective fixed terminals <b>242</b> and <b>342</b> extend in the same direction (the front-rear direction) to form the socket connector C. In the switch unit of the present embodiment, therefore, the thickness in the front-rear direction can be reduced by forming the socket connector C in the space E. This makes it possible to reduce the size of the switch unit.</p>
