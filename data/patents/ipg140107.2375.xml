<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application is directed to a bioceramic coating, a method of making and use thereof. In particular, the present application is directed to a gradient bioceramic coating comprising a rare earth oxide, a broadband laser method for preparing the bioceramic coating and the use of the bioceramic coating in the field of medical materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Bioceramic coating is an important part of biomedical materials and plays an important role in restoring defects of human sclerous tissues and rebuilding the lost physiological functions. Generally, there are two kinds of techniques of preparing bioactive ceramic coatings, i.e., dry process and wet process. The dry process is meant to carry out various reactions and depositions in gas phase. Examples of the dry process include plasma spraying, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, thermal spraying, laser cladding, ion injection, and the like. The wet process is a technique that utilizes various reactions carried out in liquid phase so as to deposit a coating on a substrate. Examples of wet process include sol-gel method, electrochemical deposition, self-assembling monolayer film method, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Laser cladding method is a technique which comprises precoating a mixed powder of CaHPO<sub>4 </sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O and CaCO<sub>3 </sub>with a certain proportion on the surface of the substrate, and then cladding treating the surface of the metal substrate with a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser processing system so that synthesis and coating of hydroxyapatite (HA) on the surface of titanium alloy are completed in one step.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The mechanical properties of HA bioceramic coating mainly depends on the sintering density and microstructure of the final sintered product. The technological parameters of broadband laser cladding can have a significant effect on the microstructure and sinterability of the bioceramic coating.</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The tests were carried out at 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.0% of rare earth oxide, respectively. The test results showed that the content of catalytically synthesized hydroxyapatite and &#x3b2;-calcium phosphate reached the climax when the content of the rare earth oxide was up to 0.4 to 0.6%, while the content of catalytically synthesized hydroxyapatite and &#x3b2;-calcium phosphate began to decrease when the content of the rare earth oxide was up to 0.8%. In conclusion, the content of the rare earth oxide has a significant effect on the formation of bioactive hydroxyapatite and &#x3b2;-calcium phosphate. When the content of the rare earth oxide was up to 0.4 to 0.6%, the content of catalytically synthesized hydroxyapatite and &#x3b2;-calcium phosphate reached the climax. The structure of the bioceramic coating comprising a rare earth oxide is significantly finer than that comprising no rare earth oxide. The fined structure is beneficial to increase the mechanical properties of the bioceramic coating. The cracking sensitivity of the bioceramic coating comprising a rare earth oxide is lower while that comprising no rare earth oxide is higher.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Optimization of Technological Parameters of Broadband Laser Cladding</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The studies on thermodynamics and kinetics showed that only by controlling the technological parameters of laser cladding can hydroxyapatite (HA) be formed. Therefore, in order to ensure the effects of the present application, the technological parameters of laser cladding were optimized by inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In order to obtain calcium and phosphor based bioceramic coating comprising HA in the cladding coating and to ensure good bonding between the coating and the substrate, appropriate technological parameters of laser cladding must be chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Upon investigation it has been discovered that controlling a relatively low output power of laser and a relatively high scanning rate are the keys to obtain the bioceramic coating comprising calcium phosphate. However, if the output power is too low or the scanning rate is too high, the substrate and the cladding material will not be melted or will be only partly melted, which leads to an unfirm bonding between the cladding layer and the substrate and therefore affects the bonding strength.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Therefore, in the experiment the optimal technological parameters of laser cladding were determined by changing the output power P and the scanning rate V. In particular, first of all, the spot size D and the scanning rate V were fixed while the output power P was changed. Then the spot size D and the output power P were fixed while the scanning rate V was changed. The optimal technological parameters of laser cladding were determined by analyzing the macro morphology, microstructure and microhardness.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">1. Determination of Output Power P</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The spot size D and the scanning rate V were fixed while the output power P was changed. First of all, a range of the output power was approximately determined. After several experiments, the range of the broadband laser output power was preliminarily determined as 2.0 to 3.0 kW through carefully observing the bonding conditions of the coating and the substrate and the quality of the coating surface. The test scheme was designed as shown in Table 1.</p>

(1) Effects of Output Power on Structure of Composite Ceramic Coating
</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the present experimental conditions, it was observed that the surface of sample No. 111 prepared with low power exhibits as melted beads and no bioceramic coating was formed. Due to the low output power, laser energy absorbed by unit area of the sample, i.e., specific energy E<sub>b </sub>was too low, such that no molten poor was formed on the surface of the titanium alloy. The surface of sample No. 112 was relatively smooth and a bioceramic coating was formed. Bioceramic coatings were also formed on the surfaces of sample Nos. 113-115. However, the surface qualities became worse from sample No. 113 to sample No. 115, in which the surface quality of sample No. 115 was the worst. Due to a gradual increase in the laser output power, laser energy absorbed by unit area of the sample, i.e., specific energy E<sub>b </sub>gradually increased too, such that the temperature of the melt in the molten pool gradually increased, which led to an increase in the tension gradient on the surface of the molten poor dominated by the temperature gradient. The higher the tension gradient on the molten pool surface is, the more vigorously the convection of the melts in the molten pool, which causes the surface quality gradually becomes worse after solidification and crystallization.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The substrate structure in the bioceramic coating of sample No. 112 exhibits as cellular crystals, on which exists white fine particles and locally exists aggregated white clusters of particles. The structure of the bioceramic coating is compact. There are fewer gaps in the bioceramic coating.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">More gaps start to appear in the bioceramic coating of sample No. 113. Upon careful observation, some white ultrafine microparticles distributed in the bioceramic coating can be seen. With the energy spectrum and electron microprobe analysis, the white ultrafine microparticles are determined to be mainly Ti and Ca enriched oxides. The existence of the white ultrafine microparticles can improve the toughness of the bioceramic coating.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Even more gaps appear in the microstructure of the bioceramic coating of sample No. 114. The compactness of the microstructure became worse.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Some gaps in the bioceramic coating of sample No. 115 has linked up with each other, forming large holes or cracks. The structure inevitably lowers the mechanical properties of the bioceramic coating.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In view of the above, along with an increase in the output power P, the structural compactness of the bioceramic coating lowers, because the sintering temperature of the ceramics increases due to the increase of the output power. Along with an increase in the sintering temperature, the crystal grains forming the ceramics gradually grow gradually. At the same time, angularities of the crystal grains become smooth and small crystal grains bonded to each other to form larger crystal grains. At this moment glassy liquid phase at the grain boundary fills the gaps among the crystal grains and bonds small crystal grains. Small crystal grains grow further and glassy liquid phase formed along with the increase in temperature further fills the gaps. As such, the growth of crystal grains and filling of the liquid phase recycle continuously and finally form ceramics by sintering.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Different from conventional sintering technologies, the laser cladding process is a rapid heating and rapid cooling process. When the output power is relatively high, i.e., the sintering temperature is relatively high, the particle size of the formed crystal grains is relatively large and the gaps formed due to failure to be filled by the liquid phase is relatively large as well. On the other hand, when the output power is relatively high, the thermal stress produced during the sintering process is relatively high, which would readily result in relatively large holes and cracks. The bioceramic coating of the present application is required to have certain porosity to enable bone tissues growing into the holes.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">According to the above experimental results, when the output power P=2.5 kW, the surface of the prepared ceramics has certain compactness as well as certain porosity. Therefore, the output power P=2.5 kW is an optimal technological parameter.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(2) Effects of Output Power on Porosity of Composite Ceramic Coating</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">With IAS-4 quantitative image analysis system, planar porosity of bioceramic coatings of sample Nos. 112-115 was assayed, respectively. The results are shown in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The specific procedures are described as follows. First of all, images of the bioceramic coating were collected. Gray value images were treated with shadow correction, image enhancement and the like in order to observe the gaps more clearly. Secondly, image thresholding segmentation was carried out. The area percent of the gaps was measured after binary image processing was conducted. Finally, porosities at different locations on the bioceramic coating were measured. The mean value of the porosities was calculated.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">According to the results shown in Table 2, along with an increase in the output power P, the porosity in the bioceramic coating increases gradually. When P=2.3 kW, as in sample No. 112, the porosity is the smallest. When P=2.9 kW, as in sample No. 115, the porosity in the bioceramic coating is the largest.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Microhardness of bioceramic coatings of sample Nos. 112 and 115 were measured, respectively. The result showed that the microhardness of bioceramic coating of sample No. 112 is larger than that of sample No. 115 because the structure of the bioceramic coating of sample No. 112 is compact and the porosity thereof is low. In contrast, the structure of the bioceramic coating of sample No. 115 is not compact and the porosity thereof is higher, which inevitably leads to a decrease in microhardness of the bioceramic coating. Therefore, regardless of porosity or hardness, the output power P=2.5 kW is an optimal parameter.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">According to the results, among the samples tested, the bioceramic coating sample No. 211 has the largest gaps, in which some gaps linked up with each other to form a line, leading to the worst structural compactness of the bioceramic coating. Meanwhile, among the samples tested, the bioceramic coating sample No. 214 has the smallest gaps and the best structural compactness.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Upon determining the optimal output power, the structure and morphology of the prepared bioceramic coatings improved significantly. The effect of the scanning rate on the surface morphology of the ceramics is not so remarkable as that of the output power. Along with an increase in scanning rate, the structural compactness of the ceramics increases while the porosity of the ceramics decreases. Due to an increase in scanning rate, the residence time of light beams is relatively short, i.e., the sintering time becomes shortened. The crystal grains were cooled rapidly before growing such that the crystal grains were fined and the compactness of the crystal grains was increased. Moreover, when the scanning rate is relatively high, the power density on the surface of the materials becomes lower, resulting in a decrease in thermal stress such that the resultant holes and cracks would be reduced. Therefore, the increase in scanning rate will result in the increase in the compactness, the strength and the hardness. When the scanning rate V=150 mm/min, the compactness of the ceramics is relatively high and the bonding between the ceramics and the substrate is good.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In view of the above study results and analysis, the optimal technological parameters of broadband laser cladding are laser output power P=2.5 kW, scanning rate V=150 mm/min, and spot size D=16 mm&#xd7;2 mm.</p>

The samples were subject to high temperature steam sterilization over 30 min at 126&#xb0; C. Three mature and healthy dogs each with a weight of about 25 kg were selected. After anaesthetized, each of the three dogs was implanted with five samples, respectively, in the left and right femurs. From proximal part to the distal part of the femurs, the samples were in turn designated as 1#, 2#, 3#, 4# and 5#. The implant durations were one and a half months, three months and six months, respectively. Over each duration a duplicate of each sample was implanted. The dogs were sacrificed without suffering before removing the samples. The femoral parts in which samples were implanted were removed, fixed in 20% formalin, embedded with PMMA, sectioned and stained with Toluidine Blue. The sectioned tissues were observed with low power and high power microscopes.</p>

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The above test results demonstrate that the bioceramic coating of the present application has better bioactivity and biocompatibility. The duration for bonding to bone tissues can be decreased by about 2 weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Theoretically speaking, the higher content of powdery titanium is in the first gradient layer in the bioceramic coating, the better physicochemical compatibility exhibits between the coating and the titanium alloy TC4. However, compared with the bioceramic coating of Chinese patent application No. 200510200011.5, the content of powdery titanium in the first gradient layer in the bioceramic coating of the present application is decreased by 10%. The test results show that where the content of titanium is 60%, the bonding between the coating and the substrate is still a metallurgical bonding and the interfacial bonding strength between the coating and the substrate is higher. In view of the above, this ratio does not constitute an influence on the physicochemical compatibility between the coating and the titanium alloy TC4.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In addition, since the content of powdery titanium in the third gradient layer in the bioceramic coating of Examples 1-3 is zero, the content of hydroxyapatite (HA) produced during the laser cladding process is relatively high. The test results show that the content of pure HA produced during laser cladding 100% of powdery composite ceramics is about 20%, such that the content of HA in the bioceramic coating is higher. Therefore, the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the bioceramic coating of the present application are significantly higher compared with that of Chinese patent application No. 200510200011.5.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Compared with the state of the prior art, the present application utilizes broadband laser cladding techniques and more reasonable gradient design so that the obtained bioceramic coating has less cracks or holes, higher hardness, and better toughness. No amorphous phases exist in the coating. Moreover, because the content of powdery titanium in the third gradient layer which contacts with the human body is zero while the content of HA is higher, the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the obtained product are significantly increased. Therefore, the obtained product can be used in restoration of human femoral necrosis, hip joint or tooth defects and would not induce a rejection.

The bioceramic coating comprising a rare earth oxide (e.g., CeO<sub>2 </sub>or La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) also has the anticoagulation effects and can prevent carcinogenesis.

The Gaussian energy distribution of broadband laser becomes a rectangular energy distribution after being treated with broadband scan mirror such that the energy distribution becomes uniform. Such a rectangular energy distribution can make the temperature distribution of a molten pool uniform and make the temperature in the central area of the molten pool decreasing in a gradient manner such that the cracking sensitivity decreases. Moreover, the temperature gradient of the molten pool edges can form an appropriate surface tension field and play a role in stirring the melt so as to make alloy elements distribute uniformly. In addition, the width of the cladding can be increased and the lapping times can be reduced so that the productivity will be increased.</p>
