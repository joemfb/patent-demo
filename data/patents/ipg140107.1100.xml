<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a dispensing spout structure for use in conjunction with an associated gable-topped carton, and more particularly to a tamper-evident dispensing spout for use on a gable-topped carton, wherein the spout includes a hingedly movable opening member for movement from a first, closed position, wherein the dispensing spout is sealed, to a second, opened position, so that a beverage or like flowable products can be dispensed through the spout.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Convenient consumption of beverages and the like by consumers is facilitated by providing packaging which maintains the contents of a package in a sealed condition until the contents are ready for consumption, with the package preferably configured to facilitate convenient opening and dispensing. Products of this nature can include container and closure packages, wherein a removable closure facilitates convenient consumption of the package's contents.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to assure the quality of a package's contents, it is desirable to provide packaging structures with a tamper-evident or tamper-indication feature to provide readily visually discernable evidence that a package has been partially or completely opened. Closure and container packages typically include tamper-indication arrangements, whereby partial or complete removal of a closure from the container provides the desired tamper-evidence.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For some applications, it can be desirable to provide paper-based containers, such as gable-topped containers for milk, fruit juice, and like beverages. For many years, gable-topped containers of this nature have been openable by configuring the gable-top of the container to generally be split and spread apart, along the top seam thereof, and the gable-top generally spread and opened to permit product dispensing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More recently, convenient use of gable-topped containers has been facilitated by the provision of dispensing spout structures mountable on the angled, gable-top of the carton. By way of example, fruit juice gable-topped cartons typically include a dispensing spout structure, having a removable membrane, and an associated removable cap. Convenient opening, and reclosing, of the container is thus facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For some applications, single-serving dispensing of a containers contents is desired, and thus the expense of providing a recloseable structure can be avoided. At the same time, it is desirable to provide such an arrangement with a tamper-evident arrangement, thus assuring the quality of the container's contents.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a tamper-evident dispensing spout structure which desirably maintains the container in a sealed condition, which can be easily opened for consumption of the container's contents, and which desirably is unitary in nature, both prior to and subsequent to opening, thereby avoiding any waste or the like attendant to use. The spout is desirably configured to facilitate use by consumers without an associated straw or the like, and the attendant waste associated therewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A tamper-evident dispensing spout structure embodying the principles of the present invention is configured for mounting on an associated container, such as a gable-topped carton. The present dispensing spout can be conveniently and inexpensively configured for single-serving use, such as for use on single-serving milk cartons, or like beverage containers. Notably, the dispensing spout can be conveniently opened, from a fully sealed condition, without removal of any portion of the spout, with the spout thereafter conveniently maintained in an opened condition. Convenient use by consumers, including children, is desirably facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the present dispensing spout includes a unitary spout body preferably having a generally cylindrical, annular wall portion. The spout body includes a mounting flange portion extending outwardly from one end of the wall portion, which facilitates mounting of the dispensing spout on an associated carton or like container.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The spout body defines a dispensing end, opposite the flange portion thereof, which defines a dispensing opening for the spout. The spout body further preferably includes an end wall joined to the spout wall at the dispensing end of the spout body. In the preferred embodiment, the end wall is perpendicular to the generally cylindrical wall portion of the spout body.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Dispensing of the contents of the associated container is effected by the provision of an opening member hingedly mounted on the spout body by an intregal hinge joined to the end wall. The opening member is movable from a first, closed position wherein the dispensing end of the spout is sealed, to a second, opened position wherein the dispensing end is open to permit dispensing of a flowable product through the spout body.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Notably, the opening member is retained in the closed position by a frangible membrane, joining the opening member to the wall portion at the dispensing end of the spout body. The frangible membrane desirably maintains the contents of the package in a fully sealed condition, but the membrane can be easily fractured and torn for dispensing of the container's contents. To this end, the opening member preferably includes a finger grip to facilitate manipulation of the opening member for tearing the frangible membrane, and moving the opening member from the first, closed position to the second, opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Convenient use is further facilitated by the provision of a locking element on the opening member, which element is engageable with the spout body in the second, opened position of the opening member, for retaining the opening member in its opened position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings, and will hereinafter be described, a presently preferred embodiment, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With reference now to the drawings, therein is illustrated a tamper-evident dispensing spout <b>10</b> embodying the principles of the present invention. Notably, a dispensing spout is of a unitary, one-piece construction, thereby facilitating convenient and cost-efficient use on an associated container, such as a gable-topped paper carton. By virtue of its straightforward design, the present dispensing spout can be economically used in connection with suitable cartons or like containers, and at the same time is configured for efficient molding, such as by injection molding, from suitable polymeric material, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, suitable copolymers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the dispensing spout <b>10</b> includes a unitary spout body having an annular wall portion <b>12</b>, which is preferably cylindrical, and a mounting flange portion extending outwardly from one end of the wall portion <b>12</b>. Mounting flange <b>14</b> is configured for sealed fitment to an associated carton, such as at the gable of a gable-topped paper carton.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the spout body preferably includes an end wall <b>16</b>, opposite the mounting flange <b>14</b>, which partially closes one end of the annular wall portion <b>12</b>. In the preferred form, the end wall <b>16</b> is positioned perpendicular to the cylindrical wall portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The spout body of the dispensing spout defines a dispensing end generally opposite flange portion <b>14</b>, at which end wall <b>16</b> is provided. The dispensing end defines a dispensing opening for the spout, with the spout body having a moveable opening member <b>18</b> hingedly mounted thereon by an integral hinge <b>19</b>, hingedly joining the opening member <b>18</b> to the end wall <b>16</b>. In accordance with the preferred, illustrated embodiment, the opening member <b>18</b> is joined to the end wall <b>16</b> along a hinge axis which generally bisects a cylinder defined by the cylindrical wall portion <b>12</b> of the spout body. The dispensing opening is preferably disposed at an obtuse angle with respect to the end wall <b>16</b>, so that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the spout body provides a mouthpiece for consumers when the spout is mounted on an associated container C.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to permit dispensing of the contents of an associated container, the opening member <b>18</b> is movable from a first, closed position, as illustrated in the drawings, to a second, opened position, wherein the dispensing opening of the dispensing end of the spout body is opened. Movement in this fashion is effected by hingedly moving opening member <b>18</b> about the integral hinge <b>19</b>, so that the opening member is generally moved from within the dispensing opening of the spout. In the illustrated embodiment, the opening member is movable through an arc of 145&#xb0;, corresponding to the obtuse angle at which the dispensing opening of the spout is oriented relative to the end wall. The specific angular orientation of the opening can be varied as desired, such as for use of the present spout on a container that does not have an angular gable top.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Prior to opening in this fashion, the dispensing spout is maintained in a closed, fully sealed condition by the provision of a frangible membrane <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which has a generally semi-circular configuration, extending about the opening member <b>18</b> from one end of hinge <b>19</b> to the other. In a current embodiment, the membrane <b>22</b> has been formed to have a thickness on the order of 0.004-0.005 inches to promote convenient fracture and tearing by consumers for opening the dispensing spout.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The opening member <b>18</b> is preferably provided with an integral finger grip <b>23</b> to facilitate manipulation of the opening member for tearing the frangible membrane <b>22</b>, and for moving the opening member from its first, closed position to its second, open position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As will be noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the finger grip <b>23</b> extends generally parallel to the wail portion <b>12</b> of the spout body to facilitate molding of the present dispensing spout without resort to cam-action or slide-action mold components.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Convenient use of the present dispensing spout is further facilitated by the provision of a locking element <b>24</b> provided on the opening member <b>18</b> generally at the base of finger grip <b>23</b>. The locking element <b>24</b> is engageable with a retention tab <b>26</b> on the spout body when the opening member has been moved to its fully opened, second position. The locking element <b>24</b> engages the retention tab with a snap-like action to maintain the opening member in its opened position. The dispensing spout <b>10</b> is preferably mounted on an associated container so that the now-opened dispensing opening is oriented generally at the lower extent of the dispensing spout, with the now-opened opening member <b>18</b> positioned thereabove, thus permitting convenient dispensing of the contents of the associated container. If desired, the present dispensing spout can be conveniently dimensioned, such as having a diameter of the wall portion on the order of 0.7 inches, so that a user can conveniently place their mouth on the dispensing spout for consumption of the associated beverage or the like. Because the use of the present dispensing spout is contemplated for single-serve containers, the need to configure the spout for reclosing and sealing can be economically avoided. At the same time, the spout structure can be conveniently opened, yet all components of the structure remain integrated, including the opening member <b>18</b> retained by integral hinge <b>19</b>, thus desirably avoiding any waste or the like associated with the use of the present dispensing spout.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous modifications and variations can be effected without departing from the true spirit and scope of the novel concept of the present invention. It is to be understood that no limitation with respect to the specific embodiment illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. The disclosure is intended to cover, by the appended claims, all such modifications as fall within the scope of the claims.</p>
