<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The following application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/646,899, which was filed on Dec. 23, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,963,885 which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/140,358, filed Dec. 23, 2008, the complete contents of each of which are incorporated by reference herein.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to athletic training devices and more particularly to an erratically and rapidly moving device configured such that in order to be captured an athlete must exhibit a required level of speed and agility.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Speed and agility are critical in numerous sports and other activities. However, motion in predictable patterns and/or on agility courses can be seen in advance and can be quickly learned by athletes. Existing training systems include stationary courses such as ladder drills, running through tires, or basketball &#x201c;suicide&#x201d; drills. Further systems exist, such as targeted chasing systems wherein an athlete moves as rapidly as possible towards a selected one of a set of illuminable lights. However, the selectively illuminable lights are stationary and thus the athlete can quickly adapt and/or anticipate the illumination sequence and/or memorize the locations of the fixed number of illuminable lights. In actual play, however, the motion may be unpredictable, and athletes must be able to still move quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is a system that provides unpredictable speed and agility training for athletes.</p>

In such embodiments, a CPU can, therefore, provide input to control a drive circuit <b>402</b> and a directional-control circuit <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A remote-control unit <b>302</b> can provide input concerning direction, speed, on/off status, or any other known and/or desired parameters to an input device/receiver <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a motion-control device <b>208</b> can, in some embodiments, be incorporated into a shut-off device <b>112</b>. A magnet <b>210</b> on a shut-off device <b>112</b> can, when in motion, produce a current that can be read by a reader <b>212</b>. An induced current can vary depending upon the orientation of magnets <b>210</b> in relation to readers <b>212</b> and the speed of magnets <b>210</b> in moving past readers <b>212</b>. In embodiments having multiple magnets <b>210</b> and readers <b>212</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the electrical signals resulting from an induced current can be summed in an op-amp circuit <b>412</b> and sent to a CPU <b>406</b> via an input device/receiver <b>408</b>. A CPU <b>406</b> can process these electrical signals to provide control information to a drive-control circuit <b>402</b> and a directional-control circuit <b>404</b> by using electrical signals to establish a seed value for a random-number generator in a CPU <b>406</b>. In some embodiments, a random number generator can translate an electrical signal into numerical values. In such embodiments, a numerical value can be parsed into separate values, each of which can be used to control speed and direction. For example, in some embodiments, a numerical value can have a plurality of digits. One or more digits can correspond to a seed value for speed control, one or more other digits can correspond to a seed value for the control time period, and at least one remaining digit can correspond to a seed value for directional control.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts another embodiment of the present device that can operate in an aquatic environment. Such embodiments can further comprise a flotation device <b>502</b>, which can be located circumferentially around a housing <b>102</b>, or in any other known and/or convenient position. In some embodiments, a housing <b>102</b> can be comprised of a buoyant material.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a side view of another embodiment of the present device. In some embodiments, a housing <b>102</b> can include extension arms <b>602</b> adapted to reduce the likelihood of overturning the device. Moreover, in some embodiments the shut-off unit <b>112</b> can be coupled with an object <b>604</b>. In some embodiments, an object <b>604</b> can have the shape of a rabbit and/or any desired shape. In some embodiments, a shut-off unit <b>112</b> can include a depression <b>216</b> that can mate with a protrusion at the base of the opening <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the protrusion can be coupled with a rotational motor <b>608</b> such that as the motor rotates, both the drive agency <b>116</b> and the object <b>604</b> can rotate in unison. In alternate embodiments, the object <b>604</b> and drive agency <b>116</b> can move and/or rotate independently.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In use, a user can turn a switch <b>108</b> to the &#x201c;on&#x201d; position and insert a shut-off unit <b>112</b> into an opening <b>110</b>. The present device can then begin to move about and be chased by a person, who could have the goal of overtaking the device and removing the shut-off unit <b>112</b>, which would cause the device to stop moving. A person can also chase the device without the goal of removing a shut-off unit <b>112</b>, but rather to follow a prescribed pattern. In some embodiments, motion of the device can be determined by a magnetostatic device that produces a random movement pattern. In other embodiments, motion can be controlled by a remote user via a remote-control unit <b>302</b>. Either way, the erratic movement of the present device can require the person chasing the device to change motion quickly, and, therefore, develop speed and agility.</p>
