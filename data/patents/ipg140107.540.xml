<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">It is an object of the invention to provide a technique for a reduction of vibration of an auxiliary handle for a hand-held power tool. The object can be achieved by a representative auxiliary handle. The auxiliary handle includes a ring-like mounting part, a pair of bases, a rod-like grip, one or arms and an elastic region. The bases are formed on a free end of the mounting part. The bases of the mounting part and extending end portions of the arms are arranged parallel to the longitudinal direction of the grip. The bases of the mounting part and the extending end portions of the arms are clamped by a bolt and a nut such that the mounting part holds the power tool body. The elastic region is provided in at least one of the mounting part, the bases and the extending end portions of the arms.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a vibration reducing technique of a detachable auxiliary handle for a hand-held power tool such as a hammer and a hammer drill.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a hand-held power tool such as a hammer, it is known to provide a fixed main handle and a detachable auxiliary handle such that the user can hold the main handle with one hand and the auxiliary handle with the other hand when operating the hammer. A hammer of this type having a main handle and an auxiliary handle is disclosed, for example, in Japanese non-examined laid-open Patent Publication No. 2000-176864.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The auxiliary handle for the above-mentioned known electric hammer is D-shaped when viewed from the axial direction of the hammer bit (the longitudinal direction of the tool body). The auxiliary handle includes a rod-like grip to be held by a user, arms extending transversely from longitudinal ends of the grip, and a ring-like mounting part which holds the barrel from outside, and the extending end portions of the arms and bases of the mounting part are clamped by a bolt and a nut, so that the auxiliary handle is D-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, vibration is caused in the power tool body during operation. The vibration is transmitted from the power tool body to a grip of an auxiliary handle held by a user and causes user discomfort. Thus, the known D-shaped auxiliary handle is not vibration-proof and in this point, further improvement is required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is, accordingly, an object of the invention to provide a technique for a reduction of vibration of an auxiliary handle for a hand-held power tool.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above-described object can be achieved by a claimed invention. The representative auxiliary handle according to the invention includes a ring-like mounting part which is capable of holding a power tool body of a hand-held power tool from outside, a pair of bases formed on a free end of the mounting part, and a rod-like grip to be held by a user. The grip has one or more arms extending in a direction transverse to a longitudinal direction of the grip. The bases of the mounting part and extending end portions of the arms are arranged parallel to the longitudinal direction of the grip, and the bases of the mounting part and the extending end portions of the arms are clamped by a bolt and a nut such that the mounting part holds the power tool body.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The &#x201c;hand-held power tool&#x201d; may represent an impact tool, including a hammer which performs a hammering operation on a workpiece by striking movement of a tool bit in its axial direction, and a hammer drill which performs a hammer drill operation on a workpiece by striking movement and rotation of a tool bit. In addition to the impact tool, however, it also widely includes a cutting power tool, such as a reciprocating saw and a jig saw, which performs a cutting operation on a workpiece by reciprocating movement of a blade.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a preferred embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, an elastic region for vibration reduction is provided in at least one of the mounting part, the bases and the extending end portions of the arms. The manner in which &#x201c;an elastic region is provided&#x201d; suitably includes the manner in which an elastic element, typically in the form of rubber, is disposed between two adjacent members and also the manner in which one member is divided into two segments and the segments are joined together into one piece via an elastic element such as rubber. According to this invention, by provision of the elastic region for vibration reduction, vibration which may be transmitted from the power tool body to the grip of the auxiliary handle can be reduced by the elastic region, so that load on the user can be alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, the elastic region is provided on a holding face of the mounting part which holds the power tool body. The manner in which the elastic region is provided on a holding face of the mounting part suitably includes the manner in which a sheet- or plate-type elastic rubber is arranged to cover all over the holding face and the manner in which elastic rubber is scattered on the holding face.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to this invention, by provision of the elastic region on the holding face of the mounting part, transmission of vibration from the power tool body to the mounting part can be reduced, and thus vibration of the grip can be reduced. Further, if the elastic region comprises an elastic rubber, the elastic rubber serves as a slip stopper and can prevent the auxiliary handle from being displaced with respect to the power tool body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, a ring component and the associated base of the mounting part are joined together into one piece via the elastic region. The manner in which the ring component and the base are &#x201c;joined together via the elastic region&#x201d; represents the manner in which an elastic material such as rubber is integrally formed with the ring component and the base which are separately formed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this invention, transmission of vibration from the mounting part to the grip can be reduced. Further, due to the configuration of the mounting part itself having the elastic region and formed in one piece, the number of parts can be reduced and ease of assembly can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, a surrounding member is further provided which surrounds the base of the mounting part and is prevented from moving in a circumferential direction with respect to the extending end portion of the arm. Further, the elastic region is provided between an inner circumferential surface of the surrounding member and an outer circumferential surface of the base. With this construction, transmission of vibration from the base of the mounting part to the surrounding member can be reduced, and thus vibration of the grip can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, the base and the surrounding member have respective flat surfaces which are opposed to each other in a direction of tightening by the bolt and the nut, and a washer is disposed between the opposed flat surfaces. In a construction in which an elastic region is disposed between the base and the surrounding member, the base and the surrounding member have respective sliding areas therebetween which move in contact with respect to each other in a direction of tightening by the bolt and the nut when the elastic region elastically deforms. In this invention, the sliding areas which slide with respect to each other are flat surfaces and the washer is disposed therebetween. With this construction, slip and thus wear resistance of the sliding areas can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, an intermediate member is disposed between the base of the mounting part and the extending end portion of the arm and prevented from moving in a circumferential direction with respect to the base of the mounting part. One of the extending end portion and the intermediate member has a projection extending in an axial direction of the bolt, while the other of the extending end portion and the intermediate member has a recess which is fitted on the projection in such a manner as to be movable with respect to the projection. Further, the elastic region is provided between an outer circumferential surface of the projection and an inner circumferential surface of the recess. With this construction, transmission of vibration from the intermediate member to the extending end portion of the arm can be reduced by the elastic region, and thus vibration of the grip can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, a washer is disposed between an end surface of the projection in the longitudinal direction and a bottom of the recess which are opposed to each other in a direction of tightening by the bolt and the nut. In a construction in which an elastic region is disposed between the outer circumferential surface of the projection and the inner circumferential surface of the recess, the outer circumferential surface of the projection and the inner circumferential surface of the recess have respective sliding areas therebetween which move in contact with respect to each other in a direction of tightening by the bolt and the nut when the elastic region elastically deforms. In this invention, the washer is disposed between the sliding areas which slide with respect to each other. With this construction, slip and thus wear resistance of the sliding areas can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, in a construction in which the elastic region is disposed between the outer circumferential surface of the projection and the inner circumferential surface of the recess, the elastic region comprises a spherical or pin-like rubber and is supported by the recess and the projection such that deformation of the spherical or pin-like rubber comprises shear deformation at least in the direction of a z-axis where the direction of the z-axis defined by a longitudinal axis of the power tool body and directions of a y-axis and an x-axis which intersect with the z-axis are concerned. The deformation may suitably include deformation comprising shear deformation exclusively, and deformation comprising shear deformation accompanied by compressive deformation. Further, the manner in which the elastic region is &#x201c;supported&#x201d; in this invention suitably embraces the manner in which the recess and the projection are joined to the spherical or pin-like rubber, for example, by adhesives, and the manner in which the recess and the projection support the spherical or pin-like rubber by frictional force caused in the contact surfaces therebetween, and the manner in which the spherical or pin-like rubber is engaged in engagement recesses formed in the outer circumferential surface of the projection and the inner circumferential surface of the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The spherical or pin-like rubber has a property that its shear rigidity is lower than its compressive rigidity, or specifically, the effect of vibration reduction by shear deformation is higher than the effect of vibration reduction by compressive deformation. In this invention, by utilizing this property, or by a vibration damping action which is caused by shear deformation of the spherical or pin-like rubber at least in the z-axis direction, transmission of vibration from the power tool body to the grip can be reduced. Thus, the effect of reducing vibration of the grip can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, the grip has two arms extending from longitudinal ends of the grip in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction, and the extending end portions of the arms are connected together by a transverse part which extends transversely to the arms, so that the grip is configured as a closed-loop frame structure. By provision of such a closed-loop frame structure, the rigidity of the grip can be increased and the durability can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, the grip has two arms extending from longitudinal ends of the grip in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction, and the extending end portion of one of the arms is fixed to the base of the mounting part by the bolt and the nut, while the extending end portion of the other arm has a free end. With such a construction, the other arm of which extending end portion has a free end can be used as a hook, so that the convenience in storing the auxiliary handle is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, the grip has three arms which extend from the both longitudinal ends of the grip and from a midpoint therebetween respectively in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the grip, and the extending end portion of the middle one of the three arms is fixed to the base of the mounting part by the bolt and the nut, while each of the extending end portions of the other two arms has a free end. According to this invention, the auxiliary handle is generally T-shaped in appearance and each of the other two arms of which extending end portion has a free end can be used as a hook, so that convenience in storing the auxiliary handle is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, a dynamic vibration reducer is installed in the grip and has a different elastic element from the elastic region and a weight which moves with respect to the grip via the elastic element. With this construction, vibration which is transmitted to the grip without being completely reduced by the elastic region can be further reduced, so that the effect of reducing vibration of the grip can be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, the grip is hollow, and the weight is disposed in a hollow portion of the grip and has a columnar shape extending in the longitudinal direction of the grip. Further, the elastic element is spherical and disposed between a recess formed in an end of the weight in an extending direction of the weight and a recess opposed to the recess of the weight and formed in an inner wall surface of the hollow portion of the grip. According to this invention, the elastic element supports each of the longitudinal ends of the weight disposed in the hollow portion of the grip, so that it can elastically support the weight in a rational manner without need of changing the diameter of the grip and can perform a vibration reducing function. Further, in addition to the support of the weight at the both ends by the elastic element, the elastic element is supported by a spherical surface, so that the vibration reducing effect can be obtained in each of the direction of the z-axis defined by the longitudinal axis of the power tool body and the directions of a y-axis and an x-axis which intersect with the z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a further embodiment of the auxiliary handle in this invention, a hand-held power tool is provided which has the auxiliary handle as defined in any claims. With this construction, a hand-held power tool can be provided which has the auxiliary handle having a higher effect of reducing vibration of the grip. Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily understood after reading the following detailed description together with the accompanying drawings and the claims.</p>

Representative examples of the present invention, which examples utilized many of these additional features and method steps in conjunction, will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. This detailed description is merely intended to teach a person skilled in the art further details for practicing preferred aspects of the present teachings and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Only the claims define the scope of the claimed invention. Therefore, combinations of features and steps disclosed within the following detailed description may not be necessary to practice the invention in the broadest sense, and are instead taught merely to particularly describe some representative examples of the invention, which detailed description will now be given with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An auxiliary handle according to a first embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. This embodiment is explained as being applied to an electric hammer drill as a representative example of a hand-held power tool. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an external view showing an electric hammer drill <b>101</b> with an auxiliary handle in the form of a side handle. The construction of the hammer drill <b>101</b> is now briefly explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The hammer drill <b>101</b> mainly includes a body <b>103</b> that forms an outer shell of the hammer drill <b>101</b>, a hammer bit <b>119</b> detachably coupled to the tip end region (on the left side as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the body <b>103</b> via a tool holder (not shown), and a main handle <b>109</b> connected to the body <b>103</b> on the side opposite to the hammer bit <b>119</b> and designed to be held by a user. The body <b>103</b> is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;power tool body&#x201d; according to the present invention. The hammer bit <b>119</b> is held by the tool holder such that it is allowed to reciprocate with respect to the tool holder in its axial direction and prevented from rotating with respect to the tool holder in its circumferential direction. In the present embodiment, for the sake of convenience of explanation, the side of the hammer bit <b>119</b> is taken as the front side and the side of the main handle <b>109</b> as the rear side.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The body <b>103</b> mainly includes a housing <b>105</b> and a barrel <b>107</b> connected to the front end of the housing <b>105</b>. The body <b>103</b> houses a driving motor, a motion converting mechanism in the form of a crank mechanism which converts rotation of the driving motor into linear motion, a striking mechanism having a striker (striking element) that strikes the hammer bit <b>119</b> in the axial direction and an impact bolt (intermediate element) that transmits the striking movement of the striker to the hammer bit <b>119</b>, and a power transmitting mechanism that reduces the speed of rotation of the driving motor and transmits the rotation to the hammer bit <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the hammer drill <b>101</b> thus constructed, when the driving motor is driven, a striking force is applied to the hammer bit <b>119</b> in the axial direction from the crank mechanism via the striking mechanism, and at the same time, a rotating force is also applied to the hammer bit <b>119</b> in the circumferential direction via the power transmitting mechanism. Thus, the hammer bit <b>119</b> performs a drilling operation on a workpiece (concrete) by a hammering movement in the axial direction and a drilling movement in the circumferential direction. The hammer drill <b>101</b> can be appropriately switched between a hammering operation mode in which only a striking force in the axial direction is applied to the hammer bit <b>119</b>, and a hammer drill operation mode in which a striking force in the axial direction and a rotating force in the circumferential direction are applied to the hammer bit <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The auxiliary handle in the form of a side handle <b>110</b> according to this embodiment is detachably mounted onto a barrel <b>107</b> of the hammer drill <b>101</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the side handle <b>110</b> is shown mounted on the left side of the hammer drill so as to be held by the user's left hand. The construction of the side handle <b>110</b> is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which shows the side handle <b>110</b> partially in section. The side handle <b>110</b> mainly includes a mounting ring <b>111</b> which is detachably mounted onto the generally cylindrical barrel <b>107</b> by holding the outer circumferential surface of the barrel <b>107</b> from the outside, a grip <b>121</b> connected to the mounting ring <b>111</b>, and a fixing (clamping) means which includes a through bolt <b>131</b> and a clamping knob <b>135</b> with a nut <b>133</b> and serves to clamp and loosen the mounting ring <b>111</b>. The mounting ring <b>111</b> and the grip <b>121</b> are features that correspond to the &#x201c;mounting part&#x201d; and the &#x201c;grip&#x201d;, respectively, according to this invention. Further, the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b> are features that correspond to the &#x201c;bolt&#x201d; and the &#x201c;nut&#x201d;, respectively, according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mounting ring <b>111</b> includes a pair of upper and lower generally semi-circular arc ring components <b>113</b>. The mounting ring <b>111</b> is formed by connecting one end of each of the ring components <b>113</b> to one end of the other so as to be rotatable with respect to each other via a shaft <b>117</b> which extends parallel to the longitudinal direction of the barrel <b>107</b>. A base <b>115</b> extends outward from the other free end of each of the ring components <b>113</b>. The ring component <b>113</b> and the base <b>115</b> are features that correspond to the &#x201c;ring component&#x201d; and the &#x201c;base&#x201d;, respectively, according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The grip <b>121</b> has a rod-like shape having a generally circular section and has upper and lower arms <b>123</b> which extend parallel to each other from the both longitudinal (vertical) ends of the grip <b>121</b> toward the mounting ring <b>111</b> in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the grip <b>121</b>. The bases <b>115</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> are disposed between extending end portions <b>125</b> of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> via upper and lower ring-like cams <b>137</b>. Specifically, the bases <b>115</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> and the extending end portions <b>125</b> of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> are aligned in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the barrel <b>107</b> (in a vertical direction) via the upper and lower cams <b>137</b>. The extending end portions <b>125</b> are features that correspond to the &#x201c;extending end portions&#x201d; according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The extending end portions <b>125</b> of the arms <b>123</b>, the cams <b>137</b> and the bases <b>115</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> which are arranged and aligned as described above have respective holes aligned in the vertical direction, and the through bolt <b>131</b> is loosely inserted through these holes in the vertical direction. The through bolt <b>131</b> has a head <b>131</b><i>a </i>on one end, and the head <b>131</b><i>a </i>engages with a side (bottom of a counterbore) of the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the one (upper) arm <b>123</b> so that the maximum insert position is defined. The other end of the through bolt <b>131</b> protrudes through the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the other (lower) arm <b>123</b>, and the nut <b>133</b> of the clamping knob <b>135</b> is threadably mounted on a thread of the through bolt <b>131</b>. The end surface of the clamping knob <b>135</b> faces the outer surface of the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the arm <b>123</b> such that it can contact the outer surface. Further, the nut <b>133</b> is fixedly disposed inside the clamping knob <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A cam face having generally V-shaped indentations is formed in the both sides (both end surfaces in the axial direction) of each of the upper and lower cams <b>137</b> in the circumferential direction. The upper and lower extending end portions <b>125</b> and the upper and lower bases <b>115</b> also have respective cam faces having generally V-shaped indentations, corresponding to the cam faces of the cams <b>137</b>, on their respective sides which face the cam faces of the cams <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the clamping knob <b>135</b> is turned in one direction (tightening direction), the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> cooperate to clamp the extending end portions <b>125</b> of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> and move them (by elastic deformation of the arms <b>123</b>) in a direction that lessens a space therebetween (toward each other). As a result, the bases <b>115</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> are also moved via the upper and lower cams <b>137</b> toward each other in a direction that lessens the diameter of the ring components <b>113</b>. Thus, the mounting ring <b>111</b> is clamped onto the barrel <b>107</b>. Further, a stopper <b>115</b><i>a </i>is formed on each of the sides of the bases <b>115</b> of the ring components <b>113</b> which face the other. The stoppers <b>115</b><i>a </i>come into contact with each other during clamping operation and thereby prevent the mounting ring <b>111</b> from being excessively clamped.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the clamping knob <b>135</b> is turned in the other direction (loosening direction), clamping by the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> is released. Thus, the extending end portions <b>125</b> of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> and the bases <b>115</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> return to their yet-to-be clamped initial position, so that the mounting ring <b>111</b> is released from the barrel <b>107</b>. After release of the mounting ring <b>111</b> from the barrel <b>107</b>, when the clamping knob <b>135</b> is further turned in the loosening direction, the engagement between the cam faces of the cams <b>137</b> and the cam faces of the bases <b>115</b> or the extending end portions <b>125</b> is released, so that the cam teeth are allowed to climb over each other. In this state, fore-and-aft adjustments of the grip <b>121</b> can be made in increments of the angle corresponding to the pitch of the cam teeth by turning the arms <b>123</b> on the axis of the through bolt <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, in this embodiment, the mounting ring <b>111</b> and the grip <b>121</b> are fixed to each other by clamping the extending end portions of the ring components <b>113</b> or the bases <b>115</b> and the free ends of the arms <b>123</b> or the extending end portions <b>125</b> together via the cams <b>137</b> by means of the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut. A plurality of components including the bases <b>115</b> of the ring components <b>113</b>, the extending end portions <b>125</b> of the arms <b>123</b> and the cams <b>137</b> are thus assembled into a handle body.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this embodiment, a sheet-like (or plate-like) elastic rubber <b>141</b> is placed on an inner circular arc surface of each of the ring components <b>113</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b>. The elastic rubber <b>141</b> is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;elastic region&#x201d; according to this invention. The elastic rubber <b>141</b> is joined to the inner circular arc surface of the ring component <b>113</b>, for example, by molding using a mold. In this case, projections and depressions <b>113</b><i>a </i>are formed discontinuously in the circumferential direction in the inner circular arc surface of the ring component <b>113</b>. Therefore, the joint area between the inner circular arc surface and the elastic rubber <b>141</b> can be increased and thus the joint strength can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the user holds the main handle <b>109</b> and the side handle <b>110</b> of the hammer drill <b>101</b> and performs an operation, such as a hammering operation and a hammer drill operation, impulsive and cyclic vibration is caused in the body <b>103</b> of the hammer drill <b>101</b>. This vibration is then transmitted from the barrel <b>107</b> to the side handle <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, however, the elastic rubber <b>141</b> is provided between the barrel <b>107</b> and the mounting ring <b>111</b>, so that transmission of vibration from the body <b>103</b> or the barrel <b>107</b> to the side handle <b>110</b> side can be reduced by elastic deformation of the elastic rubber <b>141</b>. Further, in this embodiment, the elastic rubber <b>141</b> also serves as a slip stopper and can prevent the side handle <b>110</b> from being displaced with respect to the barrel <b>107</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment, the upper and lower ring components <b>113</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> and the bases of the ring components <b>113</b> are separately formed and joined together via an elastic rubber <b>143</b>, so that transmission of vibration from the ring components <b>113</b> to the bases <b>115</b> is reduced.

Components or elements in the third embodiment which are substantially identical to those in the first embodiment are given like numerals as in the first embodiment and will not be described or will be only briefly described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment, upper and lower rubber receiving members <b>145</b> are each provided on the mounting ring <b>111</b> in such a manner as to individually surround the associated bases <b>115</b> of the upper and lower ring components <b>113</b>. An elastic rubber <b>147</b> is disposed between the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the base <b>115</b>. The rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the elastic rubber <b>147</b> are features that correspond to the &#x201c;surrounding member&#x201d; and the &#x201c;elastic region&#x201d;, respectively, according to this invention. The rubber receiving members <b>145</b> are disposed between the extending end portions <b>125</b> of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> via the cams <b>137</b> and clamped by the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown, each of the rubber receiving members <b>145</b> has a box-like shape which surrounds or covers the base <b>115</b> substantially in its entirety, or specifically, all sides of the base <b>115</b> except its region of connection with the ring component <b>113</b>. Further, the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> has a through hole through which the through bolt <b>131</b> extends, and has a cam face that engages with the cam face of the associated cam <b>137</b>. Therefore, when the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b> are tightened, the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> is connected to the associated extending end portion <b>125</b> of the arm <b>123</b> via the cam <b>137</b>. Further, a predetermined clearance is provided between the inner surface of the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the outer surface of the base <b>115</b> so as to allow the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the base <b>115</b> to move with respect to each other even when the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b> are tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the elastic rubber <b>147</b> is disposed on each of the front and rear sides between the inner surface of the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the outer surface of the base <b>115</b>, or specifically, between surfaces of the both members <b>145</b>, <b>115</b> which extend in a direction parallel to the tightening direction of the through bolt <b>131</b> and the nut <b>133</b>. Each of the elastic rubbers <b>147</b> is columnar and arranged such that its longitudinal direction is parallel to the axial direction of the through bolt <b>131</b> (to the vertical direction). Further, the elastic rubber <b>147</b> is supported by front and rear engagement recesses <b>115</b><i>c </i>which have a semicircular section and are formed in the front and rear outer surfaces of the base <b>115</b>, and held in contact with the front and rear inner surfaces of the rubber receiving member <b>145</b>. Specifically, the elastic rubbers <b>147</b> are disposed between the base <b>115</b> and the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> in a manner of being pinched therebetween from the front and the rear (in the axial direction of the hammer bit <b>119</b>). With this construction, the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the base <b>115</b> are allowed to move with respect to each other in a horizontal direction by elastic deformation of the elastic rubbers <b>147</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">During operation of the hammer drill <b>101</b>, vibration is caused in the body <b>103</b> by striking movement of the hammer bit <b>119</b>, and this vibration is mainly caused in the axial direction of the hammer bit <b>119</b>. In this embodiment, the elastic rubbers <b>147</b> are held by the base <b>115</b> and the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> from the front and the rear, so that the vibration caused in the axial direction of the hammer bit <b>119</b> can be efficiently reduced by elastic deformation of the elastic rubbers <b>147</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, in this embodiment, a washer <b>145</b> is disposed on each of the upper and lower sides between the inner surface of the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the outer surface of the base <b>115</b>, or specifically, between upper and lower opposing flat surfaces of the both members <b>145</b>, <b>115</b> which extend in a direction transverse to the tightening direction of the through bolt <b>131</b> and the nut <b>133</b>. When the elastic rubbers <b>147</b> elastically deforms by vibration, the rubber receiving member <b>145</b> and the base <b>115</b> slide with respect to each other on their upper and lower opposing surfaces. In this embodiment, by provision of the washers <b>149</b> between these sliding surfaces which slide with respect to each other, slip and thus wear resistance of the sliding areas can be improved.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Fourth Embodiment of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A fourth embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the side handle <b>110</b> partially in section, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view taken along line C-C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This embodiment is a modification to the vibration reducing structure of the side handle <b>110</b>, and in the other points, it has the same construction as the above-described first embodiment. Components or elements in the fourth embodiment which are substantially identical to those in the first embodiment are given like numerals as in the first embodiment and will not be described or will be only briefly described. In this embodiment, for the sake of convenience of explanation, the axial direction of the hammer bit <b>119</b>, or the longitudinal direction of the hammer drill is taken as z-axis, the vertical direction perpendicular to the z-axis as y-axis, and the horizontal direction perpendicular to the z-axis, or the lateral direction of the hammer drill as x-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this embodiment, a rubber receiving member <b>151</b> is disposed between the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the upper arm <b>123</b> and the upper cam <b>137</b> and between the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the lower arm <b>123</b> and the lower cam <b>137</b>. Further, an elastic rubber <b>153</b> is disposed between the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> and the extending end portion <b>125</b>. The rubber receiving member <b>151</b> and the elastic rubber <b>153</b> are features that correspond to the &#x201c;intermediate member&#x201d; and the &#x201c;elastic region&#x201d;, respectively, according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown, each of the rubber receiving members <b>151</b> has a generally cylindrical shape through which the through bolt <b>131</b> can be inserted. A flange <b>151</b><i>a </i>is formed on the outer periphery of the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> in the middle in its longitudinal direction (in the direction of the y-axis). Further, a cam face is provided on the side of the flange <b>151</b><i>a </i>which faces the cam <b>137</b> and engages with the cam face of the cam <b>137</b>. Therefore, when the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b> are tightened, the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> is connected to the base <b>115</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> via the cam <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this embodiment, when the grip <b>121</b> of the side handle <b>110</b> is moved with respect to the mounting ring <b>111</b>, elastic deformation of the elastic rubber <b>153</b> includes shear deformation in each of the directions of the z-axis and the x-axis which intersect with each other. With this construction, transmission of vibration from the body <b>103</b> side to the grip <b>121</b> can be reduced by utilizing the action of damping vibration by the shear deformation of the elastic rubber <b>153</b> in the two directions of the z-axis and the x-axis. The support structure of the elastic rubber <b>153</b> configured for this purpose is now explained.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>is formed on the side of the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the arm <b>123</b> which faces the rubber receiving member <b>151</b>. An outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> in the longitudinal direction is loosely fitted in the circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>and thus allowed to move with respect to the recess <b>125</b><i>a</i>. The circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>and the outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>are features that correspond to the &#x201c;recess&#x201d; and the &#x201c;projection&#x201d;, respectively, according to this invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a plurality of (eight in this embodiment) engagement recesses <b>125</b><i>b </i>having a semicircular section are formed in the inner circumferential surface of the circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction and extend in the longitudinal direction (the direction of the y-axis). Correspondingly, a plurality of engagement recesses <b>151</b><i>c </i>having a semicircular section are formed in the outer circumferential surface of the outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the rubber receiving member <b>151</b>. Columnar (pin-like) elastic rubbers <b>153</b> are held between the engagement recesses <b>125</b><i>b </i>and <b>151</b><i>c </i>which face each other. One end of each of the elastic rubbers <b>153</b> in the longitudinal direction is held in contact with an end surface of the associated engagement recess <b>125</b><i>b </i>of the circular recess <b>125</b><i>a</i>, and the other longitudinal end of the elastic rubber <b>153</b> is held in contact with an end surface of the engagement recess <b>151</b><i>c </i>of the outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>(a side of the flange <b>151</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The bottom of the circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>of the extending end portion <b>125</b> and the end surface of the outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> are flat and a washer <b>155</b> is disposed between the flat surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this embodiment, as described above, the elastic rubbers <b>153</b> are disposed between the inner circumferential surface of the circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>of the extending end portion <b>125</b> and the outer circumferential surface of the outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction and supported by the engagement recesses <b>125</b><i>b</i>, <b>151</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, when vibration is inputted from the barrel <b>107</b> to the side handle <b>101</b> side in the directions of the z-axis and the x-axis, mainly a force in the shearing direction acts upon all of the elastic rubbers <b>153</b>, other than those located on the z-axis and the x-axis which run through the center of the rubber receiving member <b>151</b>, via its spherical contact surface in contact with the engagement recesses <b>125</b><i>b</i>, <b>151</b><i>c</i>. Specifically, the elastic deformation of the elastic rubber <b>153</b> mainly comprises shear deformation (partially accompanied by compressive deformation), and transmission of vibration from the barrel <b>107</b> (the mounting ring <b>111</b>) to the grip <b>121</b> can be reduced by the vibration damping action of this shear deformation. Further, the force in the shearing direction includes a force in the direction of linearly cutting off and a force in the direction of twisting off.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, according to this embodiment, by utilizing shear deformation of the elastic rubbers <b>153</b>, the effect of reducing vibration of the grip <b>121</b> can be enhanced in the direction of the z-axis or the striking direction of the hammer bit <b>119</b> in which vibration reduction is particularly highly desired.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, in this embodiment, when the elastic rubbers <b>153</b> elastically deform by vibration, the extending end portion <b>125</b> and the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> slide with respect to each other via the washer <b>155</b>. Therefore, like in the third embodiment, slip and thus wear resistance of the sliding areas can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, in place of the cylindrical elastic rubbers <b>153</b> in this embodiment, spherical elastic rubbers may be used. In this case, naturally, the engagement recesses <b>125</b><i>b</i>, <b>151</b><i>c </i>formed in the inner circumferential surface of the circular recess <b>125</b><i>a </i>and the outer circumferential surface of the outer cylindrical portion <b>151</b><i>b </i>are configured to have a semispherical shape. Further, a projection may be formed not on the rubber receiving member <b>151</b> side but on the extending end portion <b>125</b> side of the arm <b>123</b>, while a recess may be formed not on the extending end portion <b>125</b> side but on the rubber receiving member <b>151</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a stay <b>161</b> is provided which extends parallel to the grip <b>121</b> and connects the ends of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> extending transversely to the longitudinal direction of the grip <b>121</b> from the ends of the grip <b>121</b> in its longitudinal direction. The stay <b>161</b> is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;transverse part&#x201d; according to this invention. In this embodiment, the grip of the side handle <b>110</b> is configured as a closed loop of an integral frame structure having the grip <b>121</b>, the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> and the stay <b>161</b>. With this construction, the rigidity of the grip <b>121</b> can be increased and the durability can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, in this embodiment, upper and lower horizontal projections <b>163</b> are formed on the upper and lower portions of the stay <b>161</b>.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, a predetermined clearance is provided between the inner surface of the rubber receiving member <b>165</b> and the outer surface of the projection <b>163</b> so as to allow the rubber receiving member <b>165</b> and the projection <b>163</b> to move with respect to each other even when the through bolt <b>131</b> and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b> are tightened.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A sixth embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the side handle <b>110</b> partially in section, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a sectional view taken along line F-F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. This embodiment is a modification to the construction of the grip side and the vibration reducing structure of the side handle <b>110</b>, and in the other points, it has the same construction as the above-described first embodiment. Components or elements in the sixth embodiment which are substantially identical to those in the first embodiment are given like numerals as in the first embodiment and will not be described or will be only briefly described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this embodiment, one (lower arm) of the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> which extend from the both longitudinal ends of the grip <b>121</b> in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the grip <b>121</b> is connected to the mounting ring <b>111</b>, while the other arm (upper arm) <b>123</b> is designed as a non-connected structure. Specifically, in this embodiment, the grip <b>121</b> is generally L-shaped having the arms <b>123</b>, so that the upper arm <b>123</b> can be utilized, for example, as a wall-mounting hook for storing the side handle <b>110</b>. Thus, the convenience in storing the side handle <b>110</b> is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, in this embodiment, the bases <b>115</b> of the upper and lower ring components <b>113</b> of the mounting ring <b>111</b> are disposed between a bolt receiver <b>171</b> on the upper side and a cylindrical rubber receiving member <b>173</b> via the cam <b>137</b> on the lower side, and these members are clamped by the through bolt <b>131</b> extending through these members, and the clamping knob <b>135</b> with the nut <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the extending end portion <b>125</b> of the lower arm <b>123</b> is cylindrical and loosely fitted over the rubber receiving member <b>173</b> from below in such a manner as to be allowed to move with respect to the rubber receiving member <b>173</b>. Further, a plurality of columnar (pin-like) elastic rubbers <b>175</b> are disposed between the mating faces of the rubber receiving member <b>173</b> and the extending end portion <b>125</b> and arranged at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction. A plurality of engagement recesses <b>173</b><i>a </i>having a semicircular section are formed in the outer circumferential surface of the rubber receiving member <b>173</b> and extend in the longitudinal direction (the vertical direction). Correspondingly, a plurality of engagement recesses <b>125</b><i>c </i>having a semicircular section are formed in the inner circumferential surface of the extending end portion <b>125</b>. The columnar elastic rubbers <b>175</b> are held between the opposed engagement recesses <b>173</b><i>a </i>and <b>125</b><i>c</i>. In other words, the elastic rubbers <b>175</b> are supported by the same structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> as described above. Further, one (upper) end of each of the elastic rubbers <b>175</b> in the longitudinal direction is held in contact with an end surface of the associated engagement recess <b>173</b><i>a </i>of the rubber receiving member <b>173</b>, and the other (lower) end of the elastic rubber <b>175</b> in the longitudinal direction is held in contact with an end surface of the engagement recess <b>125</b><i>c </i>of the extending end portion <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Therefore, according to this embodiment, like in the above-described fifth embodiment, the effect of reducing vibration of the grip <b>121</b> by elastic deformation of the elastic rubbers <b>175</b> can be obtained in each of the longitudinal, vertical and lateral directions. At the same time, like in the fourth embodiment, vibration of the grip <b>121</b> can be reduced in the longitudinal and lateral directions by utilizing deformation mainly comprising shear deformation.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Seventh Embodiment of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A seventh embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the side handle <b>110</b> partially in section. This embodiment is a modification to the sixth embodiment. As shown, the grip <b>121</b> has three arms <b>123</b> which extend from the both longitudinal (vertical) ends of the grip <b>121</b> and from a midpoint between the ends of the grip <b>121</b>, respectively, in a direction transverse to the longitudinal direction of the grip <b>121</b>. Only the middle one of the three arms <b>123</b> is connected to the mounting ring <b>111</b>, while the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> are designed as a non-connected structure. In the other points, it has the same construction as the above-described sixth embodiment. Components or elements in the seventh embodiment which are substantially identical to those in the sixth embodiment are given like numerals as in the sixth embodiment and will not be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, in this embodiment, the grip <b>121</b> is generally T-shaped having the arms <b>123</b>, so that the upper and lower arms <b>123</b> can be each utilized, for example, as a wall-mounting hook for storing the side handle <b>110</b>. Therefore, according to this embodiment, almost the same effect as the sixth embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Eighth Embodiment of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">An eighth embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the side handle <b>110</b> in section. In this embodiment, a dynamic vibration reducer <b>181</b> is installed in the side handle <b>110</b> in order to reduce vibration of the side handle <b>110</b> (the grip <b>121</b>). Specifically, the grip <b>121</b> is hollow and the dynamic vibration reducer <b>181</b> is disposed in the internal space of the grip <b>121</b> in the form of a hollow portion <b>121</b><i>a</i>. The dynamic vibration reducer <b>181</b> includes a weight <b>183</b> in the form of a rod-like or columnar element disposed in the hollow portion <b>121</b><i>a </i>and extending in the longitudinal (vertical) direction of the grip <b>121</b>, and an elastic element in the form of a spherical rubber <b>183</b> which supports the weight <b>183</b> in such a manner as to allow movement of the weight <b>183</b>. The spherical rubber <b>183</b> is held between a spherical recess <b>183</b><i>a </i>formed in each of the longitudinal ends of the weight <b>183</b> and a spherical recess <b>187</b><i>a </i>formed in each of plugs <b>187</b> which are provided to close the both open ends of the hollow portion <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the grip <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to this embodiment having the above-described construction, during operation using the hammer drill <b>101</b>, the dynamic vibration reducer <b>181</b> installed in the side handle <b>110</b> passively reduces vibration of the side handle <b>110</b> by cooperation of the weight <b>183</b> and the spherical rubber <b>185</b> which comprise vibration reducing elements in the dynamic vibration reducer <b>181</b>. As a result, vibration caused in the side handle <b>110</b> can be reduced. In this embodiment, the weight <b>183</b> has a columnar shape and is supported at the longitudinal ends by the spherical rubbers <b>185</b>. Therefore, the grip <b>121</b> can be designed to have an easy-to-grip outside diameter, and the weight <b>183</b> can be elastically supported in a rational manner. Further, in addition to the support of the weight <b>183</b> at the both ends by the spherical rubbers <b>185</b>, each of the spherical rubbers <b>185</b> is held between the spherical recess <b>183</b><i>a </i>on the weight <b>183</b> side and the spherical recess <b>187</b><i>a </i>on the grip <b>121</b> side. Therefore, the vibration reducing effect can be obtained in each of the longitudinal, vertical and lateral directions of the tool bit.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an elastic rubber for reducing transmission of vibration as described in the first to seventh embodiments is not provided in a region between the mounting ring <b>111</b> and the grip <b>121</b>, but this embodiment can be used in combination with any one of the vibration transmission reducing structures described in the first to seventh embodiments. In this case, vibration which is transmitted to the grip <b>121</b> without being completely reduced by the elastic rubber can be further reduced by the dynamic vibration reducer <b>181</b>, so that the effect of reducing vibration of the grip <b>121</b> can be further enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, although the first to eighth embodiments are described as to the side handle <b>110</b> applied to the hammer drill <b>101</b>, its applicability is not limited to the hammer drill <b>101</b>, but it can also be widely applied to an impact tool such as a hammer, a cutting power tool, such as a reciprocating saw and a jig saw, which performs a cutting operation on a workpiece by reciprocating movement of a blade, and other hand-held power tools.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, the structures of reducing transmission of vibration of the grip <b>121</b> by using the elastic rubber in the fifth to seventh embodiments can be appropriately replaced with any one of those in the first to fourth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Having regard to the invention, following technical concept can further be provided:</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">&#x201c;An auxiliary handle, including:</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">a ring-like mounting part which is capable of holding a power tool body of a hand-held power tool from outside,</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">a pair of bases formed on a free end of the mounting part, and</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">a rod-like grip to be held by a user, the grip having one or more arms extending in a direction transverse to a longitudinal direction of the grip,</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">wherein the bases of the mounting part and extending end portions of the arms are arranged parallel to the longitudinal direction of the grip, and the bases of the mounting part and the extending end portions of the arms are clamped by a bolt extending therethrough in the longitudinal direction of the grip and a nut, so that the mounting part holds the power tool body, characterized in that:</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">a dynamic vibration reducer is installed in the grip and has a different elastic element from the elastic region and a weight which moves with respect to the grip via the elastic element.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With this construction, during operation using the hand-held power tool, the dynamic vibration reducer passively reduces vibration of the auxiliary handle by cooperation of the weight and the elastic element which comprise vibration reducing elements in the dynamic vibration reducer. As a result, vibration caused in the auxiliary handle can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">&#x201c;The auxiliary handle, wherein the grip has an internal space and the dynamic vibration reducer is disposed in the internal space.&#x201d;</p>
