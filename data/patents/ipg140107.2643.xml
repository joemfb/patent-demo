<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an ohmic electrode for SiC (silicon carbide) semiconductor, a method of manufacturing an ohmic electrode for SiC semiconductor, a semiconductor device, and a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An SiC semiconductor has such characteristics not possessed by an Si (silicon) semiconductor as being greater than the Si semiconductor in a band gap by approximately three times, in a breakdown voltage by approximately ten times, in electron saturation velocity by approximately two times, and in thermal conductivity by approximately three times. Therefore, a semiconductor device such as an electronic device including an SiC semiconductor has been developed in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the semiconductor device including the SiC semiconductor, in order for a current to flow in the semiconductor device, an ohmic electrode should be formed on the SiC semiconductor. For example, non-Patent Document 1 (&#x201c;<i>SiC Sosi no Kiso to Ouyou</i>,&#x201d; co-edited by Kazuo Arai and Sadafumi Yoshida, Ohmsha, Ltd., March 2003, pp. 116 to 118) discloses an electrode composed of Ni (nickel) as an electrode capable of establishing ohmic contact with an n-type SiC semiconductor. In addition, non-Patent Document 1 discloses an electrode formed of a stack of a Ti (titanium) layer and an Al (aluminum) layer (the Al layer being in contact with a p-type SiC semiconductor) as an electrode capable of establishing ohmic contact with a p-type SiC semiconductor. Moreover, non-Patent Document 1 discloses the feature that electrodes can simultaneously be formed on the n-type SiC semiconductor and the p-type SiC semiconductor by using an electrode formed of thin Ni as an electrode capable of establishing ohmic contact with both of the n-type SiC semiconductor and the p-type SiC semiconductor.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0005">When an electrode composed of Ni is formed on the SiC semiconductor, however, surface roughness of the electrode occurs. This may be because of aggregation in a reaction layer, of C (carbon) that is eliminated in a process of silicidation through interdiffusion between Ni and Si as a result of heat treatment at the time of formation of the electrode. In addition, in such a case, the SiC semiconductor on which the electrode is formed is eroded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0006">On the other hand, when the electrode formed of the stack of the Ti layer and the Al layer is formed on the p-type SiC semiconductor region of the semiconductor device including the SiC semiconductor, Al melts in heat treatment at the time of formation of the electrode and adjacent electrodes are short-circuited.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">In view of the above-described circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide an ohmic electrode for SiC semiconductor capable of achieving ohmic contact with both of an n-type SiC semiconductor and a p-type SiC semiconductor, achieving less occurrence of surface roughness of an electrode and achieving less erosion of the SiC semiconductor, a method of manufacturing an ohmic electrode for SiC semiconductor, a semiconductor device including the ohmic electrode for SiC semiconductor, and a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">The present invention is directed to an ohmic electrode for SiC semiconductor that contains Si and Ni. According to such a feature, ohmic contact with both of an n-type SiC semiconductor and a p-type SiC semiconductor can be established, occurrence of surface roughness of the electrode can be lessened, and erosion of the SiC semiconductor can be lessened. Here, preferably, a ratio between the number of Si atoms and the number of Ni atoms (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) in the ohmic electrode for SiC semiconductor according to the present invention is not smaller than 0.9 and not greater than 1.1.</p>

Initially, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), an Si layer <b>3</b> is formed on SiC semiconductor <b>1</b>. It is noted that Si layer <b>3</b> can be formed with a conventionally known method such as a vapor deposition method or a sputtering method.</p>

It is noted that Ni layer <b>4</b> can be formed with a conventionally known method such as a vapor deposition method or a sputtering method.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">Thereafter, a stack of Si layer <b>3</b> and Ni layer <b>4</b> is subjected to heat treatment through heating. As a result of heat treatment, silicidation of the stack of Si layer <b>3</b> and Ni layer <b>4</b> is achieved, and ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor that contains Si and Ni as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) is formed. Here, silicidation refers to formation of an alloy of Si and a metal other than Si.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">Here, a ratio between the number of Si atoms forming Si layer <b>3</b> and the number of Ni atoms forming Ni layer <b>4</b> (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) is preferably not smaller than 0.9 and not greater than 1.1 and more preferably not smaller than 0.95 and not greater than 1.05. If the ratio between the number of Si atoms forming Si layer <b>3</b> and the number of Ni atoms forming Ni layer <b>4</b> (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) is smaller than 0.9, SiC semiconductor <b>1</b> may be eroded in the heat treatment above. If the ratio is greater than 1.1, a part of Si layer <b>3</b> may remain without reacting, after the heat treatment above.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">In addition, if the ratio between the number of Si atoms forming Si layer <b>3</b> and the number of Ni atoms forming Ni layer <b>4</b> (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) is not smaller than 0.95 and not greater than 1.05, it is likely that homogeneous ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor, in which Si and Ni are dispersed more uniformly as a whole, can be formed, without erosion of SiC semiconductor <b>1</b> through the heat treatment above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">In addition, a ratio between the number of Si atoms and the number of Ni atoms (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) in ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor is preferably not smaller than 0.9 and not greater than 1.1 and more preferably not smaller than 0.95 and not greater than 1.05. If the ratio between the number of Si atoms and the number of Ni atoms (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) in ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor is smaller than 0.9, ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor may be formed of an inhomogeneous alloy layer composed of several types of silicides.

Therefore, contact resistance between the surface of ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor and an interconnection metal layer formed on that surface tends to be lower and adhesion strength between ohmic electrode <b>2</b> for SiC semiconductor and the interconnection metal layer tends to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">In addition, the total thickness of Si layer <b>3</b> and Ni layer <b>4</b> is preferably not smaller than 50 nm and not greater than 100 nm.

<p id="p-0119" num="0119">Thereafter, the mixed layer of Si and Ni was formed to a thickness of 80 nm on the surface of each of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer, by simultaneously sputtering a target composed of Si and a target composed of Ni. Here, a ratio between the number of Si atoms and the number of Ni atoms in a mixed layer, that had separately been formed with the method and the conditions the same as those for this mixed layer, was determined with Auger electron spectroscopy. As a result, it was confirmed that, in any of the mixed layer formed on the surface of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and the mixed layer formed on the surface of the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer, the ratio between the number of Si atoms and the number of Ni atoms (the number of Si atoms/the number of Ni atoms) in the mixed layer was 1.03.</p>

Thus, the electrode according to Example 5 containing Si and Ni as well as Au was formed on the surface of each of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">The electrode according to Example 5 fabricated as above was visually observed under the criteria the same as in Example 1. Then, surface roughness of the electrode according to Example 5 formed on the surface of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and surface roughness of the electrode according to Example 5 formed on the surface of the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer as well as erosion of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and erosion of the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer were not observed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0124">In addition, by feeding a current across the adjacent electrodes according to Example 5, current-voltage characteristics of the electrodes according to Example 5 formed on the respective surfaces of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer were measured. As a result, it was confirmed that both of the electrode according to Example 5 formed on the surface of the n-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer and the electrode according to Example 5 formed on the surface of the p-type 4H&#x2014;SiC semiconductor layer exhibited ohmic characteristics.</p>
