<p id="p-0001" num="0000">It is an object of the present invention to manufacture a micromachine having a plurality of structural bodies with different functions and to shorten the time required for sacrifice layer etching in a process of manufacturing the micromachine. Another object of the present invention is to prevent a structural layer from being attached to a substrate after the sacrifice layer etching. In other words, an object of the present invention is to provide an inexpensive and high-value-added micromachine by improving throughput and yield. The sacrifice layer etching is conducted in multiple steps. In the multiple steps of the sacrifice layer etching, a part of the sacrifice layer that does not overlap with the structural layer is removed by the earlier sacrifice layer etching and a part of the sacrifice layer that is under the structural layer is removed by the later sacrifice layer etching.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device having a microstructure such as a micromachine, and also relates to a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Researches have been conducted on manufacturing minute machines by a process for manufacturing a semiconductor element and a method similar to that process. For example, a three-dimensional structural body having a space and a portion moving in the space, such as a gear or a bridge structure, is manufactured by processing a silicon wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, researches have been advanced on manufacturing a micro electromechanical device having one function by manufacturing a structural body as aforementioned and a semiconductor element over one substrate or by attaching a structural body and a semiconductor element, which are manufactured separately, to each other. The electromechanical device is referred to as a MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System), a micromachine, or the like. At present, micromachines such as the following are manufactured: a pressure sensor or an acceleration sensor that detects movement of a portion thereof which moves in a space; a variable capacitor, an inductor, or a waveguide which uses a space as a favorable insulator other than having a portion moving in the space; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Micromachines are classified into two groups according to their manufacturing methods. One is called bulk micromachines which are obtained by manufacturing a three-dimensional structural body in such a way that a silicon wafer or an SOI substrate itself is processed by etching or polishing. The other is called surface micromachines which are obtained by manufacturing a three-dimensional structural body in such a way that a thin film is stacked over a substrate such as a silicon wafer and the thin film is processed by photolithography, which is a general process for manufacturing a semiconductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since a bulk micromachine is obtained by processing a substrate from various directions, the degree of freedom in manufacturing a three-dimensional structural body is so high that various structural bodies can be manufactured. However, many steps are different from those in a process for manufacturing a semiconductor element. Accordingly, in many cases, a semiconductor element and a structural body are separately manufactured and then they are attached to each other or they are packaged into one without being attached to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Here, a basic method for manufacturing a structural body in a surface micromachine is described. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, a sacrifice layer <b>2701</b> is formed to form a space in a structural body. This sacrifice layer <b>2701</b> is to be removed later. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, a structural layer <b>2702</b> is formed over the sacrifice layer. The structural layer has a three-dimensional shape because the structural layer is formed over the sacrifice layer. Then, a space <b>2703</b> is formed under the structural layer by etching away the sacrifice layer <b>2701</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>; thus, a part of the structural layer over the space (here a portion above the sacrifice layer) can move.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, an example of a simple structural body having the structural layer <b>2702</b> and the space <b>2703</b> over a substrate is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As well as being an important step in manufacturing a micromachine, sacrifice layer etching is a rate-controlling point having a number of problems. For example, sacrifice layer etching needs to progress in a lateral direction, i.e., a direction parallel to a substrate surface in order to remove a part of the sacrifice layer that overlaps with the structural layer, and thus, the sacrifice layer etching is conducted by isotropic etching. Moreover, since the sacrifice layer has thick thickness in order to form a space and is as long as several micrometers, it takes much time to etch the sacrifice layer. Further, the sacrifice layer etching leads to problems in that the sacrifice layer <b>2704</b> is left because a part thereof that overlaps with the structural layer <b>2702</b> cannot be removed completely as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>, and that the structural layer buckles as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref> and attaches the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In such a surface micromachine, it is necessary that the sacrifice layer be formed in order to form a space and a structure portion that can move in the space, and that sacrifice layer etching be performed to remove the sacrifice layer. This sacrifice layer etching is a significant rate-controlling point in manufacturing a micromachine. This is because it takes much time to isotropically etch the sacrifice layer that basically has thick thickness and moreover because, in many cases, the movable portion and the substrate are attached to each other after the etching.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, in order to shorten the time for the sacrifice layer etching, a process in which a tunnel is provided in the sacrifice layer so that an etchant is easily introduced in the sacrifice layer at the sacrifice layer etching is considered (see Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The attachment between a bottom surface of the movable portion and a surface of the substrate includes attachment caused when drying after the sacrifice layer etching and attachment caused as a secondary result of impact or static electricity after the drying. It is considered that the attachment when drying is caused by sublimation or supercritical drying and the secondary attachment is caused by formation of a low-energy film.

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">According to the method described in Patent Document 1, the time required for the sacrifice layer etching can be shortened. However, since the sacrifice layer needs to be formed in two separate steps, the number of steps is increased overall. A countermeasure against the attachment caused when drying and the countermeasure disclosed in Patent Document 1 to prevent the secondary attachment both have problems in long-term reliability and require particular apparatuses and materials.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">Although micromachines have functions that cannot be realized by semiconductor elements, micromachines have not yet been introduced into markets because cost cannot be reduced due to its complicated process. Thus, inexpensive and high-value-added micromachines are expected. As a specific example, manufacturing of a plurality of structural bodies with different functions over one substrate through the same process is expected.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">It is an object of the present invention to manufacture a micromachine having a plurality of structural bodies with different functions and to shorten the time required for sacrifice layer etching in a process for manufacturing the micromachine. Moreover, according to the present invention, a structural layer is prevented from being attached to a substrate after the sacrifice layer etching.

<p id="p-0020" num="0020">In this specification, a layer which is to form a space of a structural body and which will be removed later is referred to as &#x201c;a sacrifice layer&#x201d; and a step of removing the layer which is to form the space of the structural body is referred to as &#x201c;sacrifice layer etching&#x201d;. This sacrifice layer has roles of not only forming the space but also determining a shape of a portion moving in the space.</p>

It is to be noted that, in some cases, a part of the second layer that is under the sacrifice layer is removed when the sacrifice layer is anisotropically etched away.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">In the present invention, isotropic etching is conducted by using a liquid etchant filled in a container in such a way that the liquid etchant is made to flow. For example, the etchant can be controlled so as to flow by agitating the etchant in the container, vibrating a substrate having an insulating surface or the container, or making the etchant flow in or out of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">In the present invention, when a gaseous etchant introduced in an apparatus is used in the isotropic etching, the pressure in the apparatus can be changed by introducing the etchant or another gas into the apparatus and exhausting the etchant or another gas from the apparatus.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">Embodiment modes and embodiments of the present invention will be hereinafter described with reference to drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the following description. It is easily understood by those skilled in the art that the mode and detail can be variously changed unless departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention will not be construed as being limited to the description of the embodiment modes and embodiments hereinafter shown. It is to be noted that the reference numeral indicating the same part may be used in common throughout the drawings in the description of the constitution of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">This embodiment mode will describe a method for manufacturing a micromachine.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is formed by processing a first layer formed over a substrate having an insulating surface. Here, the first layer may be formed to have a single-layer or multilayer structure. The shaping process of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> can be performed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. The sacrifice layer <b>101</b> has a thickness of 0.8 to 15 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">As the substrate having an insulating surface, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a metal substrate, a flexible substrate such as a plastic substrate, or the like can be used. Moreover, a semiconductor substrate made of silicon or the like over which a layer having an insulating property (hereinafter referred to as an insulating layer) is formed can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">The first layer may be formed directly on these insulating surfaces, or the first layer can also be formed over an insulating layer functioning as a protection film, a base layer, or the like. In addition, the first layer can be formed over a semiconductor element or the like which is formed over the insulating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">The sacrifice layer <b>101</b> can be formed by a sputtering method or a CVD method using a metal such as titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), or tantalum (Ta); an oxide of the metal; a nitride of the metal; a semiconductor material containing silicon or germanium; an oxide or nitride of the semiconductor material; phosphosilicate glass (PSG); or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a structural layer <b>102</b> is formed by processing a second layer formed over the sacrifice layer <b>101</b>. Similarly to the first layer, the second layer can also be formed to have a single-layer or multilayer structure. The shaping process of the structural layer <b>102</b> can be performed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">It is acceptable as long as the structural layer <b>102</b> is formed using a material having resistance to an etchant used to etch the sacrifice layer <b>101</b>. For example, the material can be selected from metals such as titanium (Ti), aluminum (Al), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), and tantalum (Ta); an oxide of the metal; a nitride of the metal; a semiconductor material containing silicon or germanium; and an oxide or nitride of the semiconductor material.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">Here, a specific example of a combination of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b>, the structural layer <b>102</b>, and the etchant used for etching the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is shown. For example, if fluorinated acid is used as the etchant during the sacrifice layer etching, the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> can be formed with phosphosilicate glass (PSG) or silicon oxide and the structural layer <b>102</b> can be formed with silicon having a polycrystalline structure. In the case of using an ammonia peroxide mixture as the etchant, the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> can be formed with tungsten (W) and the structural layer <b>102</b> can be formed with silicon oxide. The ammonia peroxide mixture is a liquid in which ammonia, hydrogen peroxide water, and pure water are mixed, and which can be obtained, for example, by mixing 28 wt % of ammonia, 31 wt % of hydrogen peroxide water, and pure water at a ratio of 3:5:2.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">Moreover, silicon can be dissolved in a mixed solution of HF and HNO<sub>3 </sub>(preferably with further addition of CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), a KOH solution, an NaOH solution, an EPW solution (a mixed solution of ethylenediaminepyrocatechol and water), an EDP (ethylenediaminepyrocatechol) solution, a TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydride) solution, a hydrazine solution, or the like. Moreover, silicon can be removed by an XeF<sub>2 </sub>gas, a mixed gas of SF<sub>6 </sub>and C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, an SF<sub>6 </sub>gas, or the like. Since selectivity between silicon and silicon oxide can be obtained by using these etchants, the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> can be formed with silicon and the structural layer <b>102</b> can be formed with silicon oxide. On the contrary, if the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is formed with silicon oxide and the structural layer <b>102</b> is formed with silicon, the etchant may be a mixed solution of HF and NH<sub>4</sub>F, an NH<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>2 </sub>solution, a buffered fluorinated acid solution, or the like; or a mixed gas of HF and NH<sub>4</sub>F, a mixed gas of SF<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Since KOH, EPW, EDP, TMAH, and hydrazine cause anisotropy in etching rate depending on impurity concentration or plane orientation of a silicon crystal having a polycrystalline structure, the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> and the structural layer <b>102</b> can be formed with silicon having different plane orientation or different impurity concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">Next, a part of the sacrifice layer that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>102</b> is removed first as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In this specification, if the sacrifice layer etching is carried out in multiple steps, the steps are given the order: first sacrifice layer etching, second sacrifice layer etching, third sacrifice layer etching, and so on. In other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>102</b> is removed by first sacrifice layer etching. As the first sacrifice layer etching, anisotropic etching can be applied to etch away the part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>102</b>. Specifically, an anisotropic wet or dry etching method using the aforementioned etchant can be used. The first sacrifice layer etching is desirably anisotropic dry etching because anisotropic dry etching can be carried out in a much shorter period of time than wet etching.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">Next, another part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that overlaps with the structural layer <b>102</b> is removed by second sacrifice layer etching as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, thereby forming a space <b>103</b>. As the second sacrifice layer etching, isotropic etching in which the etchant also diffuses in a lateral direction is applied to remove a part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that is under the structural layer <b>102</b>. Specifically, an isotropic wet or dry etching method using the aforementioned etchant can be applied. The isotropic etching is, for example, a method using plasma of an etching gas under an atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">Moreover, the second sacrifice layer etching can be carried out by isotropic wet etching while partially leaving the part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that is under the structural layer <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a perspective view in the case where the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is partially left by the second sacrifice layer etching, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional view along a line O&#x2014;P. Since the sacrifice layer etching progresses from a portion where the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is in contact with the etchant toward the sacrifice layer under the structural layer <b>102</b>, a small amount of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> can be left in a central portion under the structural layer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">If the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is partially left in this manner, the space <b>103</b> can be formed by removing the remaining part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> under the structural layer <b>102</b> by third sacrifice layer etching as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. At this time, isotropic wet or dry etching can be applied as the third sacrifice layer etching.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">Methods of the first sacrifice layer etching, the second sacrifice layer etching, and the third sacrifice layer etching as aforementioned can be selected based on a combination of the structural layer, the sacrifice layer, and the etchant for etching the sacrifice layer.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">The structural body shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2C</figref> has a beam structure with spaces over and under the structural layer <b>102</b>, and the spaces are formed by forming the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> and the structural layer <b>102</b> and then conducting the sacrifice layer etching in at least two steps in this example. However, in the present invention, the shape of the structural body and the manufacturing method of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> and the structural layer <b>102</b> are not limited to those described above. For example, the structural layer <b>102</b> of the structural body can have a cantilever shape, a comb shape, a gear wheel shape, or the like. Moreover, the sacrifice layer and the structural layer can be manufactured by using a silicon wafer. For example, by implanting an impurity into a silicon wafer, a sacrifice layer including silicon and a structural layer including silicon having the impurity may be formed separately.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">Thus, in a method for manufacturing a micromachine of the present invention, the sacrifice layer is removed in multiple steps. The first sacrifice layer etching can be carried out in a short period of time since a part of the sacrifice layer to be removed does not overlap with the structural layer. This is because an area where the sacrifice layer is in contact with the etchant is so large that the etchant easily diffuses, and moreover because anisotropic etching with high etching rate can be applied due to the fact that the sacrifice layer does not overlap with the structural layer.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">Thus, when the second sacrifice layer etching is conducted after decreasing the sacrifice layer by the first sacrifice layer etching, the second sacrifice layer etching can be conducted in a shorter period of time. Further, it is possible to avoid a problem that the sacrifice layer is not etched completely.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">When wet etching is applied as the second sacrifice layer etching to entirely remove the part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that is under the structural layer <b>102</b>, the structural layer <b>102</b> may buckle because its structure cannot be maintained due to surface tension of a liquid existing under the structural layer <b>102</b>, and there is a case where the structural layer <b>102</b> is attached to the substrate or an adjacent layer. If the part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that is under the structural layer <b>102</b> is not entirely removed but is partially left by the second sacrifice layer etching, the part of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that is left can be used as a supporter that supports the structural layer <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>). In specific, the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> is removed while leaving a central portion of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that overlaps with the structural layer <b>102</b> and the central portion is used as the supporter. It is to be noted that the central portion does not indicate a center in a strict sense but indicates a shape of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> when the second sacrifice layer etching is stopped in a state that the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> functions as the supporter. Then, the central portion of the sacrifice layer <b>101</b> that functions as the supporter can be removed by the third sacrifice layer etching. Therefore, the third sacrifice layer etching is desirably isotropic dry etching. Alternatively, wet etching using an etchant with surface tension low enough not to cause the attachment can be used.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0096">Differently from the aforementioned embodiment modes, this embodiment mode will describe a method for manufacturing a structural body provided with an opening (hereinafter also referred to as a hole).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a sacrifice layer <b>201</b> is formed by processing a first layer formed over an insulating substrate. The first layer can be formed by a single layer or stacked layers in a similar way to the above embodiment modes, and the shaping process of the first layer can be performed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a structural layer <b>202</b> is formed by processing a second layer formed over the sacrifice layer <b>201</b>. The second layer can be formed and processed in a similar manner to the first layer. Here, the structural layer <b>202</b> is provided with holes <b>203</b>. The number of holes <b>203</b> may be one or more. If a plurality of holes are provided, the holes <b>203</b> may have different diameters from each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a top view of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> and the structural layer <b>202</b> provided with the holes <b>203</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a cross-sectional view along a line O&#x2014;P of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">Next, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>202</b> is removed by first sacrifice layer etching as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Similarly to the above embodiment mode, the first sacrifice layer etching may be anisotropic etching. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a top view of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> and the structural layer <b>202</b> after the first sacrifice layer etching, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is a cross-sectional view along a line O&#x2014;P of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref>, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>202</b> is also removed in the holes <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> that overlaps with the structural layer <b>202</b> is removed by second sacrifice layer etching. Similarly to the above embodiment mode, the second sacrifice layer etching can be isotropic etching. By the second sacrifice layer etching, a space <b>204</b> of the structural body is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">As aforementioned, the sacrifice layer etching can be conducted in a shorter period of time than before by conducting the sacrifice layer etching in multiple steps. In addition, when the holes <b>203</b> are opened in the structural layer <b>202</b> as shown in this embodiment mode, the first sacrifice layer etching can remove a larger amount of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> and the second sacrifice layer etching can remove a smaller amount of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b>; therefore, the overall time required for the sacrifice layer etching can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a base layer is formed over a substrate <b>205</b>, and a sacrifice layer <b>208</b> and a structural layer <b>209</b> having holes <b>210</b> are formed over the base layer. Since the base layer has a multilayer structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a first base layer <b>206</b> and a second base layer <b>207</b> are stacked in order.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>208</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>209</b> is removed by first sacrifice layer etching. Thus, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>208</b> that is right under each hole <b>210</b> is etched away.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, even the base layer under the holes <b>210</b> may be etched depending on the etching time and selectivity. This is the reason why the base layer has the multilayer structure of the first base layer <b>206</b> and the second base layer <b>207</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6D</figref>. The first base layer <b>206</b> in the holes <b>210</b> is etched away and the second base layer <b>207</b> in the holes <b>210</b> is partially etched away, and depressions <b>211</b> are formed as a result. Similarly to the above example, the first sacrifice layer etching and etching of the base layer can be anisotropic etching.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>208</b> that is under the structural layer <b>209</b> is removed by the second sacrifice layer etching. Similarly to the above example, the second sacrifice layer etching can be isotropic etching.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">When the depressions <b>211</b> are formed by etching the base layers after the first sacrifice layer etching in this way, a bottom surface of the structural layer <b>209</b> which sandwiches the space with the second base layer <b>207</b> can be made rough. When the surface is rough, the etchant can be removed rapidly by surface tension and the buckling of the structural layer <b>209</b> due to drying or the like can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">The buckling caused when a force supporting the movable portion is weaker than the attaching force between the bottom surface of the movable portion and the surface facing the bottom surface corresponds to the buckling caused when drying. The attaching force between the bottom surface of the movable portion and the surface facing the bottom surface is generated by an existence of a liquid such as the etchant between them, and is proportional to the area where the liquid is in contact with the solid and the surface tension of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">If the diameter of the hole <b>210</b> provided in the structural layer <b>209</b> is smaller than the distance between the bottom surface of the movable portion and the surface facing the bottom surface (i.e., the thickness of the sacrifice layer), the facing surface can be made to be a lyophobic surface by an etching step. As a result, the attaching force between the facing surface and the liquid becomes small and the buckling can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">If the diameter of the hole <b>210</b> provided in the structural layer <b>209</b> is equal to or larger than the thickness of the sacrifice layer <b>208</b>, a droplet falls in the depression <b>211</b> provided under the structural layer <b>209</b>. Therefore, an area where the bottom surface of the movable portion is in contact with the liquid becomes small and the liquid is more easily separated from the bottom surface of the movable portion; thus, the buckling can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">When the bottom surface of the structural layer <b>209</b> becomes rough, the area where the bottom surface of the movable portion can be in contact with the surface facing the bottom surface becomes small and the buckling can be prevented. This is because the surface energy decreases by reducing the contact area.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0111">In this way, the buckling, i.e., the attachment when drying and the secondary attachment, can be suppressed by forming the depression <b>211</b> on the bottom surface of the structural layer <b>209</b>, specifically in the base layer, through the hole provided in the structural layer <b>209</b> to make the surface facing the movable portion rough.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0112">Thus, since the bottom surface of the structural layer <b>209</b> only needs to be made rough, the base layer <b>212</b> can be formed in a single layer as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">In addition, the procedure may be: (1) forming the depression after the first sacrifice layer etching, (2) subjecting the surface of the depression to a lyophilic process, and (3) conducting the second sacrifice layer etching.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, when the first base layer <b>213</b> is formed with a lyophilic material and the second base layer <b>214</b> is formed with a lyophobic material and a depression is formed by etching until a part of the first base layer <b>213</b> is exposed in the aforementioned manner, liquid causing the attachment can easily enter the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">In this embodiment mode, the following procedure is also possible: forming the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> and the structural layer <b>202</b> provided with the holes <b>203</b>; removing the part of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>202</b> by the first sacrifice layer etching; removing the part of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> that overlaps with the structural layer <b>202</b> by the second sacrifice layer etching while partially leaving the sacrifice layer <b>201</b>; and removing the part of the sacrifice layer <b>201</b> left by the second sacrifice layer etching by the third sacrifice layer etching. The part left by the second sacrifice layer etching can prevent the structural layer <b>202</b> from buckling during the manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">When the structural layer is provided with the holes and the sacrifice layer etching is conducted in multiple steps as shown in this embodiment mode, the time required for etching the sacrifice layer can be shortened without adding a complicated process and without using particular apparatus and material, and moreover, the structural layer can be prevented from buckling.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0117">This embodiment mode can be freely combined with any of the above embodiment modes.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment Mode 4</heading>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">This embodiment mode will describe a method for manufacturing a micromachine with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref> which show a conventional method, and specifically describe a solution by a method of the present invention and points thereof that are different from those in the above embodiment modes.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0119">When sacrifice layer etching is conducted by a conventional method, a problem may occur in that a sacrifice layer remains without being completely removed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref>. This is because of the following: (1) the sacrifice layer <b>2701</b> cannot be removed completely due to the large amount of the sacrifice layer material, or (2) some parts of the sacrifice layer <b>2701</b> are removed while other parts cannot be removed since the sacrifice layer etching takes a long time and causes variation in etching rate within the substrate surface. However, even if the sacrifice layer etching is conducted for a long enough time, in some cases, the sacrifice layer <b>2704</b> is partially left as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28A</figref> and cannot be removed completely.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0120">A phenomenon in which the sacrifice layer is left will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 10B</figref>. For example, a sacrifice layer <b>401</b> and a structural layer <b>402</b> are formed as shown in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Most part of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> is covered with the structural layer <b>402</b> and the structural layer <b>402</b> has a long-tunnel structure.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0121">When the sacrifice layer etching is conducted on such a structure by isotropic etching, etching of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> progresses initially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. After a time t from the start of the etching, the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> is removed by a distance R (t) from an end portion of the structural layer <b>402</b>. Here, a portion <b>403</b> where the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> has been removed by etching and a portion <b>404</b> where the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> is left are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the etching stops at a certain time t<sub>max </sub>from the start of the etching. The sacrifice layer <b>401</b> has been removed by a distance R (t<sub>max</sub>)=R<sub>max </sub>from an end portion of the structural layer <b>402</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a perspective view of a structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a cross-sectional view along a line O&#x2014;P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0122">If isotropic sacrifice layer etching is conducted on the structure that forms a long tunnel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the distance R (t) from the end portion of the structural layer <b>402</b> over which the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> is etched depends on the time as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the horizontal axis shows the time t from the start of the etching and the vertical axis shows the distance R (t) over which the etching is conducted. As shown by such a tunnel structure, in the case where the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> recedes so deeply under the structural layer <b>402</b> with the progress of the sacrifice layer etching that it is difficult for the etchant to flow in to the vicinity of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b>, the distance R<sub>max </sub>over which the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> is etched is saturated at the certain time t<sub>max </sub>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The sacrifice layer etching does not progress any more even if the etching is continued further because of the following reasons. Since the structural layer <b>402</b> has the long-tunnel structure, the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> recedes deeply under the structural layer <b>402</b> with the progress of etching of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b>. Thus, a reaction product <b>406</b> of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> and the etchant is likely to remain in the tunnel, and an etchant <b>407</b> capable of reaction does not flow in easily. When the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> recedes to the distance that is out of the reach of the etchant <b>407</b> by diffusion, the sacrifice layer etching stops. At this time, the distance over which the etching has been conducted corresponds to R<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> have shown the example in which the structural layer <b>402</b> has the tunnel structure, the shape of the structural layer <b>402</b> is not limited to this. That is to say, as in the tunnel structure, the sacrifice layer is left in the structure in which it is difficult for the etchant to flow in to the vicinity of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> because the depth is long in proportion with the area of the opening like in the tunnel structure and the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> recedes to the inside surrounded by the structural layer <b>402</b> and the insulating substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0124">The maximum distance R<sub>max </sub>over which the etching is conducted and the time t<sub>max </sub>required for the etching depend on various factors such as the materials and structures of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> and the structural layer <b>402</b>, the material of the etchant for etching the sacrifice layer <b>401</b>, and the etching method, condition, and the like for the sacrifice layer <b>401</b>. However, the distance R (t) over which the etching is conducted is saturated at a certain distance R<sub>max </sub>even if any method, material, condition, and the like are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0125">If a micromachine is manufactured under a condition that the distance R over which the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> is to be removed by the sacrifice layer etching is larger than the maximum distance R<sub>max </sub>over which the etching is conducted, a problem is caused in that the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> remains under the structural layer <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0126">As thus described, the etching rate gets slower with the increase in the time t from the start of the etching, and the etching stops at the distance R<sub>max </sub>when the time t exceeds the certain time t<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0127">The above problem is caused because the reaction product <b>406</b> and the etchant become difficult to diffuse. Accordingly, in the present invention, the etchant is made to flow so that the reaction product <b>406</b> diffuses from the periphery of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> and moreover so that the etchant <b>407</b> capable of reaction exists around the sacrifice layer <b>401</b>. Then, the etching rate can be accelerated even when the time t from the start of the etching increases, and the maximum distance R<sub>max </sub>over which the etching is conducted can be increased. As a result, the degree of freedom in designing the micromachine can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0128">If the aforementioned method is carried out by dry etching, for example, the etchant <b>407</b> capable of reaction can be controlled so as to exist around the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> by introducing the etchant and exhausting the gas in an apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0129">An apparatus for carrying out dry etching provided with such a structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. This dry etching apparatus has an upper electrode <b>414</b> provided with an introduction port <b>411</b> of an etchant, a lower electrode <b>415</b>, and an exhaust port <b>412</b>. An insulating substrate <b>413</b> where a sacrifice layer is formed over the lower electrode <b>415</b> is provided, and voltage is applied to the lower electrode <b>415</b> and the upper electrode <b>414</b> to generate plasma; thus, etching is conducted. At this time, the etchant in a gas form is exhausted from the exhaust port <b>412</b>. Moreover, the introduction and exhaust of the etchant can be alternately conducted. The dry etching apparatus is not limited to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and, for example, the introduction port <b>411</b> may be provided separately from the upper electrode <b>414</b>. Moreover, the exhaust port <b>412</b> may be provided under the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0130">In general, the dry etching apparatus in the case of manufacturing a semiconductor element controls the flow rate of the etchant introduced from the introduction port <b>411</b> and the amount of gas exhausted from the exhaust port <b>412</b> to keep the pressure constant in the apparatus; thus, dry etching is conducted. However, since a large amount of material is removed in the case of the sacrifice layer etching, using a general method may lead to problems in that the etching rate gets extremely slow and that a reaction product of the etchant and the sacrifice layer is deposited over the insulating substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0131">Therefore, in the dry etching apparatus of this embodiment mode, the sacrifice layer etching is conducted by a method in which the amount of the etchant to be introduced is increased to perform the etching and the amount of gas to be exhausted is increased after a certain period of time. That is to say, in this embodiment mode, the sacrifice layer etching is conducted while changing the pressure in the apparatus by introducing and exhausting the gas.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0132">The gas is exhausted in order to remove the reaction product formed by a chemical reaction between the sacrifice layer and the etchant and to make it easier to introduce the etchant to the vicinity of the sacrifice layer; therefore, the degree of vacuum is not necessarily increased. However, the inside of the apparatus is preferably high vacuum because the reaction product is not easily deposited over the insulating substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0133">Moreover, an additional step may be conducted to generate plasma by introducing inert gas such as argon or helium from the introduction port <b>411</b> so that the reaction product deposited over the insulating substrate <b>413</b> is removed physically. For example, the sacrifice layer etching can be conducted in the following order: (1) the etching is conducted by introducing the etchant, (2) the gas in the apparatus is exhausted, and (3) the reaction product is removed by introducing inert gas. In Step (3), the reaction product can also be removed efficiently by exhausting the gas at the same time. Steps (1) to (3) can be arbitrarily combined or repeated as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0134">The gas used in Step (3) is not limited to inert gas, and a reactive gas that can react with the reaction product of the sacrifice layer and the etchant and remove the reaction product may be used. Here, the aforementioned reactive gas is a reactive gas other than the etchant. The amount of etchant or gas to be introduced to remove the reaction product, the amount of gas to be exhausted in the etching apparatus, the number of times of repeating the steps, and the like can be determined based on the film thickness of the sacrifice layer, the kind of the etchant and the sacrifice layer, and the like. The amount of etchant and noble gas to be introduced, the amount of gas to be exhausted, the number of times of repeating the steps, and the like can be determined based on the film thickness of the sacrifice layer, the kind of the sacrifice layer and the etchant, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0135">In accordance with such a dry etching method, the reaction product <b>406</b> remaining in the vicinity of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> will no longer remain in the vicinity of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b> and a new etchant <b>407</b> capable of reaction easily diffuses to the vicinity of the sacrifice layer <b>401</b>. Thus, the sacrifice layer etching can be conducted in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0136">Moreover, if the sacrifice layer etching is wet etching, the above method can be realized by vibrating the substrate or a container of etchant or making the etchant flow.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12D</figref> show a wet etching method to achieve the aforementioned method. In a wet etching apparatus, insulating substrates <b>422</b> each of which has a sacrifice layer formed thereover and stands on a substrate holder <b>424</b> can be soaked in a liquid etchant <b>423</b> filled in a container <b>421</b>. Here, in order to make the etchant flow, a method of vibrating the container <b>421</b> is given as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0138">Moreover, in order to make the etchant flow, a method of vibrating the insulating substrate <b>422</b> by vibrating the substrate holder <b>424</b> is given as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0139">Furthermore, in order to make the etchant flow, a method of agitating the etchant is given as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0140">In addition, in order to make the etchant flow, a method in which an introduction port <b>425</b> and an exhaust port <b>426</b> of the etchant are provided in the container <b>421</b> to introduce and exhaust the etchant is given as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0141">By making the etchant flow in this way, the sacrifice layer etching can be conducted in a short period of time. Moreover, the sacrifice layer can be prevented from remaining because the reaction with the etchant progresses.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0142">Thus, since the etching rate can be improved by using the method for manufacturing a micromachine of the present invention, the time required for the sacrifice layer etching can be shortened. In addition, since the maximum distance R<sub>max </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> over which the etching is conducted can be increased, the degree of freedom in designing the micromachine can be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0144" num="0144">A micromachine of the present invention has a structural body and an electric circuit having a semiconductor element, and the structural body has a structural layer and a space formed by removing a sacrifice layer. A part of the structural layer can move in the space. Here, the electric circuit includes, for example, a wireless communication circuit, a memory, a control circuit, and the like. This embodiment mode will describe a structure of such a micromachine. The memory has a semiconductor element and a storage element.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the structural body in the micromachine of the present invention has a structural layer <b>701</b> and a lower electrode <b>703</b>, and has a space <b>702</b> between the structural layer <b>701</b> and the lower electrode <b>703</b>. The structural layer <b>701</b> can move up and down by an external force. By such a structural body, change in electrostatic capacitance between the structural layer <b>701</b> and the lower electrode <b>703</b> can be known, and the structural body serves as a sensor that can detect the change in the electrostatic capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the structural body has a fixed comb <b>704</b> and a movable comb <b>705</b>, and has spaces between the fixed comb <b>704</b> and the movable comb <b>705</b> and between the movable comb <b>705</b> and the insulating substrate. When voltage is applied between the fixed comb <b>704</b> and the movable comb <b>705</b> to use the movable comb as an electrode, the structural body serves as an actuator that can change an electric signal inputted from the outside into displacement.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0147">Besides the aforementioned example, an unmovable structural body that has a structural layer and a space formed by removing a sacrifice layer can be formed. In other words, the structural body corresponds to an inductor, a capacitor, a waveguide, or the like in which only a wire is formed on the substrate and the structural layer is formed apart from the substrate. Since the structural layer is formed apart from the substrate, interaction thereof with the substrate can be reduced; therefore, such a structural body can be used for a wireless communication circuit that mainly operates at high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0148">The aforementioned structural body is an example, and the structural body can have a shape and be formed with steps in accordance with its purpose and can be provided with a predetermined function by various driving methods. For example, even in the case of forming the structural body having the same structure, different functions can be provided depending on the driving methods.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0149">A micromachine <b>711</b> can have an electric circuit portion <b>712</b> and a structure portion <b>713</b> formed by a structural body, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. For example, if the structure portion <b>713</b> is a sensor that detects change in electrostatic capacitance, the micromachine <b>711</b> can detect physical amount such as pressure or acceleration by the sensor, and the detected amount can be processed and outputted by the electric circuit portion <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0150">Further, if the structure portion <b>713</b> is the actuator as described above, the micromachine <b>711</b> can process an electric signal inputted from the outside in the electric circuit portion <b>712</b> and output displacement or force through the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0151">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, a micromachine <b>714</b> has a wireless communication circuit <b>715</b> and another electric circuit <b>716</b>, by which wireless communication with the outside can be carried out. Here, the other electric circuit corresponds to, for example, an information processing circuit, a memory, a control circuit, or the like. Moreover, the wireless communication circuit has an antenna, a power source circuit, or the like to perform wireless communication with an external device through electromagnetic waves. A passive element that forms the wireless communication circuit, such as an inductor or a capacitor, can be formed by a structural body which has a structural layer and a space formed by removing a sacrifice layer and in which two layers having a conductive property (hereinafter called conductive layer) face each other with a space therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0152">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, a micromachine <b>717</b> can be formed by a wireless communication circuit <b>718</b>, a structure portion <b>719</b>, and another electric circuit <b>720</b>. The other electric circuit <b>720</b> has an information processing circuit, a memory, a control circuit, or the like similarly to the above example. The structure portion has a sensor or an actuator, which is a structural body, and the micromachine can send information and receive control to/from the outside through the wireless communication circuit. This wireless communication circuit can also have a passive element formed as a structural body having a space and a structural layer.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0153">The structural body in the micromachine of the present invention can form not only a sensor or an actuator but also a passive element as above. In a circuit for performing wireless communication, the passive element (capacitor, inductor, resistor, or the like) is important; however, these passive elements have been difficult to form by general steps for forming a semiconductor element. However, by forming the passive element using the structural body, favorable characteristics can be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0155">This embodiment mode will show specific examples of a method for manufacturing a structural body in a micromachine. Here, a method for manufacturing a switch that decides conduction or nonconduction by physical contact or noncontact will be described with reference to FIGS. <b>15</b>A to <b>17</b>B<b>2</b>. In each drawing used here, a top view is shown on the left side while a cross-sectional view is shown on the right side.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0156">First, as shown in FIGS. <b>15</b>A<b>1</b> to <b>15</b>A<b>2</b>, a conductive layer <b>501</b> is formed over a substrate <b>502</b>. The conductive layer <b>501</b> may be directly formed on the substrate <b>502</b>, or the conductive layer <b>501</b> may be formed after forming a base layer <b>503</b> on the substrate <b>502</b>. In FIG. <b>15</b>A<b>1</b> which is a top view, the substrate <b>502</b> and the base layer <b>503</b> are omitted. FIG. <b>15</b>A<b>1</b> shows an example in which the conductive layer <b>501</b> is formed after forming the base layer <b>503</b> over the substrate <b>502</b>. The conductive layer <b>501</b> can be formed in such a way that a conductive layer is processed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. The conductive layer <b>501</b> is formed as a pair of electrodes, which controls driving of a switch.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0157">Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. <b>15</b>B<b>1</b> to <b>15</b>B<b>2</b>, an insulating layer <b>504</b> is formed over the conductive layer <b>501</b>, and conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> are formed over the insulating layer <b>504</b>. The insulating layer <b>504</b> can be formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. The conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> can be formed and processed between the pair of conductive layers <b>501</b> in a similar manner to the aforementioned conductive layer <b>501</b>. Since the conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> formed here function as a conducting route of a signal, the conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> are formed as a pair of electrodes. That is to say, the pair of conductive layers <b>501</b> and the pair of conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> are provided in a cross shape. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top view of FIG. <b>15</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0158">Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. <b>15</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>15</b>C<b>2</b>, a sacrifice layer <b>507</b> is formed over the conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b>. The sacrifice layer <b>507</b> can be formed and processed in a similar manner to the aforementioned conductive layers. The sacrifice layer <b>507</b> formed here is removed in later sacrifice layer etching, and the portion where the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> existed becomes a space. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top view of FIG. <b>15</b>C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0159">Next, as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>16</b>A<b>2</b>, conductive layers <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> are formed over the sacrifice layer <b>507</b>. The conductive layers <b>508</b> and <b>509</b> can be formed and processed in a similar manner to the aforementioned conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> and sacrifice layer <b>507</b>. The conductive layer <b>509</b> becomes a contact electrode which conducts along a conducting route by being in contact with the conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b>, while the conductive layer <b>508</b> becomes a driving electrode which drives a switch by applying voltage between the conductive layer <b>508</b> and the conductive layer <b>501</b>. Thus, the conductive layer <b>508</b> is provided so as to face the pair of conductive layers <b>501</b> with the insulating layer <b>504</b> and the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> interposed therebetween, and the conductive layer <b>509</b> is provided so as to face the pair of conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> with the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> interposed therebetween. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top view of FIG. <b>16</b>A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0160">Next, as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>16</b>B<b>2</b>, a structural layer <b>510</b> is formed over the conductive layers <b>508</b> and <b>509</b>. The structural layer <b>510</b> can be formed with an insulating material to have a single-layer structure or a multilayer structure, and processed in a similar manner to the above sacrifice layer <b>507</b> or the like. The structural layer <b>510</b> formed here is to form the shape of the structural body having a bridge structure and to constitute a main portion that can move. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top view of FIG. <b>16</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0161">Subsequently, a space <b>511</b> is formed by removing the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> by sacrifice layer etching as shown in FIGS. <b>16</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>16</b>C<b>2</b>. In this sacrifice layer etching, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>510</b> can be removed by first sacrifice layer etching and then a part of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> that is under the structural layer <b>510</b> can be removed by second sacrifice layer etching, as shown in the aforementioned embodiment mode. Then, the conductive layer <b>509</b> and the conductive layer <b>505</b> face each other with the space <b>511</b> therebetween, and the conductive layer <b>501</b> and the conductive layer <b>508</b> face each other with the space <b>511</b> and the insulating layer <b>504</b> interposed therebetween. Thus, the structural body <b>512</b> having the space <b>511</b> formed by removing the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> and the structural layer <b>510</b> capable of moving in the space <b>511</b> can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0162">Moreover, in the above sacrifice layer etching, it is also possible that most of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> that is under the structural layer <b>510</b> is removed by the second sacrifice layer etching, and the rest of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> is removed by third sacrifice layer etching. The part of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> left by the second sacrifice layer etching can be used as a supporter that supports the structural layer <b>510</b> to prevent the structural layer <b>510</b> from buckling; thus, the attachment when drying can be prevented. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top view of FIG. <b>16</b>C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0163">Moreover, holes <b>513</b> can be provided in the structural layer <b>510</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>17</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>17</b>A<b>2</b>. Then, as described in the above embodiment mode, the part of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> that does not overlap with the structural layer <b>510</b> and a part of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> that is right under the holes <b>513</b> can be removed by the first sacrifice layer etching, and the part of the sacrifice layer <b>507</b> that is under the structural layer <b>510</b> can be removed by the second sacrifice layer etching. In addition, as shown in FIGS. <b>17</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>17</b>B<b>2</b>, a depression <b>514</b> can be provided in the insulating layer <b>504</b> right under the holes <b>513</b> by etching after the first sacrifice layer etching, and then, the second sacrifice layer etching can be conducted. Furthermore, a lyophilic process can be carried out after providing the depression <b>514</b> and then the second sacrifice layer etching can be conducted. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top views of FIGS. <b>17</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>17</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0164">Next, operation of the structural body <b>512</b> manufactured by the above method will be described. The structural body <b>512</b> functions as a switch that operates whether to convey a signal or not. Here, FIG. <b>16</b>C<b>2</b> shows an OFF state of the switch. Since voltage is not applied between the driving electrodes (i.e., between the conductive layers <b>501</b> and <b>508</b>), the conductive layer <b>505</b> and the conductive layer <b>506</b> are not electrically connected to each other. FIGS. <b>18</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>18</b>A<b>2</b> show an ON state of the switch. Here, the structural layer <b>510</b> is lowered by applying voltage between the driving electrodes (i.e., between the conductive layers <b>501</b> and <b>508</b>) to generate an electrostatic force. The conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> are electrically connected to each other by lowering the structural layer until the conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> come into contact with the conductive layer <b>509</b>. Since the conductive layers <b>505</b> and <b>506</b> and the conductive layer <b>509</b> are provided with the space <b>511</b> therebetween, switching operation can be performed in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0165">A switch using an electrostatic attracting force in this way is driven based on balance between an attracting force generated between the driving electrodes (i.e., between the conductive layers <b>501</b> and <b>508</b>) and a force of restitution (=spring constant&#xd7;displacement) due to the material and structure of the structural layer <b>510</b>. In other words, the switch can be turned on by applying voltage large enough to generate an electrostatic force that exceeds the force of restitution of the structural layer <b>510</b>. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>502</b>, the base layer <b>503</b>, and the insulating layer <b>504</b> are omitted in the top view of FIG. <b>18</b>A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0166">When the holes <b>513</b> are provided in the structural layer <b>510</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>17</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>17</b>A<b>2</b>, air resistance that acts on a beam portion of the structural layer <b>510</b> can be decreased to increase switching speed. The provision of the holes <b>513</b> has an advantageous effect of decreasing the remaining stress in the structural layer <b>510</b> to reduce the spring constant. In addition, decreasing the mass provides an advantageous effect that mechanical resonance frequency for the beam portion of the structural layer <b>510</b> is increased. Further, even though the holes <b>513</b> are provided so as to penetrate through the conductive layer <b>508</b>, the electrostatic capacitance between the driving electrodes is almost the same as that in the case where the holes <b>513</b> are not provided if the diameter of each of the holes <b>513</b> is larger than the distance between the conductive layers <b>501</b> and <b>508</b>, which are the driving electrodes, by three to four times or less. This is because defects of electrostatic capacitance of the holes <b>513</b> can be compensated by a fringing effect.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0167">Although this embodiment mode has shown the structural body <b>512</b> with a bridge structure, the structural body can be formed to have, for example, a cantilever structure. It is to be noted that the bridge structure means a structure with its opposite ends fixed to the substrate and its center not in contact with the substrate. The cantilever structure means a structure of the structural body formed over a substrate with only one end thereof fixed to the substrate and the other end not in contact with the substrate. This embodiment mode can be freely combined with any of the above embodiment modes.</p>

<p id="p-0168" num="0168">With reference to FIGS. <b>19</b>A<b>1</b> to <b>20</b>C<b>2</b>, this embodiment mode will describe a specific method for manufacturing a structural body of a micromachine, which is different from the structural bodies shown in the above embodiment modes and which can be used as a sensor. In each drawing used here, a top view is shown on the left side and a cross-sectional view is shown on the right side.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0169">As shown in FIGS. <b>19</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>A<b>2</b>, a first conductive layer <b>601</b> is formed over a substrate <b>602</b>. The first conductive layer <b>601</b> can be formed in such a way that a conductive material is processed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. The first conductive layer <b>601</b> can have a single-layer or multilayer structure. FIGS. <b>19</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>A<b>2</b> show the case in which the first conductive layer <b>601</b> is formed in a single-layer structure after forming a base layer <b>603</b> over the substrate <b>602</b>. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>602</b> and the base layer <b>603</b> are omitted in FIG. <b>19</b>A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0170">Next, as shown in FIGS. <b>19</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>B<b>2</b>, a sacrifice layer <b>604</b> is formed over the first conductive layer <b>601</b>. The sacrifice layer <b>604</b> can be formed and processed in a similar way to the first conductive layer <b>601</b>. Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. <b>19</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>C<b>2</b>, a second conductive layer <b>605</b>, an insulating layer <b>606</b>, and a third conductive layer <b>607</b> are stacked over the sacrifice layer <b>604</b>. Here, the second conductive layer <b>605</b> and the third conductive layer <b>607</b> can be formed in a similar manner to the first conductive layer <b>601</b>, and the insulating layer <b>606</b> can be formed using an insulating material. Over these layers, a resist can be formed by photolithography and the resist can be processed in a self-aligning manner by a dry or wet etching method. The second conductive layer <b>605</b>, the insulating layer <b>606</b>, and the third conductive layer <b>607</b> (these three layers are also referred to as a structural layer collectively in this embodiment mode) function as a movable structure portion. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>602</b> and the base layer <b>603</b> are omitted in FIGS. <b>19</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0171">Next, the sacrifice layer <b>604</b> is removed by sacrifice layer etching to form a space <b>608</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>19</b>D<b>1</b> and <b>19</b>D<b>2</b>. Here, a part of the sacrifice layer <b>604</b> that does not overlap with the second conductive layer <b>605</b> can be removed by first sacrifice layer etching and a part of the sacrifice layer <b>604</b> that is under the second conductive layer <b>605</b> can be removed by second sacrifice layer etching, in a similar manner to the above embodiment mode.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0172">In addition, holes <b>609</b> can be provided in the structural layer as shown in FIGS. <b>20</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>A<b>2</b>. In this case, the procedure can be as follows as explained in the above embodiment mode: (1) a part of the sacrifice layer <b>604</b> that is right under the holes <b>609</b> is removed by the first sacrifice layer etching, (2) a depression <b>610</b> is provided in the first conductive layer <b>601</b> that will become a lower electrode, and then (3) the part of the sacrifice layer <b>604</b> that is under the structural layer is removed by the second sacrifice layer etching.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0173">In the case of not providing the holes in the structural layer, a groove <b>611</b> having a similar function to the depression <b>610</b> can be provided in the first conductive layer <b>601</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>20</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>B<b>2</b>. The groove <b>611</b> has a comb-like shape when viewed from above (see FIG. <b>20</b>B<b>1</b>). Specifically, the first conductive layer <b>601</b> is provided with the groove <b>611</b> arbitrarily. Alternatively, the groove <b>611</b> can be formed after forming the first conductive layer <b>601</b>, and after that, the sacrifice layer <b>604</b> can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0174">In addition, as shown in FIGS. <b>20</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>C<b>2</b>, a layer <b>612</b> that overlaps with the structural layer can be formed and then the sacrifice layer etching can be carried out. In FIG. <b>19</b>D<b>1</b> and FIGS. <b>20</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>20</b>B<b>1</b>, and <b>20</b>C<b>1</b>, the substrate <b>602</b> and the base layer <b>603</b> are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0175">In the structural body manufactured as above, an end of the structural layer formed to have a cantilever shape is movable by an external force (such as pressure or acceleration). Then, since the electrostatic capacitance between the first conductive layer <b>601</b> and the second conductive layer <b>605</b> changes by the movement of the structural layer, the structural body can function as a sensor by detecting the displacement. For example, a voltage V<b>1</b> and a voltage V<b>2</b> are applied to the first conductive layer <b>601</b> and the third conductive layer <b>607</b> and a voltage Vx of the second conductive layer <b>605</b> is detected; thus, the displacement of the structural layer can be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0176">Although this embodiment mode has shown the example of the structural body having the structural layer with a cantilever shape, the structural body may have a structural layer with a bridge structure as shown in the above embodiment mode.

<p id="p-0178" num="0178">As shown in FIGS. <b>21</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>A<b>2</b>, a first layer <b>302</b> is formed over a substrate <b>301</b>. Here, the first layer <b>302</b> may be formed directly on the substrate <b>301</b>; however, a layer serving as a protection film is desirably formed in advance in a single-layer or multilayer structure. FIG. <b>21</b>A<b>2</b> shows an example of forming two layers of protection layers <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b </i>over the substrate and forming the first layer <b>302</b> over the protection layers <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b</i>. Each of the protection layer <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b </i>is formed with a material such as silicon oxide, hafnium oxide, silicon nitride, or hafnium nitride. The first layer <b>302</b> can be formed in such a way that a thin film formed with a material having a semiconductor property, for example, silicon, germanium, or the like is processed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. The first layer <b>302</b> functions as a semiconductor layer in the semiconductor element and functions as a lower driving electrode in the structural body.

The insulating layer <b>304</b> can be formed with an oxide of a semiconductor material or a metal, or a nitride of a semiconductor material or a metal. For example, the insulating layer <b>304</b> can be formed with silicon oxide or hafnium oxide by a high-density plasma CVD method. Then, the second layer <b>305</b> can be formed by processing a conductive material in a similar manner to the first layer <b>302</b>.

FIG. <b>21</b>B<b>2</b> shows an example of forming the second layer <b>305</b> in a single-layer structure.

The high-concentration impurity regions <b>306</b> and <b>307</b> have high conductivity. As the impurity element, either an impurity imparting P-type or N-type conductivity to a semiconductor or both of them can be implanted selectively. FIGS. <b>22</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>22</b>A<b>2</b> show an example in which the N-type high-concentration impurity region <b>306</b> is formed by implanting the impurity imparting N-type conductivity in the first layer <b>302</b> that forms the left semiconductor element and the P-type high-concentration impurity region <b>307</b> is formed by implanting the impurity imparting P-type conductivity in the first layer <b>302</b> that forms the right semiconductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0181">After forming the second layer <b>305</b>, a sidewall can also be formed around the second layer <b>305</b> in the following manner: an impurity element is implanted in the first layer <b>302</b> at low concentration, an insulating layer is formed over the second layer <b>305</b>, and then the insulating layer is removed by anisotropic etching. After that, the high-concentration impurity region and a low-concentration impurity region can also be formed in the semiconductor layer (first layer <b>302</b>) by implanting the impurity element at high concentration. The provision of the impurity regions with different impurity concentrations in the semiconductor layer in this way can improve the reliability of the semiconductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0182">Next, as shown in FIGS. <b>22</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>22</b>B<b>2</b>, a third layer <b>308</b> is formed over the second layer <b>305</b>. The third layer <b>308</b> is formed by processing an insulating material in a similar manner to the above second layer <b>305</b>. In the semiconductor element, the third layer <b>308</b> is formed to serve as an interlayer insulating layer in which a contact portion between a later-formed fourth layer <b>309</b> and the second layer <b>305</b> is formed. In the structural body, the third layer <b>308</b> is formed to serve as a sacrifice layer. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>301</b>, the protection layers <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b</i>, and the insulating layer <b>304</b> are omitted in FIGS. <b>22</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>22</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>

The fourth layer <b>309</b> is formed by processing a conductive material in a similar manner to the third layer <b>308</b>. The fourth layer functions as a wire that electrically connects elements in the semiconductor element and functions as a contact electrode and an upper driving electrode in the structural body.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0184">Next, a fifth layer <b>310</b> is formed over the fourth layer <b>309</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23B</figref>. The fifth layer <b>310</b> can be formed by processing an insulating material in a similar manner to the fourth layer <b>309</b>. The fifth layer <b>310</b> functions as a protection layer covering the entire semiconductor element and functions as a structural layer in the structural body. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>301</b>, the protection layers <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b</i>, and the insulating layer <b>304</b> are omitted in FIGS. <b>23</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>23</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0185">Subsequently, as shown in FIGS. <b>24</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>24</b>A<b>2</b>, the third layer <b>308</b> that forms the structural body portion, i.e., the sacrifice layer is removed by sacrifice layer etching, thereby forming a space <b>311</b>. The space <b>311</b> is surrounded by the fourth layer <b>309</b> and the fifth layer <b>310</b> on its top side, the fifth layer <b>310</b> on its lateral side, and the insulating layer <b>304</b> and the second layer <b>305</b> on its bottom side. Here, the third layer <b>308</b> existing in the semiconductor element portion is not removed because it is not exposed by being covered with the fifth layer <b>310</b>, and only the third layer <b>308</b> in the region where the structural layer is formed is removed. In this sacrifice layer etching, a part of the sacrifice layer (third layer <b>308</b>) that does not overlap with the structural layer can be removed by first sacrifice layer etching and a part of the sacrifice layer (third layer <b>308</b>) that is under the structural layer can be removed by second sacrifice layer etching By conducting the sacrifice layer etching in multiple steps in this way, the time required for the sacrifice layer etching can be shortened and the structural layer can be prevented from buckling. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>301</b>, the protection layers <b>303</b><i>a </i>and <b>303</b><i>b</i>, and the insulating layer <b>304</b> are omitted in FIG. <b>24</b>A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0186">Thus, an N-type thin film transistor <b>312</b>, a P-type thin film transistor <b>313</b>, and a structural body <b>314</b> functioning as a switch can be formed.

<p id="p-0187" num="0187">Although this embodiment mode has shown the case in which the structural body and the semiconductor element are formed over one insulating substrate, a storage element of a memory can also be formed over the same insulating substrate as the structural body in addition to the semiconductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0188">This embodiment mode can be freely combined with any of the above embodiment modes.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Embodiment Mode 9</heading>
<p id="p-0189" num="0189">This embodiment mode shows an example which is different from the above embodiment modes in that a plurality of structural bodies having different functions are formed through the same process. An example in which elements functioning as an inductor, a variable capacitor, a switch, and a sensor are formed at the same time will be shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0190">A method for manufacturing an inductor is described with reference to FIGS. <b>25</b>A<b>1</b> to <b>25</b>D<b>2</b>. First, as shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>25</b>A<b>2</b>, a first conductive layer <b>902</b> is formed over a substrate <b>901</b>. A semiconductor substrate, a glass substrate, a plastic substrate, a metal substrate, or the like can be used as the substrate <b>901</b>. These substrates can be used as they are, or the substrates each having a protection film formed thereover can also be used. FIG. <b>25</b>A<b>2</b> shows an example of forming the first conductive layer <b>902</b> after forming a protection layer <b>903</b> over the substrate <b>901</b>. The first conductive layer <b>902</b> can be formed in such a way that a conductive material is processed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. The first conductive layer <b>902</b> has a circular shape and a portion thereof is open. The circular shape of the first conductive layer <b>902</b> has its radius continuously changing from one end of the first conductive layer <b>902</b> to the other end. This is because a second conductive layer is formed with a swirling shape (also called a winding shape, planar coil shape, or cocentric circular shape) in a later step. Here, the first conductive layer <b>902</b> has a conductive layer having a circular shape; a conductive layer having a first rod shape, which is connected electrically to an end of the conductive layer having a circular shape; and a conductive layer having a second rod shape, which is physically apart from the center of the conductive layer having a circular shape. The shape of the first conductive layer <b>902</b> is not limited to this, and is determined depending on a final form of an inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0191">Next, a sacrifice layer <b>904</b> is formed over the first conductive layer <b>902</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>25</b>B<b>2</b>. The sacrifice layer <b>904</b> can be formed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. The sacrifice layer <b>904</b> is provided with openings <b>921</b> and <b>922</b> to have contact with the first conductive layer <b>902</b>. The openings <b>921</b> and <b>922</b> are formed by a dry or wet etching method. The openings <b>921</b> and <b>922</b> are provided in order to electrically connect the first conductive layer <b>902</b> to the subsequently-formed conductive layer. Thus, in FIGS. <b>25</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>25</b>B<b>2</b>, although the openings are formed at ends of the first conductive layer <b>902</b> that has been processed, the positions of the openings are not limited to these.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0192">Next, as shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>25</b>C<b>2</b>, the second conductive layer <b>905</b> and the insulating layer <b>906</b> are formed and processed in a self-aligning manner by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. At this time, the second conductive layer <b>905</b> and the insulating layer <b>906</b> are each processed to have an swirling shape (also called a winding shape, planar coil shape, cocentric circular shape, or spiral shape). The eddy shape is clockwise in FIG. <b>25</b>C<b>1</b>; however, it may be counterclockwise. In this embodiment mode, the second conductive layer <b>905</b> and the insulating layer <b>906</b> are collectively referred to as a structural layer.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0193">Next, the sacrifice layer <b>904</b> is removed by sacrifice layer etching to form a space, as shown in FIGS. <b>25</b>D<b>1</b> and <b>25</b>D<b>2</b>. The space is partially in contact with the second conductive layer <b>905</b> on its top side and the first conductive layer <b>902</b> or the protection layer <b>903</b> on its bottom side. The space is entirely open on its lateral side, and the second conductive layer <b>905</b> is provided to have a columnar shape in the center of the space. Thus, a structural body <b>907</b> functioning as an inductor can be formed. In this manner, the inductor having the space between the substrate <b>901</b> and the structural layer can have less interaction with the substrate <b>901</b>; therefore, the inductor can be used particularly at high frequency regions. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>901</b> and the protection layer <b>903</b> are omitted in FIGS. <b>25</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>B<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>C<b>1</b>, and <b>25</b>D<b>1</b>.</p>

These substrates can be used as they are, or the substrates each having a protection film formed thereover can also be used. FIG. <b>26</b>A<b>2</b> shows an example of forming the first conductive layers <b>912</b> after forming a protection layer <b>913</b> over the substrate <b>911</b>. The first conductive layers <b>912</b> can be formed in such a way that a conductive material is processed by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0196">Next, a sacrifice layer <b>914</b> is formed over the first conductive layers <b>912</b> as shown in FIGS. <b>26</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>B<b>2</b>. The sacrifice layer <b>914</b> can be formed similarly to the first conductive layers <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0197">Next, as shown in FIGS. <b>26</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>C<b>2</b>, the second conductive layer <b>915</b> and the insulating layer <b>916</b> are formed and processed in a self-aligning manner by resist patterning by photolithography and a dry or wet etching method. In this embodiment mode, the second conductive layer <b>915</b> and the insulating layer <b>916</b> are collectively referred to as a structural layer.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0198">Next, the sacrifice layer <b>914</b> is removed by sacrifice layer etching to form a space, as shown in FIGS. <b>26</b>D<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>D<b>2</b>.

In other words, the space is surrounded by the second conductive layer <b>915</b> on its top side and lateral side and the protection layer <b>913</b> on its bottom side, and is open on another lateral side. Thus, the structural body <b>917</b> functioning as a variable capacitor can be formed. Here, when one of the first conductive layers <b>912</b> serves as a capacitor electrode and the other serves as a control electrode, the distance between the second conductive layer <b>915</b> and the first conductive layer <b>912</b> serving as a capacitor electrode changes by applying voltage between the second conductive layer <b>915</b> and the first conductive layer <b>912</b> serving as a control electrode to lower the structural layer. This can be used as a variable capacitor. It is to be noted that the substrate <b>911</b> and the protection layer <b>913</b> are omitted in FIGS. <b>26</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>B<b>1</b>, and the substrate <b>911</b>, the protection layer <b>913</b>, and the insulating layer <b>916</b> are omitted in FIGS. <b>26</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>26</b>D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0199">The sacrifice layer etching in the aforementioned manufacturing method can be conducted in a short period of time by dividing the sacrifice layer etching into multiple steps as shown in the above embodiment modes, and moreover it is possible to prevent the structural layer from being attached to the first conductive layer <b>912</b> or the protection layer <b>913</b> when drying. In the case of manufacturing a variable capacitor, the structural layer may be provided with a hole. The hole in the structural layer can reduce air resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0200">Moreover, in the above manufacturing method, the structural body functioning as a switch or a sensor as described in the above embodiment mode can be manufactured by adding a step of forming a conductive layer and an insulating layer under the first conductive layer <b>912</b> or conducting the sacrifice layer etching after forming a conductive layer over the insulating layer <b>916</b>.</p>

It is understood that the sacrifice layer is not removed, because the region where the sacrifice layer <b>802</b> overlaps with the structural layer <b>803</b> or the sacrifice layer <b>812</b> overlaps with the structural layer <b>813</b> is shown in white in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0218">Next, the same sample as that in Experiment 3 was used in Experiment 4 to carry out sacrifice layer etching in two steps. That is to say, the sacrifice layer etching is conducted under the same condition as that in Experiment 2.</p>

Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref> is a photograph taken at 500-fold magnification of the incident-light microscope. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref> is a photograph showing the portion where the distribution of the sacrifice layer <b>802</b> is not dense, i.e., the portion where a single structural body is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref> is a photograph showing the portion where the distribution of the sacrifice layer <b>802</b> is dense, i.e., the portion where a plurality of structural bodies are formed. It is understood that the sacrifice layer has been removed, because the region where the sacrifice layer overlaps with the structural layer is shown in yellow-green if the photographs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A and 34B</figref> are in color. Since black-and-white photographs are used in this specification, the photographs have an intermediate color between black and white. In this way, the sacrifice layer etching can be conducted with high accuracy even on the sample having different densities in the distribution of the sacrifice layer.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0220">From the comparison between Experiment 3 and Experiment 4, it is possible to remove the sacrifice layer accurately and to improve the yield in the sacrifice layer etching step by using the method of the present invention even in the portion where the distribution of the sacrifice layer <b>812</b> is not dense.</p>
