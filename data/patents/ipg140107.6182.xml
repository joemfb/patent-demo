<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to information management systems and, more particularly, to updating the configuration of information management systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embedded systems are used in a variety of modern electro-mechanical systems. These systems are often configured to perform one or more specialized tasks associated with the overall system in which they are deployed. In many cases, these embedded systems perform data retrieval and archiving functions associated with a larger system. For example, an embedded system may include an information management system programmed to store parameters or data, perform calculations using the parameters or data, and create trends, reports, and histograms for the data. The information management system may also be responsive to a triggering event or schedule. Embedded systems are often highly specialized to the systems in which they are deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to minimize development and manufacturing costs, generic information management systems have been developed that are compatible with a variety of different systems. Once deployed in a system, these generic information management systems may be customized using processor-executable embedded software loaded into a memory device associated with the information management system. This embedded software may contain instructions for monitoring virtually every operation associated with the system. By customizing operations of each embedded system at the software level, the same information management system hardware may be employed in a variety of applications, allowing for mass-production of the generic hardware. Further, because the functionality of the system is defined almost exclusively in software, updates, modifications, and upgrades may be made to the system without necessitating replacement of the system hardware, thereby reducing repair and upgrade costs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because software for embedded systems may define virtually all functional aspects associated with the system, the design of software for these systems may be complicated and time intensive, and may require highly specialized knowledge of software development techniques. For example, embedded software associated with engine monitoring may comprise hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and the total embedded software on machines can be millions of lines of code.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One system for simplifying the design of software for these types of generic hardware systems focuses on methods to configure a machine electronic control module (ECM), while minimizing inventory requirements and reducing the total production time. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,529,805 to Aldrich, III, et al. (the '805 patent) discloses a method and apparatus for configuring an ECM for multiple automobile configurations. The disclosed apparatus includes an automobile identifier identifying one of the multiple automobile configurations, and a memory configured to store multiple configuration data sets, with each of the multiple data sets corresponding to one of the multiple configurations. The apparatus also includes a processor configured to receive the automobile identifier and select one of multiple data sets based at least in part upon the automobile identifier for execution of automobile functions controlled by the automobile ECM.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although the method and apparatus for configuring an ECM for multiple automobile configurations described in the '805 patent allows a single hardware and software module to be used on multiple machines, the method and apparatus of the '805 patent do not allow for easy upgrades. Specifically, because the '805 patent requires the different configuration files to be loaded onto the ECM module during manufacture of the machine, the ECM module cannot be updated to reflect modifications to the machine, such as, for example, the addition or subtraction of a sensor, the addition of a new type of sensor, or a change in required performance of the machine or a sensor. Also, the ECM module has a set of configurations, and the calculations in a specific configuration cannot be changed without rewriting the entire configuration. Additionally, changes are limited to sets of vehicles, and cannot be customized at a low cost for one specific machine.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosed system and method for updating information management system configurations are directed to improvements in the existing technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Data system <b>106</b> may include subsystems that communicate to automatically gather and report information from machine <b>100</b> during operation. For example, data system <b>106</b> may include an electronic control module (ECM), or another processor capable of executing, and/or for outputting command signals in response to received and/or stored data to affect machine <b>100</b>. Data system <b>106</b> may include any means for monitoring, recording, storing, indexing, processing, and/or communicating the operational aspects of machine <b>100</b>.

Data system <b>106</b> may also include an onboard information management system (IMS) <b>110</b> associated with each machine <b>100</b>. IMS <b>110</b> may monitor the health and status of machine <b>100</b>. For example, IMS <b>110</b> may monitor parameters on machine <b>100</b>, such as, for example, machine location, oil pressure, hydraulic contamination level, travel speed, current task progress, etc. During machine <b>100</b> operation, IMS <b>110</b> may, among other things, monitor, sample, and/or convert into parameter data, the signals provided by sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In addition, IMS <b>110</b> may store, manipulate, and/or perform calculations with the parameter data.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may include virtual sensors. Instead of direct measurements, virtual sensors have been developed to process other various physically measured values and to produce values that were previously measured directly by physical sensors. A virtual sensor may refer to a mathematical algorithm or model that produces output measures comparable to a physical sensor based on inputs from other systems, such as may be sensed by physical sensors <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. For example, a physical NO<sub>x </sub>emission sensor may measure the NO<sub>x </sub>emission level of machine <b>100</b> and provide values of NO<sub>x </sub>emission level to other components, such as an ECM; while a virtual NO<sub>x </sub>emission sensor may provide calculated values of NO<sub>x </sub>emission level to an ECM based on other measured or calculated parameters, such as compression ratios, turbocharger efficiency, aftercooler characteristics, temperature values, pressure values, ambient conditions, fuel rates, and engine speeds, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">IMS <b>110</b> may also report the values of the parameters to an off-board system (not shown) during machine operation.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Continuing the simplified exemplary embodiment, using the data in configuration file <b>306</b>, the configuration tool <b>304</b> may provide one or more data objects as inputs to software node <b>302</b> N<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is contemplated that the ordering of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is exemplary only and not intended to be limiting. Accordingly, certain steps may be performed before or simultaneously with one or more of the other steps.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Methods and systems consistent with the disclosed embodiments enable a single hardware and software module to be used on multiple types of machines <b>100</b>. IMS <b>110</b> employing the disclosed methods and processes allow updates to reflect modifications to machine <b>100</b>, such as, for example, the addition or subtraction of a sensor <b>112</b>, the addition of a new type of sensor <b>112</b>, or a change in required performance of the machine <b>100</b> and/or a sensor <b>112</b>. As a result, the functional file of IMS <b>110</b> does not need to be changed or updated. Instead, only a configuration file <b>306</b> need be changed to implement updates or changes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although the disclosed embodiments are described in relation to IMS <b>110</b> on a machine <b>100</b>, the disclosed systems and methods may also be implemented in any environment where it may be advantageous to allow dynamic changes to an information management system, e.g., a IMS <b>110</b> system, without the expense of redesigning and recompiling the functional software, such as the software of the IMS module <b>207</b>. As an example, the disclosed IMS <b>110</b> may be employed wherever a system or apparatus may need a change to its IMS module <b>207</b> software, but the change is limited to that machine <b>100</b>, and where the costs associated with rewriting and recompiling the IMS module <b>207</b> software would not be justified.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The presently disclosed system and method for IMS <b>110</b> may have several advantages. First, because the presently disclosed method for IMS <b>110</b> allows updates to reflect a modification to a machine <b>100</b>, such as, for example, the addition or subtraction of a sensor <b>112</b>, the addition of a new type of sensor <b>112</b>, or a change in required performance of the machine <b>100</b> or a sensor <b>112</b> without recompiling the functional software of IMS module <b>207</b>, users may realize greater flexibility over conventional information management systems. For example, using the disclosed systems and methods to update the configuration file <b>306</b>, users may easily upgrade the IMS <b>110</b> when new sensors <b>112</b> are added. This reduction in cost may be reflected in more accurate data being recorded for each machine <b>100</b>. Thus, users will keep their machine <b>100</b> IMS <b>110</b> up-to-date with their sensors <b>112</b>, and the data stored for analysis will be based on actual sensor <b>112</b> data.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the presently disclosed IMS <b>110</b> system and method may decrease the cost of deploying such systems and methods on new types of machines. For instance, new information management system data <b>308</b> may be created by adding to the functional software of IMS module <b>207</b> one or more new software nodes <b>302</b> required to implement new information management system data <b>308</b>. In most cases, most of software nodes <b>302</b> may be usable without modification on the new machine types. As a result, the presently disclosed IMS <b>110</b> system and method may significantly reduce design time and cost, resulting in more effective and timely deployment of IMS <b>110</b> onto new machine types.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed system and method for information management. Other embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the present disclosure. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the present disclosure being indicated by the following claims.</p>
