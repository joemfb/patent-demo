<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An infant carrier apparatus comprises a support frame having opposite first and second sides, a handle pivotally coupled with the support frame, and a stop mechanism. The handle is operable to rotate relative to the support frame between a first position inclined toward the first side, and a second position inclined toward the second side. The stop mechanism is adapted to arrest the handle at an intermediate position when the handle is rotated from the first position toward the second position, wherein the intermediate position is located between the first and second position. In addition, other embodiments also described a method of adjusting the infant carrier apparatus.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to China Patent Application No. 201010144606.4, which was filed on Apr. 7, 2010.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an infant carrier apparatus and its adjusting method, and more particularly to an infant carrier apparatus and method that can prevent injury induced by accidental pinching of hands or legs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A stroller apparatus typically comprises a support frame provided with wheels, a seat assembly, a folding mechanism and a handle. After a child is placed in the seat, the parent can use the handle to push the stroller in movement. In traditional strollers, the seat assembly is usually oriented toward the front of the stroller in its direction of displacement. Because the child does not face the parent when seated in the stroller, no interaction is permitted between the child and the parent. To remedy this deficiency, some current approaches propose a stroller structure in which the orientation of the handle can be adjusted back and forth, whereby the child can be desirably seated facing the parent and the stroller displaced in either of two opposite directions. However, when the handle is adjusted from a first position inclined toward the front of the stroller to a second position inclined toward the rear, the close position of the handle with the support frame may create a clamping angle that can pinch the child's fingers or legs, causing potential risks of injury.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for an infant carrier apparatus that can prevent accidental pinching during adjustment of the handle, and address at least the foregoing issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present application describes an infant carrier apparatus and its adjusting method that can prevent the occurrence of accidental pinching during adjustment of the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the infant carrier apparatus comprises a support frame having opposite first and second sides, a handle pivotally coupled with the support frame, and a stop mechanism. The handle is operable to rotate relative to the support frame between a first position inclined toward the first side, and a second position inclined toward the first side. The stop mechanism is adapted to stop the handle at an intermediate position when the handle is rotated from the first position toward the second position, wherein the intermediate position is located between the first and second position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment a method of adjusting the infant carrier apparatus is described. The method comprises pivoting the handle relative to the support frame in a direction of adjustment from a first position inclined toward the first side toward a second position inclined toward the second side, forcing the handle to stop at an intermediate position before the handle reaches the second position, wherein the handle is stopped at the intermediate position by the stop mechanism in an engaged state, and removing the engaged state of the stop mechanism and continuing to rotate the handle in the direction of adjustment from the intermediate position to the second position.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view illustrating one embodiment of an infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b>. The infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b>, which is exemplary a baby stroller, can include a support frame <b>102</b>, and a seat <b>104</b> and handle <b>106</b> respectively connected pivotally with the support frame <b>102</b>. The support frame <b>102</b> can include a first frame portion <b>108</b>, a second frame portion <b>112</b>, a third frame portion <b>110</b>, and linking elements <b>114</b>. The first and third frame portions <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> can respectively define front and rear legs of the support frame <b>102</b>, whereas the second frame portion <b>112</b> can be respectively coupled with upper ends of the first and third frame portions <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. Each of the handle <b>106</b>, the first frame portion <b>108</b> and the second frame portion <b>112</b> can be respectively formed as a generally U-shaped tube assembly including left and right side segments (<b>106</b>A for the side segments of the handle <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>A for the side segments of the first frame portion <b>108</b>, and <b>112</b>A for the side segments of the second frame portion <b>112</b>), and a transversal segment connected between the side segments (<b>106</b>B for the grasping segment of the handle <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>B for the transversal segment of the first frame portion <b>108</b>, and <b>112</b>B for the transversal segment of the second frame portion <b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The left and right sides of the support frame <b>102</b> can have a symmetrical construction. More specifically, on each of the left and right sides, the side segments <b>106</b>A, <b>108</b>A and <b>112</b>A can be respectively coupled with a hinge structure <b>109</b> that permits the second frame portion <b>112</b> and the handle <b>106</b> to respectively pivot relative to the first frame portion <b>108</b>. Accordingly, the inclination of the handle <b>106</b> can be adjusted forward and rearward, and both the handle <b>106</b> and the second frame portion <b>112</b> can be folded relative to the first and third frame portions <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> to collapse the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">On each of the left and right sides, the third frame portion <b>110</b> can have an upper end pivotally coupled with the corresponding side segment <b>112</b>A of the second frame portion <b>112</b>, and a lower end portion connected with the first frame portion <b>108</b> via one corresponding linking element <b>114</b>. Multiple wheels <b>116</b> can be disposed at the lower ends of the first frame portion <b>108</b> and third frame portion <b>110</b> for displacement of the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b> toward a first or front side <b>102</b>A or a second or rear side <b>102</b>B of the support frame <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The seat <b>104</b> can include a seat frame <b>104</b>A, and a cushion <b>104</b>B (shown with phantom lines) disposed thereon. However, in alternate embodiments, the seat <b>104</b> may include a seat board or fabric attached with a seat frame. The seat <b>104</b> is disposed between the left and right side of the support frame <b>102</b>. The seat <b>104</b> can have a first or front end portion laterally coupled with the side segments <b>108</b>A via pivot connections, and an opposite second or rear end portion laterally coupled pivotally with hang bars <b>118</b>, which are in turn pivotally coupled with the side segments <b>112</b>A of the second frame portion <b>112</b>. When the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b> is collapsed or deployed for use, the second frame portion <b>112</b> can rotate about a pivot axis defined by the hinge structures <b>109</b>, causing the seat <b>104</b> to pivot relative to the first frame portion <b>108</b> via the pivotal connection of the hang bars <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a front upper region of the seat <b>104</b> can be provided with a first tray <b>122</b>, which can be pivotally connected with opposing inner sides of the hinge structures <b>109</b>. A footrest <b>124</b> can be affixed with the transversal segment <b>108</b>B of the first frame portion <b>108</b> at a front lower position of the seat <b>104</b>. The transversal segment <b>112</b>B of the second frame portion <b>112</b> can be mounted with a second tray <b>125</b>. The placement of the second tray <b>125</b> at a rear upper region of the seat <b>104</b> can be easily accessible to an adult caregiver, permitting convenient placement of various objects thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The transversal segment <b>112</b>B of the second frame portion <b>112</b> can also be provided with a frame adjustment control <b>126</b> operable to unlock a locking engagement between the first frame portion <b>108</b> and the second frame portion <b>112</b>. Once unlocked, the second frame portion <b>112</b> and handle <b>106</b> can be pivoted toward the first side <b>102</b>A of the support frame <b>102</b> to collapse the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are schematic views illustrating two different use configurations of the handle <b>106</b> respectively inclined toward the first side <b>102</b>A and second side <b>102</b>B. As shown, when the handle <b>106</b> is in a position inclined toward the second side <b>102</b>B, the left/right side segment <b>106</b>A of the handle <b>106</b> and the left/right side segment <b>112</b>A of the second frame portion <b>112</b> can be located adjacent to each other and extend generally parallel along a same direction. The caregiver can therefore use the handle <b>106</b> to push the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b> in movement toward the first side <b>102</b>A. In this configuration, a lock mechanism <b>130</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) assembled in the hinge structure <b>109</b> and operatively connected with a release control <b>132</b> on the grasping segment <b>106</b>B can lock the handle <b>106</b> with the second frame portion <b>112</b>. In contrast, when the handle <b>106</b> is adjusted to a position inclined toward the first side <b>102</b>A, a caregiver can use the handle <b>106</b> to push the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b> in movement toward the second side <b>102</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an intermediate position of the handle <b>106</b> between the first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (i.e., inclined toward the first side <b>102</b>A) and the second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (i.e., inclined toward the second side <b>102</b>B). As it is adjusted from the first position to the second position, the handle <b>106</b> rotates toward the second frame portion <b>112</b> and forms with it an acute clamping angle that may accidentally catch and pinch a child's hand or leg. To prevent the occurrence of finger pinch accidents, a safety measure can be implemented in the form of a stop mechanism <b>134</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) provided in the hinge structure <b>109</b>. In the course of the handle <b>106</b> toward the second frame portion <b>112</b>, the stop mechanism <b>134</b> can force the handle <b>106</b> to stop at a proper angular position away from the second frame portion <b>112</b>. Once the caregiver has verified that there is no risk of finger pinch occurrences, a release actuator <b>166</b> provided on the handle <b>106</b> can be operated to release the stop mechanism <b>134</b> and permit the handle <b>106</b> to continue its adjustment from the intermediate position to the second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exploded view illustrating the assembly of the lock mechanism <b>130</b> and stop mechanism <b>134</b> in the hinge structure <b>109</b>. For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> only shows the assembly implemented at one lateral side of the support frame <b>102</b>. It will be understood that the other side may also have a same construction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the side segment <b>106</b>A of the handle <b>106</b> can be affixed with a first coupling element <b>142</b>. Moreover, a portion of the support frame <b>102</b>, e.g., the side segment <b>112</b>A of the second frame portion <b>112</b>, can be affixed with a coupling bracket <b>144</b>. The first coupling element <b>142</b> can include a shell portion where is formed a shaft portion <b>142</b>A adapted to pivotally connect with the coupling bracket <b>144</b>. The handle <b>106</b> can thereby rotate relative to the support frame <b>102</b> about a pivot axis X<b>1</b> defined by the shaft portion <b>142</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The coupling bracket <b>144</b> has a distal end portion forming a generally cylindrical axle housing provided with a slot <b>146</b> on a lateral side. A second coupling element <b>145</b>, which is affixed with the side segment <b>108</b>A of the first frame portion <b>108</b>, can be assembled through the slot <b>146</b> for pivotally connecting the first frame portion <b>108</b> with the second frame portion <b>112</b>. At an opposite side of the slot <b>146</b>, the coupling bracket <b>144</b> can further include an extension forming an ear <b>148</b> where the third frame portion <b>110</b> can be pivotally connected. The lock mechanism <b>130</b> and the stop mechanism <b>134</b> can be respectively assembled and enclosed between the first coupling element <b>142</b> and the coupling bracket <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a side of the coupling bracket <b>144</b> adapted to connect with the first coupling element <b>142</b> of the handle side segment <b>106</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the stop mechanism <b>134</b> assembled with the first coupling element <b>142</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the lock mechanism <b>130</b> can include a latch unit <b>150</b>, a rotary plate <b>152</b>, a rigid holder cage <b>154</b> and a transmission cable <b>155</b>. The latch unit <b>150</b> and the rotary plate <b>152</b> can be disposed at least partially in an inner cavity <b>142</b>B of the first coupling element <b>142</b>. The transmission cable <b>155</b> can have two opposite ends respectively connected with the release control <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the rotary plate <b>152</b>. By operating the release control <b>132</b>, the transmission cable <b>155</b> can be drawn in movement to cause rotation of the rotary plate <b>152</b>, which in turn drives movement of the latch unit <b>150</b> to unlock the handle <b>106</b> and allow its adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the latch unit <b>150</b> can include two latching bolts <b>158</b> movably assembled with a casing <b>159</b>. When the latch unit <b>150</b> is assembled, the shaft portion <b>142</b>A passes through a hole <b>150</b>A of the casing <b>159</b>, such that the two latching bolts <b>158</b> are located at two diametrically opposite sides of the shaft portion <b>142</b>A. At a side of the casing <b>159</b>, the latching bolts <b>158</b> can be movably engaged through associated guide slots formed in the rotary plate <b>152</b>, such that rotation of the rotary plate <b>152</b> can drive the two latching bolts <b>158</b> to either move toward the shaft portion <b>142</b>A for unlocking disengagement, or away from the shaft portion <b>142</b>A for locking engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the coupling bracket <b>144</b> can include an inner cavity <b>144</b>A facing the rotary plate <b>152</b>. The holder cage <b>154</b> is fixedly secured in the inner cavity <b>144</b>A, and includes a plurality of locking slots <b>156</b>A, <b>156</b>B, <b>156</b>C and <b>156</b>D disposed at different radial directions relative to the pivot axis X<b>1</b>. Once assembled, the latching bolts <b>158</b> can lie in the inner cavity <b>144</b>A and within the boundaries of the holder cage <b>154</b>. Depending on whether the handle <b>106</b> is adjusted to the first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or the second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the latching bolts <b>158</b> can respectively engage with the locking slots <b>156</b>A and <b>156</b>B or with the locking slots <b>156</b>C and <b>156</b>D to lock the handle <b>106</b> in place and block its rotation relative to the support frame <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a radial direction illustrating the assembly of the stop mechanism <b>134</b>. For clarity, the representation of connecting portions associated with the first frame portion <b>108</b> is omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> and <b>10</b>, the stop mechanism <b>134</b> can include first and second abutting elements <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>, and a spring <b>164</b>. The first abutting element <b>160</b> can be affixed at a position of the coupling bracket <b>144</b> in the area of the inner cavity <b>144</b>A, for example adjacent to a center of the inner cavity <b>144</b>A. The first abutting element <b>160</b> can extend in a radial direction from the pivot axis X<b>1</b>, and have a polygonal shape including contiguous first and second sidewalls <b>160</b>A and <b>160</b>B. The first sidewall <b>160</b>A may extend substantially parallel to a radial direction from the pivot axis X<b>1</b>, whereas the second sidewall <b>160</b>B can be beveled relative to the first sidewall <b>160</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second abutting element <b>162</b> can be constructed as a movable abutting element assembled in the inner cavity <b>142</b>B of the first coupling element <b>142</b>, for example at a location radially distant from the shaft portion <b>142</b>A. The second abutting element <b>162</b> can include a slider element <b>162</b>A that may be assembled via a fixture <b>162</b>B secured with the first coupling element <b>142</b> through two screws <b>162</b>C. The fixture <b>162</b>B can define a slot <b>162</b>D into which the slider <b>162</b>A is held and guided in movement along a direction approximately radial relative to the shaft portion <b>142</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the spring <b>164</b> can be a compression spring that is disposed between the slider element <b>162</b>A and a peripheral sidewall of the inner cavity <b>142</b>B. The spring <b>164</b> can bias the slider element <b>162</b>A to a position that would cause the slider element <b>162</b>A to come in contact against the first abutting element <b>160</b> during adjustment of the handle <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For disengaging the slider element <b>162</b>A, the release actuator <b>166</b> is provided on the handle <b>106</b>. The release actuator <b>166</b> can be operatively connected with the slider element <b>162</b>A via a transmission cable <b>172</b>. The release actuator <b>166</b> can include a movable sleeve <b>171</b> that is formed by the assembly of first and second sleeve bodies <b>168</b> and <b>170</b>. An inner side of the first sleeve body <b>168</b> can form a post <b>168</b>A that passes through two elongated slots <b>174</b> formed on opposite sides of the handle side segment <b>106</b>A, and connect with the second sleeve body <b>170</b>. The transmission cable <b>172</b> can have a first end anchored with the slider element <b>162</b>A, and a second end remotely anchored with the post <b>168</b>A of the sleeve <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the release actuator <b>166</b> is operated by sliding the sleeve <b>171</b> in the direction D relative to the side segment <b>106</b>A of the handle <b>106</b>, the slider element <b>162</b>A can be drawn by the transmission cable <b>172</b> to slide away from the shaft portion <b>142</b>A and compress the spring <b>164</b>. The slider element <b>162</b>A can be thereby shifted to a disengaged position out of contact with the first abutting element <b>160</b>, which can permit rotation of the handle <b>106</b> in either direction without any obstruction. When the release actuator <b>166</b> is released, the spring <b>164</b> can urge the slider element <b>162</b>A toward the shaft portion <b>142</b>A to a position enabling its contacting with the first abutting element <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an intermediate position of the handle <b>106</b> corresponding to a contact occurrence between the first and second abutting elements <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>. For clarity, only the first abutting element <b>160</b> and the coupling bracket <b>144</b> associated with the second coupling frame <b>112</b> are partially represented with solid lines, whereas the second abutting element <b>162</b> and the first coupling element <b>142</b> associated with the handle <b>106</b> are partially drawn with phantom lines. The position of the first abutting element <b>160</b> is such that when the handle <b>106</b> is adjusted from the first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> toward the second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the slider element <b>162</b>A can move along with the handle <b>106</b> to come in abutment against the first sidewall <b>160</b>A of the first abutting element <b>160</b>. This abutment between the first and second abutting elements <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> creates an obstruction that can stop the handle <b>106</b> in an intermediate position sufficiently away from the second frame portion <b>112</b> to prevent finger pinching. It is worth noting that while this obstruction can block rotation of the handle <b>106</b> toward the second position, it still permits rotation of the handle <b>106</b> in a reverse direction toward the first side <b>102</b>A. Therefore, the intermediate position is only a temporarily stop, and does not constitute an adjusted position of the handle <b>106</b> for use.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To completely adjust the handle <b>106</b> to the second position, the release actuator <b>166</b> has to be manually operated to move the slider element <b>162</b>A to the disengaged position out of contact with the first abutting element <b>160</b>. Only then the handle <b>106</b> can be rotated from the intermediate position to the second position inclined toward the second frame portion <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the handle <b>106</b> being adjusted toward the first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the handle <b>106</b> is reversely adjusted from the second position toward the first position, the slider element <b>162</b>A moving along with the handle <b>106</b> can come into contact against the beveled second sidewall <b>160</b>B of the first abutting element <b>160</b>, which pushes the slider element <b>162</b>A in a direction away from the first abutting element <b>160</b> to compress the spring <b>164</b>. As a result, the handle <b>106</b> is not stopped at the intermediate position of the first abutting element <b>160</b> and can continue to rotate without obstruction until it reaches the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Exemplary use of the stop mechanism <b>134</b> in the adjustment of the handle <b>106</b> is described hereafter with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> and <b>8</b>-<b>10</b>. In a first step, the handle <b>106</b> can be rotated relative to the support frame <b>102</b> from the first position (i.e., inclined toward the first side <b>102</b>A of the support frame <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) toward the second position (i.e., inclined toward the second side <b>102</b>B of the support frame <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a second step, before the handle <b>106</b> reaches the second position, the slider element <b>162</b>A of the second abutting element <b>162</b> moving along with the handle <b>106</b> comes in abutment against the first sidewall <b>160</b>A of the first abutting element <b>160</b>, which forces the handle <b>106</b> to stop at the intermediate position away from the second frame portion <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a third step, since the handle <b>106</b> is stopped, the caregiver can verify that there is no risk of finger pinching, and then manually operate the release actuator <b>166</b> to disengage the slider element <b>162</b>A out of contact with the first abutting element <b>160</b>. After the engaged state of the stop mechanism <b>134</b> is removed, the handle <b>106</b> can be rotated until it reaches the second position inclined toward the second frame portion <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the handle <b>106</b> is adjusted from the first side <b>102</b>A toward the second side <b>102</b>B, the stop mechanism <b>134</b> provided in the hinge structure <b>109</b> can therefore arrest the handle <b>106</b> in an intermediate position at a suitable angle away from the second frame portion <b>112</b>. The caregiver can thus make sure that there is no risk of finger pinching, and then disengage the stop mechanism <b>134</b> so that the handle <b>106</b> can rotate in safe manner to the second position. Because the disengagement of the stop mechanism <b>134</b> requires a manual operation, the occurrence of finger pinching due to accidental rotation of the handle <b>106</b> can be effectively prevented. Accordingly, the infant carrier apparatus <b>100</b> can be safer in use.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the handle <b>106</b> is adjusted from the second position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to the first position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the moving slider element <b>162</b>A can contact against the beveled second sidewall <b>160</b>B, which pushes the slider element <b>162</b>A away and allows the handle <b>106</b> to continuously rotate without obstruction toward the first side <b>102</b>A of the support frame <b>102</b>. No manual disengagement of the stop mechanism <b>134</b> is therefore required in the direction of adjustment from the second side <b>102</b>B to the first side <b>102</b>A of the support frame <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Realizations in accordance with the present invention therefore have been described only in the context of particular embodiments. These embodiments are meant to be illustrative and not limiting. Many variations, modifications, additions, and improvements are possible.
