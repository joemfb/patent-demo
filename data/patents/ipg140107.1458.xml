<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A document-feeding roller mechanism includes a feeding roller assembly and a clamping-force adjusting module. The feeding roller includes a roller frame, a first roller unit, and a second roller unit. A document is conveyed by the first and second roller units through a printing module. The clamping-force adjusting module includes a cam unit and a resilient pressing unit. The resilient pressing unit is disposed between the roller frame and the cam unit. When the cam unit is rotated, the biasing force of the resilient pressing unit applied to the roller frame can be adjusted to change the document clamping force of the first and second roller units. Hence, just before a trailing end of the document is separated from the first and second roller units, the document clamping force can be reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of Chinese Application No. 201110125761.6, filed on May 10, 2011.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a printing apparatus, and more particularly to a document-feeding roller mechanism and a printing apparatus having the same and being capable of adjusting the document clamping force.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional printing apparatus, a document is clamped and conveyed by a feeding roller assembly to move through a printing module, and is ejected from the printing apparatus by a document-ejecting roller assembly disposed downstream of the printing module. During feeding of the document, the feeding roller assembly provides a clamping force to the document for pushing and moving the document toward the printing module.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the document is passing through the printing module, since leading and trailing ends of the document are clamped by the feeding roller assembly and the document-ejecting roller assembly, respectively, the document is subjected to a pulling force. When the trailing end of the document is removed from the feeding roller assembly, the pulling force applied to the document disappears due to release of the clamping force of the feeding roller assembly, thereby resulting in a change in the document tension. Such a sudden tension change affects adversely the printing quality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, since the clamping force of the feeding roller assembly to the document is fixed, in case of power failure occurring during a printing process, it is difficult to remove a document jammed in the feeding roller assembly from the conventional printing apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of this invention is to provide a document-feeding roller mechanism and a printing apparatus having the same, which can reduce adverse affection of the document clamping force of rollers on the printing quality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of this invention, there is provided a document-feeding roller mechanism adapted for conveying a document through a printing module, the document having a trailing end, the document-feeding roller mechanism comprising:</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0039">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the clamping-force adjusting module <b>4</b> is operable for adjusting the clamping force of the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> to the document <b>101</b>. The clamping-force adjusting module <b>4</b> includes a cam unit <b>42</b>, a resilient pressing unit <b>43</b>, and a movable member <b>44</b>. The cam unit <b>42</b> and the movable member <b>44</b> are positioned such that the second side surface <b>313</b> of the upright plate <b>311</b> faces the cam unit <b>42</b> and the movable member <b>44</b>. The movable member <b>44</b> is disposed between the upright plate <b>311</b> and the cam unit <b>42</b>, and has two opposite sides abutting respectively against the resilient pressing unit <b>43</b> and the cam unit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">In this embodiment, the movable member <b>44</b> is elongated, and the frame body <b>31</b> further includes two side plates <b>314</b> extending from the second side surface <b>313</b> of the upright plate <b>311</b> and spaced apart from each other. Each of the side plates <b>314</b> is formed with a guide slot <b>315</b>. The guide slots <b>315</b> in the side plates <b>314</b> are aligned with each other. Two ends of the movable member <b>44</b> extend respectively and movably into the guide slots <b>315</b>, so as to guide movement of the movable member <b>44</b> toward and away from the upright plate <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">The cam unit <b>42</b> includes a shaft <b>420</b> and a plurality of cams <b>421</b> disposed on the shaft <b>420</b>. Two ends of the shaft <b>420</b> extend respectively and rotatably through the side plates <b>314</b>. Each of the cams <b>421</b> has a rotating center <b>522</b> coaxial with the axis of the shaft <b>420</b>, a first camming surface portion <b>423</b>, and a second camming surface portion <b>424</b> nearer to the rotating center <b>422</b> than the first camming surface portion <b>423</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the resilient pressing unit <b>43</b> includes a plurality of torsion springs <b>431</b> disposed on the upright plate <b>311</b>. Each of the torsion springs <b>431</b> has two coiled portions <b>432</b>, a first resilient arm <b>433</b> connected between the coiled portions <b>432</b>, and two second resilient arms <b>434</b>. In this embodiment, the first resilient arm <b>433</b> is U-shaped, the two coiled portions <b>432</b> are connected respectively to two opposite ends of the first resilient arm <b>433</b>, and the second resilient arms <b>434</b> are connected respectively to the coiled portions <b>432</b>, and extend in the same direction. The upright plate <b>311</b> is formed with a plurality of spaced-apart lugs <b>316</b> permitting the coiled portions <b>432</b> of the torsion springs <b>431</b> to be sleeved respectively thereon. The first resilient arms <b>433</b> of the torsion springs <b>431</b> abut against the movable member <b>44</b>. The second resilient arms <b>434</b> of the torsion springs <b>431</b> extend through the upright plate <b>311</b>, and press respectively against the roller frames <b>321</b> so as to biasing the first roller unit <b>322</b> to contact the second roller unit <b>323</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">In an alternative embodiment, the movable member <b>44</b> is omitted, and the first resilient arms <b>433</b> of the torsion springs <b>431</b> abut directly against the cam unit <b>42</b>. In another alternative embodiment, only one torsion spring <b>431</b> and only one cam <b>421</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044">The sensor <b>34</b> is disposed on a bottom surface of one of the roller frames <b>321</b> between the frame body <b>31</b> and the first roller unit <b>322</b>. In this embodiment, the sensor <b>34</b> is a light shielding sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the kinetic power unit <b>33</b> includes a power source <b>331</b> and a transmission <b>332</b> for transmitting power from the power source <b>331</b> to an end of the shaft <b>420</b>. In this embodiment, the power source <b>331</b> is a motor, and the transmission <b>332</b> is a gearing. The power source <b>331</b> can drive the transmission <b>332</b> to thereby rotate the shaft <b>420</b> and, thus, the cams <b>421</b>. Operation of one of the cams <b>421</b> will be described in the following. When the cam <b>421</b> rotates to a first angular position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first camming surface portion <b>423</b> comes into contact with the movable member <b>44</b>. When the cam <b>421</b> rotates to a second angular position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second camming surface portion <b>423</b> comes into contact with the movable member <b>44</b>. As such, rotation of the cam <b>421</b> from the first angular position to the second angular position results in movement of the movable member <b>44</b> away from the upright plate <b>311</b>, so that a pressure applied from the second resilient arms <b>434</b> to the roller frames <b>321</b> is reduced. Hence, the document clamping force of the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> is also reduced. Conversely, rotation of the cam <b>421</b> from the second angular position to the first angular position results in movement of the movable member <b>44</b> toward the upright plate <b>311</b>, so that the pressure applied from the second resilient arms <b>434</b> to the roller frames <b>321</b> is increased. Hence, the document clamping force of the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> is also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">In this embodiment, the cam unit <b>42</b> is controlled such that, when the document <b>101</b> is fed toward the printing module <b>2</b> by the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b>, and when a trailing end <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the document <b>101</b> has not yet moves through the sensor <b>34</b>, the cam <b>422</b> is disposed at the first angular position, so that the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> provide a large document clamping force to feed the document <b>101</b> toward the printing module <b>2</b>; and when the trailing end <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the document <b>101</b> moves past the sensor <b>34</b> (i.e., when the document <b>101</b> moves to a position adjacent to and disposed upstream of the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>), and when the sensor <b>34</b> no longer detects the document <b>101</b>, the sensor <b>34</b> emits a sensing signal to the power source <b>331</b>. Upon receiving the sensing signal, the power source <b>331</b> activates the shaft <b>420</b> to rotate the cam <b>421</b> from the first angular position to the second angular position. Hence, the document clamping force of the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> are reduced in stages. In other words, a pulling force applied cooperatively by the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b> and the document-ejecting roller assembly <b>5</b> to the document <b>101</b> is released progressively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">When the cam <b>341</b> rotates to the second angular position, a pressure applied from the movable member <b>44</b> to the torsion springs <b>431</b> is reduced. At this time, although the first roller unit <b>322</b> still abuts against the second roller unit <b>323</b>, the document clamping force is reduced significantly. Hence, when the trailing end <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the document <b>101</b> separates from the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, a sudden change in the document tension caused due to a sudden reduction in the document pulling force can be avoided, so that adverse affection on the printing quality can be diminished.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref>, to rotate the cam <b>421</b> between the first and second angular positions, the document-feeding roller mechanism <b>3</b> further includes a cam-position sensing unit <b>45</b>. The cam-position sensing unit <b>45</b> includes a rotating member <b>451</b> co-rotatable with the cam unit <b>42</b>, and a cam-position sensor <b>452</b> for sensing the rotating member <b>451</b>. In this embodiment, the rotating member <b>451</b> is generally shaped as a sector, and is disposed on an end of the shaft <b>41</b>, and is adjacent to one of the side plates <b>314</b>. The cam-position sensor <b>452</b> is disposed on the side plate <b>314</b> adjacent to the rotating member <b>451</b>, is a U-shaped light shielding sensor, and has a notch <b>453</b>. The rotating member <b>452</b> is rotatable into the notch <b>453</b>, so that the cam-position sensor <b>452</b> generates a control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">In this embodiment, the rotating member <b>451</b> is controlled such that, when the cam <b>421</b> is disposed at the first angular position, the rotating member <b>451</b> is not moved into the notch <b>453</b> in the cam-position sensor <b>452</b>, and when the cam <b>421</b> rotates to the second angular position, and when the trailing end <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the document <b>101</b> separates from the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b>, the rotating member <b>451</b> is moved into the notch <b>453</b> in the cam-position sensor <b>452</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, so that the cam-position sensor <b>452</b> emits the control signal to the power source <b>311</b>. Upon receiving the control signal from the cam-position sensor <b>452</b>, the power source <b>311</b> drives the cam <b>421</b> to rotate from the second angular position to the first angular position, so as to increase the document clamping force of the first and second roller units <b>322</b>, <b>323</b> for feeding the next document <b>101</b> toward the printing module <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">In this embodiment, the rotating member <b>451</b> is designed such that, after reaching a position in the notch <b>453</b> in the cam-position sensor <b>452</b>, where the light can be shielded, it continues to rotate an angle of about 10&#xb0; to 15&#xb0;. In this manner, it is ensured that the light can be shielded even when the printing apparatus is subjected to a vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">Since the power source <b>331</b> of the document-feeding roller mechanism <b>3</b> is disposed for driving the clamping-force adjusting module <b>4</b>, during program initialization, it can be designed to drive rotation of the cam <b>421</b> from the first angular position to the second angular position when the document <b>101</b> is jammed without operation of the sensor <b>34</b>. In this manner, since the document clamping force of the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b> is reduced, the jammed document <b>101</b> can be removed with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0052">Alternatively, the torsion springs <b>431</b> may be replaced with tension springs or compression springs that are disposed between the cam unit <b>42</b> and the roller frames <b>321</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">In view of the above, through cooperation between the cam unit <b>42</b> and the resilient pressing unit <b>43</b> of the clamping-force adjusting module <b>4</b>, the document clamping force of the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b> can be adjusted according to the feeding state of the document <b>101</b> such that, just before the document <b>101</b> is moved into the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b>, the pulling force applied by the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b> and the document-ejecting roller assembly <b>5</b> to the document <b>101</b> can be released gradually, thereby preventing a sudden change in the document tension occurring when the document <b>101</b> separates from the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b>, so as to improving the printing quality. Thus, the object of this invention is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">Furthermore, after the trailing end <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the document <b>101</b> moves past the sensor <b>34</b>, and before it separates from the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b>, since it is subjected to a smaller clamping force, if the document <b>101</b> is jammed due to power failure, it can be removed easily from the feeding roller assembly <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">With this invention thus explained, it is apparent that numerous modifications and variations can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. It is therefore intended that this invention be limited only as indicated by the appended claims.</p>
