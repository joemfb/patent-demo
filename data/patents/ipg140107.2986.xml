<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to novel S-t-butyl protected cysteine di-peptide analogs and related compounds and methods of using these compounds for the treatment of diseases and/or conditions, including but not limited to diseases and/or conditions of Central Nervous System (CNS).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Diseases and/or conditions of the Central Nervous System (CNS) affect a large number of people. One of the CNS disorders, schizophrenia, is a debilitating disorder afflicting 1% of the world's population. The development of effective medications to treat schizophrenia relies on advances in characterizing the underlying pathophysiology.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional approaches to treating schizophrenia and other CNS disorders have significant disadvantages, including suboptimal efficacy and/or side effects associated with their use. For example, existing first and second generation antipsychotic agents have a number of shortcomings and significant side effects, such as extrapyramidal side effects, endocrine effects, obesity, elevated triglycerides, blood pressure and glucose levels, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal toxicity and agranulocytosis. Thus, it is desirable to develop novel agents that can improve treatment outcomes and safety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a significant need for new therapeutical agents to treat disorders of the CNS.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Certain compounds described herein may contain one or more chiral atoms, or may otherwise be capable of existing as two enantiomers, or two or more diastereoisomers. Accordingly, the compounds of this invention include mixtures of enantiomers/diastereoisomers as well as purified enantiomers/diastereoisomers or enantiomerically/diastereoisomerically enriched mixtures. Also included within the scope of the invention are the individual isomers of the compounds represented by formulas above as well as any wholly or partially equilibrated mixtures thereof. The present invention also covers the individual isomers of the compounds represented by the formulas above as mixtures with isomers thereof in which one or more chiral centers are inverted. Also, it is understood that all tautomers and mixtures of tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds of the formulas above.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms, e.g., hemi-hydrate. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Certain compounds of the invention also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the nitrogen atoms may form salts with acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, furmaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous hydroxide potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid salts are equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention. (See, for example S. M. Berge, et al., &#x201c;Pharmaceutical Salts,&#x201d; <i>J. Pharm. Sci., </i>66: 1-19 (1977) which is incorporated herein by reference.)</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;composition&#x201d; is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from a combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. The phrase &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; means those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well-known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. <i>Pharmaceutical Sciences, </i>1977, 66: 1 et seq. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting a free base function with a suitable organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which can be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylammonium, dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium, triethylammonium, diethylammonium, and ethylammonium among others. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants which can be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the present invention can be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug form. Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The phrase &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; of the compound of the invention means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or lower animal may range from about 0.0001 to about 1000 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be specially formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, transdermally (e.g. using a patch), transmucosally, sublingually, pulmonary, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term &#x201c;parenterally,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a component of the present invention and a physiologically tolerable diluent. The present invention includes one or more compounds as described above formulated into compositions together with one or more non-toxic physiologically tolerable or acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that are collectively referred to herein as diluents, for parenteral injection, for intranasal delivery, for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for rectal or topical administration, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise physiologically acceptable, sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the like), vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, and suitable mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used separately or together.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., <i>Methods in Cell Biology</i>, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of treating a disease or condition in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of any of Formulas I or II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The preferred route of administering to the subject is via oral delivery.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In general, the invention is not limited to treatment of any specific disease or condition but encompasses the treatment of any disease or condition whose mechanism may be affected by the compounds of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some aspects, the methods and compositions of the invention may be used in combination with conventional first and second generation anti-psychotic agents.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, in one embodiment, the invention is directed to a combinational use of: 1) a compound of any of Formulas I-II and 2) pre-existing first generation anti-psychotic agents (including but not limited to chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, loxapine, molindone, perphenazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, haloperidol, fluphenazine, droperidol, zuclopenthixol and prochlorperazineperphenazine) and/or second generation anti-psychotic agents (including but not limited to amisulpride, aripiprazole, asenapine, blonanserin, clotiapine, clozapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, mosapramine, olanzapine, paliperidone, perospirone, quetiapine, remoxipride, risperidone, sertindole, sulpiride, ziprasidone, zotepine, bifeprunox (DU-127,090), pimavanserin (ACP-103), and vabicaserin (SCA-136)) for the treatment of a disease or condition of CNS, including but not limited to schizophrenia, drug craving, drug addiction, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, ALS, ischemic stroke, HIV dementia, and Huntington's disease.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of any of Formulas I or II or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.</p>
