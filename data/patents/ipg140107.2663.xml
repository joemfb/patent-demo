<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority to Korean patent application number 10-2009-0005418 filed on Jan. 22, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, is claimed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention generally relates to a method of forming patterns of a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a method of forming the patterns of a semiconductor device, which is capable of stabilizing a pattern formation process and securing process margin, although spacer patterning technology is used.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The patterns of a semiconductor device include cell patterns, which constitute the cell array of the semiconductor device, and test patterns formed under the same conditions (for example, material, thickness, width, and length) as the cell patterns to analyze the resistance of the cell patterns. The cell patterns are formed in a cell array region, and the test patterns are formed in a peripheral (peri) region that is narrower than the cell array region. The patterns of the semiconductor device become micro-sized with a high degree of integration of the semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Spacer patterning technology has been proposed as a method of forming the micro patterns of the semiconductor device. Spacer patterning technology includes a process of patterning an sacrificial pattern using a photoresist pattern as an etch barrier, a process of forming a spacer on the sidewalls of the sacrificial pattern, a process of removing the sacrificial pattern, a process of patterning a hard mask pattern using the spacer as an etch barrier, and a process of patterning the patterns of a semiconductor device using the hard mask pattern as an etch barrier. As described above, in spacer patterning technology, the shapes of the hard mask pattern and the cell patterns are defined by the spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above-described spacer is configured to surround the sidewalls of the sacrificial pattern having a specific width. More specifically, the spacer includes line spacers spaced apart from each other at a specific interval and interconnection spacers connecting both ends of the line spacers and formed at the sidewalls of both ends of the sacrificial pattern. Here, the interconnection spacers are removed before the hard mask pattern is formed. Accordingly, the shapes of the test patterns and the cell patterns are defined by the line spacers. On the other hand, pad units are formed at both ends of the test patterns and each has a width wider than that of the test patterns and functions as resistance measurement terminals. To this end, after the interconnection spacers are removed, a pad sacrificial pattern, having a width wider than the width of each of the line spacers, must be formed at both ends of the line spacer. In this case, since the interval between the line spacers formed in the peri region is narrow as in the cell array region, the pad sacrificial pattern does not overlap both ends of one line spacer, but connects two line spacers and overlaps therewith. The hard mask pattern is patterned using the pad sacrificial pattern and the line spacers having this form. The cell patterns, the test patterns, and the pad units are patterned using the hard mask pattern. Consequently, the test patterns have the same width and interval as the cell patterns. The pad units are configured to connect two test patterns and are formed at both ends of the test patterns. The resistance value of the cell pattern is analyzed through the test patterns and the pad units. To analyze the resistance value of the cell patterns, the resistance value of one of the test patterns formed under the same condition as the cell patterns must be known. However, since the pad units are formed to connect the two test patterns, the resistance value measured through the pad units to analyze the resistance value of the cell patterns must be divided in half.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, to accurately analyze the resistance of the cell patterns, the test patterns must be formed under the same conditions as the cell patterns. If it is sought to form the test patterns under the same conditions as the cell patterns, the sizes of the photoresist patterns, functioning as the etch barriers, must be identical in the cell array region and the peri region when the sacrificial patterns are formed. In the case where the photoresist patterns having the same size are formed in the peri region and the cell array region, the densities of the photoresist patterns in the peri region and the cell array region must be uniform because of Depth of Focus (DOF) margin. Accordingly, dummy photoresist patterns are formed in the peri region. Through the dummy photoresist patterns, dummy sacrificial patterns are formed when the sacrificial patterns are formed, dummy spacers are formed when the spacers are formed, the dummy hard mask pattern is formed when the hard mask pattern is formed, and dummy patterns are formed when the cell patterns and the test patterns are formed. The dummy patterns are formed in a process of improving the stability of a process, but are not used to analyze the resistance of the cell patterns. Accordingly, the dummy patterns must be electrically isolated from the test patterns. However, if the width of the pad units formed at both ends of the test pattern is wider than the width of the test pattern, there is a danger that the dummy patterns might be connected to the pad units. To prevent this problem, the length of the dummy patterns is shorter than that of the test pattern. If it is sought to form the length of the dummy pattern shorter than that of the test pattern as described above, the length of the dummy sacrificial patterns must be shorter than that of other sacrificial patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing spacers formed by known methods.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, spacers include a first spacer <b>1</b> formed to define a test pattern, dummy spacers <b>3</b> formed for the stability of a process, and a second spacer <b>5</b> formed to define cell patterns. As described above, the first spacer <b>1</b> has the same shape as the second spacer <b>5</b>, and the dummy spacers <b>3</b> are shorter than the first spacer <b>1</b>. The spacers <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>5</b> are divided into respective line spacers <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>a </i>and respective interconnection spacers <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. Here, since regions where the test pattern, the dummy patterns, and the cell patterns will be formed are defined by the respective line spacers <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>a</i>, the interconnection spacers <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b </i>must be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The interconnection spacers <b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are removed by an etch process using photoresist patterns PR as etch barriers. Regions where the photoresist patterns PR will be formed are defined depending on exposure mask alignment. In this case, since the dummy spacers <b>3</b> are shorter than the first spacer <b>1</b>, the interconnection spacers <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the dummy spacers <b>3</b> and the interconnection spacer <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the first spacer <b>1</b> are not arranged on the same line. It makes it difficult to secure the alignment margin of an exposure mask in the test pattern region. Accordingly, the line spacer <b>1</b><i>a </i>of the first spacer <b>1</b> adjacent to the interconnection spacers <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the dummy spacers <b>3</b> is likely to be exposed as in a portion indicated by &#x201c;X.&#x201d; Consequently, failure is generated in the formation of the test pattern. Accordingly, there is a need for a method of stabilizing a pattern formation process and securing process margin, although spacer patterning technology is used.</p>

The first sacrificial pattern includes a first pattern having a first width in the first region and second patterns each having a second width. Each of the cell sacrificial patterns has a third width narrower than the first width in the second region. The second patterns protrude from one end of the first pattern and are formed in paralle. The method further includes forming the first spacer surrounding sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern and a second spacer surrounding sidewalls of the cell sacrificial patternpatterns, removing the first sacrificial pattern and the cell sacrificial patternpatterns, and removing the first spacer formed on a side of the first pattern and the second spacer formed on sidewalls of both ends of the cell sacrificial patternpatterns.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a fourth embodiment, during the formation of the first sacrificial pattern and the cell sacrificial patterns, a third sacrificial pattern, having third and fourth patterns, is formed in the first region. The third pattern faces the first pattern in a state where the second patterns intervene between the third pattern and the first pattern. The fourth patterns are configured to protrude from one end of the third pattern and are placed between the second patterns.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the disclosed method is susceptible of embodiments in various forms, specific embodiments are illustrated in the drawings (and will hereafter be described) with the understanding that the disclosure is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment described and illustrated herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Disclosed herein are methods described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The drawing figures are provided to allow those having ordinary skill in the art to understand the scope of one or more embodiments of the disclosure. To clarify multiple layers and regions, the thickness of the layers is enlarged in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2J</figref> are plan views showing a method of forming patterns of a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3J</figref> are section views of the semiconductor device taken along line I-I&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2J</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3A</figref>, a target etch layer <b>105</b>, a hard mask layer <b>107</b>, a first auxiliary layer, <b>129</b>, and first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b> for forming the patterns of the semiconductor device are formed over a semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> including a first region A and a second region B (semiconductor substrate in second region B is not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first region A is a peri region where a test pattern and test pad units will be formed. The second region B is a cell array region where cell array patterns constituting the cell array of the semiconductor device will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The target etch layer <b>105</b> is patterned to form the target pattern, which constitutes the test pattern, the test pad units, and the cell array pattern. For example, when the cell array patterns are gate patterns, the target etch layer <b>105</b> is formed from a conduction layer for gate patterns. Furthermore, when the target etch layer <b>105</b> is a conduction layer for gate patterns, the target etch layer <b>105</b> may be formed over a gate insulation layer <b>103</b> formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first sacrificial layer <b>129</b> is formed by stacking materials having different etch properties from the etch property of the hard mask layer <b>107</b> and etch steps, performed during a spacer patterning process, taken into consideration so that the materials come into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In more detail, the hard mask layer <b>107</b> may be made of Tetra Ethyl Ortho Silicate (TEOS). The first sacrificial layer <b>129</b> may have a structure in which a first amorphous carbon layer <b>109</b>, a first SiON layer <b>111</b>, a polysilicon layer <b>113</b>, a second amorphous carbon layer <b>115</b>, and a second SiON layer <b>117</b> are sequentially stacked. Here, before the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b> are formed, a Bottom Anti-Reflect Coating (BARC) layer <b>119</b> may be further formed over the first auxiliary layer <b>129</b>. The BARC layer <b>119</b> functions to prevent the scattering of a light source when the exposure process of forming the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A becomes a factor to determine the alignment margin of an exposure mask for cutting in a subsequent process. Accordingly, to secure the alignment margin of the exposure mask for cutting in the first region A, the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b> have different widths in the first region A and the second region B. In more detail, the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A may be wider than the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the second region B. In this case, although the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A may vary depending on the design rule of a semiconductor device, the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A may be six times greater than the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the second region B to secure Depth Of Focus (DOF) margin. Furthermore, the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A may be eight times smaller than the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the second region B so that the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> can be formed within the first region A.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A is six times greater than the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the second region B as described above, DOF margin can be secured. Accordingly, a dummy photoresist pattern can be removed in the first region A because it is not necessary to make the density of the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b> identical in the first region A and the second region B.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 3B</figref>, the BARC layer <b>119</b>, the second SiON layer <b>117</b>, and the second amorphous carbon layer <b>115</b> are sequentially etched using the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3A</figref>, as etch barriers, thereby forming a first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; over the polysilicon layer <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The width of the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and each of the cell sacrificial patternpatterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; are defined by the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b>. The width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the first region A is wider than the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b> formed in the second region B. Accordingly, the first width W<b>1</b> of the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>is wider than the second width W<b>2</b> of the cell sacrificial patternpatterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;. Here, the first width W<b>1</b> may be six to eight times the second width W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the etch process of forming the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; is performed, the polysilicon layer <b>113</b> is made of material having an etch rate which is slower than that of the second amorphous carbon layer <b>115</b>, thus functioning as an etch-stop layer. Furthermore, when the etch process of forming the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; is performed, the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b>, the BARC layer <b>119</b>, the second SiON layer <b>117</b>, etc. may be removed. Alternatively, after the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; are formed, the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b>, the BARC layer <b>119</b>, and the second SiON layer <b>117</b>, which are left over, may be removed using an additional process.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 3C</figref>, a first spacer configured to surround the sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and a second spacer configured to surround the sidewalls of the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first spacer includes first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b> and first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>. The first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b> are spaced apart from each other at the first width W<b>1</b>. The first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b> are configured to connect both ends of the first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b> and are formed on both sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The second spacer includes second line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b>&#x2032; and second interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>&#x2032;. The second line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b>&#x2032; are spaced apart from each other at the second width W<b>2</b>. The second interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>&#x2032; are configured to connect both ends of the second line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b>&#x2032; and are formed on both sidewalls of each of the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a&#x2032;. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first and second spacers are formed by etching a spacer layer formed on the surface of the polysilicon layer <b>113</b>, including the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, through blank-etching or partial etching so that the spacer layer remains on the sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;. In this case, a part of the polysilicon layer <b>113</b> exposed at the portion from which the spacer layer has been removed may be etched.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 3D</figref>, the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 3C</figref> are removed, so the polysilicon layer <b>113</b> under the first sacrificial pattern <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the cell sacrificial patterns <b>115</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 3E</figref>, second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b> are formed to remove the first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>, connected to one end of the first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>, and the second interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b> are formed so that the first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>, connected to one end of the first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>, and the second interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>&#x2032; are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A method of forming the second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b> is described in more detail below. First, a photoresist layer is coated over the polysilicon layer <b>113</b> including the first and second spacers. An exposure mask <b>195</b> for cutting, including a light-blocking pattern <b>193</b>, is formed over the photoresist layer. The light-blocking pattern <b>193</b> of the exposure mask <b>195</b> for cutting is transferred to the photoresist layer by performing an exposure process. After the exposure process, the photoresist layer is developed, so the second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b> are formed over the polysilicon layer <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The light-blocking pattern <b>193</b> of the exposure mask <b>195</b> for cutting is made of light-blocking material, such as chrome (Cr), thus being capable of blocking light during an exposure process. Since the formation regions of the second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b> are defined depending on the alignment of the light-blocking pattern <b>193</b>, the alignment margin of the light-blocking pattern <b>193</b> in the first region A and the second region B must be sufficient. In general, the interval between the second interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>&#x2032; may provide sufficient process margin. On the other hand, in the first region A, the interval between the first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b> is defined by the first width, and the interval between the second line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b>&#x2032; is defined by the second width. The first width is wider than the second width. Accordingly, the alignment margin of the light-blocking pattern <b>193</b>, configured to shield the first line spacer <b>121</b>L<b>2</b> connected to one end of the first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>, and expose the first line spacer <b>121</b>L<b>1</b> connected to the other ends of the first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b> in the first region A, is sufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2F and 3F</figref>, the first line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>, connected to one end of the first interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b> and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>, and the second interconnection spacers <b>121</b>S<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>S<b>2</b>&#x2032; are removed using the second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 3E</figref>, as etch barriers. The second photoresist patterns PR<b>2</b> are then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G and 3G</figref>, a Spin On Carbon (SOC) layer <b>123</b>, a Multi-Functional Hard Mask (MFHM) layer <b>125</b>, and third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b> are stacked over the polysilicon layer <b>113</b> so that the first spacer and the second spacer that are left over are covered.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The SOC layer <b>123</b> and the MFHM layer <b>125</b> are made of materials having a different etch property. Before the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b> are formed, an interlayer layer <b>127</b>, such as a BARC layer, may be further formed over the MFHM layer <b>125</b>. The interlayer layer <b>127</b> functions to prevent the scattering of a light source when an exposure process of forming the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each of the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b> has a pattern defining test pad units. The test pad units function as terminals for measuring the resistance of the test pattern. The test pad units each have a width wider than that of the test pattern and are formed at both ends of the test pattern. In the case where spacer patterning technology is used, the widths of the first line spacer <b>121</b>L<b>2</b> and the second line spacers <b>121</b>L<b>1</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b>L<b>2</b>&#x2032;, defining the regions where the test pattern and the cell patterns will be respectively formed, become uniform. Accordingly, to form the test pad units each having a width wider than that of the test pattern, a process of forming the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b> has to be additionally performed. The third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b> are formed at both ends of the remaining first spacer so that they overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2H and 3H</figref>, the interlayer layer <b>127</b>, the MFHM layer <b>125</b>, the SOC layer <b>123</b>, and the polysilicon layer <b>113</b> are sequentially etched using the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G and 3G</figref>, as etch barriers. Accordingly, second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>and polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each of the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>has a width wider than that of the remaining first spacer and overlaps both ends of the first spacer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>are formed under the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>and the remaining first and second spacers.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When an etch process of forming the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>and the polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>is performed, the first SiON layer <b>111</b>, made of material slowly etched as compared to the polysilicon layer <b>113</b>, functions as an etch stop layer. Furthermore, when the etch process of forming the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>and the polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>is performed, the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b>, the interlayer layer <b>127</b>, and the MFHM layer <b>125</b> may be removed. Alternatively, after the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>and the polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>are formed, the third photoresist patterns PR<b>3</b>, the interlayer layer <b>127</b>, and the MFHM layer <b>125</b> that are left over may be removed using an additional process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I and 3I</figref>, the first SiON layer <b>111</b>, the first amorphous carbon layer <b>109</b>, and the hard mask layer <b>107</b> are sequentially etched using the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2H and 3H</figref>, the remaining first and second spacers, and the polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>as etch barriers. While the first SiON layer <b>111</b> and the first amorphous carbon layer <b>109</b> are etched, the first and second spacers and the second sacrificial patterns <b>123</b><i>a </i>may be removed. Furthermore, while the hard mask layer <b>107</b> is etched, the polysilicon patterns <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the first SiON layer <b>111</b> may be removed. Consequently, stack patterns in which of which a hard mask pattern <b>107</b><i>a </i>and a first amorphous carbon pattern <b>109</b><i>a </i>are stacked are formed over the target etch layer <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2J and 3J</figref>, the target etch layer <b>105</b> is etched using the first amorphous carbon pattern <b>109</b><i>a </i>and the hard mask pattern <b>107</b><i>a</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I and 3I</figref>, as etch barriers, thereby forming cell patterns <b>105</b>S, a test pattern <b>105</b>T, and test pad units <b>105</b>P over the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>. When the etch process of forming the cell patterns <b>105</b>S, the test pattern <b>105</b>T, and the test pad units <b>105</b>P is performed, the first amorphous carbon pattern <b>109</b><i>a </i>and the hard mask pattern <b>107</b><i>a </i>may be removed. Alternatively, after the cell patterns <b>105</b>S, the test pattern <b>105</b>T, and the test pad units <b>105</b>P are formed, the first amorphous carbon pattern <b>109</b><i>a </i>and the hard mask pattern <b>107</b><i>a </i>may be removed using an additional process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The test pattern <b>105</b>T according to the first embodiment is formed in a single-line form in the first region A through a series of the processes. Accordingly, the resistance of the cell patterns <b>105</b>S having a single-line form can be directly analyzed by applying an electrical signal to the test pad units <b>105</b>P and then measuring the resistance of the test pattern <b>105</b>T having a single-line form. That is, the resistance of the cell patterns can be analyzed without additional conversion. This is because the alignment margin of the exposure mask <b>195</b> for cutting, described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E and 3E</figref>, can be secured by forming the width of the first photoresist pattern PR<b>1</b>, formed in the first region A, to be wider than the width of each of the first photoresist patterns PR<b>1</b>, formed in the second region B, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3A</figref>. Here, the target pattern formed in the first region is a resistance test pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">An interval between the first and second test patterns <b>205</b>T and <b>305</b>T is same as an interval of cell patterns.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The interval between the spacer to be etched and the spacer not to be etched in the region where the test pattern is formed is wide, thereby being capable of securing the alignment margin of an exposure mask for cutting.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The shape or width of the sacrificial pattern, defining the region where the spacer is formed, differs in the region where the cell patterns are formed and the region where the test pattern is formed. Accordingly, test patterns having various forms can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Test patterns having various forms can be formed by changing the shape or width of the photoresist pattern. Accordingly, the manufacturing cost of semiconductor devices can be reduced because an addition process of diversifying the shape of the test pattern is not required.</p>
