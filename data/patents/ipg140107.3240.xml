<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In semiconductor devices, including high voltage devices, it is desirable to obtain a low on-resistance that is primarily determined by the drift region resistance. Typically, the drift region resistance of a transistor is lowered by increasing the doping level of the drift region. However, increasing the doping level of the drift region has the undesirable effect of reducing the breakdown voltage. The doping level of the drift region is therefore optimized to obtain the maximum on-resistance while still maintaining a sufficiently high breakdown voltage. As the requirements for breakdown voltages increase, the use of drift region doping concentrations to adjust on-resistance and breakdown voltages becomes more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to breakdown voltages being affected by the doping concentration of the drift region, breakdown voltages are also affected by the electric field distribution inside and outside the device. As a result, there have been efforts in the art to control the electric field distribution by field-shaping methods and therefore control the on-resistance and breakdown voltage of transistor devices. For example, lateral floating coupled capacitor (FCC) structures have been used to control the electric fields in the drift region of a transistor and thereby improve on-resistance. These FCC structures include insulated trenches formed in the drift region of a transistor, which contain isolated electrodes and are parallel to the direction of current flow. These FCC structures improve transistor properties. For example, the drift region field-shaping provided by the FCC regions can desirably provide high breakdown voltage and low on-resistance simultaneously. However, there are problems associated with fabricating and using floating coupled capacitors to control the breakdown voltage and on-resistance including relying on fabrication methods that use highly doped polysilicon to fill trenches, which requires additional polysilicon deposition steps that make the process more expensive and reduces yields. Further, FCC structures made by filling trenches with highly doped polysilicon can result in FCC structures that have voids. These voids can be detrimental to an FCC device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is need for FCC structures that are fabricated more efficiently and which have few or substantially no voids in the FCC.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention allow for easier and more reliable fabrication methods for making stable lateral floating coupled capacitors (LFCC) devices, which can be integrated with existing fabrication processes. Embodiments of the present invention also provide LFCC field effect transistors, which reduce on-resistance while maintaining higher breakdown voltages. Embodiments of the present invention further provide methods of fabricating LFCC field effect transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment, a method includes forming a first trench in a substrate that extends vertically from an upper surface to a depth within the substrate, the first trench having first sidewalls, a first bottom, and a pattern formed on the first sidewalls near the first bottom of the trench, and forming an oxide layer on the first sidewalls and first bottom of the first trench that leaves a second trench located within the first trench and is separated from the first trench by the oxide layer. The second trench has second sidewalls that are substantially vertical without showing the pattern and a second bottom that is substantially flat. The pattern compensates for the difference in oxidation rates between the bottom of the first trench and the first sidewalls.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another embodiment, the method further includes etching the substrate for a first time period with a first gas mixture, which has a first ratio of reactant gas to passivant gas, to form the first sidewalls. The first ratio of reactant gas to passivant gas is then changed to a second ratio of reactant gas to passivant gas. The substrate is then etched for a second time period with a second gas mixture, which has a second ratio of reactant gas to passivant gas, to form the pattern. The reactant gas can be SF6 and the passivant gas can be O2, the second ratio of reactant gas to passivant gas can be (1.1:1), and the second time period can range between 15 and 25 seconds. In one embodiment the second time period is 20 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, the method further includes decreasing the ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas so that the second ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas is less than the first ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, a method of fabricating a semiconductor device includes forming a first trench in a silicon substrate that extends vertically from an upper surface to a depth within the substrate. The first trench, which has first sidewalls, a first bottom, and a pattern formed on the first sidewalls near the first bottom of the trench, is formed by first etching the silicon substrate for a first time period with a first gas mixture to form the first sidewalls. The first gas mixture has a first ratio of reactant gas to passivant gas, a first flow, and first pressure. After the first time period has lapsed, a second gas mixtures having a second ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas that is less than the first ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas, a second flow that is less than the first flow, and a second pressure that is higher than the first pressure is formed. The silicon substrate is then etched for a second time period with the second gas mixture to form the pattern. An oxide layer is then formed on the first sidewalls, first bottom and pattern, which can be notched shape, of the first trench that leaves a second trench located within the first trench and separated from the first trench by the oxide layer. The second trench has second sidewalls that are substantially vertical without showing the pattern and a second bottom that is substantially flat. The second trench is then filled with a conductor to form a lateral floating capacitively coupled device. The pattern, which can be a notch shape, compensates for the difference in oxidation rates between the bottom of the first trench and the first sidewalls. The substrate can be silicon.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments allow for easier and more reliable fabrication methods for making stable lateral floating coupled capacitors (LFCC) devices, which can be integrated with existing fabrication processes. Embodiments also provide field effect transistors with lateral floating control capacitors that reduce on-resistance while maintaining higher breakdown voltages. Embodiments further provide methods of fabricating these field effect transistors with lateral floating control capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments, the drift region of a field effect transistor includes an active drift region that conducts current between the source region and the drain region when voltage is applied to the gate region and inactive floating charge control (FCC) regions that field-shape the active drift region to improve breakdown voltage. The FCC structures are formed in trench regions disposed in the drift regions between the source regions and the drain region. Each trench, which contains an FCC and extends vertically into a silicon substrate, has first sidewalls, a first bottom, and a pattern formed on the first sidewalls near the first bottom of the trench. An oxide layer disposed on the first sidewalls and first bottom of the first trench that leaves a second trench located within the first trench and is separated from the first trench by the oxide layer. Because of the pattern in the first trench, which can be a notch pattern, the second trench is formed with nominally a flat bottom and nearly vertical sides without re-entrant side-walls. The pattern compensates for the difference in oxidation rates between the bottom of the first trench and the first sidewalls. A conductive material is disposed within the second trench to form the floating coupled capacitor. The trenches, which contain the FCC regions, can be made so that the trenches in the termination region are either parallel or perpendicular to the trenches in the action region. Details of these embodiments are explained below with reference to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, unlike the prior art, which requires using highly doped polysilicon to fill the trenches and an additional polysilicon deposition, embodiments allow for depositing the gate poly prior to doping. Additionally, using the pattern structure eliminates potential voids, which are detrimental to the FCC device. Embodiments also enable the integration of a trench capacitor of LFCC device into a field oxide layer isolated IC flow without adding additional thermal steps promoting the diffusion of various silicon dopants from a specialized isolation oxide layer on the trench sidewalls.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an illustration of a trench <b>105</b> used in making semiconductor transistors. The trench <b>105</b> is a trench having substantially vertical sidewalls <b>110</b> and a smooth rounded bottom <b>115</b> that has a flat portion in the center. When this type of trench <b>105</b> is etched into a silicon substrate the vertical sidewalls <b>110</b> surfaces and the smooth rounded bottom <b>115</b> surfaces have different crystallographic planes. Since oxidation rates of silicon are dependent on the crystallographic plane on which the oxidation is done, having different planes on the sidewalls <b>110</b> and the bottom <b>115</b> of the trench leads to different oxidation rates on the sidewalls <b>110</b> and the bottom <b>115</b> of the trench. The different oxidation rates lead to uneven oxidation around the bottom of the trench, as illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is an Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image <b>150</b> of the trench after oxidation showing the spear-like void <b>140</b> near the bottom of the trench. As mentioned, this spear like void causes problems in later deposition processes. The spear-like void makes it difficult to deposit conductive material into the second trench created by the oxidation <b>135</b> and can results in voids in the conductive material that is later deposited. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows that the trench with sidewalls <b>110</b> and bottom <b>115</b> is deposited in a silicon substrate <b>145</b>. The spear-like void occurs when trenches that are formed in silicon are oxidized. Etching a trench in silicon forms a trench having (111) silicon crystallographic plane along the bottom <b>115</b> surface of the first trench and a (110) silicon crystallographic plane along the sidewalls <b>110</b> surfaces of the trench.

As can be seen from image <b>160</b>, the conductive material did not deposit very well into the spear-like region located at the bottom portion of the second trench created by the oxidation process. This void can create defects in the transistor having the LFCC structure which can be detrimental to its performance.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is an illustration of a trench <b>205</b> used to fabricate LFCC semiconductor transistor structures, in accordance with an embodiment. Trench <b>205</b> has substantially vertical sidewalls <b>210</b> and a pattern <b>215</b> that can resemble a notch with a flat portion in the center. The pattern <b>215</b> is used to compensate for non-uniform oxidation on the trench sidewalls and trench bottom. As described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, etching a trench in a silicon substrate forms sidewalls and a bottom with different crystallographic orientations which causes spear-like oxidation pattern inside the trench when the trench undergoes an oxidation process. When trench <b>205</b> is etched into a silicon substrate, the vertical sidewalls <b>210</b> surfaces and the pattern <b>215</b> surface have different crystallographic planes. The surface of the bottom portion of pattern <b>215</b> which looks substantially flat has a (111) silicon crystallographic plane. The surface of the sidewalls <b>210</b> of trench <b>205</b> have (110) silicon crystallographic plane. The surface of the notched portion of the pattern <b>215</b> has crystallographic planes that compensate for the difference in oxidation rates between (111) silicon crystallographic plane and (110) silicon crystallographic plane. Although the pattern <b>215</b> is illustrated as a notch, other patterns can also be used to compensate for the difference in oxidation rates between different crystallographic planes.</p>

As compared with the oxidation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the oxidation <b>235</b> is substantially more uniform than the oxidation <b>135</b> and lacks the spear-like void <b>140</b> near the bottom of the trench. The oxidation <b>235</b> creates a second trench <b>240</b> within the first trench, which is later filled with conductive material used to form the FCC regions. Since this process creates a second trench <b>240</b>, which lacks a spear-like void, the conductive material is more easily and more reliably deposited in the second trench. The second trench shape allows the conductive material to be uniformly deposited into the trench without creating voids, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) image <b>265</b> of a floating capacitor made using the trench illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> showing a floating capacitor without voids. Image <b>265</b> shows the second trench created by the oxidation process without any kind of void. The second trench is filled with conductive material to form the LFCC structure. As can be seen from image <b>265</b>, the conductive material has been substantially uniformly deposited into the second trench created by the oxidation process. Shaping the termination of a silicon trench to have a notched profile with an etch process such as Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), a combination of etch stop layers and etching steps, or varied clamp pressures and/or varied substrate temperatures can be used to produce the desired shape in the silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The image <b>265</b> illustrates a trench <b>230</b> with a floating capacitor which is part of an LFCC semiconductor device. In one embodiment, the LFCC semiconductor device includes a source region, a drain region, a gate region, a drift region disposed between the source region and the drain region which provides a conduction path between the source and the drain, and a floating coupled capacitors (FCC) formed in a trench region and disposed in the drift region between the source regions and the drain region. Each trench further includes a first trench that extends vertically from an upper surface to a depth within a silicon substrate. The first trench has first sidewalls, a first bottom, and a pattern formed on the first sidewalls near the first bottom of the trench. An oxide layer is disposed on the first sidewalls and first bottom of the first trench that leaves a second trench located within the first trench and is separated from the first trench by the oxide layer. The second trench has second sidewalls that are substantially vertical without showing the pattern and a second bottom that is substantially flat. A conductive material is disposed within the second trench to form the floating coupled capacitor. Since silicon oxidation rates change with exposed silicon lattice face, by adding a pattern with stubs to the bottom of the trench the spear-head is eliminated. The pattern, which can be notched shape, compensates for the difference in oxidation rates between the bottom of the first trench and the first sidewalls. The first trench can also form a (111) silicon crystallographic plane along the first bottom surface of the first trench, a (110) silicon crystallographic plane along the first side wall surfaces of the first trench, and silicon crystallographic planes along the pattern surface that compensate for the difference in oxidation rates between the (111) silicon crystallographic planes and the (110) silicon crystallographic planes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Using this pattern eliminates the spear-head profile that was described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> and therefore reduces voids in the floating capacitors. Further, using deep trench etchers employing TDM technology, the sidewall shapes can be altered by modulating the etchant to passivant step times and gas compositions, creating a pattern or notched bottom profile. By notching the bottom of the deep trenches in silicon, the slower oxidation rate due to the (111) crystallographic plane oxidizes the thicker edges while slower oxidizing crystallographic planes are recessed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method used to manufacture an LFCC structure using the trench illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment. The method starts in operation <b>305</b> by setting up an etch tool such as a LAM 9400 for etching trenches into substrates. Next in operation <b>310</b>, a silicon substrate is provided into the etching tool for etching a trench. In operation <b>315</b>, the first etch conditions for etching predominantly the trench sidewalls <b>210</b> are set. Setting the first etch conditions includes setting a first gas mixture ratio, a first pressure, a first gas flow and first bias power. The first gas mixture can include mixtures of SF<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and any neutral diluting material such as helium, argon, xenon or other noble gasses or inert gasses. SF<sub>6 </sub>is a reactant gas and O<sub>2 </sub>is a passivant gas. In one embodiment the first ratio of SF<sub>6 </sub>to O<sub>2 </sub>is 1.6:1, the first pressure is 55 milliTorr, the first total gas flow is 325 SCCM (standard cubic centimeters per minute), the first bias power is 15 Watts, and the first temperature is set at 7&#xb0; C. but can range from 2&#xb0; C. to 12&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once the first etch conditions are set, the etching process begin in operation <b>320</b>. The etching operation <b>320</b> can include etching the substrate using a combination of etch stop layers and etching steps. The etching operation can also use varied clamp pressures and/or varied substrate temperatures to produce the desired shape in the silicon. While the etching is being done in operation <b>320</b>, a decision is made in operation <b>325</b> whether it is time to change the etch conditions. The decision is made by either checking if a first time period has lapsed or by using detectors such as an end-point detector. If the decision in operation <b>325</b> is that it is not time to change the etch conditions, then etching continues in operation <b>320</b>. If the decision in operation <b>325</b> is that it is time to change etch conditions (e.g. a first time period has lapsed) to make the pattern <b>215</b> at the bottom of the trench, then in operation <b>330</b> a second set of etch conditions is set. Setting the second etch conditions can include setting any one or combinations of gas mixture, gas pressure, gas flow, temperature, and bias power. Therefore, operation <b>330</b> sets a second gas mixture ratio, a second pressure, a second gas flow, a second temperature, and/or second bias power. The second gas mixture can include mixtures of SF<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and any neutral diluting material such as helium, argon, xenon or other noble gasses or inert gasses. In one embodiment, the second ratio of SF<sub>6 </sub>to O<sub>2 </sub>is 1.1:1, the second pressure is 65 milliTorr, the second gas flow is 313 SCCM, the second bias power is 15 Watts, and the second temperature is set at 7&#xb0; C. but can range from 2&#xb0; C. to 12&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the second ratio of SF<sub>6 </sub>to O<sub>2 </sub>is 1.1:1, the second pressure is 55 milliTorr, the second gas flow is 313 SCCM, the second bias power is 15 Watts, and the second temperature is set at 7&#xb0; C. but can range from 2&#xb0; C. to 12&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the second ratio of SF<sub>6 </sub>to O<sub>2 </sub>is 1.3 1, the second pressure is 55 milliTorr the second gas flow is 330 SCCM, the second bias power is 15 Watts, and the second temperature is set at 7&#xb0; C. but can range from 2&#xb0; C. to 12&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments the etching process is continuous so that the silicon substrate is being etched as the etch conditions are changed from the first set of etch conditions to the second set of etch conditions. For example, the second set of etch conditions can be set by reducing on the fly the amount of O<sub>2</sub>, reducing the pressure to increase ion bombardment at the trench bottom to make the critical dimension (CD) wider and then increasing O<sub>2 </sub>and raising pressure to increase polymer formation and narrowing the trench bottom, which forms small notches. In one embodiment, setting the second set of etch conditions can include decreasing the ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas so that the second ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas is less than the first ratio of reactive gas to passivant gas. In another embodiment, setting the second set of etch conditions can include changing the flow of the gas mixture so that the flow of the second gas mixture is different than the flow of the first gas mixture. In another embodiment, setting the second set of etch conditions can include decreasing the flow of the gas mixture so that the flow of the second gas mixture is less than the flow of the first gas mixture. In another embodiment, setting the second set of etch conditions can include changing the pressure of the gas mixture so that the pressure of the second gas mixture is different than the pressure of the first gas mixture. In another embodiment, setting the second set of etch conditions can include increasing the pressure of the gas mixture so that the pressure of the second gas mixture is higher than the pressure of the first gas mixture. In another embodiment, forming the first trench with the pattern further includes etching the substrate with a process that modulates an etchant process time to passivant process time and/or modulates an etchant gas composition to passivant gas composition. In another embodiment, the flow of neutral gas is changed. The flow of neutral gas, which can be an inert gas such as argon, helium, xenon, etc, can be changed either by itself or in combination with changes made to the gas mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments, which are not continuous, silicon is etched, using TDM, etching with varied pressure/etch/passivation step times to create a pattern similar to the one shown as a notch in pattern <b>215</b>. The pattern or notch can be made by having longer etching steps and shorter passivant steps to increase the CDs at the trench bottom over a short depth in TDM processing.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As the first etch conditions are changed to the second etch conditions, the etching process continues in operation <b>335</b> to form the etch pattern <b>215</b> at the bottom of the trench. The etching process in operation <b>335</b> is set to run for a second time period which can range between 15 seconds and 25 seconds and is about 20 seconds in one embodiment. While the etching continues in operation <b>335</b>, another decision is made in operation <b>340</b> whether the trench with pattern <b>215</b> is completed and whether it is time stop the etching process. The decision is made by checking if the second time period has lapsed. If the decision in operation <b>340</b> is that it is not time to stop the etching process, then etching continues in operation <b>335</b>. If the decision in operation <b>340</b> is that it is time to stop the etching process (e.g. the second time period has lapsed), then in operation <b>345</b> the etching process stops. Next in operation <b>350</b>, an oxide layer is formed on the first sidewalls <b>210</b> and pattern <b>215</b> of the first trench that leaves a second trench <b>240</b> located within the first trench and is separated from the first trench by the oxide layer <b>235</b>. The second trench <b>240</b> has second sidewalls that are substantially vertical without showing the pattern <b>215</b> and a second bottom that is substantially flat. After the oxidation process, the internal profile of the second trench consists of a nominally flat bottom with nearly vertical sides without a re-entrant side-wall. The pattern compensates for the difference in oxidation rates between the bottom of the first trench and the first sidewalls.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next in operation <b>355</b> after oxidation, the second trench <b>240</b> is filled with a conductive material to form a trench capacitor or LFCC-type device. The filling can be performed without a seam using un-doped, or lightly doped, polysilicon. In some embodiments this filling process is done with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD) or other techniques. The process ends in operation <b>360</b> when the floating capacitor device is sent on for further processing.</p>

The active drift regions <b>420</b> and the P-resurf layers <b>440</b>A-<b>440</b>C create a pn junction. The active drift regions <b>420</b> have a structure that include alternating pn junctions which are in vertically stacked as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. The interrupted N+ buffer region <b>430</b> has segments aligning with the inactive vertical FCC regions <b>425</b>A-<b>425</b>D. The P-resurf regions <b>440</b>A-<b>440</b>C extend to the gate <b>410</b>. In one embodiment, the P-resurf regions <b>440</b>A-<b>440</b>C can be electrically connected to a ground through a connection to a P-body <b>440</b>, and then to the substrate in a low-side LDMOS. This connection establishes an electrode-substrate coupling in an FCC trench. The N+ buffer region <b>430</b> is made of conductive material that makes electrical contact between the active drift regions and a channel formed under the gate <b>410</b>. The source <b>405</b> is disposed in the body <b>440</b>, which is a conductor. When sufficient voltage is applied to the gate <b>410</b> a channel forms under the gate <b>410</b> and current flows from the source <b>405</b> through the channel to the N+ buffer region <b>430</b> to the active drift regions and to the drain <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The FET illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> can be formed by disposing one or more vertical pn junctions on portions of the drift regions that are between the inactive vertical FCC regions <b>425</b>A-<b>425</b>D. This vertically stacked alternating P-N layer structure can be epitaxially grown before the FCC trench is etched. The inactive vertical FCC regions (four shown) <b>425</b>A-<b>425</b>D can be formed according to the method described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This method includes etching a silicon substrate to form a trench with a pattern <b>215</b> at the bottom, oxidizing the trench to form an oxidation layer <b>235</b> and a second trench <b>240</b>, and then filling the second trench <b>240</b> with a conductive material. The same procedure can be used to form a number of isolated floating electrodes in the FCC trench after multi p-n epitaxial layers are deposited. The addition of pn junctions to the active drift region can increase the carrier concentration in the active drift region by about a factor of two, thereby substantially reducing the on-resistance of the device. In one example, if a box-like doping profile is used, then incorporation of P-resurf layers can increase n-drift concentration from 1&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 2&#xd7;10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>while maintaining breakdown voltage.</p>
