<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-70884 filed on Mar. 28, 2011 in Japan, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a magnetic storage element, a magnetic storage device, and a magnetic memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To realize a memory with a larger capacity, a memory of a spin shift register type that uses domain walls has been suggested. In conventional semiconductor memories, &#x201c;a storage element, a select element, and an information extracting line&#x201d; are normally formed in each memory cell. However, this memory of the spin shift register type is based on a concept that only storage elements are arranged at a high density by transferring stored information to the locations of a sensor and a wiring formed in predetermined positions, and such a memory has a possibility of a dramatic increase in memory capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, a stable shifting operation requires a current with a high current density for the domain walls to transit from a resting state to a moving state. The necessity of a high current and a large amount of power in a shifting operation to be performed frequently is an undesirable aspect in achieving high memory reliability and a smaller power consumption, and the critical current required in a domain-wall shifting operation needs to be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a shift register for memories, it is not preferable to provide a control electrode for each bit (or each digit), and a shifting operation needs to be performed on a desired number of digits by applying some effect to the entire bit string. In each shift register that has been suggested for memories, one could manage to shift information in several digits accurately and collectively, but it is not at all easy to shift information in all the digits of information in a magnetic thin wire to realize a large-capacity memory accurately and collectively, which is at least several hundred bits and sometimes can be more than several kilobits to achieve a larger capacity, using the current pulse flowing through the shift register. In a large-capacity memory having a large number of bits in one thin wire, the physical length of the shift register becomes greater, and the possibility of false operations due to rounding of the current pulse waveform caused by the capacity or inductance components might become higher.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A magnetic storage device according to an embodiment includes: a magnetic thin wire extending in a first direction and having a plurality of magnetic domains partitioned by domain walls; an electrode capable of applying a current flowing in the first direction and a current flowing in the opposite direction from the first direction, to the magnetic thin wire; and an assisting unit receiving an electrical input and assisting movement of the domain walls in an entire or part of the magnetic thin wire.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The following is a description of embodiments, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A magnetic storage element according to a first embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a magnetic storage element <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment. The magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of this embodiment includes a magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> formed on a substrate (not shown) either via a nonmagnetic layer (not shown) or not via a nonmagnetic layer, electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>that are connected to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> and apply currents to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and a wiring <b>210</b>. The magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> has a thin, linear shape extending in one direction. In this specification, the direction in which this thin wire extends is called the thin-wire directions (the first direction). A cross-sectional shape of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> taken along a plane perpendicular to the thin-wire directions is a rectangular, circular, or elliptical shape. The magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> includes magnetic domains <b>101</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>101</b><sub>n </sub>(n being an integer). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, n is 7. A magnetic domain is a region in which the magnetization direction is uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the boundary between each two adjacent magnetic domains, the magnetization direction continuously changes in the thin-wire directions. The magnetization change regions are called domain walls. A domain wall normally has a finite width w that is determined by the anisotropy energy or exchange stiffness of the magnetic material. When a write unit and a read unit are provided in the magnetic storage element, the magnetization directions of the respective regions each having a predetermined length in the thin-wire directions are associated with bit data &#x201c;0&#x201d; or &#x201c;1.&#x201d; Therefore, when data &#x201c;00011011&#x201d; is stored in the magnetic storage element, a domain wall exists on each boundary between the region corresponding to the third bit and the region corresponding to the fourth bit, between the region corresponding to the fifth bit and the region corresponding to the sixth bit, and between the region corresponding to the sixth bit and the region corresponding to the seventh bit. The amount of data stored in one magnetic storage element is a hundred bits to several thousands of bits. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the magnetization direction of each magnetic domain is perpendicular, but can be parallel. In this specification, a perpendicular magnetization direction is a magnetization direction that is perpendicular to the thin-wire directions. The materials that can be used for the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A current source <b>150</b> is connected to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> via the electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, and currents can be applied in both of the thin-wire directions of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. The wiring <b>210</b> is positioned in the vicinity of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and is electrically insulated from the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is positioned so that the thin-wire directions are perpendicular to the substrate surface (the upper face of the substrate, for example). However, as in a magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of a first modification illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> can be positioned so that the thin-wire directions are parallel to the substrate surface. Further, as in a second modification shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, multiple (two in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) wirings <b>211</b> and <b>212</b> can be provided for one magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of this embodiment is manufactured by a film forming technique and a fine processing technique. The manufacturing method will be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of this embodiment can move each domain wall in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> by a predetermined distance in the thin-wire directions, using the wiring <b>210</b> and the current source <b>150</b>. The procedures for this are described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">First, from time t<sub>2 </sub>to time t<sub>3 </sub>(&#x3e;t<sub>2</sub>), a procedure called an assisting procedure for applying a current to the wiring <b>210</b> is carried out. A current magnetic field having components perpendicular to the magnetization of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is generated around the wiring <b>210</b>. If there are multiple wirings <b>210</b>, the current is applied to at least one of the wirings <b>210</b>. A partial region (called an excitation region) in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is affected by the current magnetic field, and has fluctuations in its magnetization direction, and the width of each domain wall in the excitation region becomes greater. There is a dipole-dipole interaction and an exchange interaction between magnetizations in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and therefore, the fluctuations in the magnetization direction propagate through the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. As a result, the widths of the domain walls outside the excitation region in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> also become greater than those observed prior to the generation of the current magnetic field. The current applied to the wiring <b>210</b> can be a pulse current or an alternating current. In the case of an alternating current, the current preferably has a frequency close to the ferromagnetic resonance frequency of the magnetic material forming the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. This is because the sensitivity to a magnetic field becomes higher in the vicinity of a resonance frequency, and fluctuations can be caused in a magnetization direction by a low current.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At time t<sub>1</sub>, a current <b>155</b> is applied to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> with the use of the current source <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As is well known, when a current is applied to a magnetic material, the current is spin-polarized in the magnetization direction. At a domain wall, the magnetization direction spatially changes. Therefore, the spin-polarization direction of the current <b>155</b> also spatially changes, and in reaction to that, the magnetization is subjected to a torque from the current <b>155</b>. If the current value is equal to or larger than a threshold value, the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> move in the electron flowing direction or in the opposite direction <b>105</b> from the current <b>155</b>. When the current <b>155</b> is cut off, the domain walls stop moving. Accordingly, the movement distances of the domain walls can be controlled by adjusting the period of time during which the current <b>155</b> is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of this embodiment, a torque is supplied, with the domain wall widths being made greater. Therefore, the total amount of magnetization involving torque passing becomes larger. Accordingly, the domain wall movement efficiency becomes higher than that achieved when a magnetic field is not generated by a current applied to the wiring <b>210</b>. Thus, the domain walls can be moved by a lower current and/or in a shorter period of time, and the stability in the movement of the domain walls is dramatically improved, compared with the stabilities in conventional cases. That is, in this embodiment, the movement of the domain walls is assisted by application of a current to the wiring <b>210</b>, and the wiring <b>210</b> forms an assisting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The above procedures can be expressed in the timing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>). The time for the domain walls to start moving is the time when a current and a magnetic field are supplied at the same time. If t<b>2</b>&#x2266;t<b>1</b>, the time for the domain walls to start moving is t<b>1</b>. If t<b>1</b>&#x2266;t<b>2</b>, the time for the domain walls to start moving is t<b>2</b>. In particular, the time t<b>1</b> is preferably equal to or later than time t<b>2</b> (t<b>2</b>&#x2266;t<b>1</b>). When a current is applied to more than one wiring, the condition, t<b>2</b>&#x2266;t<b>1</b>, is preferably satisfied for each of the wirings to which the current is applied. In that case, the movement of the domain walls starts at time t<b>1</b> and ends at the time when the supply of the current stops, and the movement period of the domain walls is determined by the period of time during which the current is applied. Therefore, the domain walls are moved by a predetermined distance with excellent precision. The current can be applied as a pulse current formed by dividing timewise the current <b>155</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>). This application of current is effective in controlling the timing to stop the moving domain walls. Further, where the current magnetic field is an AC magnetic field, as described above, timing charts are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>4</b>(<i>d</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>) illustrates a case where the amplitude of the alternating current changes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>d</i>) illustrates a case where the amplitude of the alternating current is constant. The waveform of the magnetic field shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>) is the magnetic field accompanying spin waves generated in each magnetic storage element of the later described second through fourth embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The wiring <b>210</b> is preferably located in a position near the input portion for the current <b>155</b>. When multiple wirings <b>210</b> are provided in the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> and a current is applied only to one or some of the wirings, it is preferable to selectively apply the current to the wiring(s) <b>210</b> closest (closer) to the input portion for the current <b>155</b>. Here, the input portion for the current <b>155</b> in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is defined by the direction in which the current <b>155</b> is applied. The reason for that is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which illustrates a specific example. When the current <b>155</b> is applied in the direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the domain walls move in the opposite direction from the current <b>155</b>. When the current <b>155</b> is applied only to the wiring <b>211</b> located closer to the input portion for the current <b>155</b> between the wiring <b>211</b> and the wiring <b>212</b> for generating magnetic fields, the domain walls on the side toward which the domain walls are moving start moving in a shorter period of time. With this arrangement, each domain wall is prevented from catching up with and overtaking the other domain walls.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, reading and writing methods for the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the first embodiment and a first modification are described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram for illustrating writing and reading methods for the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this magnetic storage element <b>1</b>, the first electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>is provided at one terminal of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> or in the region to be the magnetic domain <b>101</b><sub>1</sub>, and a magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> is provided at the other terminal. The magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> is used for writing and reading, and the thin-wire direction thereof is perpendicular to the thin-wire direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. The second electrode <b>104</b><i>b </i>of the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> is provided at the other terminal of the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>. A current is applied between the electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, so that the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> move. A writing unit <b>110</b> and a reading unit <b>120</b> are provided on the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>. The writing unit <b>110</b> has an electrode <b>112</b><i>a </i>formed on a face thereof, with the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> being interposed between the face and the other parts of the writing unit <b>110</b>. The writing unit <b>110</b> has a nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b> formed on the opposite side of the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> from the electrode <b>112</b><i>a</i>. A magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b> having a fixed magnetization is formed on the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, and an electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>is formed on the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The reading unit <b>120</b> has an electrode <b>122</b><i>a </i>formed on a face thereof, with the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> being interposed between the face and the other parts of the reading unit <b>120</b>. The reading unit <b>120</b> has a nonmagnetic layer <b>124</b> formed on the opposite side of the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> from the electrode <b>122</b><i>a</i>. A magnetization fixed layer <b>126</b> having a fixed magnetization is formed on the nonmagnetic layer <b>124</b>, and an electrode <b>122</b><i>b </i>is formed on the magnetization fixed layer <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First, writing is described as follows. The current <b>155</b> is applied between the electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>from the current source <b>150</b>, and a current is also applied to the wiring <b>210</b>. By doing so, the domain walls are moved so that the region on which writing is to be performed in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> moves to a position between the electrode <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b> of the writing unit <b>110</b>. After that, a current is applied between the electrodes <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the writing unit <b>110</b>, to perform writing on the region on which writing is to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When writing is performed so as to obtain a magnetization in the same direction as the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>, a current is applied from the electrode <b>112</b><i>a </i>to the electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>via the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, and the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>. In this case, electrons flow in the opposite direction from the current, and therefore, electrons flow from the electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>to the electrode <b>112</b><i>a </i>via the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, and the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>. At this point, the electrons that have passed through the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b> are spin-polarized, and the spin-polarized electrons flow, through the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, into the region on which writing is to be performed in the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>. The spin-polarized electrons having spins in the same direction as the magnetization direction in the region on which writing is to be performed pass through the region on which writing is to be performed, but the spin-polarized electrons having spins in the opposite direction from the magnetization direction in the region on which writing is to be performed apply a spin torque to the magnetization in the region on which writing is to be performed, so that the magnetization direction in the region on which writing is to be performed becomes the same as the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>. Accordingly, the magnetization direction in the region on which writing is to be performed becomes the same as the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When writing is performed so as to obtain a magnetization in the opposite direction from the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>, a current is applied from the electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>to the electrode <b>112</b><i>a </i>via the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, and the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>. In this case, electrons flow in the opposite direction from the current, and therefore, electrons flow from the electrode <b>112</b><i>a </i>to the electrode <b>112</b><i>b </i>via the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, and the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>. At this point, the electrons that have passed through the region on which writing is to be performed in the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> are spin-polarized, and the spin-polarized electrons flow, through the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b>, into the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>. The electrons having spins in the same direction as the magnetization of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b> pass through the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>, but the electrons having spins in the opposite direction from the magnetization of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b> are reflected by the interface between the nonmagnetic layer <b>114</b> and the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>, and flow into the region on which writing is to be performed in the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>. The spin-polarized electrons having spins in the opposite direction from the magnetization of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b> apply a spin torque to the magnetization in the region on which writing is to be performed in the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b>, so that the magnetization direction in the region on which writing is to be performed becomes the opposite direction from the magnetization of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>. Accordingly, the magnetization in the region on which writing is to be performed is in the opposite direction from the magnetization of the magnetization fixed layer <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the reading method is described as follows. The current <b>155</b> is applied between the electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>from the current source <b>150</b>, and a current is also applied to the wiring <b>210</b>. By doing so, the domain walls are moved so that the region from which reading is performed in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is located between the electrode <b>122</b><i>a </i>and the nonmagnetic layer <b>124</b> of the reading unit <b>120</b>. After that, a constant current or a constant voltage is applied between the electrodes <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the reading unit <b>120</b>. At this point, the electrical resistance between the electrodes <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>varies with the angle between the magnetization direction in the region from which reading is to be performed and the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>126</b> (a magnetoresistive effect). Utilizing the magnetoresistive effect, information is read from the region from which reading is to be performed. Specifically, the resistance value has a low (high) value when the magnetization direction in the region from which reading is to be performed and the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>126</b> is parallel (antiparallel).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">By the writing method and the reading method for the first modification of the first embodiment, the electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, the writing unit <b>110</b>, and the reading unit <b>120</b> are provided on the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. That is, although the writing unit <b>110</b> and the reading unit <b>120</b> are provided on the magnetic thin wire <b>103</b> connected to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the first embodiment, the writing unit <b>110</b> and the reading unit <b>120</b> are provided on the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the first modification. The writing method and the reading method according to the first modification are implemented in the same manner as those according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the material of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Various kinds of magnetic materials can be used as the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. For example, a magnetic alloy containing at least one element selected from the group consisting of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), and chromium (Cr) can be used. Typical examples include permalloy (a FeNi alloy) and a CoFe alloy. In particular, a magnetic material having a large uniaxial anisotropy constant K<sub>u </sub>and a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be used. Where a material with a large anisotropy constant K<sub>u </sub>is used, the domain wall widths are small when a magnetic field or a current is not being applied. Therefore, if a material with a large anisotropy constant K<sub>u </sub>is used as the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in this embodiment, the effect to increase the domain wall widths can be easily achieved when a magnetic field is applied. Accordingly, the use of such a material is preferable. Examples of such materials include an alloy containing one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, and Cr, and one or more elements selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd, Ir, Ru, and Rh. The value of the uniaxial anisotropy constant can be adjusted by controlling the composition of the magnetic material forming the magnetic layer or the crystal regularity achieved by a heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is also possible to use a magnetic material having a crystalline structure such as a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure and having a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Such a magnetic material typically contains a metal having Co as a main component, but can be some other metal having an hcp structure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The magnetization direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> can be either perpendicular or parallel to the thin-wire direction, but is preferably perpendicular to the thin-wire direction to reduce the current value required for moving the domain walls, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is designed to have a thin-wire direction perpendicular to the substrate, the easy axis of the magnetic anisotropy is in the film plane, and therefore, the magnetization direction can be oriented in a direction perpendicular to the thin-wire direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Examples of materials each having a large magnetic anisotropy and the easy axis of the magnetic anisotropy in the film plane include Co, a CoPt alloy, and a CoCrPt alloy. CoPt and CoCrPt can be alloys. These materials are metal crystals having the c-axis of the hcp structure in the film plane. Further, an additional element can be added in any case of the above-mentioned materials.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">When the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is designed to have a thin-wire direction parallel to the substrate surface, the easy axis of the magnetic anisotropy is in a direction perpendicular to the film plane, and therefore, the magnetization direction can be oriented in a direction perpendicular to the thin-wire direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Examples of materials realizing this include a Co layer, a CoPt layer, a FePt layer, a film stack of Co/Ni, and a TbFe layer each having the c-axis of the hcp structure oriented in a direction perpendicular to the film plane. It should be noted that CoPt can be an alloy. In the case of a TbFe layer, if Tb is not less than 20 atomic % and not more than 40 atomic %, the TbFe layer has a perpendicular anisotropy. Further, in the case of any of the above-mentioned materials, an additional element can be added.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, a material that is an alloy of a rare-earth element and an iron group transition element and has a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be used as the material of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Specific examples of such materials include GdFe, GdCo, GdFeCo, TbFe, TbCo, TbFeCo, GdTbFe, GdTbCo, DyFe, DyCo, or DyFeCo.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> preferably has each side of a cross-section or a diameter that is not less than 2 nm and not more than 100 nm, so as not to generate a magnetization distribution in the cross-section perpendicular to the thin-wire direction. The longer the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the thin-wire direction is, the more magnetic domains can be included in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. However, when the entire length becomes extremely great, the electrical resistance of the entire magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> becomes higher. Therefore, the length of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the thin-wire direction is typically in the range of 100 nm to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Regions having a different cross-sectional area from the other portions, such as notches and concavities, can be formed in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> at regular intervals in the thin-wire direction. In this case, the pinning potential becomes higher for the domain walls than when no notches are formed, and it is easier for the domain walls to stop. However, the current required for a transition from a resting state to a moving state becomes higher. The magnetic storage element of this embodiment can increase the domain wall widths even in such a case, by virtue of the action of the assisting unit. Accordingly, the domain walls can be moved by a lower current, and this embodiment proves effective.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The magnetic properties can be adjusted by adding a nonmagnetic element, such as Ag, Cu, Au, Al, Mg, Si, Bi, Ta, B, C, O, N, Pd, Pt, Zr, Ir, W, Mo, Nb, or H, to the above described material used as the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Further, other various physical properties, such as the crystallinity, the mechanical properties, and the chemical properties, can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Simulation Results)</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A simulation was performed to compare the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of this embodiment with a magnetic storage element according to a comparative example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) through <b>7</b>(<i>c</i>) show the results of the simulation. In the magnetic storage element of the comparative example, the wiring <b>210</b> for applying a magnetic field to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is not provided. In the magnetic storage elements of this embodiment and the comparative example, the simulation was performed on the same magnetic materials of the same size under the same conditions, except for the magnetic field application. In this simulation, the magnetization arrangement in which a region having the opposite magnetization direction from those of the surrounding regions is formed in a magnetic material having a thin-wire shape like the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is set as the initial condition. Changes over time in the magnetic structures caused by applying a current and a magnetic field using a micro-magnetic simulation were observed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) show the simulation results showing the time course of the domain wall width and the time course of the magnetization distribution observed when a magnetic field was applied from time t<sub>2 </sub>to time t<sub>3</sub>, and a current is applied after time t<sub>1 </sub>according to the procedures described in this embodiment. The dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>) show the simulation results showing the time course of the domain wall width and the time course of the magnetization distribution observed when a magnetic field was not applied and only a current was applied after time t<sub>1 </sub>in the magnetic storage element of the comparative example. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7(</figref><i>a</i>), <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>7</b>(<i>c</i>), the domain walls start moving when the domain wall width starts increasing in both magnetic storage elements of this embodiment and the comparative example. Further, it can be seen that, in this embodiment, the domain wall width becomes greater while the magnetic field is being applied. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the period of time between time t<sub>1 </sub>at which the current application starts and the time at which the domain walls start moving is made much shorter than in the comparative example, and the domain walls can be moved faster than in the comparative example. Since the period of time required until the domain walls start moving can also be shortened by increasing the current, the current can be effectively reduced when the domain walls are moved by applying the current for a certain period of time.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A magnetic layer <b>14</b>, a nonmagnetic layer <b>16</b>, a magnetic layer <b>18</b>, and a protection film <b>20</b> are then formed in this order (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>)). The magnetic layer <b>14</b> is to be the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>.

A wafer on which the magnetic layer <b>14</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>16</b>, the magnetic layer <b>18</b>, and the protection film <b>20</b> are stacked is put into a vacuum furnace in a magnetic field, and annealing is performed in the magnetic field at 270&#xb0; C. for 10 hours, for example. Thus, the magnetic layers <b>14</b> and <b>18</b> achieve uniaxial anisotropies. After this, by using a lithography technique and RIE, patterning is performed to re-form the protection film <b>20</b>, the magnetic layer <b>18</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>16</b>, the magnetic layer <b>14</b> into the planar shape of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>)).</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the current density required for the domain walls to transit from a resting state to a moving state can be lowered, and the domain walls can be moved in a stable manner.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a magnetic storage element according to a second embodiment. The magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the second embodiment includes a magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> including magnetic domains <b>101</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>101</b><sub>n </sub>(n being an integer), electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>applying currents generated from a current source <b>150</b> to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and a spin wave generator <b>170</b> generating spin waves in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Although not shown in the drawing, the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the second embodiment also includes a writing unit and a reading unit, like that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The spin wave generator <b>170</b> includes a magnetic layer <b>172</b> that is connected to one terminal of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> and extends in a direction perpendicular to the thin-wire direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, a nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> formed on the magnetic layer <b>172</b>, a magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> formed on the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b>, and electrodes <b>177</b><i>a </i>and <b>177</b><i>b </i>applying currents between the magnetic layer <b>172</b> and the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b>, the currents being generated from a current source <b>180</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> and the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> of the spin wave generator <b>170</b> are formed on the face of the magnetic layer <b>172</b> on the same side as the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, but can be formed on the face of the magnetic layer <b>172</b> on the opposite side from the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, as in a first modification illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In such a case, the electrode <b>104</b><i>b </i>also serves as the electrode <b>177</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">To increase thermal disturbance endurance, the film thickness of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> can be made greater, or an antiferromagnetic layer <b>178</b> for fixing magnetization can be formed on the face of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> on the opposite side from the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b>. Although not shown in the drawing, the antiferromagnetic layer <b>178</b> can also be formed on the face of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> on the opposite side from the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Further, the current source <b>150</b> and the current source <b>180</b> can share some of the electrodes, but are designed to be capable of controlling switching on and off of currents independently of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The magnetization directions of the magnetic layer <b>172</b> and the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> can be either parallel (antiparallel) or perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this embodiment, the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> are moved in the following manner. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>), from time t<sub>2 </sub>to time t<sub>3</sub>, a current <b>185</b> is applied from the current source <b>180</b>. This procedure is called an assisting procedure. When the assisting procedure is carried out, a spin-polarized current flows into at least part of the region in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> or the magnetic layer <b>172</b>, and accordingly, a spin torque is applied, to change the magnetization direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> or the magnetic layer <b>172</b>. At this point, if the magnetization direction in the region subjected to the spin torque in the magnetic layer <b>172</b> is reversed, unintended writing is performed. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the change in magnetization direction to 90 degrees or smaller or generate a precessional movement of magnetization, to prevent unintended writing. In this case, the change in magnetization propagates as spin waves from the magnetic layer <b>172</b> to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the domain wall widths in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> become greater than those observed prior to the current application.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At time t<sub>1</sub>, a current is applied from the current source <b>150</b> into the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. If the current value is equal to or larger than a threshold value, the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> move in the electron flowing direction or in the opposite direction from the current. When the current is cut off, the domain walls stop moving. Accordingly, the movement distances of the domain walls can be controlled by adjusting the period of time during which the current is applied. That is, in this embodiment, the spin wave generator <b>170</b> assists movement of the domain walls, and is also called an assisting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the spin wave generator <b>170</b>, the angle between the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> and the magnetization direction in the region near the interface between the magnetic layer <b>172</b> and the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> is restricted to 45 to 135 degrees, to prevent unintended magnetization switching. With this arrangement, even if the current <b>185</b> continues to be applied, unintended magnetization switching do not occur. Therefore, the angle between the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> and the magnetization direction in the region near the interface between the magnetic layer <b>172</b> and the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> is preferably 90 degrees, for example. Where the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> and the magnetization direction of the magnetic layer <b>172</b> are perpendicular to each other, the current required for a change in magnetization can be advantageously reduced. Further, where the angle between the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> and the magnetization direction in the region near the interface between the magnetic layer <b>172</b> and the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> is zero, or where the magnetization directions are parallel to each other, magnetization fluctuations can be caused in the magnetic layer <b>172</b> by applying the current <b>185</b> with such a polarity that the current <b>185</b> flows from the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> to the magnetic layer <b>172</b>. When the angle between the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> and the magnetization direction in the region near the interface between the magnetic layer <b>172</b> and the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b> is 180 degrees, or where the magnetization directions are antiparallel to each other, magnetization fluctuations can be caused in the magnetic layer <b>172</b> by applying the current <b>185</b> with such a polarity that the current <b>185</b> flows from the magnetic layer <b>172</b> to the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b>. However, when the magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer <b>176</b> and the magnetization direction of the magnetic layer <b>172</b> are parallel or antiparallel to each other, if the magnitude of the current <b>185</b> is equal to or larger than a threshold value and the current applying period of time is equal to or longer than a threshold value determined by the value of the current <b>185</b>, the magnetization direction in the region subjected to the spin torque in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is reversed. Therefore, the magnitude of the current <b>185</b> or the current applying period of time needs to be smaller or shorter than the corresponding threshold value. For example, if the magnitude of the current <b>185</b> is smaller than the threshold value, a restoring force is generated by the action of the spin torque and the exchange interaction in the magnetic layer <b>172</b>. Accordingly, stable magnetization oscillations occur, and spin waves are constantly generated, even if the current <b>185</b> is not controlled timewise. In view of this, a magnitude of the current <b>185</b> smaller than the threshold value is preferable. The proportion of the exchange interaction to the spin torque can be made larger by reducing the planar size of the nonmagnetic layer <b>174</b>. Accordingly, by doing so, magnetization switching can be made more difficult. Further, by shaping the waveform of the current <b>185</b> into that of a periodic pulse or an alternating current, the spin torque can be weakened prior to a magnetization switching, and switching can be prevented. That is, in the second embodiment, magnetization fluctuations can be caused in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in a stable manner, and accordingly, a state in which the domain wall widths in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> are made greater can be achieved over a long distance in the thin-wire direction. Thus, a large number of domain walls can be moved in a stable manner, even if the magnitude of the current applied from the current source <b>150</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In each of the magnetic storage elements <b>1</b> of the second embodiment and its first modification, the thin-wire direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is oriented in a direction perpendicular to the substrate surface (the upper face of the substrate, for example).

In this case, the respective layers <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>, and <b>176</b> of the spin wave generator <b>170</b> are formed to extend in directions parallel to the thin-wire direction of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The magnetic layer <b>130</b> is made of an insulating magnetic material or a high-conductivity magnetic material. When the magnetic layer <b>130</b> is made of an insulating magnetic material, the magnetic layer <b>130</b> can be connected directly to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. In this case, the distance between the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> and the magnetic layer <b>130</b> is short, and therefore, the spin, waves generated in the magnetic layer <b>130</b> can be directly made to propagate through the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. As a result, the fluctuation transfer efficiency becomes higher, which is preferable. When the magnetic layer <b>130</b> is made of a high-conductivity magnetic material, a nonmagnetic insulator (not shown) needs to be provided between the magnetic layer <b>130</b> and the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, so that the magnetic layer <b>130</b> and the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> are electrically insulated from each other.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows a magnetic storage element according to a fourth embodiment. The magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the fourth embodiment includes a magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> including magnetic domains <b>101</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>101</b><sub>n </sub>(n being an integer), electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>applying currents generated from a current source <b>150</b> to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and a spin wave generator <b>240</b>. The spin wave generator <b>240</b> includes a magnetic layer <b>242</b> that is located in the vicinity of the entire magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> or part of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, a nonmagnetic layer <b>244</b> formed on the magnetic layer <b>242</b>, a magnetization fixed layer <b>246</b> formed on the nonmagnetic layer <b>244</b>, and electrodes <b>247</b><i>a </i>and <b>247</b><i>b </i>applying currents between the magnetic layer <b>242</b> and the magnetization fixed layer <b>246</b>, the currents being generated from a current source <b>248</b>. Although not shown in the drawing, the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the fourth embodiment also includes a writing unit and a reading unit, like that of the first embodiment. The magnetization direction of the magnetization fixed layer. <b>246</b> is fixed. The fixing of the magnetization direction is performed by increasing the film thickness or forming an antiferromagnetic layer on the face on the opposite side from the nonmagnetic layer <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this embodiment, the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> are moved in the following manner. First, from time t<sub>2 </sub>to time t<sub>3</sub>, a current is applied from the current source <b>248</b>. This procedure is called an assisting procedure. When the assisting procedure is carried out, a spin-polarized current flows into the magnetic layer <b>242</b>, and accordingly, a magnetization <b>243</b> at least in a partial region is subjected to a spin torque. As a result, fluctuations occur. The fluctuations in the magnetization <b>243</b> propagate as spin waves through the magnetic layer <b>242</b>. Further, a magnetostatic interaction occurs between the magnetization <b>243</b> in the magnetic layer <b>242</b> and the magnetization in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Therefore, fluctuations are caused in the magnetization in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and spin waves propagate through the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the domain wall widths in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> become greater than those observed prior to the current application. That is, in this embodiment, the spin wave generator <b>240</b> assists a movement of the domain walls, and is also called an assisting unit. The timing to apply a current with the use of the current source <b>150</b> is the same as that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the magnetic layer <b>242</b> is made of an insulator, a spin wave generator <b>240</b>A having a voltage source <b>249</b>, instead of the current source <b>248</b>, can be used, as in a modification of the fourth embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Where the magnetic layer <b>242</b> is made of an insulator, the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> can be in contact with the magnetic layer <b>242</b>. Alternatively, all of or part of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> can be buried in the magnetic layer <b>242</b>. Since the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is in direct contact with the magnetic layer <b>242</b> as described above, the magnetization fluctuations caused in the magnetic layer <b>242</b> can be efficiently transferred through the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and the domain wall widths in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> can be made even greater. When the magnetic layer <b>242</b> is made of a high-conductivity material, an insulator (not shown) needs to be provided between the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> and the magnetic layer <b>242</b>, so that the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> and the magnetic layer <b>242</b> are electrically insulated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When a number of magnetic storage elements of this embodiment are used and are arranged in a row, the magnetic layer <b>242</b>, the nonmagnetic layer <b>244</b>, and the magnetization fixed layer <b>246</b> can be shared between adjacent magnetic storage elements. With this arrangement, high integration of magnetic storage elements can be realized. If a current is not applied to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in this case, only spin waves are generated in the magnetic layer <b>242</b>, and the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> do not move. Accordingly, the respective magnetic elements can be controlled independently of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As described above, in the fourth embodiment, the current density required for the domain walls to transit from a resting state to a moving state can be lowered, and the domain walls can be moved in a stable manner, as in the second embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A magnetic storage element according to a fifth embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>22</b>(<i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref><i>a</i>) is a cross-sectional view of the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the fifth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22(</figref><i>b</i>) is a top view of the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the fifth embodiment includes a magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> including magnetic domains <b>101</b><sub>1 </sub>through <b>101</b><sub>8</sub>, electrodes <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>applying currents generated from a current source <b>150</b> to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and a piezoelectric unit <b>250</b>. The piezoelectric unit <b>250</b> includes a piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> formed to surround at least a partial region of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> (all of the region in the drawings), and electrodes <b>254</b><i>a </i>and <b>254</b><i>b </i>that are formed on the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> and apply voltages generated from a voltage source <b>256</b> to the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, the magnetic storage element <b>1</b> of the fifth embodiment also includes a writing unit and a reading unit, like that of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the fifth embodiment, the domain walls are moved in the following manner. First, from time t<sub>2 </sub>to time t<sub>3</sub>, a voltage is applied to the electrodes <b>254</b>. This procedure is called an assisting procedure. When the assisting procedure is carried out, crystal distortions are caused as oscillations in the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b>, and propagate as elastic waves from the region of the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> in contact with the electrode <b>254</b> to the surrounding region through the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b>. As a result, the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is subjected to a stress via the interface with the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b>, and the magnetic anisotropy of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is changed by an inverse magnetostriction effect. Fluctuations are then caused in the magnetization in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the domain wall widths in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> become greater than those observed prior to the current application. As a result, the value of the current required for shifting the domain walls can be greatly reduced. That is, in this embodiment, the piezoelectric unit <b>250</b> assists movements of the domain walls, and is also called an assisting unit. In the fifth embodiment, a stress is applied to the entire interface between the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> and the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. Distortions are caused in the entire region in the vicinity of the interface in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and the domain wall widths in this region become greater. In each embodiment using a current magnetic field generated from a wiring, the effect of the wiring becomes smaller in inverse proportion to the distance. In the fifth embodiment, on the other hand, a uniform effect is applied to the entire domain walls in the relevant region, and the widths can be advantageously increased. Even where the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> is in contact with part of the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, magnetization fluctuations caused by the distortions propagate as spin waves through the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>, and are effective to some degree. However, the area of the interface between the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> and the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> is preferably large, as the uniformity of the effect is improved. In particular, if the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> extends along the entire magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the thin-wire direction, the above mentioned effect can be achieved over the entire magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. In one of the most preferable examples, the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> surrounds the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b>. In such a case, the widths of all the domain walls in the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> can be collectively made greater in a stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Another advantage of the fifth embodiment is the effect to reduce power consumption. The application of a stress to the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> with the use of the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> is performed by voltage driving. Therefore, the power consumption required for causing distortions is much smaller than that of each embodiment using a current magnetic field generated by a wiring. Accordingly, in combination of a reduction in the current required for moving the domain walls by virtue of the assisting effect achieved by an increase in domain wall width, the power consumption required for moving the domain walls becomes much smaller. The current value required for moving the domain walls can be estimated to be 10 or more times smaller in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The propagation characteristics of the elastic waves propagating through the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> depend on the crystal characteristics of the piezoelectric material, and the elastic waves propagate in a direction depending on the crystal orientation. In particular, uniform surface acoustic waves are excited in a piezoelectric material having monocrystal characteristics or a uniaxial orientation. Therefore, the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> is preferably made of a piezoelectric material having monocrystal characteristics or a uniaxial orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Examples of materials that can be used as the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> include potassium sodium tartrate (KNaC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), aluminum nitride (AlN), lead zirconate titanate (PZT (Pb(Zr,Ti)O<sub>3</sub>)), lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT), quartz crystal (SiO<sub>2</sub>), lithium niobate (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>), lithium tantalate (LiTaO<sub>3</sub>), lithium tetraborate (Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), potassium niobate (KNbO<sub>3</sub>), langasite crystal (La<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>5</sub>SiO<sub>14</sub>, for example), and potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (KNaC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.4H<sub>2</sub>O). Further, with any of these piezoelectric materials being a base material, an additional element can be added so as to adjust the characteristics. Further, the piezoelectric layer <b>252</b> can have a multilayer structure formed by stacking layers made of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The materials that can be used as the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the fifth embodiment are the same as those of the first embodiment. In particular, a great change is caused in magnetic anisotropy of a material having a magnetostriction constant with a large absolute value when a constant stress is applied to the material. Therefore, even when only a small distortion is applied, the magnetization direction greatly changes. Accordingly, the effect to increase the domain wall widths becomes greater, and the current value required for moving the domain walls can be made smaller. Therefore, such a material is preferable. Examples of materials having large magnetostriction constants include alloys of Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, or the like, alloys of platinum and Fe, Co, or Ni, and alloys of a rare earth such as Tb, Sm, or Eu and Fe, Co, or Ni. The materials that can be used as the magnetic thin wire <b>100</b> in the fifth embodiment also include materials having magnetostriction constants that are made larger by adding an additional element to the same materials as those of the first embodiment. In one example, a magnetic material having the Ni element added thereto has a magnetostriction constant shifted in the negative direction, compared with a material not having the Ni element added thereto. Accordingly, by increasing the content of the Ni element, a magnetic material having a magnetostriction constant with a negative sign and a large absolute value can be obtained. In another example, a magnetic material having a very small amount of oxygen added thereto has a magnetostriction constant shifted in the positive direction, compared with a material not having oxygen added thereto. Accordingly, by adding oxygen to a magnetic material, a magnetic material having a magnetostriction with a positive sign and a large absolute value can be obtained.</p>

Further, the bit lines BL<sub>1 </sub>through BL<sub>n </sub>and the assisting lines SL<sub>1 </sub>through SL<sub>n </sub>are connected to drive circuits <b>420</b>A and <b>420</b>B including a decoder for selecting the respective wirings, a reading circuit, and the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, the writing units of the magnetic storage elements <b>1</b> are not shown. One terminal of each writing unit is connected to the switching element for write selecting (not shown), and the other terminal is connected to a current source (not shown). The switching elements for writing can also serve as the switching elements for reading. Alternatively, one reading unit and one writing unit can be provided for more than one memory cell. In such a case, the degree of integration can be made higher. Where each memory cell is provided with one reading unit and one writing unit, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, the data transfer rate can be made higher.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">To cause a data shift in a memory cell, the decoders in the drive circuits <b>410</b>A, <b>410</b>B, <b>420</b>A, and <b>420</b>B first decode an address signal input from outside, the magnetic thin wire ML corresponding to the decoded address is selected, and a current is applied to the selected magnetic thin wire ML. A current is then applied to the corresponding assisting line SL at the time described in the first embodiment, and a current magnetic field is generated, when the magnetic storage elements <b>1</b> of the memory cells are magnetic storage elements of the first embodiment. When the magnetic storage elements <b>1</b> are magnetic storage elements of one of the second through fifth embodiments, a current magnetic field is not generated, but the assisting procedure described in the corresponding embodiment is carried out. The direction in which the domain walls move is the same as the direction in which electrons flow in the magnetic thin wire ML, or is the opposite from the current flowing direction.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">To perform writing on a memory cell, the decoders in the drive circuits <b>410</b>A, <b>410</b>B, <b>420</b>A, and <b>420</b>B first decode an address signal input from outside, the word line WL corresponding to the decoded address is selected, and the corresponding switching element <b>320</b> is turned on. A current is then applied to the bit line BL, to perform writing. Alternatively, after the data stored in the corresponding magnetic thin wire ML is moved by a required amount, writing is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">To read data stored in a memory cell, the decoders in the drive circuits <b>410</b>A, <b>410</b>B, <b>420</b>A, and <b>420</b>B first decode an address signal input from outside, the magnetic thin wire ML corresponding to the decoded address is selected, and a data shift is performed in the above described manner so that the bit to be read from the bit string stored as the magnetization direction in the memory cell is moved to the position of the reading unit. After this, the word line WL is selected, the switching element <b>320</b> is turned on, and a current is applied to the bit line BL. Thus, reading is performed. The reading current can be oriented in either the positive direction or the negative direction, but has a smaller absolute value than the absolute value of the writing current, so as to prevent inversions of the stored data due to reading.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Although the assisting lines SL are parallel to the bit lines BL in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, the assisting lines SL can be parallel to the word lines WL or the magnetic thin wires ML. In such a case, an assisting line SL is selected, and the assisting procedure is carried out. By doing so, the assisting procedure is carried out on the magnetic storage elements <b>1</b> in the magnetic thin wire ML connected to the assisting line SL or in the vicinity of the assisting line SL. Accordingly, shifts can be simultaneously performed in the magnetic storage elements <b>1</b>, and the power consumption of the magnetic storage device can be reduced.</p>

Likewise, throughout the specification, &#x201c;being parallel&#x201d; and &#x201c;being horizontal&#x201d; do not mean &#x201c;being accurately-parallel&#x201d; and &#x201c;being accurately-horizontal.&#x201d;</p>
