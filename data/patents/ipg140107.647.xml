<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/026,262, filed Dec. 31, 2004, now abandoned which in turn claims priority to Netherlands Application No. 1025163, filed Dec. 31, 2003, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for assembling mail pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When assembling mail pieces, in most cases, main documents are assembled with inserts such as annexes to form a set, which set is then finished into a mail piece, for instance by inserting the document and the insert or inserts into an envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One objective of (marketing) communication by means of adding inserts is that as much note as possible is taken of these inserts, in particular by persons potentially interested therein. In these and other cases, it is desirable that it is indicated on the envelope which inserts the mail piece contains, so that recipients interested in the respective inserts throw away the mail piece or the inserts less easily.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, a problem is that it is quite usual for the available types of inserts to vary over time and to include different inserts in mail pieces for different recipients. Therefore, the indications of the inserts are to be logistically geared to the available inserts and the number of inserts to be sent along.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to simplify the provision of indications of inserts included in mail pieces in accordance with available inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the invention, this object is achieved by providing a method for assembling mail pieces, of which at least a number each comprise at least one insert of at least one type and an envelope, using an apparatus comprising at least one insert feeder station for individually feeding inserts, and an inserter for inserting inserts into envelopes, the at least one feeder station being arranged for feeding the inserts towards the inserting station. For at least one type of inserts, a mini image file defining a mini image of at least a part of an insert of that type is stored. For each mail piece comprising an insert of that type:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">the insert of the that type is fed from the insert feeder station and the insert is transported to the inserting station;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">the mini image or mini images defined by the respective mini image file or mini image files are printed on an envelope; and</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">the insert is inserted into the envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention also provides an apparatus for assembling mail pieces, including:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">at least one insert feeder station for individually feeding inserts, an inserter for inserting inserts into envelopes, the feeder stations being arranged for feeding the inserts towards the inserting station;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a printer for printing on envelopes; and</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a data processor structure comprising a memory for storing at least one mini image file defining a mini image of at least a part of an insert of a particular type present in the at least one insert feeder station, the data processor structure being arranged for causing the printer to print the at least one mini image defined by the respective at least one mini image file on an envelope for a mail piece if the insert feeder station is controlled to feed an insert of the at least one type for inclusion in the mail piece.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such an apparatus is specifically designed for carrying out the method according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As mini images of an insert of a type, or of inserts of types, that are included in mail-pieces are printed on the envelopes by a printer of the apparatus for assembling mail pieces, the envelopes are provided in a very simple manner with indications of the insert or inserts contained therein and these indications can be determined and geared very simply and flexibly to the inserts to be sent without requiring an understanding of the nature or the contents of the inserts. The provision of the indications regarding the inserts can be made without reference to information on the nature or the meaning of the contents of the inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further elaborations of the invention are described in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further design aspects, effects and details of the invention appear from the detailed description of an exemplary embodiment with reference to the drawing.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The mail pieces <b>1</b> which are assembled according to the example described hereinafter comprise one or more main documents <b>2</b> which are individually separated and fed from a stack <b>3</b> and inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> in the form of annexes to the main document. The inserts are of three different types which are individually separated and fed from stacks <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, and envelopes <b>10</b> which are individually separated and fed from a stack <b>11</b>. The stacks <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b> are loaded in feeder station holders <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, such as paper cassettes or trays, by a user of the apparatus. The assembled mail pieces <b>1</b> are assembled to form a stack <b>12</b>. The main documents <b>2</b> can be identical for all or some of the addressees, in which case the main document effectively constitutes a type of insert itself as well, or be different for each addressee.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The apparatus for assembling mail pieces according to the example represented in the drawing has, as stations, a feeder station <b>13</b> for feeding main documents <b>2</b> from the stack <b>3</b> one by one, a gathering station <b>14</b> for gathering main documents to be included in the same mail piece, three insert feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, an image capturing device in the form of a scanner <b>18</b> and, as finishing stations, a folding station <b>19</b> and an inserting station <b>20</b> for inserting the assembled sets of documents into envelopes <b>10</b> to form the mail pieces <b>1</b>. It is noted that for the sake of convenient organization, the stacks of documents <b>7</b>-<b>9</b> and the stack of envelopes <b>11</b> have been depicted next to the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b> and <b>20</b> but that as a rule, in practice, they will preferably be located in line with a conveying path extending along or through the stations <b>13</b>-<b>20</b>. Furthermore, a printer <b>40</b> for printing on envelopes <b>10</b> fed from the stack <b>11</b> is provided and arranged for supplying printed envelopes <b>10</b> to the inserting station <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The apparatus further has a data processing structure including a data processor <b>21</b> for controlling the apparatus and a memory <b>22</b> coupled to the data processor <b>21</b>, so that the data processor <b>21</b> can store data in the memory <b>22</b> and read data therefrom. The data processor <b>21</b> can, for that matter, also be designed as a structure of cooperating processors that can be mounted in a joint housing or, in part or not in part, in separate housings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data processor <b>21</b> and the memory <b>22</b> are designed for storing mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b>, each defining a mini image of at least a part of an insert <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> of a particular type.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The data processor <b>21</b> and the printer <b>40</b> are arranged for printing one or more mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> defined by one or more of the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> on each envelope intended for a mail piece with one or more inserts of which at least a portion is shown in the printed mini images. According to the example represented in the drawing, inserts of all three types <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> have been included in the topmost one of the mail piece <b>1</b> in the stack <b>12</b> in accordance with the mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> printed on the envelopes.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, have added a copy of each of the inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> to a main document <b>2</b> to form a set. In the drawing, further sets of sheets <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, some of which are not yet complete are also shown.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Finishing the sets of sheets <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> to form mail pieces is carried out, insofar as required, by folding in the folding station <b>19</b> and by inserting the completed sets in the inserting station <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this manner, on each envelope <b>10</b> for a mail piece <b>1</b> with one or more inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> of the three types of inserts loaded in the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, one or more mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> defined by the associated mini image files <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are printed. As mini images of the inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> or parts thereof are used as insert indications, the envelopes can be provided with indications about the inserts (to be) present therein in a very simple manner, in a mail room, and without editing the printing to be made for instance by departments outside the mailroom and without essential knowledge of the contents or nature of the inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>. Thus, also in cases in which establishing the inserts to be sent along is not done, at least partly, when the contents of the main documents <b>2</b> is/are drafted (as is for instance the case when advertisements are sent along with bills and the like or magazines, or inserts are added to a franking value threshold) the envelopes can be provided with indications relating to the inserts, without editing of the printing being required.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is possible for the mini image to constitute a full size image of a portion of an insert of the type to be indicated by that mini image. However, in most cases, it is more advantageous to print a an image of an entire insert of a particular type, or of a characterizing part thereof on a reduced scale (i.e. showing an image of the insert or of a portion thereof smaller than the original), because thus, in a relatively reliable manner, a depiction is obtained that fits on the envelope and from which it can be seen more easily what kind of insert is indicated and on the basis of which it can be recognized easily whether the right insert has been inserted, not only by the recipient, but also by a person operating the apparatus. The mini image printed as insert indication can also be a line or part of a line of a text of the respective insert. The mini image printed as insert indication is each time the same for all inserts of a particular insert type. Irrespective whether the mini images constitute images of portions of the annex of the respective type on a reduced scale or not, the mini images as printed are preferably significantly smaller than the inserts, so that several mini images indicating the presence of several types of inserts in the envelope can be printed on an envelope.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention can be used in situations in which all mail pieces manufactured during one &#x201c;run&#x201d; or &#x201c;job&#x201d; are to contain one or more inserts of the same type, but is also particularly suitable for providing insert indications on the envelopes when inserts are to be selectively added to particular main documents, depending on sets of insert instructions associated with a main document. Such insert instructions can for instance appear, by reference or not by reference, from machine-readable signs on the main documents or be presented in synchronization with the feeding of main documents, which is attractive in particular if the main documents are printed in-line, i.e. are fed one by one by the printer that prints the documents, to the stations for assembling mail pieces. According to the present example, the insert instructions on the main documents <b>2</b> are also provided in the form of mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, the mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> on the main documents <b>2</b> being identical to the mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> that are printed on the respective envelopes <b>10</b> into which the main documents <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> and the associated inserts are to be inserted. A scanner <b>42</b> for detecting the mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> on the main document is provided and is connected to the data processor <b>21</b>. The data processor <b>21</b> is arranged and connected top the feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> for recognizing the mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> and causing the feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, to selectively add inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> to the main documents <b>2</b> in accordance with mini images <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> present on the respective main documents <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For printing on the envelopes <b>10</b>, automatically and selectively, only those mini images <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> are printed that correspond with the insert types which, according to the insert instructions, are to be added to the respective main document are printed on the respective envelopes. This can be achieved in a particularly simple manner by printing the mini images as scanned from the main documents <b>2</b>. For obtaining a high quality printing, it is preferred that the printings on the envelopes <b>10</b> are defined on the basis of a mini image files associated to the same selected inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> as the mini images scanned from the respective main document <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When assembling the mail pieces <b>1</b>, in accordance with the insert instructions, the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> are selected which are identified by the indications of the types of insert <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> which, according to the insert instructions, are to be included in the same mail piece as the main document <b>2</b> with which the insert instructions are associated. If only one or no insert is to be added to some of the main documents, one or no mini image file <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, the data processor <b>21</b> ensures that the printer <b>40</b> is controlled for exclusively printing the mini images <b>26</b>-<b>28</b> that are defined by the selected mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> on the envelopes <b>10</b> and the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b> are controlled for selectively including inserts <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> exclusively in mail pieces in which inserts of the selected type or types are to be included according to the insert instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Printing the envelopes can be carried out prior to or after the associated documents and inserts have been inserted therein. In the present example, the envelopes are printed by the printer <b>40</b> and supplied to the inserting station <b>20</b> one by one. Thus, matching of envelopes <b>10</b> with the main document <b>2</b> and the inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, if any, can be achieved and maintained in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The data processor <b>21</b> is coupled to the scanner <b>18</b> via a connection <b>31</b> and arranged for converting image data obtained upon scanning into the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b>. As the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> are obtained by scanning the inserts <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> of the respective types, it is ensured in a simple manner that the correct representations <b>26</b>-<b>28</b> are printed on the main documents <b>2</b>, without it being required that mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b>, or information on the basis of which these can be assembled, are supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to this example, further, the scanner <b>18</b> is located downstream of the holders <b>32</b>-<b>34</b> of the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b> for dispensing the inserts <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> one by one. The data processor <b>21</b> is further designed for controlling the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b> for feeding, during a start-up phase, a sample of each of the inserts <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> from the holders <b>32</b>-<b>34</b>, and receiving image data obtained upon scanning of the insert <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> of the types loaded in the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b>, processing the image data into image data files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> and storing the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b>, each in association with at least one insert feeder station code of the insert feeder station <b>15</b>-<b>17</b>, which insert feeder station code indicates to which of the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b> the mini image file belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this manner, the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> are not only obtained during scanning, but what is also achieved during the start-up phase prior to the operational phase is that the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> are automatically coupled to the insert feeder stations <b>15</b>-<b>17</b> in which the respective insert types <b>4</b>-<b>6</b> have been loaded. When, in operation, the insert instructions indicate, for instance, that inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> are to be added to a particular main document, on the basis of the insert instructions, also the mini image files with the codes identifying the first two insert feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are selected, resulting in the printing of the mini images <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the inserts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> in the first two insert feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, the mini image files can also be obtained in many different manners, for instance from the designer or printer of the respective insert. During a start-up phase preceding an operational phase during which mail pieces are assembled, the scanner <b>18</b> can be utilized for recognizing which types of inserts are present in the feeder stations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>. When the mini image files <b>23</b>-<b>25</b> are stored in association with indications referring to associated insert types, it can automatically be ensured that the correct inserts are added and the correct mini image files are printed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the scanner <b>18</b> is used only during the start-up phase, it is advantageous to design it to be removable. A relatively slow scanner then suffices, scanning the inserts only during the start-up phase, because during the operational phase, the documents and inserts do not need to be led through the scanner.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The inserts can also be printed in reaction to insert instructions which refer to particular types of inserts, while each time, those mini image files for determining the mini images to be printed on the envelopes are selected that belong to the insert types indicated by the insert instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Within the framework of the invention, many other modes and embodiments of carrying out the invention are conceivable. For instance, instead of annexes to a main documents, the insert or inserts may also constitute the only contents of the envelope. Furthermore, instead of a scanner, also other image capturing devices can be used, such as a camera.</p>
