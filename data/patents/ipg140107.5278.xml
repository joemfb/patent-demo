<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to German Patent Application No. DE 10 2011 016 641.6, filed Apr. 9, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The technical field relates to a method and a device for determining and providing information for the transport of at least one object with a passenger car, a computer program product and a computer-readable medium.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During a transport of objects with a passenger car, some people tend to overestimate the load or transport capacity of the vehicle, for example, while shopping. Therefore, it is possible that too many objects are bought. Arriving at the passenger car, difficulties can subsequently arise with the loading of the passenger car. This can be augmented in that typically no additional transport aids such as for example fastening straps are carried along in the vehicle or the loading cannot be carried out by one person alone. It can happen, furthermore, that shopping trolleys start moving in an uncontrolled manner or the parking lock, in which the motor vehicle is parked, is too narrow for the loading process. In addition, the loading can sometimes comprise a plurality of loading steps and the loading process can thus take more time than expected. Large objects are often temporarily leaned against the side walls of the motor vehicle during the transport, which could lead to damages and sometimes the transport goods are stowed in such a way that they cause a possible risk during the trip.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, at least one object is to state a method and a device for determining and providing information for the transport of at least one object with a passenger car, a computer program product and a computer-readable medium, which support customers or users during a shopping process. In addition, other objects, desirable features and characteristics will become apparent from the subsequent summary and detailed description, and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment, a method for determining and providing information for the transport of at least one object by means of a passenger car comprises the following steps. There takes place a determining of at least one first parameter of at least one object to be transported. The at least one first parameter in this case is selected from the group consisting of dimensions of the at least one object and the mass of the at least one object. In addition, a determining of a current transport capacity of the passenger car takes place. Furthermore, a determining of a probable loading state of the passenger car based on the at least one determined first parameter and the determined current transport capacity of the passenger car takes place. Furthermore, an outputting of information with regard to the determined probable loading state takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method supports customers or users, for example, the driver of the passenger car, during a shopping process. In particular, this takes place through the determining of the probable loading state of the passenger car based on the mentioned quantities and the outputting of information regarding this determined probable loading state. Therefore, the user receives, even during the shopping process, information as to whether the passenger car is suitable for the transport of the at least one object and can therefore already determine at an early stage if he should make the purchase. The method thus has the advantage that the user cannot only determine during a loading process if the object to be transport is suitable for the transport with the passenger car or not. This results in a time and cost saving to the user, since for example a return transport of the object into the sales localities and a returning process connected with this can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The outputting of the information regarding the determined probable loading state preferably includes an outputting of a warning message, if the determined probable loading state exceeds a predetermined threshold value. For example, an outputting of a warning message can take place in the event that the determined probable loading state exceeds the permissible gross weight of the passenger car and/or in the event that a predefined transport volume is exceeded. Therefore, the user is informed in a particularly reliable manner regarding a possible overloading of the passenger car. The warning message can for example be output as a visual and/or acoustic warning message.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment, at least one second parameter characterizing a stackability of the at least one object is additionally determined. The determining of the probable loading state of the passenger car in this embodiment additionally takes place based on the at least one determined second parameter. This is advantageous, in particular, if a plurality of objects have to be transported and the stackability of the individual objects is therefore of particular significance. The at least one second parameter is preferably a packaging state of the at least one object. For example, it can be determined if the packaging is solid or loose or if the at least one object comprises a packaging. Furthermore it can be determined for example if the at least one object is particularly fragile.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The determining the at least one first parameter and/or the at least one second parameter can include an inputting of the at least one first parameter or the at least one second parameter with an input device. This makes possible a particularly simple input of the relevant parameter. Furthermore, the determining of the at least one first parameter and/or of the at least one second parameter can include a providing of an object-specific identification. Here, a selecting of a data set including the at least one first parameter or the at least one second parameter from a data base based on the object-specific identification additionally takes place. The object-specific identification preferably includes an at least one-dimensional barcode and/or an RFID-code. This makes possible a particularly user-friendly determining of the respective parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the determining of the at least one first parameter and/or of the at least one second parameter can take place by means of data determined by at least one sensor. In an embodiment, the at least one sensor in this case is embodied as optical camera. This likewise makes possible a particularly user-friendly determining of the relevant parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The determining of the current transport capacity of the passenger car preferably includes a determining of a vehicle type of the passenger car, a number of occupants of the passenger car, a current configuration of an interior of the passenger car, a current loading state of the passenger car and/or a determining of transport devices additionally arranged in the region of the passenger car exterior, for example of a bicycle carrier or roof luggage rack. Therefore, the current transport capacity of the passenger car can be determined to as accurate a degree as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further embodiment, the determining of the current transport capacity of the passenger car additionally takes place based on at least one predefined parameter. The at least one predefined parameter characterizes the visual conditions for a driver of the passenger car and/or the road safety. The at least one predefined parameter is, for example, a stowage space defined taking into account the visual conditions for the driver or a loading volume taking into account the visual conditions. Therefore, the safety during the transport of the at least one object can be increased and if applicable, legal regulations that exist, taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The determining of the probable loading state of the passenger car preferably includes a determining of an arrangement of the at least one object to be transported in the passenger car and/or a configuration of the interior of the passenger car based on the determined current transport capacity. The outputting of the information regarding the determined probable loading state in this case includes an outputting of information regarding the determined arrangement of the at least one object to be transported in the passenger car and/or the determined configuration of the interior of the passenger car. Therefore, the user is advantageously provided with detailed information, as a result of which the user can for example stow an object to be transported in a particularly space-saving manner or configure the interior of the passenger car particularly suitable for the transport, for example, by folding over one or a plurality of seats.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A device is provided for determining and providing information for the transport of at least one object with a passenger car. The device comprises a first determining device, embodied for determining at least one first parameter of at least one object to be transported, where the at least one first parameter is selected from the group consisting of dimensions of the at least one object and the mass of the at least one object. In addition, the device comprises a second determining device, embodied for determining a current transport capacity of the passenger car. Furthermore, the device comprises a third determining device, which is embodied for determining a probable loading state of the passenger car based on the at least one determined first parameter and the determined current transport capacity of the passenger car. In addition to this, the device comprises an output device, which is embodied for outputting information regarding the determined probable loading state.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The device has advantages such as the advantages already mentioned in connection with the method, which at this point need not be mentioned again to avoid repetitions. Preferably, the device is part of a mobile telephone. This advantageously increases the comfort for the user, since the user can make use of his mobile telephone and no additional components are therefore needed during the shopping process.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A computer program product which, when it is executed on a computer unit of a device for determining and providing information for the transport of at least one object with a passenger car, directs the computer unit to execute the following steps. The computer unit is directed for determining at least one first parameter of at least one object to be transported, where the at least one first parameter is selected from the group consisting of dimensions of the at least one object and the mass of the at least one object. In addition, the computer unit is directed for determining a current transport capacity of the passenger car. Furthermore, the computer unit is directed for determining a probable loading state of the passenger car based on the at least one determined first parameter and the determined current transport capacity of the passenger car. In addition, the computer unit is directed to output information regarding the determined probable loading state. A computer-readable medium is also provided, on which a computer program product according to the mentioned embodiment is stored. The computer program product and the computer-readable medium have advantages, such as the advantages already mentioned in connection with the method, which at this point are not mentioned again to avoid repetitions.</p>
