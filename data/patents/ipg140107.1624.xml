<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of wagering devices and methods, and novel wagering systems and methods related to big wheel or candy wheel type games.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background of the Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the more common wagering devices that has remained popular over the years is the spinning wheel, also known as the candy wheel. One of the more common upright spinning wheel devices in the gaming industry is the Big 6 wheel, in which usually six different types of symbols are distributed randomly about a wheel, each of the symbols being present in different proportions or frequencies on the wheel. The different symbols are either physically or virtually (in electronic format) separated from each other by pegs, and a usually fixed position pointer is used to determine the game event outcome, with the pointer identifying the symbol resulting from the game spin.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One common variant of this game is a large wheel with more than 30 spaces available on the face of the wheel, and each space is identified with a specific denomination of currency. In the US, for example, the wheel will have slots of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $50 (for example). A wager is placed on a specific denomination (e.g., a $1.00 or more wager) and if the correct denomination is chosen for the result of the spin, the wager is resolved proportionally to the wager and the denomination. That is, for a $2.00 wager on the $5 outcome, the payout would be $2.00&#xd7;$5, or $10.00. The distribution and number of denomination symbols is such that there is a built in house advantage. The statistical long-range frequency of $1 appearing is less than 1:1, and so forth, through the statistical long-range frequency of the $50 denomination outcome being less than 1:50.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Numerous variations of these types of games have been tried. U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,061 (Jackson) discloses an apparatus and method for operating a gaming device, said method comprising: for a single play of a game: enabling a wager to be placed on a payline; causing a display device to display a plurality of areas, each of said areas divided into a plurality of sub-areas; for at least one but less than all of the sub-areas of each of the areas, randomly determining a symbol from a plurality of different symbols into display in said sub-area, and causing the display device to display said randomly determined symbol in said sub-area; for each of said areas, randomly determining one of the sub-areas of each of the areas which defines the payline, and causing the display device to display an indication of said randomly determined sub-areas which define the payline, wherein for each of said areas, the random determination of any symbol to display in any sub-area of said area is separate from the random determination of which sub-area of said area defines the payline; and determining if any randomly determined and displayed symbols in the sub-areas which define the payline are one of a plurality of winning symbol combinations, and if any randomly determined and displayed symbols along the payline are one of said plurality of winning symbol combinations, causing the display device to display an award for said winning symbol combination.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other variations are shown in Published U.S. Patent Application Document No. 20050215307 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,553,233) and Published U.S. Patent Application Document No. 20040077398 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,890,255 (Jarvis, Eugene, et al.), &#x201c;Multiple wheel roulette game.&#x201d;</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A Three-Wheel gaming system is provided wherein there are three physical and/or virtual wheels that have multiple symbol positions on the wheels that are used to independently determine game event outcomes on each of the three wheels. At least one wager is placed on any single wheel, any two wheels or all three wheels. The three wheels are then spun (physically or virtually), the individual wheel symbol outcomes are determined and the wagers are resolved according to the rules of the game that determine payouts on the wagers(s).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An at least Three-Wheel gaming system is provided wherein there are three physical and/or virtual wheels that have multiple symbol positions on the wheels that are used to independently determine game event outcomes on each of the three wheels. At least one wager is placed on any single wheel, any two wheels or all three wheels. The three wheels are then spun (physically or virtually), the individual wheel symbol outcomes are determined and the wagers are resolved according to the rules of the game that determine payouts on the wagers(s).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One way of describing games according to the present technology is as a method of providing a wagering game and resolving wagers on that wagering game that includes at least:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">a) providing three independently spinning wheel outcome providers, each spinning wheel outcome provider having more than thirty outcome positions on each wheel;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">b) each outcome position on the wheel having a symbol therein;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">c) each spinning wheel outcome provider positioned on a gaming apparatus so that all symbols on a face of each spinning wheel outcome provider are viewable at the same time from a position in front of the gaming device;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">d) each spinning wheel outcome provider having at least six different types of symbols displayed on the face of the spinning wheel outcome provider;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0019">e) the gaming apparatus comprising the three spinning wheel outcome providers, a processor, memory accessible by the processor, and the processor configured to execute code to perform a method comprising:
        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0020">i) recognizing a wager on the wagering game in which the wager places value at risk on the determination of at least one outcome selected from the group consisting of 1) a specific symbol appearing on a specific spinning wheel outcome provider; 2) any symbol appearing on any two spinning wheel outcome providers; 3) any single symbol appearing on all spinning wheel outcome providers; and 4) a specifically selected single symbol appearing on all spinning wheel outcome providers;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0021">ii) spinning each of the spinning wheel outcome providers;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0022">iii) identifying a specific symbol outcome on each spinning wheel outcome provider; and</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0023">iv) resolving any wager recognized in i) based upon the identification of each specific symbol outcome on each spinning wheel outcome provider.
<br/>
Each spinning wheel outcome provider may consist of a physical spinning wheel with an axis or rotation perpendicular to the face of the spinning wheel outcome provider, or each spinning wheel outcome provider consists of a virtual spinning wheel with an axis or rotation perpendicular to the face of the spinning wheel outcome provider which is displayed on a video display system. Two separate wagers may be recognized at a single player position, the two separate wagers comprising a) at least one wager on an outcome of a specific symbol on a specific wheel, a specific symbol on at least two wheels, or a specific symbol on three wheels and b) an outcome of any specific symbol on three wheels or any single symbol on all three wheels. Two separate wagers may be recognized at a single player position, the two separate wagers comprising a) at least one wager on an outcome of a specific symbol on a specific wheel, a specific same symbol on at least two wheels, or a specific same symbol on three wheels and b) an outcome of any same specific symbol on three wheels or any same symbol on all three wheels. Multiple wagers of equal or different amounts may be placed different wheels and different symbols on the different wheels. That is, there may be a $5.00 wager on Yellow on wheel 2, and a $10.00 wager placed on Red on wheel 3.

        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0024">A preferred system may include one or more of the following components.
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0025">1) There are (at least) three (physical or virtual) wheels with equally-spaced, differentially spaced, or processor-weighted separate compartments.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0026">2) Each compartment contains a symbol or character or characterization that distinguishes among compartments. Symbols my be any predetermined set of symbols (e.g., bells, lemons, plums, cherries, Sevens, Bars, Double Bars, Triple Bars, etc.), characters (Mahjong symbols, Asian figure characters, Roman numbers, astrological symbols, and the like) and characterizations (colors, stripes, checks, patterns, and the like).</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0027">3) Each of the wheels preferably has equal numbers of spaces for specific numbers as the other wheels, although in a less preferred embodiment (especially in a processor based, virtual wheels display), different numbers of compartments or slots may be present in one or more wheels. Those numbers are proposed to be between 28 and 36 spaces, and may be about 32 spaces.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0028">4) The three physical wheels are preferably displayed in a full frontal display (in flat appearance, perspective, with or without topographic features or the like), so that each wheel can be independently and collectively viewed, each wheel independently selected for wagering, and individual outcomes on each of the three wheels can be viewed by players. Variations in the play of the games and displays of the wheel and views of the wheel (as explained later) may be provided with virtual wheels to control the size of the display.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0029">5) Wagers are made on individual wheels, any multiple ones of the wheels (e.g., two of the wheels) or all three wheels. The wagers may be made electronically based on credits, credit, charged to an account, direct entry of coins, cash or tokens, ticket-in/ticket out wagers or any other way of placing value at risk.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0006" num="0030">6) Each wager operates or stands separately, in that a wager does not have to be won on the first wheel as a trigger or qualifier for a wager to be won against any other wheel.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0007" num="0031">7) Winning outcomes can depend upon collective events, but the individual outcomes on each wheel and for each wager are separately determined and there is no &#x201c;pay line&#x201d; as present in a standard slot-type gaming system.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0008" num="0032">8) The columns, slots or compartments in the wheel preferably contain either a single color from among 6 colors or individual symbols, with no secondary characteristic that can be wagered upon separately, that is there are no combinations of suits and ranks, symbols and colors and the like that must be combined to determine a single compartment symbol effect or outcome.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0009" num="0033">9) A side bet wager may be made that multiple identical symbols (e.g., 3 yellow color areas) will be obtained on a single spin of the three wheels. This side bet will be resolved according to a pay-table which differentiates awards among the different symbol that results from the spin of the three wheels.</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0010" num="0034">10) The preferred mode is an electronic system with a random number generator determining individual wheel symbol outcomes or selecting template outcomes for spins of all three wheels. The system would comprise at least one video display, a processor system, memory and player input controls (e.g., button, switches or touchscreen entry system).

Additional technical enabling disclosure is provided herein.

<p id="p-0017" num="0035">A &#x201c;display&#x201d; as that term is used herein is an area that conveys information to a viewer. The information may be dynamic, in which case, an LCD, LED, CRT, LDP, rear projection, front projection, or the like may be used to form the display. The aspect ratio of the display may be 4:3, 16:9, or the like. Furthermore, the resolution of the display may be any appropriate resolution such as 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, 1080p or the like. The format of information sent to the display may be any appropriate format such as standard definition (SDTV), enhanced definition (EDTV), high definition (HD), or the like. The information may likewise be static, in which case, painted glass may be used to form the display. Note that static information may be presented on a display capable of displaying dynamic information if desired. Three dimensional imaging technology may also be provided for the images and the screen. Additionally, truncated perspectives may be provided on individual wheels to enhance ease of viewing the results on each wheel. For example, because there are three wheels, visual space on the screens must be optimized. Rather than being limited to showing a single view of the wheel with very small observable symbols, a portion of the virtual wheel may be magnified (in direct view or perspective) to increase the size of the symbols in the determination area (where the pointer determines the event outcome).</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0044">In the following descriptions, the use of the general term &#x201c;wheels&#x201d; includes purely, free-spinning wheels, processor and step motor controlled three individual reels, with one of ordinary skill in the art appreciating and understanding the technical implementations that are appropriate for the different mechanical and/or electronic systems.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0045">Looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a full view of a screen shot of three wheels <b>20</b><i>a </i><b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are shown with respective symbol position indicators or selectors <b>30</b><i>a </i><b>30</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>c</i>. Individual characterization symbols of colors B (blue), G (Green), R (Red), W (White), Y (Yellow), V (Violet) and I (Indigo) are shown distributed randomly (but identically) about the three wheels <b>20</b><i>a </i><b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The screen <b>32</b> is a touchscreen having player input areas for wagering on each wheel separately <b>12</b><i>a </i><b>12</b><i>b </i>and <b>12</b><i>c</i>, for wagering on all three wheel <b>14</b>, for a special side bet <b>16</b>, for selecting the amount of each wager <b>18</b> (e.g., by progressively touching area <b>18</b> the amount of the wager is increased) and for selecting a particular color for a wager <b>26</b> (wherein repeatedly touching area <b>26</b>, a progression through the colors is made). Alternatively, there may be separate areas for each color, separate areas for each size of wager and a separate area to start each game (<b>34</b>). Other touch sensitive areas for cashing out, calling an attendant, and the like may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0046">One example of a method of play of the game can be performed as follows. The amount of an initial wager on an underlying game is made by repeatedly contacting area <b>18</b> on the touchscreen <b>32</b>. A level of $5.00 per wager on the underlying wheel spinning game is made. Contact with area <b>26</b> scrolls through colors until a particular color (in this case B (Blue) is selected. Area <b>12</b><i>b </i>only is contacted to select the second wheel <b>20</b><i>b </i>as the underlying game object. No side bet is selected for this game play. The start button <b>34</b> is pressed and the three wheel <b>20</b><i>a </i><b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are virtually spun, a random number generator (not shown) in the processor system (not shown) determining ultimate virtual wheel positions with respect to the pointers <b>30</b><i>a</i>. As an alternative, the wheels may appear to remain stationary and the pointers rotate about the wheels, or both the wheels and pointers may rotate with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a final position for the spin outcomes for the three wheels <b>20</b><i>a </i><b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>are shown as G (Green) for wheel <b>20</b><i>a</i>, B (Blue) for wheel <b>20</b><i>b </i>and B (Blue) for wheel <b>20</b><i>c</i>. As the wager in this game was directed towards only the second wheel (<b>20</b><i>b</i>), only that outcome needs to be considered. As the outcome was the color B (Blue) wagered upon, the player wins the proportional amount awarded for that color when that outcome occurs (e.g., if a $5.00 wager is made and the return on the most prominent color (which Blue is) would be 1:1, so the player would retain his $5.00 wager and be paid an additional $5.00 award.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0048">Again looking at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, note sections <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>on the screen <b>32</b>. The top section <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be a communal screen available to multiple players so that (like keno) the game may be played as a group or even theater event. In that case, players may have a screen or player input showing only bottom section <b>32</b><i>b </i>or may have both sections displayed on the player's individual screen <b>32</b>. In this format, individual players may make their desired wagers on a communal game displayed on a central display area. Upon locking out further wagers, or completion of wagers at all active positions, or after expiration of a predetermined time period, the game is begun and a central processor resolves all wagers at each individual player position. The player input device in this format, as described above, may be any input/transmitting device known in the art.</p>
