<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present aspects relate to cryptographic systems, and more particularly, to systems, apparatus and methods for an identity based symmetric cryptosystem using biometric data that provides for both secure data transmission and secure access to transmit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional password based security systems generally include two phases. First, an initial enrollment phase during which users select passwords, which are subsequently stored on an authentication device, such as an authentication server. Secondly, an authentication phase allows the user to gain access to resources or data by entering their passwords, which are then verified against the stored version of the password. However, such a password-based security mechanism is highly vulnerable. For example, if the passwords are stored as unencrypted, plain text, then an adversary who gains access to the system can obtain every password in the system. In this instance, even a single successful attack by the adversary can compromise the entire system. Additionally, password-based computer security systems are susceptible to brute force attacks, in which all possibilities are searched to decipher the passwords, or a dictionary attack, in which only possibilities most likely to succeed (e.g., a list derived from words in a dictionary) are searched.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An additional problem related to password-based security systems is that passwords are not required to be user-specific, in that passwords can be shared amongst more than one individual/user, making it difficult for the system to know who has the password at any given point in time. Thus, authentication in such security systems is possession based and thus, possession of the password is sufficient to establish user authenticity. This means that passwords are unable to provide requisite non-repudiation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address some of these problems conventional password systems have evolved to implement encryption. For example, the passwords are encrypted during the enrollment phase using an encryption or hash function and during the authentication phase, when a user enters a candidate password, the function is applied to the candidate password and access is granted if the encrypted candidate password matches the encrypted password stored during the enrollment phase. Such encrypted passwords provide no benefit to an adversary unless the adversary possesses or has knowledge of the encryption or hash function. However, unless the encryption function is deemed to be strong, adversaries have shown a propensity to be able to hack or otherwise decipher encryption codes. So-called &#x201c;strong&#x201d; encryption codes, while they may prevent hacking, may be too expensive, complex and/or inefficient to implement in certain instances.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, biometric data has been used as a means of providing user authentication. In a biometric security system physical biometric features of a user are measured to obtain biometric parameters, commonly referred to as observations. The biometric features may include, but are not limited to, fingerprints, eye-related features, such as iris recognition, other face recognition features, voice recognition features and the like. However, a conventional biometric security system, in which the biometric data is unencrypted, has the same vulnerability as a conventional password based system. Specifically, if the database stores unencrypted biometric templates in a central database or in the user device, then the parameters are subject to attack and misuse. Once the biometric parameters are illicitly located, the adversary may be able to modify the parameters to match the appearance or characteristic of the adversary to gain unauthorized access. In addition, the threat exists of having &#x201c;fake&#x201d; biometric data inputted in an artificial manner. Also, unlike password security, biometric data is not a secret and, as such, some biometric data, such as fingerprints, can be easily forged if the data is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, encryption of biometric data has proven to be a challenging task. Among other reasons, the manner by which the biometric features are measured and the variance in the biometric features from one measurement to another, termed &#x201c;noise&#x201d; provide obstacles to a cryptographic system implementing biometric data. For example, biometric parameters may be captured and entered during an enrollment phase, such that enrollment biometric parameters are encrypted using an appropriate encryption function. However, during the authentication phase, the biometric parameters obtained from the same user may differ from those taken at enrollment. For example, if the biometric data is related to facial feature recognition, the capturing equipment and lighting may differ and the features themselves may change over time. Thus, if the biometric data captured during authentication are passed through the same encryption function, the result may not match the enrollment data. In this regard, no acceptable methods for performing error correction or syndrome code decoding for the noise structure particular to biometrics exists. Most previous secure biometric systems use a memory-less noise model or other models that oversimplify the nature of the noise and do not reflect actual operational conditions. As such, the previous attempts at secure biometrics do not adequately represent the time varying dynamics of biometric features and the acquisition and measurement processes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Recently, multimodal biometric fusion has been introduced which uses in combination more than one source of biometric data with error correction and some secret information, such as a password or PIN to generate a secret key. However, this type of security technique requires storage of a large quantity of data and it tends to be resource intensive to implement and, thus costlier to implement than other biometric techniques. Additionally, liveliness detection testing of biometric data has been implemented, in which a &#x201c;live&#x201d; human characteristic is captured, such as temperature, blood flow, heartbeat or the like. However, implementation of liveliness detection testing may not be feasible on resource constrained devices, such as handheld wireless devices or the like, which would require different types of sensors than are currently available on such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, a need exists to develop a highly secure biometric model through which both access and transmission can effectively be made very secure. The desired model should address and overcome the inherent variability of biometric data, while providing for a model that prevents duplication of biometric data.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Present aspects define methods, apparatus, and computer program products that provide for an identity-based cryptosystem using a very secure biometric model through which both access and data transmission are effectively made very secure. In one aspect herein described, syndrome vectors of biometric data are generated and securely stored to provide for tolerance of the inherent variability of biometric data. In addition, to insure that the biometric data is not duplicated by adversaries who might gain access to the syndrome generation algorithm and the biometric data, present aspects, provide for keeping the private key more secure and making the cryptosystem user-identity dependent. In certain aspects, added security is accomplished by generating a private key from conventional key generation techniques and generating a final key from input of the private key and biometric data as a one-way function. As such the systems, apparatus and computer program products herein disclosed provide end-to-end authentication of end users using secure biometry, which constitute the symmetric and/or asymmetric identity-based cryptosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Present aspects provide for a one-time registration of all biometric data between two communication points, example between a first end user device and a second end user device. In certain aspects, the one-time registration may be performed during the initial communication between the end user devices. The registration may provide for maintaining a biometric address book, either locally or network-based, using syndrome coded and/or distorted/transformed data, otherwise referred to as cancellable biometric data, to prevent adversaries from acquiring the raw biometric data.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">After the registration has been performed, biometric data may be randomly sampled and combined with a conventional private key using a one-way function to result in a final key that is used to encrypt data. The biometric data may be distorted/transformed biometric data and/or stored using syndrome code to provide additional security. Once the encrypted data is received by the device, which has registered the biometric data, the biometric data is retrieved according to a device identifier and based on a randomizer received from the encrypting device, the decrypting device determines which biometric should be used for decryption. The biometric data and the randomizer are then combined to form the final private key used for decrypting the data.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used in this application, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to include a computer-related entity, such as but not limited to hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets, such as data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a terminal, which can be a wired terminal or a wireless terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, device, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, terminal, communication device, user agent, user device, or user equipment (UE). A wireless terminal may be a cellular telephone, a satellite phone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a computing device, or other processing devices connected to a wireless modem. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station may be utilized for communicating with wireless terminal(s) and may also be referred to as an access point, a Node B, or some other terminology.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is intended to mean an inclusive &#x201c;or&#x201d; rather than an exclusive &#x201c;or.&#x201d; That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase &#x201c;X employs A or B&#x201d; is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations. That is, the phrase &#x201c;X employs A or B&#x201d; is satisfied by any of the following instances: X employs A; X employs B; or X employs both A and B. In addition, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; as used in this application and the appended claims should generally be construed to mean &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; unless specified otherwise or clear from the context to be directed to a singular form.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, SC-FDMA and other systems. The terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), cdma2000, etc. UTRA includes Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA) and other variants of CDMA. Further, cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and IS-856 standards. A TDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). An OFDMA system may implement a radio technology such as Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), IEEE 802.20, Flash-OFDM&#x25a1;, etc. UTRA and E-UTRA are part of Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS). 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA, which employs OFDMA on the downlink and SC-FDMA on the uplink. UTRA, E-UTRA, UMTS, LTE and GSM are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP). Additionally, cdma2000 and UMB are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). Further, such wireless communication systems may additionally include peer-to-peer (e.g., mobile-to-mobile) ad hoc network systems often using unpaired unlicensed spectrums, 802.xx wireless LAN, BLUETOOTH and any other short- or long-range, wireless communication techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Various aspects or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, etc. and/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules etc. discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Present aspects herein describe methods, apparatus and computer program products for an identity-based cryptosystem using a highly secure biometric model that results in heightened security for both access and data transmission. Present aspects rely on storing biometric data in syndrome vector format to provide tolerance in the inherent variability associated with biometric data. However, use of syndrome vectors alone does not address the problems associated with duplicating biometric data, thereby breaking the security provided by biometric data. Present aspects address this concern by making the private key more secure and also making the cryptosystem user-identity dependent. To accomplish this, in present aspects the private key is generated from conventional key generation techniques and the final encryption/decryption keys are generated from an input of the private key and the biometric data using a one-way function. Thus, methods, apparatus and computer-programs herein described provide for an end-to-end authentication of end users using secure biometric data, which constitutes the symmetric identity-based cryptosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> provide high-level block diagrams of an identity-based cryptosystem <b>10</b>. The system <b>10</b> includes a first computing device <b>12</b> and a second computing device <b>14</b> that communicate across a computing network <b>16</b>. While the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> includes a first computing device <b>12</b> for encrypting data that is a wireless communication device and a second computing device <b>14</b> for decrypting data that is wireless communication device and, thus the devices communicate across a computing network <b>16</b> that is a wireless communication network, the cryptosystem herein disclosed may be utilized on any computing device, wireless or wired, that transmits data across a computing network. Additionally, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict encryption in terms of first wireless communication device <b>12</b> and decryption in terms of second wireless communication device <b>14</b>, in most instances each wireless communication device may be configured with the necessary hardware and software to perform both encryption and decryption per the disclosed aspects as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first computing device <b>12</b>, operable to provide identity-based encryption, includes a computing platform <b>18</b> that includes a processor <b>20</b> and a memory <b>22</b> in communication with the processor <b>20</b>. The computing platform <b>18</b> includes one or more biometric sensors <b>24</b> that are operable to sense and capture biometric data related to the user of the computing device <b>12</b>. Biometric sensors may include, but are not limited to, fingerprint sensors, voice sensors, facial feature sensors, eye/iris sensors, and any other sensor that detects and captures a biometric feature of the user. While the biometric sensors <b>24</b> herein depicted are standalone sensors, the sensors may also be embodied as processing subsystems of processor <b>20</b> or may be embodied as software modules located in memory <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The memory <b>22</b> of computing platform <b>18</b> includes a biometric data distorter <b>26</b> operable to receive biometric data from the biometric sensors <b>24</b> and distort the data into a plurality of distorted biometric data, otherwise referred to in the art as cancellable biometric data. The biometric data distorter <b>26</b> may be any device that distorts, manipulates, filters or otherwise changes the biometric data. In addition, the biometric data distorter <b>26</b> may apply distortion to the entire received biometric data or any portion thereof. The biometric data distorter <b>26</b> may also be configured to distort biometric data coming from more than one type of biometric sensor <b>24</b>, such that the resulting distorted biometric data is a combination of biometric data received from two or more biometric sensors <b>26</b>. It should be noted that while the biometric data distorter <b>26</b> is shown as being located within memory <b>22</b> and, thus, embodied within software, biometric data distorter <b>26</b> may also be implemented in hardware and, thus, be located external from memory <b>22</b>. By distorting the biometric data, an added level of security is provided in protecting that data from being duplicated by an adversary.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, memory <b>22</b> of computing platform <b>18</b> includes a biometric sampler <b>28</b> operable for generating and storing syndrome vectors <b>30</b> for each of the plurality of distorted biometric data. Syndrome vectors, which will be discussed at length infra., provide for tolerance in the inherent variability of biometric data.

In one aspect, randomization module <b>32</b> is operable for providing the randomizer <b>34</b> to the random selection of the distorted biometric data used to generate an encryption key. Thus, randomization module <b>32</b> may in communication with encryption key generator <b>36</b> that is operable to generate an encryption key <b>42</b> based on a random sample of the distorted biometric data <b>38</b> and a private key <b>40</b>. The random sample of the distorted biometric data <b>38</b> may be obtained by applying the randomizer <b>34</b> to the distorted biometric data stored in the form of syndrome vectors <b>30</b>, such that the random sample of biometric data <b>38</b> used to generate the encryption key <b>42</b> may be a random sample of the syndrome vectors. The private key <b>40</b> may be generated by any conventional technique for generating a private key. The encryption key may be generated using a one-way function, such as a log based function, for example, Elgamal, Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The memory <b>22</b> of computing platform <b>18</b> additionally includes an encryption engine <b>44</b> in communication with processor <b>20</b> and operable to apply the encryption key <b>42</b> to encrypt data <b>46</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for identity-based encryption using a secure biometric model, according to a present aspect. At Event <b>200</b>, raw biometric data is sampled, captured, measured or otherwise acquired from a user of a computing device, which according to some aspects may be a wireless computing device. As previous noted the biometric data may include any biometric feature or characteristic associated with a user that can be characteristically sampled. Examples of biometric data include, but are not limited to, fingerprint data, voice data, facial feature data, such as eye or iris characteristics, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At Event <b>202</b>, the raw biometric data is distorted, manipulated or otherwise changed to result in a plurality of distorted biometric data, otherwise referred to as cancellable biometric data. In some aspects, distorting of the biometric data may be random distortion of the biometric data. Thus, at Event <b>204</b>, an optional randomizer, such as a random number or the like, may be applied to randomize the distortion process. Additionally, in some aspects, the distortion of the biometric data may dynamically change over time based on a pre-configuration of a distortion algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At Event <b>206</b>, the plurality of distorted biometric data is syndrome encoded to result in a plurality of corresponding syndrome vectors. Any known or future known syndrome code may be implemented to provide for generation of the syndrome codes. For example, Slepian Wolf (SW) code or Wyner-Ziv (WZ) code may be used as the syndrome code. Additionally, embedded syndrome codes may be implemented, which allow the syndrome encoder, during enrollment, to estimate an inherent variability of biometric data, and encode just enough syndrome bits to allow successful syndrome decoding. For a more detailed discussion of biometric syndrome vectors, see United States Patent Publication No. 2007/0174633, published Jul. 26, 2007, in the name of Draper et al., and entitled &#x201c;Biometric Based User Authentication and Data Encryption&#x201d;. That publication is herein incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, which will be discussed at length, infra., provide a more detailed discussion on how syndrome vectors are formed from biometric data.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At optional Event <b>208</b>, error correction is applied to at least a portion of the Syndrome Vectors to further secure the biometric data. In those aspects in which error correction is applied to the syndrome vectors, the application of error correction may be random. Thus, at Event <b>204</b>, an optional randomizer, such as a random number or the like, may be applied to the error correction process. In those aspects, in which a randomizer is applied to both the distortion of the biometric data (Event <b>202</b>) and the error correction process (Event <b>204</b>) the randomness may be synchronized so as to implement the same randomizer, for example, the same random number.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At Event <b>210</b>, the distorted biometric data in syndrome vector format, along with the private key, is communicated to another computer device. In some aspects, the communication of the distorted biometric data and the private key will occur when contact with the other computing device initially occurs. For example, based on a first time telephone call, data call or the like. The private key, which is implemented to encrypt and decrypt the data may be generated by any conventional known or future known private key generation technique.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">At Event <b>212</b>, based on the need to transmit encrypted data, an encryption key is generated based on a combination of the private key and a random sample of the distorted biometric data. As such, at Event <b>204</b>, a randomizer, such as a random number or the like, may be applied to the selection of the distorted biometric data sample to be used in generating the encryption key. In those aspects, in which a randomizer is also applied to one or more of the distortion of the biometric data (Event <b>202</b>) and the error correction process (Event <b>204</b>) the randomness may be synchronized so as to implement the same randomizer, for example, the same random number. In some aspects, a one-way function may be implemented to generate the encryption key. Examples of one-way functions include, but are not limited to, Elgamel, Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">At Event <b>214</b>, data to be transmitted is encrypted using the generated encryption key and at Event <b>216</b>, the encrypted data and the randomizer are communicated to the designated computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for syndrome and hashing based biometric security system for enrollment and authentication, according to a present aspect. The method compresses distorted biometric parameters with a syndrome code to produce a compressed syndrome vector. Unlike conventional compression, the original distorted biometric data cannot be reconstructed or approximated solely from the syndrome vector produced by the syndrome code. The syndrome vector and a hash of the original distorted biometric are stored in a biometric database.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the enrollment phase <b>300</b>, biometric data is captured, sensed, measured or otherwise acquired from the user, at Event <b>302</b>. Thereafter, at Event <b>304</b>, the biometric data is distorted, manipulated, or otherwise changed to form cancellable/distorted biometric data. At Event <b>306</b>, a syndrome encoder is applied to the distorted biometric data to produce an enrollment syndrome vector. Any type of syndrome code may used to produce the syndrome vector. For example, SW code or WZ code may be used as the syndrome code. The syndrome code can be derived from so-called &#x201c;repeat-accumulate codes&#x201d;, namely &#x201c;product-accumulate codes&#x201d; and codes known as &#x201c;extended Hamming-accumulate codes&#x201d;. In one aspect of the innovation, the syndrome encoder can operate on integer-valued inputs as opposed to binary valued inputs. Additionally, the syndrome encoder may have very high compression rates to minimize storage requirements of the biometric database. Additionally, the syndrome encoder can be rate-adaptive and be configured to operate in an incremental fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Optionally, at Event <b>308</b>, a message authentication or hash function is applied to the distorted biometric parameters to produce an enrollment hash. The hash function can be any known or future known cryptographic hash function. At Event <b>310</b>, the enrollment syndrome vector and enrollment hash pair are stored in the biometric database.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the authentication phase <b>320</b>, biometric data is again captured, sensed, measured or otherwise acquired from the user, at Event <b>322</b>. Thereafter, at Event <b>324</b>, the biometric data is distorted, manipulated or otherwise changed according to the same distortion, manipulation or change that occurred at the enrollment phase (Event <b>304</b>), resulting in authentication distorted biometric data (E&#x2032;). At Event <b>326</b>, the biometric database is searched to locate the matching enrollment syndrome vector and enrollment hash. The search can check every entry in the database or a heuristically ordered search can be used to accelerate the process of finding a match. At Event <b>328</b>, syndrome decoding is applied to the enrollment syndrome vector. Any syndrome decoder currently known or known in the future may be implemented. In some aspects, syndrome decoders that use belief propagation or turbo codes may be implemented, such decoders offer improved error resiliency with low complexity. At Event, <b>330</b>, a direct comparison can be made between the decoded enrollment distorted biometric data (E) and the authentication distorted biometric data (E&#x2032;). If the direct comparison using conventional comparison algorithms determines that the enrollment distorted biometric data is equivalent or otherwise meets a similarity threshold to the authentication distorted biometric data, at Event <b>332</b>, access is granted. If the direct comparison determines that the enrollment distorted biometric data is not equivalent or otherwise does not meet a similarity threshold to the authentication distorted biometric data, at Event <b>334</b>, access is denied.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Optionally, at Event <b>336</b>, if a direct comparison is not implemented and/or feasible, the hash function is applied to the authentication distorted biometric data to produce an authentication hash. At Event <b>338</b>, the enrollment hash stored in the biometric database is then compared to the authentication hash and if the values are determined to match or substantially match, at Event <b>332</b>, access is granted. If the comparison determines that the hash values do not match at Event <b>334</b>, access is denied. The optional use of the hash function in the authentication process provides for additional tolerance of variability from one measurement/capture of biometric data to a subsequent measurement/capture of biometric data.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram indicating dependency relationships between biometric data, distorted biometric data, full distorted feature vector, syndrome feature vector and encoded syndrome vector; according to an aspect of the innovation. A key parameter of any syndrome code is the number of bits in the syndrome vector. A syndrome vector with a large number of bits conveys more information about the biometric data and makes it easier to tolerate noise and variations in the biometric. Conversely, a syndrome vector with a smaller number of bits gives less information to an adversary if they gain possession on the syndrome vectors.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, if the length of the syndrome vector is equivalent to the length of the underlying biometric data, any amount of noise/variance could be tolerated because the original biometric data can be exactly recovered from the syndrome vector. However, an adversary that obtains the equivalent length syndrome vector can readily recover the biometric data, compromising the security of the system. In another instance, if the syndrome vector includes a small number of bits, excellent security is provided because an adversary cannot readily recover the biometric data from the syndrome vector. However, in the small bit length syndrome vector example, permissible variations between the enrollment biometric data and the authentication data are limited.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> raw biometric data, Block <b>350</b>, is depicted as an iris scan. As previously noted, the biometric data may be any biometric data related to the user of the computing device. At Block <b>352</b>, the raw biometric data is distorted to form either a plurality of distorted biometric data, each of the plurality including a segment of the full feature or, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a distorted full feature may result from the distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">At Block <b>354</b>, a distorted full feature vector is extracted from the distorted biometric data and, at Block <b>356</b>, the distorted full feature vector is reduced down to a syndrome feature vector. The syndrome feature vector captures those parts of the full feature vector that the security system developer determines to be appropriate for syndrome encoding and decoding. At Block <b>358</b>, a syndrome code is used to encode the syndrome vector from the syndrome feature vector.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At Block <b>360</b>, the encoded syndrome vector may optionally undergo error correction to further compress the data. Once the syndrome vectors are error corrected they are stored and/or transmitted to other computing devices, which rely on the syndrome encoded biometric data for decryption purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of fingerprint biometric data <b>370</b> and an extracted feature vector <b>372</b>. The extracted feature vector <b>372</b> is an example of a syndrome feature vector (Block <b>356</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The features of the fingerprint biometric data <b>370</b> are only measured in a measurement field, such as the area enclosed by observation window <b>374</b>.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Since a plane in which the fingerprint biometric data <b>370</b> is measured is quantized by a digital sensor with an array of pixels, the feature vector <b>372</b> is stored as a matrix.

The presence of a minutiae <b>376</b> is indicated by a &#x201c;1&#x201d; entry, while the lack of sensed minutiae is represented by a &#x201c;0&#x201d; entry in the matrix.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for data encryption in an identity-based cryptosystem using a secure biometric model, according to present aspects. At Event <b>400</b>, raw biometric data is received, sampled, captured, measured or otherwise acquired from a user of a computing device. As previous noted the biometric data may include any biometric feature or characteristic associated with a user that can be characteristically sampled. Examples of biometric data include, but are not limited to, fingerprint data, voice data, facial feature data, such as eye or iris characteristics, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At Event <b>410</b>, the raw biometric data is distorted, manipulated or otherwise changed to result in a plurality of distorted biometric data, otherwise referred to as cancellable biometric data. The distortion process may be implemented in software, hardware, firmware or any combination thereof. In some aspects, distorting of the biometric data may be random distortion of the biometric data. A randomizer, such as random number or the like, may be applied to randomize the distortion process. Additionally, in some aspects, the distortion of the biometric data may dynamically change over time based on a pre-configuration of a distortion algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">At Event <b>420</b>, the plurality of distorted biometric data is stored as syndrome vectors in biometric database. As previously noted, any known or future known syndrome code may be implemented to provide for generation of the syndrome codes. At optional Event <b>430</b>, error correction may be applied to at least a portion of the syndrome vectors to further secure the biometric data. In those aspects in which error correction is applied to the syndrome vectors, the application of error correction may be random. Thus, a randomizer, such as a random number or the like, may be applied to the error correction process. In those aspects, in which a randomizer is applied to both the distortion of the biometric data (Event <b>410</b>) and the error correction process (Event <b>430</b>) the randomness may be synchronized so as to implement the same randomizer, for example, the same random number.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At Event <b>440</b>, a random sample of the distorted biometric is obtained from the biometric database. Thus, a randomizer, such as a random number or the like, is applied to the selection of the sample of the distorted biometric data. In those aspects, in which a randomizer is also applied to one or more of the distortion of the biometric data (Event <b>410</b>) and the error correction process (Event <b>430</b>) the randomness may be synchronized so as to implement the same randomizer, for example, the same random number.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">At Event <b>450</b>, an encryption key is generated based on a combination of the private key and the random sample of the distorted biometric data. In some aspects, a one-way function may be implemented to generate the encryption key. Examples of one-way functions include, but are not limited to, Elgamel, Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or the like. At Event <b>460</b>, data is encrypted using the generated encryption key.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram of a method for data decryption in an identity-based cryptosystem using a secure biometric model, according to present aspects. At Event <b>500</b>, a computing device receives biometric data and a private key from another computing device. In some aspects, the computing devices may both be wireless computing devices, while in other aspects one or more of the computing devices may be wired computing devices, such as a PC or the like. The receipt of the biometric data and associated private key may be based on an initial communication with the device that sends the biometric data. The system may be configured such that the sending device recognizes that this is a first-time communication with the receiving device, for example, based on a first time call to the telephone number, IP address or the like and, in which case, automatically communicate the biometric data and the private key. Alternatively, the system may be configured, such that the receiving/decrypting device, upon receiving a communication from the other device, verifies the existence/non-existence of a biometric data entry for the other device in the biometric address book. If an entry for the other device is not verified in the biometric address book, the receiving device requests that the other device communicates the biometric data and the private key. In some aspects, the biometric data may be distorted biometric data in the form of syndrome vectors and further, the distorted biometric data may be randomly distorted biometric data. It should also be noted that the biometric data and the private key can be received in separate communications communicated at separate points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">At Event <b>510</b>, the biometric data and private key are registered in the biometric address book. Registering the biometric data and private key in the address book requires an association with the device that communicated the biometric data and private key. The association may be made via a device identifier, such as a telephone number, IP number or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">At Event <b>520</b>, encrypted data and a randomizer, such as a random number or the like, is received. Receipt of the encrypted data and randomizer may coincide with the receipt of the biometric data and private key or the receipt of the encrypted data and randomizer may be at a later point in time. At Event <b>530</b>, a random sample of the biometric data associated with the device that communicated the encrypted data is obtained. In this regard, the device identifier allows for retrieving the biometric data from the biometric address book and the randomizer provides for obtaining the random sample of the retrieved biometric data.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">At Event <b>540</b>, a decryption key is generated based on the private key and the random sample of the biometric data. In many aspects, the decryption key is generated utilizing the same one-way function implementing in encrypting the data. Thus, the one-way function may include, but are not limited to, Elgamel, Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (ECMQV), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) or the like. At Event <b>550</b>, the data is decrypted using the generated decryption key.</p>
