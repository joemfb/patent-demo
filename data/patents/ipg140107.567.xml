<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from China Patent Application 201110172980.X, filed on Jun. 24, 2011 in the China Intellectual Property Office, disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This application is related to applications entitled, &#x201c;PHASE CHANGE MEMORY CELL AND PHASE CHANGE MEMORY&#x201d;, filed Dec. 21, 2011 Ser. No. 13/332,480.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a phase change memory cell and a phase change memory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, semiconductor memory devices are categorized as random access memories (RAMs) or read-only memories (ROMs). ROMs are nonvolatile memory devices such as PROMs (programmable ROMs), EPROMs (erasable PROMs), EEPROMs (electrical EPROMs), and flash memory devices, which retain their stored data even when their power supplies are interrupted. New types of RAMs containing nonvolatile memory devices have recently been introduced. Examples includes ferroelectric RAMs (FRAMs) employing ferroelectric capacitors, magnetic RAMs (MRAMs) employing tunneling magneto-resistive (TMR) films, and phase change memories (PCM) using chalcogenide alloys. Among these, the phase change memory cannot only be widely used in civilian areas of microelectronics such as mobile phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, and mobile memory, but also has important applications in aerospace, missile systems, and military field in the future. The phase change memory devices are relatively easy to fabricate, and thus phase change memory devices may provide the best opportunities in the actual implementation of high-capacity, low cost nonvolatile RAMs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In traditional phase change memory cell, a heating element is used to heat the phase change material. During the dynamic storage, the heating element heats the phase change material to produce phase transition. However, one problem is that the heating element is made of metal or semiconductor, so it is prone to damage or oxidation during the cycle of heating process. Thus the lifespan of phase change memory cell will be affected. Furthermore, the heating element is formed by sputtering or vapor deposition, this process is complex and the production cost is relatively high.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a phase change memory cell <b>10</b> includes a substrate <b>100</b>, a carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>, a phase change layer <b>120</b>, a first electrode <b>132</b>, a second electrode <b>134</b>, a third electrode <b>136</b> and a fourth electrode <b>138</b>. The substrate <b>100</b> is used to support the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>, the phase change layer <b>120</b>, the first electrode <b>132</b>, the second electrode <b>134</b>, the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b>. The carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> and the phase change layer <b>120</b> are stacked together.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The phase change memory cell <b>10</b> includes a write circuit and a read circuit (not shown). The write circuit includes the first electrode <b>132</b>, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>, and the second electrode <b>134</b> electrically connected in series. The write circuit is used to write data into the phase change memory cell <b>10</b>. The read circuit includes the third electrode <b>136</b>, the phase change layer <b>120</b>, and the fourth electrode <b>138</b> electrically connected in series. The read circuit is used to read data from the phase change memory cell <b>10</b>. Both the write circuit and the read circuit can be used to reset the phase change memory cell <b>10</b>. At least part of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> and the phase change layer <b>120</b> overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The substrate <b>100</b> is an insulating substrate, and the material of the substrate <b>100</b> can be porcelain, glass, resin, quartz, or any combination thereof. The substrate <b>100</b> has a character of high temperature endurance, thus the shape of the substrate <b>100</b> can be retained during the working process of the phase change memory <b>10</b>. The size and the thickness of the substrate <b>100</b> can be selected according to the working temperature of the phase change memory cell <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>100</b> is flexible, and the material of the substrate <b>100</b> can be selected form polyimide, phenolic resin, polyester resin, and polyamide resin. In one embodiment, the material of the substrate <b>100</b> is polyimide with a thickness of about 20 &#x3bc;m. The shape of the substrate <b>100</b> can be retained under a temperature of 400&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The size and shape of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can be selected according to need, for example, the size and the shape can be selected according to the size and shape of the phase change memory cell <b>10</b> respectively. The shape of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can be triangular, square, rectangular, round, oval or other geometric shapes. In one embodiment, the shape of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> is rectangular. The length of the rectangle is in a range from about 50 nm to about 900 &#x3bc;m, and the width of the rectangle is in a range from about 20 nm to about 600 &#x3bc;m. In one embodiment, the length is 70 &#x3bc;m, and the width is 50 &#x3bc;m. The thickness of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> is in a range from about 0.5 nanometer (nm) to about 100 micrometers (&#x3bc;m), such as 5 nm, 20 nm, 5 &#x3bc;m, 10 &#x3bc;m, 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes. The extending direction of the carbon nanotubes is parallel with the surface of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. When the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> is located on the surface of the substrate <b>100</b>, the extending direction of the carbon nanotubes is parallel with the surface of the substrate. The carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can be a continuous film or a wire. The carbon nanotubes can be orderly or disorderly aligned. If the carbon nanotubes are disorderly aligned, the carbon nanotubes can be entangled with each other. If the carbon nanotubes are orderly aligned, the carbon nanotubes can be oriented along one or more preferred orientations. The preferred orientation means that a large majority of the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> are arranged substantially along the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> includes at least one drawn carbon nanotube film. A drawn carbon nanotube film can be drawn from a carbon nanotube array that is able to have a film drawn therefrom. The drawn carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of successive and oriented carbon nanotubes joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. The drawn carbon nanotube film is a free-standing film. Each drawn carbon nanotube film includes a plurality of successively oriented carbon nanotube segments joined end-to-end by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Each carbon nanotube segment includes a plurality of carbon nanotubes parallel to each other, and combined by van der Waals attractive force therebetween. Some variations can occur in the drawn carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotubes in the drawn carbon nanotube film are oriented along a preferred orientation. The drawn carbon nanotube film can be treated with an organic solvent to increase the mechanical strength and toughness and reduce the coefficient of friction of the drawn carbon nanotube film. A thickness of the drawn carbon nanotube film can range from about 0.5 nm to about 100 &#x3bc;m. Examples of a carbon nanotube film are taught by U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,108 to Jiang et al., and WO 2007015710 to Zhang et al.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can include at least two stacked drawn carbon nanotube films. In other embodiments, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can include two or more coplanar carbon nanotube films, and can include layers of coplanar carbon nanotube films. Additionally, when the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube film are aligned along one preferred orientation (e.g., the drawn carbon nanotube film), an angle can exist between the orientation of carbon nanotubes in adjacent films, whether stacked or adjacent. Adjacent carbon nanotube films can be combined by only the van der Waals attractive force therebetween. An angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes in two adjacent carbon nanotube films can range from about 0 degrees to about 90 degrees. When the angle between the aligned directions of the carbon nanotubes is 0 degrees, the two carbon nanotube films can be defined as oriented with the same preferred direction. When the angle between the aligned direction of the carbon nanotubes is greater than 0 degrees and smaller than 90 degrees or equal to 90 degrees, the two carbon nanotube films can be defined as entangled with each other. Stacking the carbon nanotube films will also add to the structural integrity of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can include at least a pressed carbon nanotube film. The pressed carbon nanotube film can be a free-standing carbon nanotube film. The carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film are arranged along a same direction or arranged along different directions. The carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film can rest upon each other. Adjacent carbon nanotubes are attracted to each other and combined by van der Waals attractive force. An angle between a primary alignment direction of the carbon nanotubes and a surface of the pressed carbon nanotube film is 0 degrees to approximately 15 degrees. The greater the pressure applied, the smaller the angle formed. When the carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film are arranged along different directions, the carbon nanotubes in the pressed carbon nanotube film have the same properties, such as conductivity, intensity, etc., along the direction parallel to the surface of the pressed carbon nanotube film/</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In another embodiment, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> includes a flocculated carbon nanotube film. The flocculated carbon nanotube film can include a plurality of long, curved, disordered carbon nanotubes entangled with each other. The carbon nanotubes can be substantially uniformly dispersed in the carbon nanotube film. Adjacent carbon nanotubes are acted upon by van der Waals attractive force to form an entangled structure with micropores defined therein. It is understood that the flocculated carbon nanotube film is very porous. The length of the carbon nanotubes can be greater than 10 &#x3bc;m. Furthermore, due to the carbon nanotubes in the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> being entangled with each other, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> employing the flocculated carbon nanotube film has excellent durability, and can be fashioned into desired shapes with a low risk to the integrity of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. The flocculated carbon nanotube film, in some embodiments, is free standing due to the carbon nanotubes being entangled and adhered together by van der Waals attractive force therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The phase change layer <b>120</b> can be partly overlapped with the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. The surface of the phase change layer <b>120</b> is parallel with the surface of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. Additionally, the surface of the phase change layer <b>120</b> is parallel with the extending direction of the carbon nanotubes. In one embodiment, the phase change layer <b>120</b> is stacked on the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. Furthermore, a conductive layer (not shown) can be located between the phase change layer <b>120</b> and the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> to transfer the heat produced by the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> to the phase change layer <b>120</b>. The material of the conductive layer can be selected according to need such as the Au, Ag, Cu or other conductive materials. The phase change layer <b>120</b> and the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can also be spaced in a certain interval. The distance of the interval can be arbitrary and the heat produced by the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can transfer the phase of the phase change layer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The thickness of the phase change layer <b>120</b> ranges from about 10 nm to about 200 nm. The shape of the phase change layer <b>120</b> can be triangular, square, rectangular, round, oval or other geometric shapes. The phase change layer <b>120</b> is located within the coverage area of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. It means that the area of the phase change layer <b>120</b> is smaller than that of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>, and the entire phase change layer <b>120</b> is located within the surface of carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the shape of the phase change layer <b>120</b> is round with a diameter in a range from about 20 nm to about 250 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The material of the phase change layer <b>120</b> can be germanium-antimony-tellurium (Ge&#x2014;Sb&#x2014;Te, also referred as &#x201c;GST&#x201d;), germanium-tellurium, silicon-antimony-tellurium, silicon-tellurium, or chalcogenide alloys. The phase change layer <b>120</b> functions as a variable resistor (i.e., resistance being variable with heat). The phase change material is conditioned in one of two stable states, i.e., a crystalline state or an amorphous state. The phase change material can change phase between the crystalline state and the amorphous state, based on the heat produced by the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the material of the phase change layer <b>120</b> is GST, and the original state of the material is amorphous state with a relatively high resistance. The amorphous state will be transferred into crystalline state with a relatively low resistance over a crystallization temperature (Tc) in a range from about 200&#xb0; C. to about 300&#xb0; C., and the crystalline state will be transferred into amorphous state in a melting temperature (Tm) in a range from about 400&#xb0; C. to about 500&#xb0; C. The melting temperature is also the reset temperature of the phase change materials.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The terms &#x201c;crystalline&#x201d; and &#x201c;amorphous&#x201d; are relative terms in the context of phase change materials. That is, when a phase change memory cell <b>10</b> is said to be in its crystalline state, one skilled in the art will understand that the phase change material of the cell has a more well-ordered crystalline structure when compared to its amorphous state. A phase change memory cell <b>10</b> in its crystalline state need not be fully crystalline, and a phase change memory cell <b>10</b> in its amorphous state need not be fully amorphous. The resistance of the phase change materials in its crystalline state is smaller than that in its amorphous state.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The material of the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> can be made of conductive material such as conductive pastes, metal or ITO. The thickness of the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> can range from about 10 nm to about 100 &#x3bc;m respectively. In one embodiment, the thickness of the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> ranges from about 20 nm to about 50 nm respectively. The material of the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> is made of conductive pastes, which includes powdered metal, powdered glass with a low fusion point, and binder. The powdered metal is powdered silver. The binder is terpineol or ethyl cellulose. A weight percentage of the powdered metal is in a range from about 50% to about 90%. A weight percentage of the powdered glass with the low fusion point is in a range from about 2% to about 10%. A weight percentage of the binder is in a range from about 8% to about 40%. The first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> are made by printing the conductive pastes onto part surface of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The shape, size and the position of the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> are arbitrary. While applying a voltage between the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b>, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> can produce heat to heat the phase change layer <b>120</b> to a temperature higher than the crystallization temperature (Tc) or melting temperature of the phase change temperature (Tm). In one embodiment, the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> are located on two opposite side of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. The first electrode <b>132</b> is electrically connected with a first side of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. The second electrode <b>134</b> is electrically connected with a second side of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>. Thus the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> are electrically connected with the entire carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> respectively. Furthermore, the first electrode <b>132</b> can be in contact with each carbon nanotube on the first side of the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b>, the second electrode <b>134</b> can be in contact with each carbon nanotube on the second side of the carbon nanotube layer. Thus the current flowing in the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> is uniformly dispersed, and the heat efficiency will be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b> are electrically connected with the phase change layer <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b> partly cover the surface of the phase change layer <b>120</b>. The phase change layer <b>120</b> can be located between the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> and both of the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b>. By applying a voltage on the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b>, a current will be introduced into the phase change layer <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the fourth electrode <b>138</b> can be omitted. It means that a voltage can be either applied between the third electrode <b>136</b> and the first electrode <b>132</b>, or the third electrode <b>136</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b> in order to introduce a current into the phase change layer <b>120</b>. Thus the third electrode <b>136</b>, the phase change layer <b>120</b> and the first electrode <b>132</b> (or the second electrode <b>134</b>) are electrically connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The shape and size of the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b> are arbitrary and can be selected according to need. The material of the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b> are the same as the first electrode <b>132</b>. In one embodiment, the material of the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b> are conductive pastes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The working process of the phase change memory cell <b>10</b> includes three stages: writing data, reading data and resetting data. The original state of the phase change layer <b>120</b> is amorphous state with high resistance and presents data &#x201c;0&#x201d;. The amorphous state is usually referred to as a reset state. The crystalline state with low resistance presents data &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During the process of writing data, a voltage is applied between the first electrode <b>132</b> and the second electrode <b>134</b>, the carbon nanotube layer <b>110</b> will produce heat to heat the phase change layer <b>120</b>. While the temperature of the phase change material (GST) is heated to be higher than the Tc, the phase change material will turn to crystalline state with low resistance. Thus, the process of writing data is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, when the voltage is removed, the phase change material is settled in the crystalline state when it is slowly quenched after being heated within a temperature window that higher than the Tc and low than the Tm during a time.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">During the process of reading data, a relatively small voltage is applied between the third electrode <b>136</b> and the fourth electrode <b>138</b>. The current flowing in the phase change layer <b>120</b> is so small that it cannot cause the phase transition. By measuring the feedback current, the resistance of the phase change layer <b>120</b> can be obtained. The data can be read out by comparing the obtained resistance with the original resistance of the phase change layer <b>120</b>. If the obtained resistance is smaller than the original resistance of the phase change layer <b>120</b>, a data &#x201c;1&#x201d; is obtained. If the obtained resistance is substantially equal to the original resistance, a data &#x201c;0&#x201d; is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During the process of resetting data, the phase change layer <b>120</b> is rapidly quenched after being heated over its melting point by supplied current. The state of the phase change material will be transferred into the amorphous state. The amorphous state is usually referred as a reset state, storing data &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Thus the data of the phase change memory cell <b>10</b> is reset. The resistance in the memory cell is relatively high in the amorphous state, and relatively low in the crystalline state.</p>
