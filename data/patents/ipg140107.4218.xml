The chip card ejecting mechanism <b>60</b> is configured to mount a chip card (not shown) in the housing <b>10</b>. The housing <b>10</b> includes a sidewall <b>11</b>, and defines an opening <b>12</b> through the sidewall <b>11</b>. The chip card ejecting mechanism <b>60</b> ejects the chip card out of the housing <b>10</b> through the opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the chip card ejecting mechanism <b>60</b> includes a support <b>13</b>, a hinge carrier <b>40</b>, a hinge <b>50</b>, a spring <b>53</b>, a tray <b>26</b> and a cover <b>24</b>. The support <b>13</b> is retained in the housing <b>10</b> and aligned with the opening <b>12</b>. The hinge carrier <b>40</b> is retained in the housing <b>10</b> between the sidewall <b>11</b> and the support <b>13</b>. The hinge <b>50</b> is rotatably retained on the hinge carrier <b>40</b>. The spring <b>53</b> is retained between the hinge <b>50</b> and the hinge carrier <b>40</b> to provide an elastic force which drives the hinge <b>50</b> to rotate relative to the hinge carrier <b>40</b>, thereby making the hinge <b>50</b> latch with the cover <b>24</b>, as detailed below. The tray <b>26</b> is slidably mounted to the support <b>13</b>. The cover <b>24</b> is retained (e.g., hot-melted) to the tray <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>7</b>, the support <b>13</b> defines a compartment <b>132</b> for accommodating the tray <b>26</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the hinge carrier <b>40</b> is a curved plate, shaped to fit flush to the housing <b>10</b> so that the hinge carrier <b>40</b> as fitted is cosmetically pleasing. The hinge carrier <b>40</b> defines a passage <b>411</b> aligned with the opening <b>12</b> and the compartment <b>132</b>. The passage <b>411</b> allows the cover <b>24</b> and the tray <b>26</b> to pass through the hinge carrier <b>40</b>. The hinge carrier <b>40</b> further defines two shaft holes <b>413</b>, one at each side of the passage <b>411</b>. The shaft holes <b>413</b> are used to rotatably retain the hinge <b>50</b>. The hinge carrier <b>40</b> further includes a biasing plate <b>43</b> protruding into the passage <b>411</b>. The biasing plate <b>43</b> resists the cover <b>24</b> when the cover <b>24</b> is accommodated in and covers the opening <b>12</b>. The hinge carrier <b>40</b> may further defines a securing groove <b>412</b> for holding one end of the spring <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> and <b>7</b>, the hinge <b>50</b> includes a shaft <b>51</b>, a resisting block <b>54</b>, two latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, and an elongating block <b>57</b>. The two ends of the shaft <b>51</b> are respectively and rotatably accommodated in the shaft holes <b>413</b> so the hinge <b>50</b> is retained to the hinge carrier <b>40</b>. The resisting block <b>54</b> protrudes from the center portion of the shaft <b>51</b>, and resists the biasing plate <b>43</b> when the hinge <b>50</b> is retained to the hinge carrier <b>40</b>. When the hinge <b>50</b> rotates, the resisting block <b>54</b> biases the biasing plate <b>43</b> toward the opening <b>12</b>. Each of the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> is near an end of the shaft <b>51</b>. The latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> latch with the cover <b>24</b> to hold the cover <b>24</b> in the opening <b>12</b>. The elongating block <b>57</b> protrudes from the latching block <b>55</b>, and is spaced from the shaft <b>51</b> to define a curving gap <b>572</b> between the elongating block <b>57</b> and the shaft <b>51</b>, the gap <b>572</b> is to accommodate a torsion spring. The elongating block <b>57</b> defines a retaining groove <b>573</b> opposite to the gap <b>572</b> for retaining the other end of the spring <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, in this exemplary embodiment, the spring <b>53</b> is a coil torsion spring, and includes a first end <b>531</b> and a second end <b>532</b>. When the spring <b>53</b> is mounted to the shaft <b>51</b> and located in the gap <b>572</b>, the first end <b>531</b> is latched in the securing groove <b>412</b>, and the second end <b>532</b> is latched in the retaining groove <b>573</b>. The spring <b>53</b> provides a constant force tending to rotate the hinge <b>50</b> so the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> are seeking the opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the center portion of the cover <b>24</b> defines a notch <b>245</b>, in which the biasing plate <b>43</b> is located when the cover <b>24</b> is accommodated in, and covers, the opening <b>12</b>. The cover <b>24</b> further includes two hooks <b>243</b>, one at each side of the notch <b>245</b>. Each hook <b>243</b> latches one of the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> to hold the cover <b>24</b> in the opening <b>12</b>. The cover <b>24</b> further defines an orifice <b>2411</b> corresponding the elongating block <b>57</b>. A tool, i.e., a pin <b>22</b>, is used to operate the chip card ejecting mechanism <b>60</b>. The pin <b>22</b> can be inserted into the orifice <b>2411</b> to push the elongating block <b>57</b> of the hinge <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the pin <b>22</b> is pushed, the shaft <b>51</b> is rotated until the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> are released from the hooks <b>243</b>. The tray <b>26</b> is retained to the button <b>24</b> between the hooks <b>243</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, the portable electronic device <b>100</b> may further include a detecting assembly <b>15</b> for determining the open or closed state of the tray <b>26</b>. The detecting assembly <b>15</b> includes an elastic plate <b>152</b> and a contact <b>151</b> electrically connected to the circuit board <b>70</b> of the portable electronic device <b>100</b>. The elastic plate <b>152</b> is located at an end of the support <b>13</b> opposite the opening <b>12</b>. When the tray <b>26</b> is accommodated in the compartment <b>132</b>, the tray <b>26</b> pushes the elastic plate <b>152</b> to close the contact <b>151</b> and render it conductive, at this time, the circuit board <b>70</b> generates a first signal to signify that the tray <b>26</b> is accommodated in the compartment <b>132</b>. When the tray <b>26</b> moves out of the compartment <b>132</b>, the elastic plate <b>152</b> is released and the contact <b>151</b> no longer conducts, and the circuit board <b>70</b> then generates a second signal to indicate that the tray <b>26</b> is out.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, in assembly of the device, the spring <b>53</b> is mounted to the shaft <b>51</b> with the second end <b>532</b> retained in the retaining groove <b>573</b>. The two ends of the shaft <b>51</b> are accommodated in the shaft holes <b>413</b> with the resisting block <b>54</b> resisting the biasing plate <b>43</b>, and the first end <b>531</b> latched in the securing groove <b>412</b>. The hinge carrier <b>40</b> is retained to the housing <b>10</b>, and the passage <b>411</b> is aligned with the opening <b>12</b>. The tray <b>26</b> may be retained (e.g., hot-melted) to the cover <b>24</b>. The tray <b>26</b> passes through the opening <b>12</b> and the passage <b>411</b> until the tray <b>26</b> is fully accommodated in the compartment <b>132</b>. At this stage, the hooks <b>243</b> latch with the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> to hold the cover <b>24</b> in the opening <b>12</b>, and the biasing plate <b>43</b> is located in the notch <b>245</b>. In this way, the chip card ejecting mechanism <b>60</b> is assembled to the housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, in everyday use, and against spring pressure, the pin <b>22</b> is inserted into the orifice <b>2411</b> (or pushed further into the orifice <b>2411</b>) to drive the elongating block <b>57</b> and the shaft <b>51</b> to rotate until the hooks <b>243</b> are released from the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>. The spring <b>53</b> is thus further compressed. As the shaft <b>51</b> is rotated, the resisting block <b>54</b> biases the biasing plate <b>43</b> toward the opening <b>12</b>, which drives the cover <b>24</b> to partially move out of the opening <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), thereby facilitating the exposure of the cover <b>24</b> and the tray <b>26</b> out of the opening <b>12</b>. After that, the release of the pin <b>22</b> allows the spring <b>53</b> to reverse and clear the elongating block <b>57</b> and the shaft <b>51</b>. Then, the cover <b>24</b> and the tray <b>26</b> may very easily be pulled out of the opening <b>12</b> by human fingers. The chip card is put on the tray <b>26</b>. The cover <b>24</b> is pushed in, the tray <b>26</b> passes through the opening <b>12</b> and the passage <b>411</b> until the tray <b>26</b> is fully accommodated in the compartment <b>132</b>, the hooks <b>243</b> latch with the latching blocks <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> and the biasing plate <b>43</b> is once again located in the notch <b>245</b>.</p>
