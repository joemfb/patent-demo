<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following describes an apparatus for and method of controlling an electronic device including detecting a first touch at a first location on a touch-sensitive display; detecting a second touch at a second location on the touch-sensitive display; and displaying a navigation indicator on the touch-sensitive display in response to detecting the second touch while first touch contact is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For simplicity and clarity of illustration, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. Numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the embodiments described herein. The embodiments may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail to avoid obscuring the embodiments described. The description is not to be considered as limited to the scope of the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The disclosure generally relates to an electronic device, which is a portable electronic device in the embodiments described herein. Examples of portable electronic devices include mobile, or handheld, wireless communication devices such as pagers, cellular phones, cellular smart-phones, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants, wirelessly enabled notebook computers, and so forth. The portable electronic device may also be a portable electronic device without wireless communication capabilities, such as a handheld electronic game device, digital photograph album, digital camera, or other device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A block diagram of an example of a portable electronic device <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The portable electronic device <b>100</b> includes multiple components, such as a processor <b>102</b> that controls the overall operation of the portable electronic device <b>100</b>. Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem <b>104</b>. Data received by the portable electronic device <b>100</b> is decompressed and decrypted by a decoder <b>106</b>. The communication subsystem <b>104</b> receives messages from and sends messages to a wireless network <b>150</b>. The wireless network <b>150</b> may be any type of wireless network, including, but not limited to, data wireless networks, voice wireless networks, and networks that support both voice and data communications. A power source <b>142</b>, such as one or more rechargeable batteries or a port to an external power supply, powers the portable electronic device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The processor <b>102</b> interacts with other components, such as Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>108</b>, memory <b>110</b>, a display <b>112</b> with a touch-sensitive overlay <b>114</b> operably connected to an electronic controller <b>116</b> that together comprise a touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, an auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>124</b>, a data port <b>126</b>, a speaker <b>128</b>, a microphone <b>130</b>, short-range communications <b>132</b>, and other device subsystems <b>134</b>. The processor <b>102</b> may optionally interact with one or more actuators (not shown) to provide tactile feedback and one or more force sensors (not shown) to detect a force imparted on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. Interaction with a graphical user interface is performed through the touch-sensitive overlay <b>114</b>. The processor <b>102</b> interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay <b>114</b> via the electronic controller <b>116</b>. Information, such as text, characters, symbols, images, icons, and other items that may be displayed or rendered on a portable electronic device, is displayed on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> via the processor <b>102</b>. The processor <b>102</b> may interact with an orientation sensor such as an accelerometer <b>136</b> that may be utilized to detect direction of gravitational forces or gravity-induced reaction forces.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To identify a subscriber for network access, the portable electronic device <b>100</b> uses a Subscriber Identity Module or a Removable User Identity Module (SIM/RUIM) card <b>138</b> for communication with a network, such as the wireless network <b>150</b>. Alternatively, user identification information may be programmed into memory <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The portable electronic device <b>100</b> includes an operating system <b>146</b> and software programs or components <b>148</b> that are executed by the processor <b>102</b> and are typically stored in a persistent, updatable store such as the memory <b>110</b>. Additional applications or programs may be loaded onto the portable electronic device <b>100</b> through the wireless network <b>150</b>, the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>124</b>, the data port <b>126</b>, the short-range communications subsystem <b>132</b>, or any other suitable subsystem <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A received signal such as a text message, an e-mail message, or web page download is processed by the communication subsystem <b>104</b> and input to the processor <b>102</b>. The processor <b>102</b> processes the received signal for output to the display <b>112</b> and/or to the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>124</b>. A subscriber may generate data items, for example e-mail messages, which may be transmitted over the wireless network <b>150</b> through the communication subsystem <b>104</b>. For voice communications, the overall operation of the portable electronic device <b>100</b> is similar. The speaker <b>128</b> outputs audible information converted from electrical signals, and the microphone <b>130</b> converts audible information into electrical signals for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> may be any suitable touch-sensitive display, such as a capacitive, resistive, infrared, surface acoustic wave (SAW) touch-sensitive display, strain gauge, optical imaging, dispersive signal technology, acoustic pulse recognition, and so forth, as known in the art. A capacitive touch-sensitive display may include a capacitive touch-sensitive overlay <b>114</b>. The overlay <b>114</b> may be an assembly of multiple layers in a stack including, for example, a substrate, a ground shield layer, a barrier layer, one or more capacitive touch sensor layers separated by a substrate or other barrier, and a cover. The capacitive touch sensor layers may be any suitable material, such as patterned indium tin oxide (ITO).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One or more touches, also known as touch contacts or touch events, may be detected by the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. The processor <b>102</b> may determine attributes of the touch, including a location of a touch. Touch location data may include an area of contact or a single point of contact, such as a point at or near a center of the area of contact. The location of a detected touch may include x and y components, e.g., horizontal and vertical components, respectively, with respect to one's view of the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. For example, the x location component may be determined by a signal generated from one touch sensor, and the y location component may be determined by a signal generated from another touch sensor. A signal is provided to the controller <b>116</b> in response to detection of a touch. A touch may be detected from any suitable object, such as a finger, thumb, appendage, or other items, for example, a stylus, pen, or other pointer, depending on the nature of the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. Multiple simultaneous touches may be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> is also configured to detect a gesture. A gesture, such as a swipe, is a type of touch, that begins at an origin point and continues to a finishing point while touch contact is maintained. A swipe may be long or short in distance, or duration, or both distance and duration. Two points of the swipe may be utilized to determine a vector that describes a direction of the swipe. The direction may be referenced with respect to the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, the orientation of the information displayed on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, or another reference. For the purposes of providing a reference, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; as utilized herein is substantially left-to-right or right-to-left relative to the orientation of the displayed information, and &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; as utilized herein is substantially upward or downward relative to the orientation of the displayed information. The origin point and the finishing point of the swipe may be utilized to determine the magnitude or distance of the swipe. The duration of the swipe may be determined from the origin point and finishing point of the swipe in time. The processor <b>102</b> receives data from the controller <b>116</b> to determine the direction, magnitude, and duration of the swipe. The gesture may be tracked and a plurality of sub-vectors determined for each gesture. The final sub-vector may be utilized to determine a distance and duration of a final portion of the gesture. The processor <b>102</b> receives data from the controller <b>116</b> to determine the speed of the swipe based on the distance and duration of the final portion of the gesture.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a method of controlling a portable electronic device <b>100</b>. The method may be carried out by software executed by, for example, the processor <b>102</b>. Coding of software for carrying out such a method is within the scope of a person of ordinary skill in the art given the present description. The method may contain additional or fewer processes than shown and described, and may be performed in a different order. Computer-readable code executable by, for example, the processor <b>102</b> of the portable electronic device <b>100</b> to perform the method, may be stored in a computer-readable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method is carried out on a portable electronic device <b>100</b> having a touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> that receives touch input. The touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> may display icons that are selectable to launch applications, to navigate through folders and to modify device settings, for example. The touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> may further display re-sizable graphical elements, such as windows for displaying text and/or images associated with a software application. The touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> does not continuously display a navigation indicator, such as a pointer or a cursor, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is directed to displaying a navigation indicator on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> of the portable electronic device <b>100</b> and includes detecting <b>200</b> a first touch at a first location on a touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, detecting <b>202</b> a second touch at a second location on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, and displaying <b>204</b> a navigation indicator on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> in response to detecting the second touch while first touch contact is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When displayed, the navigation indicator is spaced from the first touch and the second touch. Therefore, a view of selectable graphical elements on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> is not blocked by objects touching the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, such as a user's fingers, for example, at the navigation indicator location. In one embodiment, the navigation indicator is displayed between the first touch location and the second touch location on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> facilitates fine navigation, which is useful on a touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> including many different user-selectable graphical elements that are spaced close together.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Continued reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to describe one example of a method for controlling a portable electronic device <b>100</b>. In the present example, a user touches the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> with two fingers, as shown. The processor <b>102</b> detects <b>200</b> a first touch at a first location and detects <b>202</b> a second touch at a second location. Navigation indicator <b>300</b> is then displayed <b>204</b> in response to detection <b>202</b> of the second touch while the first touch is maintained. The navigation indicator <b>300</b> is depicted as an arrow, however, the navigation indicator <b>300</b> may be any shape.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the navigation indicator <b>300</b> is displayed, different methods for moving the navigation indicator <b>300</b> on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> and making a selection are possible. One example method is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The method may be carried out by software executed by, for example, the processor <b>102</b>. Coding of software for carrying out such a method is within the scope of a person of ordinary skill in the art given the present description. The method may contain additional or fewer processes than shown and described, and may be performed in a different order. Computer-readable code executable by, for example, the processor <b>102</b> of the portable electronic device <b>100</b> to perform the method, may be stored in a computer-readable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When a first touch is detected <b>400</b> at a first location on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, the processor <b>102</b> awaits detection <b>402</b> of a second touch. If no second touch is detected <b>402</b> within a threshold time period following detection <b>400</b> of the first touch, the processor <b>102</b> performs a function that is associated with the first touch <b>404</b>. The function may be any function that is available via touch selection on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> of the portable electronic device <b>100</b>. The function may include, for example, launching an application, opening a folder, activating a window, and minimizing, maximizing or closing an active window.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the second touch is detected <b>402</b> within the time period at a second location on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, a navigation indicator <b>300</b> is displayed <b>406</b> on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The threshold time period between the first touch and the second touch may be short in order to maintain responsiveness of the portable electronic device <b>100</b> to user selection. The time period may be zero seconds, when the first and second touches are detected at substantially the same time, or the time period may be between zero seconds and 0.25 seconds. Other time periods are possible. In general, the time period is selected to reduce a time lag between a single touch and the processor <b>102</b> performing the associated function while allowing sufficient time for detection of a two-finger touch.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when both the first and second touches end <b>408</b>, the processor <b>102</b> awaits detection of a third touch on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. If the first and second touches continue, the navigation indicator moves <b>410</b> in response to movement of one or both touches. If the touches remain generally stationary, the navigation indicator maintains its position on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. When one of the first touch and second touch ends and the other is maintained, the processor <b>102</b> waits for the other touch to end. In one embodiment, after waiting for a threshold time period, the method may revert to having detected <b>400</b> a first touch and continue the method at <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the third touch is detected <b>412</b>, the processor <b>102</b> determines if the third touch is located in a touch area that is associated with the navigation indicator <b>414</b>. If the third touch is in the touch area, the processor <b>102</b> performs a function that is associated with the navigation indicator location <b>418</b> and the navigation indicator is no longer displayed on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. If the third touch is not within the touch area, the navigation indicator is no longer displayed <b>416</b> and the method continues at <b>400</b>. In one embodiment, if the third touch is not detected <b>412</b> within a threshold time period, the navigation indicator is no longer displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The touch area is associated with the navigation indicator and may be generally centered at the navigation indicator. A touch is in the touch area when the entire contact area between the object touching the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> and the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> is in the touch area or when a portion of the contact area is in the touch area and a portion of the contact area is outside of the touch area. The size of the touch area may be determined for a particular device by considering the size of the display, the pixel density and the target demographic. In one embodiment, the size of the touch area is customizable by the user through a device setting option.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The touch area may be a circle, however, other shapes are possible including oval, square and triangular, for example. The shape of the touch area may further be different depending on where on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b> the navigation indicator is located. For example, if the navigation indicator is near an edge of the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, the touch area may be semi-circular in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Continued reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 7</figref> to describe another example of a method for controlling a portable electronic device <b>100</b>. In the present example, first and second touches are detected <b>400</b>, <b>402</b> by the processor <b>102</b> and the navigation indicator <b>300</b> is displayed <b>404</b>. Navigation indicator <b>300</b> then moves <b>410</b> in response to movement of the touches, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Once the navigation indicator <b>300</b> has moved to a desired location, both the first and second touches end <b>408</b> and a third touch is detected <b>412</b>. If the third touch is located in a touch area <b>600</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the processor <b>102</b> performs a function that is associated with the navigation indicator location <b>418</b>. If the third touch is not located in the touch area <b>600</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the navigation indicator <b>300</b> is no longer displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Continued reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref> to describe another example of a method of controlling the portable electronic device <b>100</b>. In this example, a window <b>800</b>, icons <b>802</b>, which are user-selectable to launch applications, including browser, calendar, e-mail and text messaging applications, a clock <b>804</b> and a battery level icon <b>806</b>, are displayed on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. At the top right corner of the window <b>800</b>, user-selectable window control icons include: minimize window <b>808</b>, maximize window <b>810</b> and close window <b>812</b>. As shown, the window control icons are small relative to a typical user's finger size and closely spaced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">First and second touches are detected <b>400</b>, <b>402</b> by the processor <b>102</b> and the navigation indicator <b>300</b> is displayed <b>406</b> on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the navigation indicator <b>300</b> moves <b>410</b> in response to movement of one or both touches. In the present example, the navigation indicator <b>300</b> moves to a location where the navigation indicator <b>300</b> overlaps the minimize window icon <b>808</b> on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>. Once the navigation indicator <b>300</b> has been located on an icon or other selectable element on the touch-sensitive display <b>118</b>, both touches end and a third touch is detected <b>412</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the third touch is detected within touch area <b>600</b>, the function that is associated with the navigation indicator location is performed <b>418</b>. In this example, the function performed is minimizing the window <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, fine navigation is useful for targeting small areas on a display, specific characters within text or pixels on a display. An advantage of using a navigation indicator to facilitate fine navigation is that the objects touching the touch-sensitive display, such as the user's fingers, for example, are spaced from the navigation indicator location during navigation. Therefore, the user's view of the user-selectable graphical elements on the touch-sensitive display is not blocked while the navigation indicator is moved to a desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an aspect of the disclosure there is provided a method for displaying a navigation indicator on the touch-sensitive display of a portable electronic device, the method including detecting a first touch at a first location on a touch-sensitive display, detecting a second touch at a second location on the touch-sensitive display, and displaying the navigation indicator on the touch-sensitive display in response to detecting the second touch while first touch contact is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another aspect of the disclosure there is provided a portable electronic device including a touch-sensitive display configured to display information and a processor connected to the touch-sensitive display. The processor is configured to detect a first touch at a first location on the touch-sensitive display, detect a second touch at a second location on the touch-sensitive display, and display a navigation indicator in a graphical user interface in response to detection of the second touch while first touch contact is maintained.</p>
