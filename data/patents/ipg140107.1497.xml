<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to plastic fasteners used for retention of objects including air shields to body panels of an automobile vehicle, where subsequent removal of the fastener and object is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Releasable fasteners are known that provide for deflection of two or more legs of a fastener toward each other to reduce a diameter of the legs to an aperture diameter of an object secured by the fastener. Known releasable fasteners commonly require the head or flange of the fastener to be contacted and/or rotated to displace and release the fastener, which can damage the flange and/or the object being secured. Many known releasable fasteners also require a force or pressure from a tool to be directed in an installation direction of the fastener and therefore toward the retained object to rotate the fastener for release. This additional force applied in the direction of the object can also damage the object or the aperture through which the fastener is installed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to several aspects, a grommet includes a tubular body having a bore coaxially aligned with a body longitudinal central axis. Multiple legs extend from the tubular body. A service tab assembly is positioned in the central bore. The service tab assembly includes: multiple tab extensions, each integrally connected to only one of the legs; and a pull tab in a non-extended position located entirely in the bore, and connected only to each of the tab extensions. The pull tab when displaced in a release direction acts through the tab extensions to inwardly deflect each of the legs toward the longitudinal central axis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to further aspects, a grommet includes a tubular body having a through-bore coaxially aligned with a body longitudinal central axis. A first flange integrally connected to the body is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal central axis. The through-bore extends also through the first flange. Multiple legs extend integrally from the body at a body free end oppositely positioned with respect to the flange. The legs are deflectable toward a body longitudinal axis. A service tab assembly is positioned in the through-bore. The service tab assembly includes: multiple tab extensions, each integrally connected to only one of the legs; and a pull tab positioned entirely in the through-bore in a non-extended position, and connected only to each of the tab extensions. The pull tab when displaced in a release direction acts through the tab extensions to equally inwardly displace each of the legs toward the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to still further aspects, a grommet assembly includes a grommet including: a tubular body having a bore coaxially aligned with a body longitudinal central axis; a flange integrally connected to the body, the bore extending also through the flange; multiple legs extending integrally from the tubular body; and a service tab assembly positioned entirely in the central bore in a non-extended condition. The service tab assembly includes: multiple tab extensions, each integrally connected to only one of the legs; and a pull tab connected only to each of the tab extensions. A vehicle component has an aperture. The tubular body is slidingly received in the aperture until the flange contacts the vehicle component. A vehicle body panel has a panel aperture. The legs extend through the panel aperture. The pull tab when displaced in a release direction acts through the tab extensions to equally inwardly displace each of the legs toward the longitudinal axis such that the legs are slidable through the panel aperture to release the grommet.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a grommet <b>10</b> includes a tubular body <b>12</b> extending perpendicularly from a first or body flange <b>14</b> having a surface area larger than a cross sectional area of the tubular body <b>12</b>. Although tubular body <b>12</b> may according to several aspects be circular in cross section, tubular body <b>12</b> may also have an oval, rectangular, triangular or other geometric shape in cross section, with a substantially hollow interior cavity. The tubular body <b>12</b> at a free end has multiple deflectable legs <b>16</b> with successive ones of the deflectable legs <b>16</b> separated by an elongated slot <b>18</b> that permit the legs <b>16</b> to elastically deflect towards each other such that a portion of successive ones of the legs <b>16</b> can deflect inwardly into one of the elongated slots <b>18</b> from the normal non-deflected positions shown. Each elongated slot <b>18</b> can include an open end <b>18</b><i>a </i>which is wider than a closed end <b>18</b><i>b</i>, to provide for maximum bending of the deflectable legs <b>16</b> at the free ends of the deflectable legs <b>16</b>. According to one aspect three legs <b>16</b> are provided, however, two, or more than three legs <b>16</b> can also be provided. A second or locating flange <b>20</b> is integrally connected to and extends outwardly from each of the legs <b>16</b>. A service tab assembly <b>22</b> is provided for removal of an installed grommet <b>10</b> which will be described later herein. Service tab assembly <b>22</b> is positioned within a hollow through-bore of tubular body <b>12</b> and is integrally connected only to the legs <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, grommet <b>10</b> having a circular cross section for tubular body <b>12</b> is shown in a completed installation position which is provided by insertion in an installation direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;. Grommet <b>10</b> can be subsequently removed by application of a force acting in a release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;, thereby inducing no force in the installation direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;. For the circular cross section aspect, first tubular body portion <b>24</b> of body <b>12</b> has a first diameter (diameter &#x201c;C&#x201d; shown in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The body flange <b>14</b> contacts a face <b>25</b> of a vehicle component <b>26</b> such as an air shield, shown with the first tubular body portion <b>24</b> received in an aperture <b>27</b> of the vehicle component <b>26</b>. It will be apparent that the geometry of aperture <b>27</b> can be modified to match the cross sectional geometry of tubular body <b>12</b>. A separate washer <b>28</b> which is not integrally connected to grommet <b>10</b> is received from an opposite side of vehicle component <b>26</b> and engages a second flange <b>30</b> having a diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) smaller than diameter &#x201c;C&#x201d;. Second flange <b>30</b> is integrally connected to and extends outwardly from tubular body portion <b>24</b>, and acts in conjunction with washer <b>28</b> to retain grommet <b>10</b> in the installed position with respect to the vehicle component <b>26</b>. Body <b>12</b> also integrally includes a second tubular body portion <b>32</b> having legs <b>16</b> integrally extending therefrom. Second tubular body portion <b>32</b> has a diameter &#x201c;G&#x201d; (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) smaller than diameter &#x201c;C&#x201d; of first tubular body portion <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A conical shaped or angled engagement face <b>34</b> is provided on an outwardly bulging portion <b>36</b> of each of the legs <b>16</b> that during installation of grommet <b>10</b> assist in inwardly deflecting legs <b>16</b> during insertion into an aperture <b>52</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of a vehicle body panel <b>38</b>. Grommet <b>10</b>, having vehicle component <b>26</b> and washer <b>28</b> already connected, is then installed by inserting legs <b>16</b> into the aperture <b>52</b> of vehicle body panel <b>38</b> in the installation direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; by forcing legs <b>16</b> to elastically inwardly deflect toward each other such that bulging portions <b>36</b> slidingly fit through aperture <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the grommet installed position, after legs <b>16</b> extend through aperture <b>52</b> created in the body panel <b>38</b>, a contact face <b>37</b> of each bulging portion <b>36</b> directly contacts a first side or face <b>39</b> of the body panel <b>38</b>, and the legs <b>16</b> elastically outwardly rebound substantially to their original non-deflected positions shown. The contact faces <b>37</b> thereafter act to resist removal or displacement of grommet <b>10</b> in release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;. A pull tab <b>40</b> (not clearly visible in this view) is positioned in a hollow bore <b>42</b> which can be a through-bore, shown more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, of first tubular body portion <b>24</b> proximate to the body flange <b>14</b>. The locating flange <b>20</b> of each of the legs <b>16</b> extends toward and can directly contact a second face <b>41</b> of body panel <b>38</b> which is oppositely facing with respect to body panel first face <b>39</b>. The locating flanges <b>20</b> in combination with engagement faces <b>34</b> prevent grommet <b>10</b> from sliding in either the installation direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; or release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; after installation of grommet <b>10</b>, thereby minimizing vibration of the vehicle component <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, grommet <b>10</b> is intended to permit its subsequent removal together with vehicle component <b>26</b> and washer <b>28</b> from the installed position with respect to body panel <b>38</b>. To accomplish removal, the pull tab <b>40</b> which is located in bore <b>42</b> proximate to flange <b>14</b> can be grasped using a tool such as a pair of pliers for example, and pulled in the release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;, opposite to installation direction &#x201c;A&#x201d;. Grommet <b>10</b> is designed to be installed and removed multiple times. Pull tab <b>40</b> is integrally connected by individual tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> only to individual ones of the legs <b>16</b>, such that no portion of service tab assembly <b>22</b> including pull tab <b>40</b> and/or tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> contacts flange <b>14</b> or either first or second tubular body portions <b>24</b>, <b>32</b> in any position of the service tab assembly. By pulling on pull tab <b>40</b> in the release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> cause the legs <b>16</b> to displace toward each other by moving into the space provided by elongated slots <b>18</b>, thereby allowing the bulging portion <b>36</b> of each of the legs <b>16</b> to clear aperture <b>52</b> of body panel <b>38</b>. Pull tab <b>40</b> is integrally connected to a column shaped member <b>49</b> which in turn is integrally connected to each of the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. In the normal or recessed position of pull tab <b>40</b>, substantially no portion of pull tab <b>40</b> extends outwardly of flange <b>14</b>, such that in the installed position of grommet <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, flange <b>14</b> provides a finished appearance, and pull tab <b>40</b> cannot be deflected or grasped from outside a space envelope of flange <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, diameter &#x201c;C&#x201d; of first tubular body portion <b>24</b> extends from flange <b>14</b> diametrically outward beyond second flange <b>30</b>. Diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; of second flange <b>30</b> is larger than diameter &#x201c;C&#x201d; such that second flange <b>30</b> extends diametrically/circumferentially outward beyond first tubular body portion <b>24</b>. Each of the locating flanges <b>20</b> is integrally connected to second tubular body portion <b>32</b>, extends toward the bulging portion <b>36</b> of each leg <b>16</b>, and according to several aspects is oriented at an obtuse angle &#x3b1; with respect to second tubular body portion <b>32</b>. Each of the bulging portions <b>36</b> extends outwardly with respect to second tubular body portion <b>32</b>. The bulging portion <b>36</b> of each leg <b>16</b> begins at a distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; from flange <b>14</b> which is predetermined to provide clearance for deflection of the locating flanges <b>20</b> to reach the installed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as well as to provide for a length &#x201c;F&#x201d; of the elongated slots <b>18</b>, defined as the overall length of the bulging portions <b>36</b> plus approximately 50% to 70% of a length of second tubular body portion <b>32</b>. Length &#x201c;F&#x201d; is predetermined to provide for deflection of legs <b>16</b> sufficient to slidingly pass into or out of aperture <b>52</b> during installation and removal of grommet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, diameter &#x201c;G&#x201d; of second tubular body portion <b>32</b> is continuous between first tubular body portion <b>24</b> and the bulging portions <b>36</b>. Each of the bulging portions <b>36</b> includes a curved portion <b>50</b>, and in a non-deflected position of legs <b>16</b>, the curved portions <b>50</b> of all of the legs <b>16</b> together define a maximum diameter &#x201c;H&#x201d; which is greater than a diameter of the aperture <b>52</b> created in body panel <b>38</b>. Each of the first and second tubular body portions <b>24</b>, <b>32</b> and the legs <b>16</b> are spaced with respect to and commonly share a longitudinal central axis <b>47</b> of tubular body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, service tab assembly <b>22</b> as previously noted is created by integrally connecting pull tab <b>40</b> to member <b>49</b> and to each of the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, having the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> integrally connected to individual legs <b>16</b> axially past (in the installation direction &#x201c;A&#x201d; moving away from flange <b>14</b>) and interior of the curved portion <b>50</b> of bulging portions <b>36</b>. Successive ones of tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are separated by an angle &#x3b2; which is approximately 120 degrees when three tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are used, but can vary depending on the quantity of tab extensions and legs <b>16</b>. Column shaped member <b>49</b> is coaxially located with respect to the longitudinal central axis <b>47</b> of tubular body <b>12</b> so that pull tab <b>40</b> when pulled parallel to the longitudinal central axis of tubular body <b>12</b> provides substantially equal force to each of the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the installed position, grommet <b>10</b> retains vehicle component <b>26</b> with respect to vehicle body panel <b>38</b> by spreading a retaining load using flange <b>14</b> to vehicle component <b>26</b>. In the installed position, the service tab assembly <b>22</b> is accessible from the vehicle component <b>26</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, in the installed position vehicle component <b>26</b> is held in position by engagement of washer <b>28</b> with second flange <b>30</b>. In lieu of a square or flat face for each contact face <b>37</b>, each bulging portion <b>36</b> can have a tapered or angled contact face <b>54</b> extending conically outward from second tubular body portion <b>32</b> to each curved portion <b>50</b>, to reduce friction during removal of legs <b>16</b> past a corner <b>56</b> defined by aperture <b>52</b>. Use of angled contact face <b>54</b> may also be beneficial in further reducing friction during removal of grommet <b>10</b> as a thickness &#x201c;K&#x201d; of vehicle body panel <b>38</b> increases. The diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; of second flange <b>30</b> and the maximum diameter &#x201c;H&#x201d; defined by bulging portions <b>36</b> in the non-deflected position of legs <b>16</b> are each less than a diameter &#x201c;L&#x201d; of aperture <b>27</b> of vehicle component <b>26</b>, to provide clearance for installation of grommet <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, in the installed position of grommet <b>10</b>, each locating flange <b>20</b> can elastically deflect when in contact with second face <b>41</b> of vehicle body panel <b>38</b> to provide a biasing force acting in a force direction &#x201c;M&#x201d; that holds grommet <b>10</b> in contact against vehicle body panel <b>38</b>. When pull tab <b>40</b> is manually pulled in the release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;, the displacement of pull tab <b>40</b> acts to displace each of the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> (only tab extension <b>44</b> is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in an inward direction &#x201c;N&#x201d; toward the longitudinal central axis <b>47</b> of body <b>12</b>, which displaces the curved portion <b>50</b> of each of the bulging portions <b>36</b> away from direct engagement with an inner wall <b>58</b> of aperture <b>52</b>. Because the components of service tab assembly <b>22</b> are connected only to the legs <b>16</b>, all of a force applied to pull tab <b>40</b> acts through the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and therefore acts only with respect to legs <b>16</b>. This minimizes the force required to release legs <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is also noted that due to the positioning of the components of service tab assembly <b>22</b> entirely within bore <b>42</b>, having no direct connection to flange <b>14</b> or first or second tubular body portions <b>24</b>, <b>32</b>, no force is directly applied to and no displacement of flange <b>14</b> is required to move legs <b>16</b> for release from their engaged positions with body panel <b>38</b>. Flange <b>14</b> and vehicle component <b>26</b> are not directly contacted during use of the tool for removal of grommet <b>10</b>, therefore flange <b>14</b> and vehicle component <b>26</b> are not physically marred or damaged during removal of grommet <b>10</b>. In addition, the force acting only in release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; during removal of grommet <b>10</b> does not result in axial rotation or bending of grommet <b>10</b>. Removal of grommet <b>10</b> therefore does not include application of force to either body panel <b>38</b> or vehicle component <b>26</b> which could damage body panel <b>38</b> or its aperture <b>52</b>, or the vehicle component <b>26</b> or its aperture <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>-<b>6</b> and <b>9</b>, one of the legs <b>16</b> of grommet <b>10</b> is shown during the initial stage of removal. The remaining legs are similarly actuated. A force &#x201c;P&#x201d; applied to pull tab <b>40</b> parallel to the release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; displaces pull tab <b>40</b> in the release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d;, thereby moving a free end <b>60</b> of pull tab <b>40</b> outside of the bore <b>42</b> and above a plane defined by an outer facing surface <b>62</b> of flange <b>14</b>. By positioning column shaped member <b>49</b> substantially in coaxial alignment with longitudinal central axis <b>47</b> during injection molding of grommet <b>10</b>, force &#x201c;P&#x201d; is equally divided into each of the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to provide equal inward bending for each of the legs <b>16</b>. By the integral connection of pull tab <b>40</b> to the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> (only tab extension <b>44</b> is shown for clarity) at a connection location <b>66</b>, force &#x201c;P&#x201d; induces bending of both leg <b>16</b> and second tubular body portion <b>32</b> of body <b>12</b>, primarily occurring proximate to a junction <b>64</b> between the first and second tubular body portions <b>24</b>, <b>32</b>. The tab extension <b>44</b> (similar to tab extensions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>) is integrally connected at connection location <b>66</b> to leg <b>16</b> proximate to a free end <b>68</b> of leg <b>16</b> to maximize the bending moment at junction <b>64</b>. As leg <b>16</b> elastically deflects in the inward direction &#x201c;N&#x201d; toward longitudinal central axis <b>47</b>, the locating flange <b>20</b> releases from the second face <b>41</b> of body panel <b>38</b>, and returns to its non-deflected condition shown. Curved portion <b>50</b> moves toward the longitudinal central axis <b>47</b>, thereby providing sliding clearance between the inner wall <b>58</b> of aperture <b>52</b> and the curved portion <b>50</b> such that leg <b>16</b> can be subsequently further pulled in the release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; to remove tubular body <b>12</b> from aperture <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a pre-installation or as-molded condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, grommets <b>10</b> of the present disclosure include flange <b>14</b> having tubular body <b>12</b> integrally connected to the flange <b>14</b>. The tubular body <b>12</b> has a central hollow bore <b>42</b> such as a through-bore. The tubular body <b>12</b> and the bore <b>42</b> are coaxially aligned with a longitudinal central axis <b>47</b> of the tubular body <b>12</b>. Multiple legs <b>16</b> are created in the tubular body <b>12</b> with successive ones of the legs <b>16</b> separated by an elongated slot <b>18</b> permitting each of the legs <b>16</b> to inwardly deflect from a non-deflected position toward the longitudinal central axis <b>47</b>. A service tab assembly <b>22</b> in the initial or non-deflected condition can be positioned entirely in the bore <b>42</b>. The service tab assembly <b>22</b> includes multiple tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, each integrally connected to only one of the legs <b>16</b>. A pull tab <b>40</b> is positioned entirely in the bore <b>42</b> in a non-extended position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>), and is connected only to each of the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. The pull tab <b>40</b> when displaced in a release direction &#x201c;B&#x201d; acts through the tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to inwardly displace each of the legs <b>16</b> toward the longitudinal central axis <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Grommets <b>10</b> of the present disclosure offer several advantages. By positioning service tab assembly <b>22</b> in an inner bore of the grommet, the service tab assembly <b>22</b> when pulled in a release direction acts to contract deflectable legs <b>16</b> of the grommet to permit the legs <b>16</b> to be pulled free of body panel aperture <b>52</b>, thereby providing for removal of the grommet. A locating flange <b>20</b> extending from each leg <b>16</b> prevents movement of the grommet from causing vibration of a component held in place by the grommet, such as vehicle component <b>26</b>. A service tab assembly has a pull tab positioned in the grommet inner bore that is itself connected using individual tab extensions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to inner walls of each of the legs <b>16</b> convert displacement of the pull tab <b>40</b> into inward deflection of each of the legs for removal. Grommet <b>10</b> includes all of the features identified allowing for its removal, with the exception of the separate washer <b>28</b>, all integrally included in a single molded plastic part.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The grommet is inserted into an aperture of the air shield and held onto the air shield by a separate plastic washer positioned on an opposite side of the air shield. The air shield with grommets <b>10</b> attached is then shipped for installation to a vehicle assembly plant where the air shield is held in place on the vehicle using several of the grommets and then followed up with additional metal fasteners to fix the air shield in place.</p>
