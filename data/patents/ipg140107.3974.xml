<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mobile electronic devices and home display electronics become thinner, the thickness of a display panel and the height of a side wall of a bottom chassis also decrease. However, in this case, the strength of the bottom chassis is weakened so that the chassis may bend when external impact is applied thereto. Accordingly, the display panel or the backlight unit placed in the bottom chassis may be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to enhance the mechanical strength of the bottom chassis, the height of the side wall or the thickness of the bottom portion and the thickness of the side wall need to be increased. However, such an increase is incompatible with the goal of a thin profile of the display device, and therefore a method for enhancing the mechanical strength of the bottom chassis without increasing the height of the side wall or the thickness of the bottom portion and the thickness of the side wall is desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. As those skilled in the art would realize, the described embodiments may be modified in various different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a display device according to a first embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing an assembled state of the display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, taken along the line I-I. The display device of the first embodiment is formed as a liquid crystal display (LCD).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a display device <b>100</b> includes a liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>, a backlight unit <b>20</b>, a mold frame <b>30</b>, and a bottom chassis <b>40</b>. The backlight unit <b>20</b> provides light to the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>, and the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> displays an image by controlling a light transmission amount for each pixel. The mold frame <b>30</b> and the bottom chassis <b>40</b> form a receiving module <b>50</b>, and receive and support the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> and the backlight unit <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> includes a thin film transistor substrate <b>11</b>, a color filter substrate <b>12</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>13</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) injected between the two substrates <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, a polarizing plate (not shown) is disposed at an outer side of the thin film transistor substrate <b>11</b> and the color filter substrate <b>12</b>, and a flexible circuit board <b>14</b> is fixed to one end of the thin film transistor substrate <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a flexible circuit board <b>14</b> is bent to the rear side of the bottom chassis <b>40</b> and connected with a panel driver (not shown) formed of a printed circuit board where a driving circuit is mounted. Thus, the flexible circuit board <b>14</b> transmits a video signal and a driving voltage generated from the panel driver to the thin film transistor substrate <b>11</b>. All types of disclosed liquid display panels may be used as the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The backlight unit <b>20</b> includes a light source unit <b>21</b>, a light guide unit <b>22</b>, and a reflection film <b>23</b>, and is disposed at a lower portion of the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>. The light source unit <b>21</b> is formed of a printed circuit film <b>24</b> and at least one light emitting diode <b>25</b> mounted on the printed circuit film <b>24</b>. The light source unit <b>21</b> may include a cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL), that is, a linear light source, instead of the light emitting diode <b>25</b>, that is, a dot light source.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The light guide unit <b>22</b> includes a light guiding plate <b>26</b> and at least one optical sheet <b>27</b>. The light guiding plate <b>26</b> is disposed at one side of the light source unit <b>21</b>, and receives light emitted from the light source unit <b>21</b> and substantially uniformly transmits the light to the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The optical sheet <b>27</b> is disposed between the light guiding plate <b>26</b> and the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b>. The optical sheet <b>27</b> may include a diffusion sheet and a prism sheet. The diffusion sheet diffuses light supplied from the light guiding plate <b>26</b> and enhances straightness of the light diffused by the diffusion sheet. The reflection film <b>23</b> is disposed at a lower portion of the light guiding plate <b>26</b>, and reflects light provided from the light guiding plate <b>26</b> upward.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mold frame <b>30</b> is formed in the shape of a rectangle having an opening at a center thereof, and the backlight unit <b>20</b> is disposed in the mold frame <b>30</b>. Thus, the mold frame <b>30</b> supports the backlight unit <b>20</b> by surrounding sides thereof.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Before bending the base side wall <b>43</b> from the bottom portion <b>41</b>, the end portions of the connection portions <b>45</b> may be bent to make the connection portions <b>45</b> and the reinforcing side wall <b>44</b> overlap with the base side wall <b>43</b>, and then the base side wall <b>43</b> may be bent about 90 degrees from the bottom portion <b>41</b>.</p>

Thus, the liquid crystal display panel <b>10</b> is disposed in substantially parallel with the single-layered upper portion of the base side wall <b>43</b>.
