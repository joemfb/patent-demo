<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national stage of International Application No. PCT/EP2009/050186, filed on Jan. 8, 2009, and claims the benefit thereof. The international application claims the benefits of German Application No. 10 2008 003 647.1 filed on Jan. 9, 2008; all applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a floating foundation supporting framework for offshore structures for positioning functional units in a floating position. Such floating foundation supporting frameworks may hold and support off-shore wind power plants, light towers, transmitter and/or receiver plants, radar plants, bridges, jetties, landing strips or the like, near a coast-line or also at a greater distance from a coast-line.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Floating foundations have been known, for example, for light towers or also for wind power plants. Regarding this, reference is made to DE 10 2005 036 679.1, which relates to anchorages of floating foundations on the ocean floor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Large plants such as medium-performance and high-performance wind power plants frequently have considerable weight that needs to be compensated by appropriate floating bodies. These must generate buoyancy forces that must far exceed the weight of the structure to be supported as well as that of the floating foundation in order to thus hold the affected structure still, irrespective of wave action and wind influence. To accomplish this, the necessary buoyancy forces may add up to several thousand tons. Frequently, floating foundations must necessarily span a relatively large area. The buoyancy forces applied to individual points by the buoyancy elements must be safely absorbed and tolerated by the building structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to the requirements regarding the stability of the foundation under load, there are requirements regarding the manufacturing options and costs affecting an appropriate building construction in practical applications. For example, the logistics as well as the construction efforts, material expenses and, finally also maintenance expenses, should be kept within limits. Until now, floating foundation structures have displayed deficits regarding at least one of the mentioned aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Considering this, it is the object of the invention to provide a floating foundation supporting framework that has been improved with regard to at least one of the mentioned aspects when compared with known building structures.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A floating foundation having a supporting framework in accordance with an aspect of the invention achieves this object.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The supporting framework comprises buoyancy elements, at least one of which is at least partially made of concrete, and connecting elements, which are made of steel and which form a supporting framework. By making the buoyancy elements at least partially of concrete, it is possible to considerably lower the manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This applies, in particular, to geometrically complex shapes such as, for example, the junction regions that must be designed to be hollow in order to make walking on the structure possible. This also applies to buoyancy elements that are located at the outer ends of a supporting framework that is star-shaped, for example, in order to introduce buoyancy forces into the supporting framework at that location. In particular, the lower parts or bottoms of buoyancy elements may be made of concrete. Due to the rigidity of reinforced concrete elements, such elements may have a flat bottom or a bottom that is only slightly arched, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The use of concrete for the manufacture of a floating foundation supporting framework minimizes the use of steel and thus reduces corrosion problems and prime costs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the floating foundation supporting framework comprises several cantilevers that extend horizontally when in use, as well as junction points (joints) from which extend inclined and horizontal pipe segments. The supporting framework is comprised of a load-transferring spatial trussed structure, preferably configured as prefabricated steel structures and, e.g., as hollow elements generating buoyancy forces in the junction regions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These structures preferably have the form of reinforced concrete components and are made of, for example, water-impermeable concrete. The junction regions are preferably designed so as to be hollow and patent in order to ensure that it is possible to walk on the cantilever regions. Preferably, the supporting framework is designed in such a manner that the buoyancy forces and the load-transfer in the junction points (joints) of the pipe segments are uncoupled in the entire cantilever region and in the connecting region of the buoyancy elements, said buoyancy elements preferably being arranged on the extreme outside, and are associated with the specific supporting framework elements, respectively. As a result of this, clear load conditions are established and undesirable double loads or overloads are prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The supporting framework in accordance with the invention is erected in mixed construction with the use of steel and concrete, preferably water-impermeable concrete. The framework is designed in part as a shell supporting framework and in part as a supporting bar framework. For example, the shell supporting framework comprises pipe segments made of steel or also of reinforced concrete components that are designed, for example, as junction points (joints). The supporting bar framework comprises trussed structure sections, for example, made of steel piping or other steel profiles. The supporting bar framework is connected to the shell supporting framework, so that the shell supporting framework and the supporting bar framework, together, form the foundation supporting framework.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The overall supporting behavior is defined, in the junction points (joints) of the supporting framework and in the cantilevers, by the trussed construction. The buoyancy forces due to locally applied loads occur at the junctions and on the cantilevers due to reinforced concrete components or, in the cantilever regions, also due to pipe segments.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the outlying buoyancy elements are upright cylinders whose lower cup is configured as a circular cylindrical shell. A steel shell structure is set on said circular cylindrical shell, said steel shell structure preferably being manufactured as a prefabricated cup-shaped circular cylindrical shell that is open in downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">At the junction points (joints), the reinforced concrete components are connected to the steel structures. To do so, preferably, water-impermeable, corrosion-resistant assembly techniques are employed. Steel pipes or steel socket ends can be fitted to hollow concrete elements by means of elastomer elements or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The design of the supporting framework in mixed construction comprising shell supporting frameworks and supporting bar frameworks allows a high degree of variability regarding the requirements for the inert mass distribution in the total system. In addition, it is possible to adapt the system requirements to wind power plants designed for six megawatts and above. In addition, the modules of the system such as, for example, the components of the trussed structure and the components of the shell supporting structure may be prefabricated. The plant may be erected in the dry dock or also on site. For example, assembled system modules may undergo final assembly in the dry dock, whereupon the foundation supporting framework is towed to the installation site. As a result of the prefabrication of the modules, it is only necessary to perform the final assembly in the dry dock. This minimizes the required dwell time in the dry dock and thus permits the efficient production of a larger number of floating supporting frameworks.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the load introduction of the lower guy occurs in trussed construction. Preferably, this is at the ends of the cantilevers without any load being applied to the buoyancy elements. Consequently, the supporting framework absorbs the forces of the guy as well as the forces of the buoyancy elements. However, it is also possible to impart the pulling forces of the guy as well as the force of the weight of the structure, respectively, as pressure (completely) into the concrete cups (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With the foundation supporting framework presented herein, it is possible to erect&#x2014;in a cost-neutral manner&#x2014;building structures in depths of up to one thousand meters, irrespective of the depth of the water.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system in accordance with the invention enables an optimal adaptation of the system mass distribution over variably designed ballast elements, preferably by arranging additional masses in the form of prefabricated components of reinforced concrete. These components may be arranged, as needed, at various locations of the entire trussed structure of the cantilevers. Such masses may also be disposed to increase mass inertia, avoid vibrations, attenuate vibrations, reduce vibrations and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optimally, the total buoyancy force may be adapted to various requirements by additionally providing variably designed buoyancy components, preferably in the form of spherical hollow bodies, in the entire region of the trussed structure of the cantilevers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wind power plant <b>1</b> that has been erected in the ocean and that comprises a mast <b>2</b> seated on a floating foundation <b>3</b>. The floating foundation <b>3</b> comprises a floating foundation supporting framework <b>4</b> that is held on ballast elements <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. The latter are seated on the ocean floor and are made of concrete. They are connected to the foundation supporting framework <b>4</b> by means of cables <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> that are made of corrosion-resistant or corrosion-protected steel. The weight of the ballast elements <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> is high enough so as to by far exceed the forces produced by the foundation supporting framework <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foundation supporting framework <b>4</b> is a mixed steel and concrete structure. This structure comprises several cantilevers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> that extend radially outward from a central spatial trussed structure <b>14</b>, for example in the form of a tetrahedron. Considering several aspects, the foundation supporting framework <b>14</b> is designed in mixed construction. The framework is designed, in part, as a shell supporting framework and in part as a supporting bar framework. In addition, the framework includes steel elements as well as concrete elements. The spatial trussed structure <b>14</b> comprises pipe segments <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> that form the sides of a tetrahedron and are connected to each other at strut attachment fittings <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>24</b>. The relatively large diameter of the pipe segments <b>15</b> through <b>20</b> makes it possible that each pipe may be viewed as a shell supporting framework. The strut attachment fittings <b>21</b> through <b>24</b> are hollow and lead to additional pipe segments <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> that preferably extend approximately horizontally and radially away from the center of the foundation supporting framework <b>4</b> in outward direction toward the buoyancy elements <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>. Preferably, the strut attachment fittings <b>21</b> through <b>24</b> are made of reinforced concrete, however, they may also be made of steel piping. In particular, this applies to the strut attachment fitting <b>21</b>. The fittings are connected to the respectively adjacent pipe segments <b>15</b> through <b>20</b> and <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> by means of salt-water-resistant, corrosion-resistant and tight junctions. The strut attachment fittings <b>21</b> through <b>24</b> are largely load-free. However, their presence contributes to the total buoyancy of the building structure. They are surrounded by a cage-like bar framework. This is evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and from the example of the strut attachment fitting <b>21</b>, in particular, also from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such a cage <b>31</b> forms a spatial bar framework that connects ring-shaped, load-distributing hollow box girders <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> with each other, whereby appropriate pipe segments <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> or also the mast <b>2</b> may be connected to said girders. The ring-shaped hollow box girder <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> may have a circular or a rectangular cross-section and ground plan. Due to the rectangular shape of the girder, the attachment of the spatial trussed structure of the cantilever is simple from a technological viewpoint and is more favorable from a statics viewpoint. The rods forming the cage <b>31</b> may be solid profiles, pipe profiles, L-profiles, T-profiles or other suitable profiles. Preferably, the cage <b>31</b> is a welded construction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a hollow box girder using the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> as the example. The bar framework <b>35</b> adjoins the (rectangular-) ring-shaped box profile <b>17</b><i>a</i>, said profile adjoining the pipe segment <b>17</b>. In addition, the (rectangular-) ring-shaped box profile <b>17</b><i>a </i>may be fitted to a socket end <b>17</b><i>b </i>in which the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> may be placed while creating a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows a modified embodiment of the connection with the use of the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> as the example. A short metal pipe piece <b>17</b><i>b </i>is provided between the box profile <b>17</b><i>a </i>and the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b>. The metal pipe piece may be attached, on one side or on both sides, to the box profile <b>17</b><i>a </i>and to the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> by means of pliable flanges <b>17</b><i>c</i>. Preferably, the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> has an internal permanent formwork <b>24</b><i>a </i>made of sheet metal, e.g., steel sheeting, said formwork lining the concrete element of the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b>. The formwork <b>24</b><i>a </i>may extend up to the front end of the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> and be welded there to the flanges <b>17</b><i>d </i>or directly to the socket end <b>17</b><i>b</i>, or be attached there in another manner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, each of the cantilevers <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> is configured as a spatial supporting bar framework. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and, by referring to the example of the cantilever <b>12</b>, also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As can be seen, the bar framework <b>35</b> of the cantilever <b>12</b> can circumscribe the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> and thus reduce the load applied thereto. The bar framework <b>35</b> thus creates the cage enclosing the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b>; the fitting is made of reinforced concrete. Again, hollow box girders or other flanges are provided for the attachment of the pipe segments <b>17</b>, <b>29</b> <b>26</b>. Again, the seal between the strut attachment fitting <b>24</b> and the pipe segments <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>26</b> is water-tight and corrosion-resistant, e.g., due to elastomer elements, compression seals or the like. The occurring loads, in particular bending-torsion loads and the like, are absorbed by the bar framework <b>35</b> and transferred by said bar framework to the load-bearing pipe segments <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, the pipe segment <b>26</b> is arranged in a non-load-bearing manner in the cage formed by the bar framework <b>35</b>. If necessary, the pipe segment may also be designed as a concrete pipe, plastic pipe or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, the bar framework <b>35</b> forms a spatial trussed structure having a rectangular cross-section. Unlike the depiction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bar framework may also continue to extend through the interior space of the spatial trussed structure <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 9</figref> show the attachment of the buoyancy element <b>29</b> to the cantilever <b>12</b>, this standing for each of the other radially outwardly located buoyancy elements <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. As can be seen, the buoyancy element <b>2</b> <b>9</b> forms a vertically upright cylinder with a curved or rounded upper side <b>36</b> and an essentially flat bottom <b>37</b>. Preferably, said buoyancy element is comprised of two parts. Preferably, its lower part <b>38</b> is comprised of a cup-shaped cylindrical section of reinforced concrete, as is obvious from the sectional view in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> or <b>9</b>. However, it may have a flat or, as shown, also a slightly conical or otherwise arched bottom. Furthermore, the buoyancy element <b>29</b> comprises an upper part <b>39</b> that may be, e.g., a steel structure. As is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper part <b>39</b> and the lower part <b>38</b> are connected to each other in a sealed manner. For example, they abut against a seal <b>40</b> that is seated on the upper annular flat sealing surface of the lower part <b>38</b>. They may be screwed together to create a connection. Preferably, however, the part <b>38</b> is provided on its inside with a permanent formwork, e.g., of steel, that may extend flange-like over the upper front side of the part <b>38</b>. This formwork may be welded to the part <b>39</b>. In this case, the seal <b>40</b> is unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The buoyancy element <b>29</b> is hollow and may be walkable. The pipe segment <b>26</b> may be connected to the concrete element <b>38</b> by means of a connecting piece <b>41</b>. Walls, cross-walls or the like may be provided on the connecting piece <b>41</b> and/or in or on the pipe segment <b>26</b>, in which case said walls can be locked if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The buoyancy element <b>29</b> is anchored to the cantilever <b>12</b> by means of connecting means. Preferably, these means are arranged on the upper region of part <b>38</b> in order to transmit the upthrust buoyancy force acting on part <b>38</b> as pressure force to the cantilever <b>12</b>. Attachment means may be steps provided on the concrete element, anchors set therein, steel plates and the like, these being connected to the cantilever <b>12</b>. Preferably the steps, as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, are directed upward and abut upward against the corbels <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b </i>of the bar framework <b>35</b>. Below part <b>38</b>, the bar framework <b>35</b> may have one or more supports <b>35</b><i>c</i>, on which the concrete cup <b>38</b> may be temporarily set during assembly in the dry dock. Lateral supports <b>49</b><i>a, b </i>transmit lateral forces from the bar framework <b>35</b> to the buoyancy element <b>29</b> and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, the cantilever <b>12</b> has connecting arrangements <b>42</b> for the cable <b>10</b>. The connecting arrangement <b>42</b> imparts the pulling force of the cable <b>10</b> into the cantilever <b>12</b>. To do so, individual struts <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> are provided. The struts extend downward from the cantilever <b>12</b> and connect the cantilever to the cable <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is also possible to provide a leveling arrangement that is, e.g., hydraulically actuated. The arrangement holds a vertically adjustable bar <b>45</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. While an appropriate, e.g., hydraulic adjustment arrangement is arranged in the interior space of the buoyancy element <b>29</b> and is in contact with one end of the bar <b>45</b>, its other end may be connected to the cable <b>10</b>. On the bottom of part <b>38</b>, an appropriate passage may be provided, said passage enabling a rod <b>45</b> to pass, sealing the bar permanently relative to the passage. Also, active leveling of the floating foundation <b>3</b> can be accomplished with the hydraulic adjustment arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, the leveling arrangement may also be arranged at another location such as, for example, below part <b>38</b>, as is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. For example, it is possible to provide, e.g., a chamber <b>47</b> made of steel, next to or, as illustrated, under part <b>38</b> on the cantilever <b>12</b>, whereby the hydraulic adjustment arrangement <b>48</b> is located in said chamber. The bar <b>45</b> connected to the cable <b>10</b> may extend from said adjustment arrangement. It may be possible for the chamber <b>47</b> to be walkable over an appropriately dimensioned pipe <b>49</b>, the pipe having a diameter of one to two meters and, for example, being connected to the pipe segment <b>26</b> or the connecting piece <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show a preferred embodiment of the foundation supporting framework. The chamber <b>47</b> forms a machine room in the form of, e.g., a prone cylinder having rounded end sides. The chamber <b>47</b> is arranged under the buoyancy element <b>29</b> and connected to the bar framework <b>35</b>. The wall of the cylinder is stiffened, e.g., with several annular box profile girders <b>50</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>. The girders are arranged on the inside and/or on the outside, or so as to extend through the wall, on the chamber <b>47</b>. Inside the chamber <b>47</b> is a winch <b>54</b> accommodating at least one, preferably two, cable sheaves <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>. They may be seated on a common shaft <b>57</b> that is rotatably supported in two or move bearing blocks <b>58</b>, <b>59</b>. Preferably, the bearing blocks <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> are supported on a vertical-adjustment arrangement, for example in the form of hydraulic cylinders <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> that enable a height adjustment of the bearing blocks <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> and thus an adjustment of the cable sheaves <b>55</b>,<b>56</b>. Cables <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>move from the cable sheaves <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> to a common heavy-weight foundation. They may also move to different heavy-weight foundations. At appropriate seals <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>, the cables <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>pass through the wall of the chamber <b>47</b>. Among each other, the cables <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>may be connected by a support <b>64</b> that ensures a parallel run of the cable sections between the cable sheaves <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> and the support <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As indicated only by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the cable sheaves <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> may be separated from the remaining interior space of the chamber <b>47</b> by dividing walls <b>65</b>, <b>66</b>. Preferably, the entire chamber <b>47</b> is dry. Should water penetrate up to the cable sheaves <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, the dividing walls <b>65</b>, <b>66</b> prevent the chamber <b>47</b> from being flooded.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A cross-section of the machine room is shown separately in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As is obvious, the winch <b>54</b> comprising an electric motor, hydraulic motor or the like as the drive is supported by or attached to the chamber <b>47</b> via a torque bracket <b>67</b>. The torque bracket may be pivotally supported on the wall of the chamber <b>47</b>. The winch <b>54</b> comprises a not specifically shown arrangement for braking and locking the shaft <b>57</b> in the desired rotational positions. The hydraulic cylinders <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> are disposed to vertically adjust the bearing blocks <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> in order to enable a vertical fine adjustment of the supporting framework for counterbalancing any forces occurring during operation of the structure. As can be seen, it is also possible to pivotally support the hydraulic cylinders <b>60</b>, <b>61</b>&#x2014;just like the torque bracket <b>67</b>&#x2014;on the chamber <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a schematic plan view of the foundation supporting framework. Apart from this three-star form, almost any other forms of the supporting framework are possible, as has been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. However, a plurality of ballast elements <b>68</b> and/or buoyancy elements <b>69</b> may be arranged on the periphery as well as in other sections of the supporting framework. The supporting framework may be constructed of simple components in that prefabricated concrete components are used, in particular, as strut attachment fittings and as buoyancy elements. As is obvious, the foundation supporting framework may be pyramidal and may comprise, for example, an inclined supporting structure formed by three hollow cylinders and comprise a triangular supporting framework base made of three hollow cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, the supporting frame base may have any desired and, in particular, also rectangular form, and be, e.g., square. In accordance with one modification of the invention, extending from the lower corner points of the supporting framework base, three cantilevers with a reciprocal opening angle in horizontal projection of 120 degrees may be provided. Apart from that, any desired number of cantilevers with any desired orientation may be used in the ground plan. In particular, the cantilevers may also be positioned so as to form a right angle with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dimensions of the floating body comprising several buoyancy elements is not a function of the supporting framework components. The design of the supporting framework components is a function of the load distribution pattern. In order to achieve a suitable distribution of mass, it is possible to adapt the system's mass distribution over variably configurable ballast elements, preferably by providing additional mass in the form of prefabricated reinforced concrete parts at suitable locations of the trussed framework structure. The cantilever comprises steel profiles and is attached at the junction points (joints) of the spatial trussed frameworks that connect the horizontal and inclined pipe segments with each other. The spatial trussed frameworks may form cages that circumscribe the junction points (joints). The attachment of the spatial trussed frameworks to the pipe segments is accomplished via a load-distribution (round or rectangular) ring-shaped hollow box girder. In order to achieve the statically required total buoyancy force, it is possible to additionally provide buoyancy components displaying variable design, preferably having the shape of spherical hollow bodies, in the entire region of the trussed structures of the cantilevers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, the completely prefabricated foundation supporting structure with the wind power plant set on top in horizontal floating position is taken to its location of use and then connected on-site with the anchoring elements. The winches <b>54</b> are used to lower the floating supporting structure, said winches being blocked at a desired immersion depth, e.g., with the use of brakes. A continuous fine adjustment of the floating position may be carried out with the hydraulic cylinders. With the use of the invention, it is possible to achieve a load transfer through diagonal supports preferably having the form of pipe segments of steel and spatial trussed structures of steel, while buoyancy is preferably ensured by buoyancy elements that are located far outside.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Hereinafter is a list of individual features and aspects that may be of importance in conjunction with the invention. The floating foundation supporting framework is intended, in particular, for offshore constructions for positioning functional units in floating position on or in water, in particular on or in the ocean, and is suitable for depths up to 1000 (one thousand) meters. The floating foundation framework comprises several buoyancy elements that are connected to each other by supporting structures, preferably prefabricated steel and concrete structures, and optionally comprises ballast elements, and acts as a foundation or as a platform for a functional unit. By means of pulling elements, the foundation supporting framework is connected to anchoring elements set on the ocean floor in the manner of concrete construction. The horizontal cantilevers support the buoyancy elements and&#x2014;like the connecting junctions of inclined or horizontal pipe segments&#x2014;are comprised of load-transferring steel structures, whereby buoyancy-generating hollow elements in the form of prefabricated reinforced concrete components of water-impermeable concrete are arranged in the junction regions. The hollow elements ensure the walkability of the cantilever regions.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The &#x201c;buoyancy&#x201d; and &#x201c;load-transfer&#x201d; functions are uncoupled from each other at the connecting junctions of the pipe segments in the entire cantilever region and in the connecting region of the buoyancy elements that are located far outside, and are respectively associated with specific supporting foundation elements. Construction includes mixed construction using steel and high-performance concrete. Preferably, the structure is a combination of shell supporting frameworks of materials such as high-performance concrete and/or steel, prefabricated reinforced concrete parts and/or pipe segments and supporting bar frameworks of steel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The total supporting behavior is characterized by the trussed framework construction in the junctions and in the cantilever region, and the local load introduction of the buoyancy forces in the junctions and in the cantilever region.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The local load introduction of the buoyancy forces occurs in the junctions due to the prefabricated reinforced concrete parts. In the cantilever region, the load introduction may also occur by pipe segments. The buoyancy elements are manufactured, in mixed construction, as prefabricated reinforced concrete parts&#x2014;preferably as a shell having the form of a circular cylinder with a lower bottom plate and steel shell construction&#x2014;preferably as a prefabricated shell having the form of a circular cylinder. The interfaces between the concrete construction and the steel construction are formed in the connecting junctions and in the connecting regions of the buoyancy elements. The interfaces are designed as a water-impermeable, corrosion-resistant transition construction, e.g. in the form of a steel construction. A high degree of variability is achieved regarding the inert mass distribution requirements for the total system. It is possible to adapt the system requirements of wind energy plants up to 6 megawatts. Due to the use of system modules, a high level of prefabrication is achieved. Modular assembly systems in semi-fabricated manufacturing condition can be delivered to final assembly. The load introduction of the cable forces takes place from the lower transfer into the trussed framework structure at the end of the cantilever, without stressing the buoyancy element. The manufacture of the system is cost-neutral, independent of the water-depth for depths up to 1000 (one thousand) meters. The system mass distribution can be optimally adapted by ballast elements of variable configuration&#x2014;preferably by providing additional mass in the form of prefabricated reinforced concrete components&#x2014;in the entire region of the trussed framework structure of the cantilevers. Optionally, it is possible to adapt the total buoyancy force by additionally providing buoyancy elements of variable configuration, preferably in the form of spherical hollow bodies, at any point of the trussed framework structure of the cantilevers. The planning objective can be illustrated for a 3-megawatt wind power plant. The development of cantilever modifications for plants of up to approximately 5 to 6 megawatts is possible. The anchorage of the foundation system can be implemented by means of anchoring elements to be provided on the ocean floor, preferably by heavy-weight foundations in concrete construction. The heavy-weight foundations can be manufactured on site.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The floating foundation supporting framework according to the invention for offshore structures comprises a plurality of buoyancy elements which are arranged on the outside of a supporting bar framework which, in turn, is connected to ballast elements via cables <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>. This design results in a simple construction and low construction costs.</p>
