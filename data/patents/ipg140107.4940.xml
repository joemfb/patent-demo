<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/614,868 filed Nov. 9, 2009 now U.S. Pat No. 8,295,742, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-288,154 filed in Japan on Nov. 10, 2008, Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-133982 filed in Japan on Jun. 3, 2009 Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-152815 filed in Japan on Jun. 26, 2009, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a powder container that contains powder used in an image forming apparatus, such as a printer, a facsimile, and a copier, a powder supplying device equipped with the powder container, and an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an image forming apparatus that causes a developing device to develop an electrostatic latent image formed on a latent-image carrier, toner in the developing device is consumed according to image formation. To cope with this situation, there has been proposed a conventional image forming apparatus that includes a toner supplying device equipped with a toner container that contains toner so that the toner supplying device can supply the toner contained in the toner container to a developing device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An image forming apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3492856 includes a toner supplying device that is equipped with a removable toner container that contains toner in a container body thereof, so that the toner supplying device supplies the toner contained in the toner container to a developing device. The image forming apparatus is configured such that a user can replace a toner container that has become empty because of use over time with a new toner container by pulling out the toner supplying device that is mounted on a predetermined mounting position within a body of the image forming apparatus from the body of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, in view of environmental preservation, the toner container that has become empty because of use over time is collected from a user, and then subjected to predetermined recycling processing, such as cleaning or supplying of toner, so that the toner container can be reused as a recycled product.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There has been proposed another conventional image forming apparatus that is equipped with an information storage unit, such as an integrated circuit (IC) chip, for storing use history information on a toner container, so that the use history information can be written in the information storage unit of the toner container. The image forming apparatus transmits a radio signal of use log information (i.e., a toner container lot, a manufacturing date, an amount of remained toner, an amount of supplied toner, supplied time, a type, a storage period, recycling frequency, an upper limit of recycling frequency) to the information storage unit mounted on the toner container by using a communicating unit of the image forming apparatus. The information storage unit receives the radio signal transmitted from the communicating unit of the image forming apparatus, and stores the use log information in a nonvolatile memory thereof. Thus, when performing recycling processing on the toner container, it is possible to determine whether recycling is feasible by reading the use log information from the nonvolatile memory of the information storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Regarding the container body of the toner container, the container body made of resin such as polyethylene or polypropylene has been mainly used. When the information storage unit is attached to such a container body with an adhesive, it is difficult to bond the information storage unit to the container body because polyethylene and polypropylene are so-called adhesive-resistant material, so that the information storage unit may easily be removed from the container body. Therefore, the information storage unit may be removed from the container body during the above-mentioned recycling processing. If the information storage unit is removed from the container body as mentioned above, accumulated use history information of the toner container is lost, so that quality control of the recycled toner container may not be performed as desired (first problem).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, when communication is performed between the communicating unit of the image forming apparatus and the information storage unit of the toner container, a noise may be applied to a radio signal used for the communication between the information storage unit and the communicating unit because of an electromagnetic wave emitted from a motor that drives the toner container to rotate. When a frequency band of the electromagnetic wave from the motor is close to a frequency band of the radio signal, the above-mentioned situation is more likely to occur (second problem).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a powder container that has a hollow interior for containing powder, the powder container including a tubular member that is equipped with an information storage unit that stores therein at least information related to a container body, and attached to the container body such that the container body is located within an inner hole of the tubular member; and a movement restricting unit that restricts movement of the tubular member in an axial direction of the tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a powder supplying device configured to supply powder contained in a powder container to a powder receiving unit, the powder container being attachable to and detachable from a device body of the powder supplying device, wherein the powder container has a hollow interior for containing powder and includes a tubular member that is equipped with an information storage unit that stores therein at least information related to a container body, and attached to the container body such that the container body is located within an inner hole of the tubular member; and a movement restricting unit that restricts movement of the tubular member in an axial direction of the tubular member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to still another aspect of the present invention there is provided an image forming apparatus including an image carrier that carries a latent image; a developing unit that develops the latent image carried on the image carrier with powder developer; a powder supplying unit that is equipped with a powder container in a removable manner, the powder container containing the developer, and supplies the developer contained in a container body of the powder container to the developing unit; an information storage unit that is attached to the container body and stores therein information related to the container body; and a communicating unit that is attached to a body of the image forming apparatus and reads information stored in the information storage unit, wherein the powder container has a hollow interior for containing the developer and includes a tubular member that is equipped with an information storage unit that stores therein at least information related to a container body, and attached to the container body such that the container body is located within an inner hole of the tubular member; and a movement restricting unit that restricts movement of the tubular member in an axial direction of the tubular member.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In a first embodiment, an example is described in which the present invention is applied to an electrophotographic copier (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;copier&#x201d;) that functions as an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An entire configuration and general operation of an image forming apparatus is described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, four toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K for respective colors (i.e., yellow, magenta, cyan, and black) are removably (exchangeably) mounted on a toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> that is located at a top portion of an image forming apparatus body <b>100</b>. An intermediate transfer unit <b>15</b> is arranged below the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b>. Image forming units <b>6</b>Y, <b>6</b>M, <b>6</b>C, and <b>6</b>K for respective colors (i.e., yellow, magenta, cyan, and black) are arranged parallel to each other such that they face an intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> of the intermediate transfer unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K housed in the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> are supported by toner supplying devices <b>60</b>Y, <b>60</b>M, <b>60</b>C, and <b>60</b>K, respectively. Each of the toner supplying devices <b>60</b>Y, <b>60</b>M, <b>60</b>C, and <b>60</b>K supplies (feeds) toner contained in corresponding one of the toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K to a developing device of corresponding one of the image forming units <b>6</b>Y, <b>6</b>M, <b>6</b>C, and <b>6</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the image forming unit <b>6</b>Y for yellow includes a photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y, a charging unit <b>4</b>Y that is located at a periphery of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y, a developing device <b>5</b>Y (i.e., a developing unit), a cleaning unit <b>2</b>Y, a neutralizing unit (not shown), and the like. A series of processes for image formation (i.e., a charging process, an exposing process, a developing process, a transferring process, and a cleaning process) is performed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y to form a yellow image on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each of the other three image forming units <b>6</b>M, <b>6</b>C, and <b>6</b>K has substantially the same structure as the image forming unit <b>6</b>Y for yellow except for color of toner to be used, so that each forms an image of a corresponding toner color. In the following description, only the image forming unit <b>6</b>Y for yellow will be described in detail and explanation about the other three image forming units <b>6</b>M, <b>6</b>C, and <b>6</b>K will be omitted as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is driven to rotate clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by a drive motor (not shown). At a position facing the charging unit <b>4</b>Y, a surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is uniformly charged (the charging process).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is conveyed to a position where laser light L emitted from an exposing device <b>7</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is applied. At this position, an electrostatic latent image of yellow is formed through exposure scanning (the exposing process).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is further conveyed to a position facing the developing device <b>5</b>Y. At this position, the electrostatic latent image is developed, so that a toner image of yellow is formed (the developing process).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is further conveyed to a position facing both the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> and a primary-transfer bias roller <b>9</b>Y. At this position, the toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> (a primary transferring process). At this time, a small amount of untransferred toner remains on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is further conveyed to a position facing the cleaning unit <b>2</b>Y. At this position, a cleaning blade <b>2</b><i>a </i>mechanically collects the untransferred toner that has been remained on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y (the cleaning process).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is further conveyed to a position facing the neutralizing unit (not shown). At this position, residual potential on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this manner, a series of the processes for image formation performed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The above-mentioned image forming processes are also performed on each of the other image forming units <b>6</b>M, <b>6</b>C, and <b>6</b>K in the same manner as the image forming unit <b>6</b>Y for yellow. Specifically, the exposing device <b>7</b> arranged below the image forming units emits laser light L corresponding to image information toward each of the photosensitive drums of the image forming units <b>6</b>M, <b>6</b>C, and <b>6</b>K. More particularly, the exposing device <b>7</b> emits the laser light L from a light source and causes a polygon mirror to rotate to scan each of photosensitive drums <b>1</b> with the laser light L, so that each of the photosensitive drums <b>1</b> is irradiated with the laser light L. Then, toner images of respective colors that have been formed on the photosensitive drums <b>1</b> through the developing process are superimposed one on top of the other on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b>. As a result, a color image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the intermediate transfer unit <b>15</b> includes the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b>, four primary-transfer bias rollers <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>M, <b>9</b>C, and <b>9</b>K, a secondary-transfer backup roller <b>12</b>, a plurality of tension rollers, an intermediate transfer cleaning unit, and the like. The intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> is extended around and supported by a plurality of roller members, and driven to rotate endlessly in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> along with rotation of the secondary-transfer backup roller <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Each of the four primary-transfer bias rollers <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>M, <b>9</b>C, and <b>9</b>K and corresponding one of the photosensitive drums <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>K sandwich the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> to form a primary transfer nip. A transfer bias voltage of opposite polarity of that of toner is applied to each of the primary-transfer bias rollers <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>M, <b>9</b>C, and <b>9</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> moves in the direction of the arrow and sequentially passes through the primary transfer nip of each of the primary-transfer bias rollers <b>9</b>Y, <b>9</b>M, <b>9</b>C, and <b>9</b>K. Accordingly, the toner image of each color on each of the photosensitive drums <b>1</b>Y, <b>1</b>M, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>K is primarily transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> one on top of the other.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> bearing the superimposed toner images of respective colors moves to a position facing a secondary transfer roller <b>79</b>. At this position, the secondary-transfer backup roller <b>12</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>79</b> sandwich the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> to form a secondary transfer nip. The four-color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> is transferred onto a recording medium P, such as a transfer sheet, that has been conveyed to a position of the secondary transfer nip. At this time, untransferred toner that has not been transferred onto the recording medium P remains on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> then moves to a position of the intermediate transfer cleaning unit (not shown). At this position, the untransferred toner remained on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> is collected.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this manner, a series of transferring processes performed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The recording medium P conveyed to a position of the secondary transfer nip has been conveyed from a sheet feed unit <b>86</b> that is located at a bottom portion of the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> via a sheet feed roller <b>87</b>, a registration roller pair <b>88</b>, and the like. More specifically, a plurality of the recording media P, such as transfer sheets, is stacked on top of each other in the sheet feed unit <b>86</b>. When the sheet feed roller <b>87</b> is driven to rotate counterclockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a topmost recording medium P is fed toward a space between rollers of the registration roller pair <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The recording medium P conveyed to the registration roller pair <b>88</b> is temporarily stopped at a roller nip between the registration roller pair <b>88</b> whose rotation has been stopped. Subsequently, the registration roller pair <b>88</b> is driven to rotate to convey the recording medium P toward the secondary transfer nip at a timing corresponding to conveyance of the color image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>8</b>. Accordingly, a desired color image is transferred onto the recording medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The recording medium P onto which the color image is transferred at the secondary transfer nip is further conveyed to a position of a fixing unit <b>20</b>. At this position, the color image that has been transferred onto the surface of the recording medium P is fixed to the recording medium P because of heat and pressure of a fixing belt and a pressurizing roller.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The recording medium P is then discharged out of the image forming apparatus via a space between rollers of a discharge roller pair <b>89</b>. The recording medium P discharged out of the image forming apparatus via the discharge roller pair <b>89</b> is stacked on a stacking unit <b>30</b> one on top of the other as an output image. In this manner, a series of image forming processes performed by the image forming apparatus is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A configuration and operation of the developing device of the image forming unit is described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The developing device <b>5</b>Y includes a developing roller <b>51</b>Y that faces the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y, a doctor blade <b>52</b>Y that faces the developing roller <b>51</b>Y, two conveying screws <b>55</b>Y respectively arranged in developer containers <b>53</b>Y and <b>54</b>Y, a density detection sensor <b>56</b>Y that detects toner density in a developer, and the like. The developing roller <b>51</b>Y includes a magnet that is fixedly mounted inside thereof, a sleeve that rotates about the magnet, and the like. Two-component developer G formed of carrier and toner is contained in each of the developer containers <b>53</b>Y and <b>54</b>Y. The developer container <b>54</b>Y is communicated with a toner fall path <b>64</b>Y via an opening formed at a top portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The developing device <b>5</b>Y having the above-mentioned configuration operates in the following manner. That is, the sleeve of the developing roller <b>51</b>Y rotates in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The developer G that is carried on a surface of the developing roller <b>51</b>Y because of a magnetic field generated by the magnet moves on the surface of the developing roller <b>51</b>Y along with the rotation of the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The developer G contained in the developing device <b>5</b>Y is controlled such that a ratio of toner to the developer (i.e., toner density) can be within a predetermined range. More specifically, the toner contained in the toner container <b>32</b>Y is supplied to the developer container <b>54</b>Y via the toner supplying device <b>60</b>Y according to an amount of consumption of toner in the developing device <b>5</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The toner supplied to the developer container <b>54</b>Y is mixed and stirred with the developer G by the two conveying screws <b>55</b>Y, so that the toner is allowed to circulate in the developer containers <b>53</b>Y and <b>54</b>Y (i.e., movement in a direction normal to a plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The toner in the developer G sticks to the carrier because of triboelectric charging of the toner and the carrier, so that the toner is carried on the developing roller <b>51</b>Y together with the carrier due to the magnetic force generated on the developing roller <b>51</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The developer G carried on the developing roller <b>51</b>Y is conveyed in the direction of the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to a position facing the doctor blade <b>52</b>Y. At this position, an amount of the developer G on the developing roller <b>51</b>Y is adjusted to an appropriate amount, and then, the developer G is conveyed to a position facing the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y (i.e., to a development area). Subsequently, toner sticks to a latent image formed on the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>Y because of an electric field generated in the development area. The developer G remained on the developing roller <b>51</b>Y is conveyed to a position above the developer container <b>53</b>Y along with the rotation of the sleeve, and removed from the developing roller <b>51</b>Y at this position.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of an example of a toner container <b>32</b> that is made of synthetic resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or polyethylene-polycarbonate blend. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is an enlarged view of an opening <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The toner container <b>32</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape, and includes the opening <b>23</b> having a diameter smaller than that of a cylindrical portion of the toner container <b>32</b> in the center of one end surface thereof. The opening <b>23</b> is formed on an end portion of a collar <b>24</b> that is protruded outward from the toner container <b>32</b>. A plug <b>25</b> is put on to seal the opening <b>23</b>. A knob portion <b>26</b> is formed in the center of the plug <b>25</b>. On an inner peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion is formed a guide groove <b>27</b> in a spiral manner so that toner contained in the toner container <b>32</b> can be guided toward the opening <b>23</b> when a container rotation driving device (not shown) rotates the toner container <b>32</b> that is mounted on a toner supplying device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The toner supplying device <b>60</b> is described in detail below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a reference numeral <b>13</b> denotes a driving unit that functions as a rotation driving unit to rotate the toner container <b>32</b> mounted on the toner supplying device <b>60</b>. The driving unit <b>13</b> includes a joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>that functions as an engaging member, a spring <b>13</b><i>d</i>, a motor <b>13</b><i>e</i>, and a case that houses a shaft. The driving unit <b>13</b> is fixed to a body rear plate (not shown). Protrusions <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>(in convex shapes) are formed on a rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b>. The protrusion <b>32</b><i>b </i>is inserted into a concave portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>to hold the rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b>. The protrusions <b>32</b><i>a </i>are respectively engaged with convex side surfaces <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>to rotate the toner container <b>32</b>. A height H of the protrusion <b>32</b><i>b </i>is set to be higher than a height h of each of the protrusions <b>32</b><i>a </i>(H&#x3e;h). A reference numeral <b>16</b> denotes a container holding member that holds a head portion of the toner container <b>32</b>. A reference numeral <b>117</b> denotes toner supply wings that are made of elastic material such as mylar or rubber and respectively attached, with a double-sided tape, to ribs <b>16</b><i>a </i>that are integrated with the container holding member <b>16</b> and function as a kind of agitators. In the present embodiment, four toner supply wings <b>117</b> are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a drive rib <b>16</b><i>b </i>formed on an inner peripheral surface of the container holding member <b>16</b> is engaged with a driving-force transmitting protrusion <b>32</b><i>c </i>that is formed on the head portion of the toner container <b>32</b>, so that the container holding member <b>16</b> and the toner container <b>32</b> rotate in a normal rotation direction in an integrated manner.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a reference numeral <b>20</b> denotes a seal member. A reference numeral <b>21</b> denotes a collet chuck that pinches or releases the knob portion <b>26</b> of the plug <b>25</b>. The collet chuck <b>21</b> is housed in a cylindrical case <b>22</b> and integrated with a shaft member <b>123</b> via a screw <b>84</b>. A reference numeral <b>125</b> denotes a seal member. A reference numeral <b>28</b> denotes a coil spring that always applies pressure to bias components such as the collet chuck <b>21</b>, the cylindrical case <b>22</b>, and the shaft member <b>123</b> toward the toner container <b>32</b>. The components are housed in a case <b>18</b><i>a </i>that functions as a container holding unit and is integrated with a container holder <b>81</b> of the toner supplying device <b>60</b>. A reference numeral <b>76</b> denotes a handle for putting on or removing the plug <b>25</b>. The handle <b>76</b> is rotatable in a state where a shaft member <b>76</b><i>b </i>is inserted into a shaft bearing portion <b>132</b> of the case <b>18</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A reference numeral <b>127</b> denotes a slide shaft that is inserted into a hole <b>123</b><i>a </i>formed on the shaft member <b>123</b>. The slide shaft <b>127</b> is brought into contact with a cam member <b>76</b><i>a </i>that is formed on the handle <b>76</b>, so that the components such as the collet chuck <b>21</b>, the cylindrical case <b>22</b>, and the shaft member <b>123</b> can be slid in a direction away from the toner container <b>32</b> by rotating the handle <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">An elastic member <b>19</b>, which is made of elastic material such as mylar or rubber and provided with a slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>that is a long and thin hole elongated in a direction perpendicular to a movement direction of the toner supply wings <b>117</b> (i.e., elongated in a horizontal direction), is attached to an opening <b>18</b><i>c</i>, which is formed on the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>and communicated with the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> that is supported by the container holder <b>81</b>, with a double-sided tape. By controlling setting of an opening area of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a</i>, that is, by appropriately setting a length (in the horizontal direction) and a width (in the movement direction of the toner supply wings <b>117</b>) of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a</i>, an amount of supply of toner can be adjusted appropriately. In the present embodiment, the toner supply wings <b>117</b> are respectively attached to the ribs <b>16</b><i>a </i>such that an amount of protrusion of each of the toner supply wings <b>117</b> from the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>becomes about 1 millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A reference numeral <b>29</b> is a cover that guides toner discharged from the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>to a toner fall path <b>64</b>. An opening <b>29</b><i>a </i>is formed on a bottom side of the cover <b>29</b> so as to correspond to a position of the toner fall path <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the toner supplying device <b>60</b> having the above-mentioned configuration is supported by a guide plate <b>36</b> mounted on a body rear plate <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a body front plate (not shown). A reference numeral <b>18</b><i>b </i>denotes a hole that is integrated with the container holder <b>81</b> and engaged with a positioning pin that is formed on the body front plate (not shown). A stopper (not shown) that prevents misalignment of the toner supplying device <b>60</b> is mounted on the guide plate <b>36</b>. Thus, the toner supplying device <b>60</b> of the present embodiment includes a mechanical section formed of the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>and movable components such as the container holding member <b>16</b> housed in the case <b>18</b><i>a</i>, the toner container <b>32</b> that is removable from the mechanical unit, and the driving unit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Operation for setting the toner supplying device <b>60</b> in the above configuration is described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the container holder <b>81</b> is pulled out from the guide plate <b>36</b> and stepped portions <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> of the container holder <b>81</b> are respectively hooked on notch portions <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> of the guide plate <b>36</b>, the toner container <b>32</b> filled with toner can be placed to be mounted on the container holder <b>81</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Then, the toner supplying device <b>60</b> on which the toner container <b>32</b> is mounted is slid on the guide plate <b>36</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> so as to be set at a designated position. Accordingly, the protrusion <b>32</b><i>b </i>on the rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b> is inserted into the concave portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>(positioning concave portion) of the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>to thereby fix the position of the toner container <b>32</b>, and the head portion of the toner container <b>32</b> is engaged with the container holding member <b>16</b>. At this time, the stopper presses a front surface of the container holder <b>81</b> to complete setting of the toner supplying device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When the handle <b>76</b> is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow A (in a downward direction) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the cam member <b>76</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) pulls the slide shaft <b>127</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow C as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, so that the shaft member <b>123</b> starts to move in the direction of the arrow C, resulting in causing the collet chuck <b>21</b> to come into contact with protrusion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical case <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the collet chuck <b>21</b> starts closing to pinch the knob portion <b>26</b> of the plug <b>25</b>. In this situation, when movement in the direction of the arrow C is continued, the collet chuck <b>21</b> removes the plug <b>25</b> from the toner container <b>32</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, so that the toner contained in the toner container <b>32</b> flows out to the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>(if an amount of the toner contained in the toner container <b>32</b> is small, the toner does not flow out at this time). This state means that the setting of the toner supplying device <b>60</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Operation for supplying toner is described below. Regarding toner supply, when a density detection sensor <b>56</b> located inside a developing device <b>5</b> detects absence of toner, the driving unit <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> operates to drive the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>to rotate in a direction indicated by an arrow B. Accordingly, the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>is engaged with the protrusion <b>32</b><i>a </i>formed on the rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b>, so that the toner container <b>32</b> rotates. With rotation of the toner container <b>32</b>, the toner is discharged from the opening <b>23</b> and collected in the case <b>18</b><i>a</i>. At the same time, the rotation of the toner container <b>32</b> is transmitted to the container holding member <b>16</b> via the drive rib <b>16</b><i>b </i>that is integrated with the container holding member <b>16</b>, so that the toner supply wings <b>117</b> rotate while sliding on an inner wall surface of the case <b>18</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the toner collected in the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>is stirred. When each of the toner supply wings <b>117</b> passes through the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the elastic member <b>19</b>, the toner is pushed out of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a</i>. More specifically, when each of the toner supply wings <b>117</b> is pushed out of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the toner collected around an edge portion of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>or an edge portion of the opening <b>18</b><i>c </i>is pushed out. The toner that has been pushed out falls within the cover <b>29</b> so that the toner is supplied from the toner fall path <b>64</b> to the developing device <b>5</b> via the opening <b>29</b><i>a </i>that is formed on the bottom side of the cover <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In other words, only while the toner container <b>32</b> is rotating, the toner is pushed out from the elastic member <b>19</b> to the toner fall path <b>64</b> so that the toner can be supplied to the developing device <b>5</b>. Accordingly, the toner density in the developing device <b>5</b> is maintained constant.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">By mounting a removing mechanism that removes the plug <b>25</b> on the toner supplying device <b>60</b>, the toner container <b>32</b> can be mounted on the container holder <b>81</b> while the opening <b>23</b> is sealed by the plug <b>25</b>. Therefore, even when the toner container <b>32</b> is mounted on the container holder <b>81</b> in a substantially horizontal position, it is possible to prevent leakage of toner from the opening <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>, the above-mentioned operation for removing the plug <b>25</b> from the opening <b>23</b> is performed in a reverse order. In this manner, when the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> to seal the opening <b>23</b> by the plug <b>25</b> at the time of removal of the toner container <b>32</b> from the container holder <b>81</b>, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the toner that is adhered to a wall surface of the toner container <b>32</b> near the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> is leaked and dispersed from the opening <b>23</b> to the inside of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As described above, the toner supplying device <b>60</b> of the present embodiment enables replacement of the toner container <b>32</b> without causing leakage of toner from the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a single antenna substrate <b>120</b> is mounted on the guide plate <b>36</b> of the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> (i.e., the toner supplying devices <b>60</b>Y, <b>60</b>M, <b>60</b>C, and <b>60</b>K) on which the toner containers <b>32</b> are removably mounted in parallel to each other. More specifically, four antennas <b>121</b>Y, <b>121</b>M, <b>121</b>C, and <b>121</b>K, which perform wireless communication with respective RFID tags that are attached to respective peripheral surfaces of the four toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K that are arranged in parallel to each other on the guide plate <b>36</b> (the RFID tags will be described in detail later), are formed on the same plane of the antenna substrate <b>120</b> so as to face the respective RFID tags. More particularly, the antenna substrate <b>120</b> is placed below the toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K that are arranged in parallel to each other on the guide plate <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the antenna substrate <b>120</b> is mounted on the guide plate <b>36</b> such that each of the RFID tags of the toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K faces a corresponding one of the antennas <b>121</b>Y, <b>121</b>M, <b>121</b>C, and <b>121</b>K on a front side of the image forming apparatus body. However, a mounting position of the antenna substrate <b>120</b> on the guide plate <b>36</b> is not limited to this example. The antenna substrate <b>120</b> can be mounted on arbitrary positions on the guide plate <b>36</b> such that each of the RFID tags of the toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K can face a corresponding one of the antennas <b>121</b>Y, <b>121</b>M, <b>121</b>C, and <b>121</b>K. In an extreme case, any positions can be employed to mount the antenna substrate <b>120</b> as long as each of the RFID tags of the toner containers <b>32</b>Y, <b>32</b>M, <b>32</b>C, and <b>32</b>K can perform good communication with a corresponding one of the antennas <b>121</b>Y, <b>121</b>M, <b>121</b>C, and <b>121</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In a state where the toner container <b>32</b> is mounted on the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b>, the RFID tag on the toner container <b>32</b> and the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> equipped with an antenna <b>121</b> (i.e., the antenna substrate <b>120</b>) exchange necessary information with each other. In other words, information stored in the RFID tag is transmitted to a control unit (not shown) of the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> via the antenna <b>121</b> (i.e., the antenna substrate <b>120</b>), and information about the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b>, which is acquired by the control unit, is transmitted to and stored in the RFID tag via the antenna <b>121</b> (i.e., the antenna substrate <b>120</b>). The image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> is optimally controlled based on the above information. For example, when it is detected from the above information that the toner container <b>32</b> filled with toner of color different from designated color is mounted on the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b>, the control unit stops operation of the toner supplying device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Salient features of the present embodiment will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In a first configuration embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an RFID tag <b>90</b> in a tubular shape and formed of a flexible electronic substrate is attached so as to surround an outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>. In other words, the RFID tag <b>90</b> is attached to the toner container <b>32</b> such that the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> is located within an inner hole of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape. The RFID tag <b>90</b> stores therein information related to toner, such as color of the toner, an amount of the toner, a manufacturing number of the toner (i.e., a manufacturing lot), and a manufacturing date of the toner, and information related to recycling of the toner container <b>32</b>, such as recycling frequency, date of recycling, and recycling manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the present configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a front surface of one end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> (i.e., the electronic substrate) in a rectangular shape and a back surface of the other end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> are stuck to each other with an adhesive member <b>45</b> such as a double-sided tape, so that the RFID tag <b>90</b> is eventually formed into a tubular shape. When the RFID tag <b>90</b> is to be attached to the toner container <b>32</b>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> (i.e., the electronic substrate) in the rectangular shape is wound around the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b>, and then the front surface of one end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the back surface of the other end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> are stuck to each other with the adhesive member <b>45</b>, so that eventually the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape is attached to the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> of the present configuration example includes a flexible electronic substrate <b>91</b>, an integrated circuit (IC) chip <b>92</b> that is mounted on the electronic substrate <b>91</b> and stores therein the above-mentioned information, an antenna unit <b>93</b> that is electrically connected to the IC chip <b>92</b> and arranged on the entire circumference of the electronic substrate <b>91</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">An RFID tag configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> can also be used. That is, the RFID tag includes an RFID tag <b>95</b>, which is formed of an electronic substrate <b>96</b> on which an IC chip <b>97</b> that stores therein information and an antenna unit <b>98</b> that is electrically connected to the IC chip <b>97</b> are mounted, and a flexible tubular-shape holding member <b>99</b> that holds the electronic substrate <b>96</b> of the RFID tag <b>95</b>. With use of this RFID tag, a commonly-available IC chip can be used, resulting in reduction in costs for the RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">However, when the RFID tag as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> is used, a communication distance between the RFID tag <b>95</b> and the antenna <b>121</b> (i.e., the antenna substrate <b>120</b>) of the image forming apparatus may become long when rotation of the toner container <b>32</b> for the toner supply operation is stopped, depending on an attachment position of the RFID tag to the toner container <b>32</b>. If the communication distance becomes long, the RFID tag <b>95</b> and the antenna <b>121</b> (i.e., the antenna substrate <b>120</b>) may not perform good communication.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In contrast, with use of the RFID tag <b>90</b> equipped with the antenna unit <b>93</b> that is arranged on the entire circumference of the electronic substrate <b>91</b>, a distance between the antenna unit <b>93</b> of the RFID tag <b>90</b> that is attached to the toner container <b>32</b> and the antenna <b>121</b> (i.e., the antenna substrate <b>120</b>) that is mounted on the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> can always be maintained at a desired distance when the rotation of the toner container <b>32</b> for the toner supply operation performed by the toner supplying device <b>60</b> is stopped. Therefore, the above-mentioned problem can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> attached to the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> is controlled not to move in a longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., an axial direction of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape) by a flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>that forms an edge of the opening <b>23</b> and a rib <b>57</b> that is arranged at a position where the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> can sandwich the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., a position separated from the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>at an interval substantially the same as a width of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container). In other words, both edges of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container are brought into contact with respective end walls of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b>, so that movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>90</b> with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Regarding a relation between a size of each of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in a height direction (i.e., an outward direction from the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>) and a thickness of the RFID tag <b>90</b>, the size of each of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in the height direction can be either larger or smaller than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>90</b> as long as the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> can restrict the movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container. However, it is preferable to set the size of each of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in the height direction to be larger than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>90</b> because the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in such sizes can more effectively prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>90</b> moves in the longitudinal direction of the toner container over the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Furthermore, the RFID tag in the tubular shape is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical collar <b>24</b>, so that the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., a direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape) can be restricted over the entire circumference of the collar <b>24</b>. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>90</b> with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In this manner, the RFID tag <b>90</b> can be attached to the toner container <b>32</b> at a fixed position without being attached to the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>32</b> with an adhesive or the like. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent removal of the RFID tag <b>90</b> from the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In a second configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a convex portion <b>91</b><i>a </i>that is formed on one side end portion of the electronic substrate <b>91</b> of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and a concave portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>that is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>32</b> and configured to be engaged with the convex portion <b>91</b><i>a </i>are engaged with each other when the RFID tag <b>90</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>32</b>, so that rotational movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in a circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> can be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">For example, if the RFID tag <b>90</b> is rotated in the circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> along with rotation of the toner container <b>32</b> while the toner supplying device supplies toner contained in the toner container <b>32</b> to the developing device, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>32</b> may rub against each other along with the rotation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b>. As a result, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> may be damaged. If the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> is damaged, the degradation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> may be accelerated, resulting in disabling the RFID tag <b>90</b> before the end of lifetime of the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the present configuration example, the convex portion <b>91</b><i>a </i>of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the concave portion <b>32</b><i>d </i>of the toner container <b>32</b> are engaged with each other to restrict the rotation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> is damaged by rubbing of the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>32</b> along with the rotation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Accordingly, when the toner container <b>32</b> is repeatedly recycled, acceleration of degradation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> can be prevented to the extent that the damage of the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> can be prevented. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>90</b> is disabled before the end of lifetime of the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">There can be another configuration for restricting the rotation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> as described below. That is, a hole portion that is concaved from an outer side of the side wall (i.e., an outer side of the toner container <b>32</b>) to an inner side of the side wall (i.e., an inner side of the toner container <b>32</b>) is formed on a side wall mounted with the collar <b>24</b>, and a protruded portion that is to be fitted in the hole portion is formed on an inner wall of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape, so that when the RFID tag <b>90</b> is attached to the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>, the hole portion and the protruded portion are engaged with each other to thereby restrict the rotation of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the toner container <b>32</b>. With this configuration, the movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can also be restricted due to the engagement of the hole portion and the protruded portion without formation of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> on the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In a third configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape is attached to a circumferential surface of the toner container <b>32</b> near the rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A groove <b>32</b><i>e </i>for mounting the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape is formed on the entire circumference of a side wall of the toner container <b>32</b> near the rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b> in the circumferential direction and in a width substantially the same as the width of the RFID tag <b>90</b>. Similarly to the first configuration example, the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the rectangular shape is wound around a bottom surface of the groove <b>32</b><i>e </i>and then a front surface of one end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and a back surface of the other end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> are stuck to each other with an adhesive member such as a double-sided tape, so that eventually the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape is attached to the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Both edges of the RFID tag <b>90</b>, which is in the tubular shape and attached to the groove <b>32</b><i>e</i>, in the longitudinal direction of the toner container are respectively brought into contact with inner walls of the groove <b>32</b><i>e</i>, which face each other in the longitudinal direction of the toner container across the RFID tag <b>90</b>, so that movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted. As a result, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>90</b> with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed. Furthermore, because the RFID tag in the tubular shape is attached to the bottom surface of the groove <b>32</b><i>e </i>that is formed on the entire circumference of the side wall of the toner container <b>32</b> in the circumferential direction, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the bottom surface of the groove <b>32</b><i>e </i>are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted over the entire circumference of the groove <b>32</b><i>e</i>. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>90</b> with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In this manner, by attaching the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape to the groove <b>32</b><i>e </i>that is formed on the side wall of the toner container <b>32</b> near the rear portion of the toner container <b>32</b>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> can be attached to the toner container <b>32</b> at a fixed position without being attached to the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>32</b> with an adhesive or the like. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent removal of the RFID tag <b>90</b> from the toner container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In a fourth configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, an RFID tag <b>94</b> that prestores therein various information related to the plug <b>25</b>, such as recycling frequency of the plug <b>25</b> and information related to the toner container <b>32</b> paired with the plug <b>25</b>, is attached to the plug <b>25</b> that is to be put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>. A configuration of the RFID tag <b>94</b> can be the same as the RFID tag <b>90</b> attached to the toner container <b>32</b> in the first configuration example, and therefore, explanation thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The plug <b>25</b> is recycled along with recycling of the toner container <b>32</b>. However, if the repeatedly-recycled plug <b>25</b> is continuously used over time, the plug <b>25</b> may be deformed or damaged. Therefore, it is preferable to perform quality control of a recycled product of the plug <b>25</b> by, for example, checking whether the plug <b>25</b> has been recycled a preset predetermined maximum number of times in a recycling factory or the like for the plug <b>25</b> that has been collected together with the used toner container <b>32</b> from a user. However, if the RFID tag <b>94</b> is attached to the plug <b>25</b> with an adhesive or the like, the RFID tag <b>94</b> may be removed from the plug <b>25</b> during various processing in the recycling factory, such as cleaning of the plug <b>25</b> for recycling, so that the various information related to the plug <b>25</b>, such as recycling frequency of the plug <b>25</b>, may be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the present configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, the RFID tag <b>94</b> in a tubular shape and formed of a flexible electronic substrate is attached so as to surround an outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b>. The RFID tag <b>94</b> is controlled not to move in an axial direction of the plug <b>25</b> (i.e., the same direction as the longitudinal direction of the toner container when the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b>) by a flange portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the plug <b>25</b> and a rib <b>25</b><i>b </i>that is arranged at a position where the flange portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>25</b><i>b </i>can sandwich the RFID tag <b>94</b> in the axial direction of the plug <b>25</b>.

Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>94</b> with respect to the plug <b>25</b> in the axial direction of the plug is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Furthermore, the RFID tag <b>94</b> in the tubular shape is attached to the entire circumference of the outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b> in the circumferential direction, so that the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>94</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b> are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>94</b> in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the plug can be restricted over the entire circumference of the outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b> in the circumferential direction. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>94</b> with respect to the plug <b>25</b> in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the plug is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the present configuration example, a front surface of one end portion of the rectangular RFID tag <b>94</b> and a back surface of the other end portion of the RFID tag <b>94</b> are stuck to each other with an adhesive member such as a double-sided tape, so that the RFID tag <b>94</b> is eventually formed into a tubular shape.

<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The RFID tag <b>94</b> can be attached to the following positions on the outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b>: a position to be located within the toner container <b>32</b> and to be opposite an inner peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> when the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> to seal the opening <b>23</b>; and a position to be located out of the toner container <b>32</b> when the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> to seal the opening <b>23</b>. In other words, the RFID tag <b>94</b> can be attached to arbitrary positions depending on the shape of the toner container <b>32</b>, the configuration of the toner supplying device, and the like as long as the RFID tag <b>94</b> does not disturb putting on and removal of the plug <b>25</b> with respect to the opening <b>23</b> and leakage of toner contained in the toner container <b>32</b> from the opening <b>23</b> can be prevented when the opening <b>23</b> is sealed by the plug <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">For example, in a configuration where the RFID tag <b>94</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b> at a position that is to be located within the toner container <b>32</b> and to be opposite the inner peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> when the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> to seal the opening <b>23</b>, it is preferable to bring an edge portion of the rib <b>25</b><i>b</i>, which is formed on the plug <b>25</b> for restricting the movement of the RFID tag <b>94</b> in the axial direction of the plug, with the inner peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> so that a relative position of the plug <b>25</b> with respect to the toner container <b>32</b> can be maintained so that the opening <b>23</b> can be sealed by a frictional force generated by the contact. It is also preferable to use the RFID tag <b>94</b> having a thickness smaller than a size of the rib <b>25</b><i>b </i>in a height direction. With this configuration, it is possible to prevent damage of the RFID tag <b>94</b> caused by a rub between the surface of the RFID tag <b>94</b> attached to the outer peripheral surface of the plug <b>25</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the collar <b>24</b> of the toner container <b>32</b> when the plug <b>25</b> is put on or removed from the opening <b>23</b>. It is also possible to prevent disturbance of operation for putting or removing the plug <b>25</b> on or from the opening <b>23</b> and leakage of toner from the opening <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">According to the present configuration example, it is possible to prevent removal of the RFID tag <b>94</b> from the plug <b>25</b>, so that removal of the RFID tag <b>94</b> from the plug <b>25</b> during various processing such as cleaning of the plug <b>25</b> for recycling can be prevented, resulting in preventing missing of the various information related to the plug <b>25</b>, such as recycling frequency of the plug <b>25</b>. Thus, the quality control of the recycled product of the plug <b>25</b> can be performed in a preferable manner.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The toner tank unit <b>261</b>Y is located below the toner outlet W of the cap portion <b>232</b>Y<b>1</b> of the toner container <b>232</b>Y so that toner discharged from the toner outlet W of the toner container <b>232</b>Y can be collected therein.

<p id="p-0154" num="0153">A toner end sensor <b>266</b>Y for detecting that an amount of toner collected in the toner tank unit <b>261</b>Y becomes equal to or smaller than a predetermined amount is mounted on a wall surface of the toner tank unit <b>261</b>Y (at a position in a predetermined height from the bottom portion of the toner tank unit <b>261</b>Y). The toner end sensor <b>266</b>Y can be a piezoelectric sensor or the like.

When the toner end detection by the toner end sensor <b>266</b>Y is not relieved even after the above control is repeated, the control unit <b>270</b> determines that no toner is contained in the toner container <b>232</b>Y and displays an instruction to replace the toner container <b>232</b>Y with a new one on a display unit (not shown) of the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">A stirring member <b>265</b>Y that prevents aggregation of toner collected in the toner tank unit <b>261</b>Y is arranged in the center of the toner tank unit <b>261</b>Y (near the toner end sensor <b>266</b>Y).

Driving force of the drive motor <b>280</b> is transmitted to the drive coupling <b>290</b> via the two-stage gear <b>291</b>, so that the drive coupling <b>290</b> drives the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> of the toner container <b>232</b>Y to rotate in a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">A gear <b>292</b> that is engaged with the gear <b>291</b> transmits the driving force to a helical gear <b>281</b> that is mounted on a front side of the toner supplying device <b>260</b>Y (i.e., a front side in a direction for mounting and removing the toner container <b>232</b>Y) via a driving-force transmission shaft <b>281</b><i>a</i>.

In other words, after completely mounted on the toner supplying device <b>260</b>Y, the cap portion <b>232</b>Y<b>1</b> does not rotate, so that only the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> that is rotatably mounted with respect to the cap portion <b>232</b>Y<b>1</b> is rotatable.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Salient features of the present embodiment will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in a tubular shape and formed of a flexible electronic substrate is attached so as to surround an outer peripheral surface of a collar <b>224</b>Y of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> of the toner container <b>232</b>Y. The RFID tag <b>250</b>Y stores therein information related to toner, such as color of the toner, an amount of the toner, a manufacturing number of the toner (i.e., a manufacturing lot), and a manufacturing date of the toner, and information related to recycling of the toner container <b>232</b>, such as recycling frequency, date of recycling, and recycling manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">A configuration of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y of the present embodiment can be the same as that of the RFID tag <b>90</b> of the first embodiment, and therefore, explanation thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The RFID tag <b>250</b>Y attached to the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>224</b>Y is controlled not to move in a longitudinal direction of the toner container by a flange portion <b>223</b>Ya that forms an edge of an opening <b>223</b>Y and a rib <b>257</b>Y that is arranged at a position where the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y can sandwich the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., a position separated from the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya at an interval substantially the same as a width of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container). In other words, both edges of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container are brought into contact with respective end walls of the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y, so that movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Regarding a relation between a size of each of the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y in a height direction (i.e., an outward direction from the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>224</b>Y of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>) and a thickness of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y, the size of each of the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y in the height direction can be either larger or smaller than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y as long as the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y can restrict the movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container. However, it is preferable to set the size of each of the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y in the height direction to be larger than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y because the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y in such sizes can more effectively prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y moves in the longitudinal direction of the toner container over the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Furthermore, the RFID tag in the tubular shape is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>224</b>Y that is in a cylindrical shape, so that the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>224</b>Y are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted over the entire circumference of the collar <b>224</b>Y. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In this manner, the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y can be attached to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> at a fixed position without being attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> with an adhesive or the like. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent removal of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y from the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Moreover, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, when the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is attached to the collar <b>224</b>Y of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> and then the cap portion <b>232</b>Y<b>1</b> is put on the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>, the cap member <b>232</b>Y<b>1</b> covers the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is cut off or broken because of impact or scratch externally applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In a sixth configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, a convex portion <b>250</b>Ya that is formed on one side end portion of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and a concave portion <b>258</b>Y that is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> are configured to be engaged with each other when the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>, so that rotational movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in a circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> can be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">For example, if the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is rotated in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> along with rotation of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> while the toner supplying device <b>260</b> supplies toner contained in the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> to the developing device, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> may rub against each other along with the rotation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>. As a result, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y may be damaged. If the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is damaged, the degradation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y may be accelerated, resulting in disabling the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y before the end of lifetime of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In the present configuration example, the convex portion <b>250</b>Ya of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and the concave portion <b>258</b>Y of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> are engaged with each other to restrict the rotation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is damaged by rubbing of the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> along with the rotation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Accordingly, when the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> is repeatedly recycled, acceleration of degradation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y can be prevented to the extent that the damage of the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y can be prevented. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is disabled before the end of lifetime of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">There can be another configuration for restricting the rotation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> as described below. That is, a hole portion that is concaved from an outer side of the side wall (i.e., an outer side of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>) to an inner side of the side wall (i.e., an inner side of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>) is formed on a side wall mounted with the collar <b>224</b>Y, and a protruded portion that is to be fitted in the hole portion is formed on an inner wall of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tubular shape, so that when the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y is attached to the collar <b>224</b>Y of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>, the hole portion and the protruded portion can be engaged with each other to thereby restrict the rotation of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>. With this configuration, the movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can also be restricted due to the engagement of the hole portion and the protruded portion without formation of the flange portion <b>223</b>Ya and the rib <b>257</b>Y on the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In a seventh configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tubular shape is attached to a circumferential surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> near the rear portion of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">A groove <b>259</b>Y for mounting the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tabular shape is formed on the entire circumference of a side wall of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> near the rear portion of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> in the circumferential direction, and a width of the groove <b>259</b>Y is substantially the same as the width of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y. Similarly to the fifth configuration example, the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the rectangular shape is wound around a bottom surface of the groove <b>259</b>Y and then a front surface of one end portion of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and a back surface of the other end portion of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y are stuck to each other with an adhesive member such as a double-sided tape, so that eventually the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tubular shape is attached to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Both edges of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y, which is in the tubular shape and attached to the groove <b>259</b>Y, in the longitudinal direction of the toner container are respectively brought into contact with inner walls of the groove <b>259</b>Y, which face each other in the longitudinal direction of the toner container across the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y, so that movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted. As a result, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed. Furthermore, because the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tubular shape is attached to the entire circumference of the bottom surface of the groove <b>259</b>Y that is formed on the side wall of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> in the circumferential direction, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y and the bottom surface of the groove <b>259</b>Y are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted over the entire circumference of the groove <b>259</b>Y. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y with respect to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In this manner, by attaching the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tubular shape to the groove <b>259</b>Y that is formed on the side wall of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> near the rear portion of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>, the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y can be attached to the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> at a fixed position without being attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> with an adhesive or the like. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent removal of the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y from the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In an eighth configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> and similarly to the fifth configuration example, the RFID tag <b>250</b>Y in the tubular shape and formed of a flexible electronic substrate is attached so as to surround the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>224</b>Y of the container body <b>232</b>Y<b>2</b> of the toner container <b>232</b>Y.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">A third embodiment of a copier as the image forming apparatus according to the present invention is described below.

<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The toner supplying device <b>360</b> that guides toner contained in a toner container <b>332</b>Y to the developing device <b>5</b>Y is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, positions and orientations of the toner container <b>332</b>Y, toner conveying pipes <b>343</b>Y, <b>359</b>, <b>370</b>, and <b>371</b> that function as toner supply paths and the developing device <b>5</b>Y are modified from actual ones as a help for simple understanding of the configuration. In the actual configuration, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, a longitudinal side of the toner container <b>332</b>Y and a part of the toner supply paths are arranged in a direction normal to a plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, toner contained in each of the toner containers <b>332</b>Y, <b>332</b>M, <b>332</b>C, and <b>332</b>K housed in the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> of the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> is appropriately supplied to corresponding one of the developing devices <b>5</b> via a toner supply path arranged for each toner color, based on consumption of toner in corresponding one of the developing devices <b>5</b> for corresponding color. Configurations of the four toner supply paths are substantially the same with each other except for color of toner to be used in an image forming process.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">More specifically, when the toner container <b>332</b>Y is mounted on the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> of the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b>, a nozzle <b>370</b> of the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> is connected to a cap portion <b>334</b>Y (a supported portion) of the toner container <b>332</b>Y. At this time, a plug member <b>334</b><i>d </i>(an opening and closing member) of the toner container <b>332</b>Y opens a toner outlet B of the cap portion <b>334</b>Y. Then, a driving unit (not shown) mounted on the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> rotates a container body <b>333</b>Y of the toner container <b>332</b>Y in a direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. A spiral protrusion <b>333</b><i>b </i>(i.e., a spiral groove <b>333</b><i>b </i>when viewed from an outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>333</b>Y) is formed on an inner peripheral surface of the container body <b>333</b>Y. Therefore, the toner contained in the container body <b>333</b>Y is guided toward an opening <b>323</b> by the spiral protrusion <b>333</b><i>b </i>and then discharged from the opening <b>323</b> by rotating the container body <b>333</b>Y in the direction indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The toner discharged from the opening <b>323</b> is conveyed to the nozzle <b>370</b> via the toner outlet B. The cap portion <b>334</b>Y is fixedly supported by a holding unit <b>373</b> of the toner-container housing unit <b>31</b> so that the cap portion <b>334</b>Y does not rotate along with the rotation of the container body <b>333</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Another end of the nozzle <b>370</b> is connected to one end of a tube <b>371</b> that functions as a conveying tube. The tube <b>371</b> is made of highly toner-resistant flexible material. The other end of the tube <b>371</b> is connected to a screw pump <b>359</b> (i.e., a mohno pump) of the toner supplying device.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The tube <b>371</b> as the conveying tube is formed such that an inner diameter thereof is in a range from 4 millimeters to 10 millimeters. The tube <b>371</b> can be made of rubber material such as polyurethane, nitrile, ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM), and silicon, or resin material such as polyethylene and nylon. With use of the tube <b>371</b> made of such flexible material, possibilities of layout design of the toner supply paths can be enhanced, resulting in reduction in size of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The screw pump <b>359</b> is a suction-type eccentric screw pump, and includes a rotor <b>361</b>, a stator <b>362</b>, a suction port <b>363</b>, a universal joint <b>364</b>, a motor <b>366</b>, and the like. The rotor <b>361</b>, the stator <b>362</b>, and the universal joint <b>364</b> are housed in a case (not shown). The stator <b>362</b> is an internal thread member made of elastic material such as rubber. A double-pitched spiral groove is formed inside the stator <b>362</b>. The rotor <b>361</b> is an external thread member that is formed by twisting a shaft that is made of rigid material such as metal in a spiral manner. The rotor <b>361</b> is rotatably fitted in the stator <b>362</b>. One end of the rotor <b>361</b> is rotatably connected to the motor <b>366</b> via the universal joint <b>364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The screw pump <b>359</b> having the above configuration causes the motor <b>366</b> to drive the rotor <b>361</b> that is arranged in the stator <b>362</b> to rotate in a predetermined direction (i.e., a counterclockwise direction when viewed from an upstream side of a toner conveying direction), so that suction force is generated at the suction port <b>363</b> (i.e., negative pressure is generated within the tube <b>371</b> by discharging air from the tube <b>371</b>). Accordingly, the toner in the toner container <b>332</b> is sucked into the suction port <b>363</b> via the tube <b>371</b> with air. The toner sucked into the suction port <b>363</b> is further conveyed to a space between the stator <b>362</b> and the rotor <b>361</b>, and then output to an opposite end along with rotation of the rotor <b>361</b>. The toner that has been output is discharged from an outlet <b>367</b> of the screw pump <b>359</b>, and then supplied to the developing device <b>5</b>Y via the toner conveying pipe <b>343</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">In the present embodiment, the rotor <b>361</b> of the screw pump <b>359</b> is rotated counterclockwise when viewed from the upstream side of the toner conveying direction. Furthermore, spiral (i.e., a direction of twist) of the rotor <b>361</b> is formed in a rightward direction. Therefore, swirling airflow in the rightward direction is generated within the screw pump <b>359</b> along with the rotation of the rotor <b>361</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">A method for recycling the toner container <b>332</b>Y is described below. The toner container <b>332</b>Y of the present embodiment can be reused after performing recycling processing on the used toner container (i.e., the toner container that has become empty as a result of consumption of all contained toner by the image forming apparatus).</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">A first exemplary method for recycling the toner container <b>332</b>Y is described below. In the first exemplary recycling method, a removal process for removing the cap portion <b>334</b>Y from the container body <b>333</b>Y of the toner container <b>332</b> that has been collected is performed. Then, a supplying process for cleaning the container body <b>333</b>Y and the cap portion <b>334</b>Y and then supplying toner (or two-component developer) to the container body <b>333</b>Y is performed. A putting process for putting the cap portion <b>334</b>Y on the container body <b>333</b>Y is performed as the last process. By recycling the toner container <b>332</b>Y in the above-mentioned manner, environmental resources can be efficiently used.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In the present embodiment, only toner is contained in a container body <b>333</b> of each of the toner containers <b>332</b>Y, <b>332</b>M, <b>332</b>C, and <b>332</b>K. However, it is possible to supply two-component developer to the container body <b>333</b> of each of the toner containers <b>332</b>Y, <b>332</b>M, <b>332</b>C, and <b>332</b>K when the container body <b>333</b> is to be mounted on an image forming apparatus that appropriately supplies the two-component developer formed of toner and carrier to a developing device. Even in this case, the same effect as the present embodiment can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the suction-type screw pump <b>359</b> that discharges air from the tube <b>371</b> is mounted on the toner supplying device <b>360</b>. However, it is possible to mount a discharge-type screw pump that introduces air into the tube <b>371</b> on the toner supplying device <b>360</b>. Even in this case, the same effect as the present embodiment can be obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, an RFID tag <b>350</b> in a tubular shape and formed of a flexible electronic substrate is attached so as to surround an outer peripheral surface of a collar <b>324</b> of the container body <b>333</b>. The RFID tag <b>350</b> stores therein information related to toner, such as color of the toner, an amount of the toner, a manufacturing number of the toner (i.e., a manufacturing lot), and a manufacturing date of the toner, and information related to recycling of the container body <b>333</b>, such as recycling frequency, date of recycling, and recycling manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">A configuration of the RFID tag <b>350</b> of the present embodiment is the same as that of the RFID tag <b>90</b> of the first embodiment, and therefore, explanation thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The RFID tag <b>350</b> attached to the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>324</b> is controlled not to move in a longitudinal direction of the toner container by a flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>that forms an edge of the opening <b>323</b> and a rib <b>357</b> that is arranged at a position where the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b> can sandwich the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., a position separated from the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>at an interval substantially the same as a width of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container). In other words, both edges of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container are brought into contact with respective end walls of the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b>, so that movement of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>350</b> with respect to the container body <b>333</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Regarding a relation between a size of each of the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b> in a height direction (i.e., an outward direction from the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>324</b> of the container body <b>333</b>) and a thickness of the RFID tag <b>350</b>, the size of each of the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b> in the height direction can be either larger or smaller than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>350</b> as long as the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b> can restrict the movement of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container. However, it is preferable to set the size of each of the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b> in the height direction to be larger than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>350</b> because the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b> in such sizes can more effectively prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>350</b> moves in the longitudinal direction of the toner container over the flange portion <b>323</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>357</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Furthermore, the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the tubular shape is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>324</b> that is in a cylindrical shape, so that the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>350</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the collar <b>324</b> are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted over the entire circumference of the collar <b>324</b>. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>350</b> with respect to the container body <b>333</b> in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In this manner, the RFID tag <b>350</b> can be attached to the container body <b>333</b> at a fixed position without being attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>333</b> with an adhesive or the like.

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In an eleventh configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, a convex portion <b>350</b><i>a </i>that is formed on one side end portion of the RFID tag <b>350</b> and a concave portion <b>358</b> that is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>333</b> and configured to be engaged with the convex portion <b>350</b><i>a </i>are engaged with each other when the RFID tag <b>350</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>333</b>, so that rotational movement of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in a circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>333</b> can be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">For example, if the RFID tag <b>350</b> is rotated in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>333</b> along with rotation of the container body <b>333</b> while a toner supplying device supplies toner contained in the container body <b>333</b> to the developing device, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>350</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>333</b> may rub against each other along with the rotation of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>333</b>. As a result, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>350</b> may be damaged. If the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>350</b> is damaged, the degradation of the RFID tag <b>350</b> may be accelerated, resulting in disabling the RFID tag <b>350</b> before the end of lifetime of the container body <b>333</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0222" num="0221">There can be another configuration for restricting the rotation of the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body <b>333</b> as described below.

As a result, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>350</b> with respect to the container body <b>333</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed. Furthermore, because the RFID tag <b>350</b> in the tubular shape is attached to the bottom surface of the groove <b>356</b> that is formed on the entire circumference of the side wall of the container body <b>333</b> in the circumferential direction, the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>350</b> and the bottom surface of the groove <b>356</b> are brought into contact with each other.

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">According to one embodiment of the present invention, a powder container that has a hollow interior for containing powder includes a tubular member that is equipped with an information storage unit that stores therein at least information related to a container body, and attached to the container body such that the container body is located within an inner hole of the tubular member; and a movement restricting unit that restricts movement of the tubular member in an axial direction of the tubular member. Thus, the tubular member is attached to the container body such that the container body is located within the inner hole of the tubular member equipped with the information storage unit. Therefore, movement of the tubular member in a direction perpendicular to an axial direction of the tubular member can be restricted. Furthermore, movement of the tubular member, which is attached to the container body, in the axial direction of the tubular member can be restricted. Thus, because the movement of the tubular member attached to the container body can be restricted both in the axial direction and the direction perpendicular to the axial direction with respect to the container body, so that removal of the tubular member equipped with the information storage unit from the container body can be prevented. As a result, the information storage unit can be continuously carried by the powder container over time.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Furthermore, according to another embodiment of the present invention, the powder container further includes an information transmitting-receiving unit that is electrically connected to the information storage unit and configured to transmit and receive the information to and from an external communicating unit, wherein the tubular member is an electronic substrate, and the information transmitting-receiving unit is arranged on the entire circumferential of the electronic substrate. Therefore, as described above, a distance between the information transmitting-receiving unit and the communicating unit can always be maintained at a desired distance when the rotation of the toner container for the toner supply operation performed by the toner supplying device is stopped. As a result, the information transmitting-receiving unit and the communicating unit can perform good communication.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the powder container further includes an information transmitting-receiving unit that is electrically connected to the information storage unit and configured to transmit and receive the information to and from an external communicating unit, and an electronic substrate that is equipped with the information storage unit and the information transmitting-receiving unit, and attached to the tubular member. Therefore, as described above, a commonly-available RFID tag can be used, resulting in reduced costs.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the powder container further includes a rotation restricting unit that restricts rotational movement of the tubular member in a circumferential direction with respect to the container body. Therefore, as described above, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the inner surface of the tubular member is damaged by rubbing of the inner surface of the tubular member and the outer peripheral surface of the container body along with the rotation of the tubular member in the circumferential direction with respect to the container body.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the tubular member is formed such that a rectangular member is wound around an outer peripheral surface of the container body and then both end portions of the rectangular member in a longitudinal direction thereof are stuck to each other. Therefore, the tubular member can easily be attached to the container body.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Moreover, according to the first embodiment, the followings are provided: an opening that discharges contained powder to an outside and is formed on one end surface in a axial direction of a container body; the plug <b>25</b> that is attachable to and detachable from the container body to open or close the opening <b>23</b>; a second tubular member that is equipped with a second information storage unit that stores therein at least information about the plug <b>25</b> and attached to the cap member such that the cap member is located within an inner hole of the second tubular member; and a second movement restricting unit that restricts movement of the second tubular member in an axial direction of the cap member. Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the second tubular member equipped with the second information storage unit is removed from the plug <b>25</b> during various recycling processing for the plug <b>25</b>, such as cleaning of the plug <b>25</b> and various information about the plug <b>25</b>, such as recycling frequency of the plug <b>25</b>, is lost.

Therefore, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the second tubular member equipped with the second information storage unit is removed from the cap member during various recycling processing for the cap member, such as cleaning of the cap member and in which various information about the cap member, such as recycling frequency of the cap member, is lost. Thus, the quality control of the recycled product of the cap member can be performed in a desired manner.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Moreover, according to the second embodiment, the container body includes an opening that discharges contained powder to an outside, and a cap member that is attached to the container body to seal the opening and equipped with a second opening that is communicated with the opening, wherein the cap member attached to the container body covers the information storage unit. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the information storage unit from being covered with dispersed toner. It is also possible to prevent a situation in which the tubular member is cut off or the information storage unit is broken because of impact or scratch externally applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Furthermore, according to the second embodiment, the movement restricting unit is a flange portion that is to be engaged with an engaging portion formed on the cap member, and the information storage unit and the opening are located so as to sandwich the flange portion. Therefore, the flange portion functions as a wall for preventing dispersion of the powder that has been discharged from the opening towards the information storage unit. As a result, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the toner is attached to the information storage unit and communication sensitivity of the information storage unit is thereby degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Moreover, according to the second embodiment, the container body can be supported by the cap member so as to be rotatable with respect to the cap member.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, in the powder supplying device that supplies powder contained in a powder container that is removable with respect to a body of the powder supplying device to a powder receiving unit, it is preferable to use the toner container according to the present invention as the powder container.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, in an image forming apparatus that includes an image carrier that carries a latent image; a developing unit that develops the latent image carried on the image carrier with powder developer; a powder supplying unit that is equipped with a powder container in a removable manner, the powder container containing the developer, and supplies the developer contained in a container body of the powder container to the developing unit; an information storage unit that is attached to the container body and stores therein information about the container body; and a communicating unit that is attached to a body of the image forming apparatus and reads information stored in the information storage unit, it is preferable to use the toner supplying device that carries the toner container according to the present invention as the powder supplying unit.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The shape of the container body of the toner container is not limited to that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, a container body <b>432</b> in a shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> can be used. More specifically, an outer peripheral wall and an inner peripheral wall of the container body in a space between a collar <b>424</b> and a rib <b>458</b> are formed such that respective diameters are gradually decreased from a rear portion of the container body to an opening so that the inner peripheral wall can form a slope <b>432</b><i>f</i>. The slope <b>432</b><i>f </i>has a function to gradually convey toner contained in the container body <b>432</b> toward an opening <b>423</b> when the toner contained in the container body <b>432</b> is conveyed to the opening <b>423</b> along with rotation of the container body <b>432</b> around a shaft. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent discharge of a large amount of toner from the opening <b>423</b> at one time. Furthermore, in the container body <b>432</b>, an RFID tag <b>490</b> in a tubular shape can be attached to the collar <b>424</b> such that movement of the RFID tag <b>490</b> in an axial direction of the container body is restricted by a flange portion <b>423</b><i>a </i>and a rib <b>457</b>.

<p id="p-0250" num="0249">A toner supplying device <b>70</b> is described below. The toner supplying device of the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> includes the same components as those of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. These components are denoted with the same reference numerals as of the first embodiment, and therefore, the explanation in the first embodiment should be referred to as appropriate. The present embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the opening of the toner container <b>1030</b> has a different shape (i.e., the flange <b>1031</b> is formed) and a driving-force transmitting protrusion <b>1032</b><i>c </i>is formed on a surface of the flange <b>1031</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the drive rib <b>16</b><i>b </i>formed on the inner peripheral surface of the container holding member <b>16</b> is engaged with the driving-force transmitting protrusion <b>1032</b><i>c </i>that is formed on the flange <b>1031</b> of the toner container <b>1030</b> such that the container holding member <b>16</b> and the toner container <b>1030</b> can rotate in a normal rotation direction in an integrated manner.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Operation for setting the toner supplying device <b>70</b> in the above configuration is described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, when the container holder <b>81</b> is pulled out from a guide plate <b>136</b> and the stepped portions <b>40</b> and <b>41</b> of the container holder <b>81</b> are respectively hooked on notch portions <b>138</b> and <b>139</b> of the guide plate <b>136</b>, the toner container <b>1030</b> filled with toner is placed to be mounted on the container holder <b>81</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. Then, the toner supplying device <b>70</b> on which the toner container <b>1030</b> is mounted is slid on the guide plate <b>136</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> so as to be set at a designated position. Accordingly, the protrusion <b>32</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) on a rear portion of the toner container <b>1030</b> is inserted into the concave portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>(positioning concave portion) of the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>to thereby fix the position of the toner container <b>1030</b>, and the head portion of the toner container <b>1030</b> is engaged with the container holding member <b>16</b>. At this time, the stopper presses a front surface of the container holder <b>81</b> to complete setting of the toner supplying device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">When the handle <b>76</b> is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow A (in a downward direction) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, the cam member <b>76</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) pulls the slide shaft <b>127</b> in a direction indicated by an arrow C as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, so that the shaft member <b>123</b> starts to move in the direction of the arrow C, resulting in causing the collet chuck <b>21</b> to come into contact with the protrusion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the cylindrical case <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the collet chuck <b>21</b> starts closing to pinch the knob portion <b>26</b> of the plug <b>25</b>. In this situation, when movement in the direction of the arrow C is continued, the collet chuck <b>21</b> removes the plug <b>25</b> from the toner container <b>1030</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, so that the toner contained in the toner container <b>1030</b> flows out to the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>(if an amount of the toner contained in the toner container <b>1030</b> is small, the toner does not flow out at this time). This state means that the setting of the toner supplying device <b>70</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Operation for supplying toner is described below. Regarding toner supply, when the density detection sensor <b>56</b> located inside the developing device <b>5</b> detects absence of toner, the driving unit <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 39</figref> operates to drive the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>to rotate in a direction indicated by an arrow B. Accordingly, the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>is engaged with the protrusion <b>32</b><i>a </i>formed on the rear portion of the toner container <b>1030</b>, so that the toner container <b>1030</b> rotates. With rotation of the toner container <b>1030</b>, the toner is discharged from the opening <b>23</b> and collected in the case <b>18</b><i>a</i>. At the same time, the rotation of the toner container <b>1030</b> is transmitted to the container holding member <b>16</b> via the drive rib <b>16</b><i>b </i>that is integrated with the container holding member <b>16</b>, so that the toner supply wings <b>117</b> rotate while sliding on the inner wall surface of the case <b>18</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the toner collected in the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>is stirred. When each of the toner supply wings <b>117</b> passes through the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the elastic member <b>19</b>, the toner is pushed out of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a</i>. More specifically, when each of the toner supply wings <b>117</b> is pushed out of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a</i>, the toner collected around an edge portion of the slit hole <b>19</b><i>a </i>or an edge portion of the opening <b>18</b><i>c </i>is pushed out. The toner that has been pushed out falls within the cover <b>29</b> so that the toner is supplied from a toner fall path <b>71</b> to the developing device <b>5</b> via the opening <b>29</b><i>a </i>that is formed on the bottom side of the cover <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">In other words, only while the toner container <b>1030</b> is rotating, the toner is pushed out from the elastic member <b>19</b> to the toner fall path <b>71</b> so that the toner is supplied to the developing device <b>5</b>. Accordingly, the toner density in the developing device <b>5</b> is maintained constant.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">By mounting a removing mechanism that removes the plug <b>25</b> on the toner supplying device <b>70</b>, the toner container <b>1030</b> can be mounted on the container holder <b>81</b> while the opening <b>23</b> is sealed by the plug <b>25</b>. Therefore, even when the toner container <b>1030</b> is mounted on the container holder <b>81</b> in a substantially horizontal position, it is possible to prevent leakage of toner from the opening <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">When the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>1030</b>, the above-mentioned operation for removing the plug <b>25</b> from the opening <b>23</b> is performed in a reverse order. In this manner, when the plug <b>25</b> is put on the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>1030</b> to seal the opening <b>23</b> by the plug <b>25</b> at the time of removal of the toner container <b>1030</b> from the container holder <b>81</b>, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the toner that is adhered to a wall surface of the toner container <b>1030</b> near the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>1030</b> is leaked and dispersed from the opening <b>23</b> to the inside of the image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">As described above, the toner supplying device <b>70</b> according to the present embodiment enables replacement of the toner container <b>1030</b> without causing leakage of toner from the opening <b>23</b> of the toner container <b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">In the present embodiment, similar to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the single antenna substrate <b>120</b> is mounted on the guide plate <b>136</b> of a toner-container housing unit <b>131</b> (i.e., toner supplying devices <b>70</b>Y, <b>70</b>M, <b>70</b>C, and <b>70</b>K) on which the toner containers <b>1030</b> are removably mounted in parallel to each other. The toner-container housing unit <b>131</b> of the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> includes the same components as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. These components are denoted with the same reference numerals as of the first embodiment, and therefore, the explanation in the first embodiment should be referred to as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In a state where the toner container <b>1030</b> is mounted on the toner-container housing unit <b>131</b>, the RFID tag on the toner container <b>1030</b> and the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> mounted with an RFID reader <b>1120</b> exchange necessary information with each other. In other words, information stored in the RFID tag is transmitted to the control unit (not shown) of the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> via the RFID reader <b>1120</b>, and information about the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b>, which is acquired by the control unit, is transmitted to and stored in the RFID tag via the RFID reader <b>1120</b>. The image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> is optimally controlled based on the above information. For example, when it is detected from the above information that the toner container <b>1030</b> filled with toner of color different from designated color is mounted on the toner-container housing unit <b>131</b>, the control unit stops operation of the toner supplying device <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Salient features of the present embodiment will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, an RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to an outer peripheral surface of a port <b>1024</b> that is formed on one end portion of the toner container <b>1030</b> on the side where the opening is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</figref> illustrate an example of the RFID tag <b>1060</b>. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref> is a perspective view of a back surface of the RFID tag, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref> is a perspective view of a front surface of the RFID tag. A memory unit <b>62</b> that is in a convex spherical shape and formed on a substrate <b>61</b> on the back surface of the RFID tag stores therein data listed in (1), (2), and (3) as follows. The data listed in (1) and (2) are initial data stored at the time of manufacturing the toner container.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">(1) A type of toner to be contained, characteristics of the toner, a contained amount, a manufacturing number of the toner, a manufacturing date, a manufacturing factory, and a near-end timing (timing just before toner is run out) according to the contained amount (the number of pixels to be printed just before the toner is run out, and the number of containers).</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">(2) A type of a container, a manufacturing number, a manufacturing date, and a type of a mountable body.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">(3) Updated data: a manufacturing number of a machine body for actual mounting, a mounting date (history), the total number of pixels of a formed image, a latest contained amount (i.e., a remaining amount) calculated from an amount of consumption based on the total number of pixels, and a toner end date (history).</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">A capacitor <b>63</b> mounted on the back surface of the RFID tag is a rectifier capacitor for cutting noise. In the present embodiment, both a low-pass capacitor and a high-pass capacitor are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">An antenna <b>1064</b> is printed on each of the front surface and the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b>. The antenna <b>1064</b> has a directivity of an electromagnetic wave to each of the front surface and the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> (i.e., in a direction vertically outward from each of the front surface and the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b>). The antenna <b>1064</b> can be configured to have directivity to either the front surface or the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> as long as communication with the RFID reader <b>1120</b> mounted on the image forming apparatus body can be established.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">The substrate <b>61</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is supported by a rib pair <b>33</b> that is formed of a rib <b>33</b><i>a </i>and a rib <b>33</b><i>b </i>that are protruded from an outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> of a container body <b>1032</b> (i.e., an outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> near the opening <b>23</b>). When the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be supported by the rib pair <b>33</b>, adhesive or thermal deposition is not necessary because an operator can fix the RFID tag <b>1060</b> to the container body <b>1032</b> by inserting the substrate <b>61</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> into a space between the rib pair <b>33</b> by hand or by using a tool. Therefore, even when the surface of the container body <b>1032</b> has adhesive-resistant property, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can be easily supported by the container body <b>1032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">At the time of assembly, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is not just mounted on the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> but inserted into the space between the rib pair <b>33</b> in a vertical direction. Therefore, the space between the rib pair <b>33</b> as a mounting portion of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> with respect to the container body <b>1032</b> can be assuredly viewed, resulting in reducing an occurrence of assembly failure.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the rib pair <b>33</b> is not integrated with the flange <b>1031</b> and is provided with a slit (space) <b>1038</b> between the rib pair <b>33</b> and the flange <b>1031</b> so that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can be easily inserted by pushing the rib pair <b>33</b> open.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">A groove <b>34</b> through which the memory unit <b>62</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and some integrated components on the substrate <b>61</b> (e.g., the capacitor <b>63</b>) can pass is formed on the rib <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the rib pair <b>33</b>. When the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is set by being inserted into the space between the rib pair <b>33</b>, the memory unit <b>62</b> and the capacitor <b>63</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> are fitted in the groove <b>34</b> such that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is brought into slight contact with the surface of the memory unit <b>62</b> by pressure on the surface of the toner container <b>32</b> or slight backlash is remained so that removal of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> from the space of the rib pair <b>33</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">If a frequency band of an electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>of the driving unit <b>13</b> is near to a frequency band of a radio signal used for communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b>, the electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>may be applied to the radio signal. Therefore, a communication failure may occur in the communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> because of the electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">In the present embodiment, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening <b>23</b>, so that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is located at a position more distant from the driving unit <b>13</b> than the RFID tag that is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near a rear portion of the container body <b>1032</b> where the protrusion <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion <b>32</b><i>b </i>that are engaged with the driving unit <b>13</b> are formed. Therefore, compared to the situation where the RFID tag is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the rear portion, the electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>of the driving unit <b>13</b> is less applied as a noise to the communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b>. As a result, occurrence of the communication failure due to the electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>in the communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> can be more prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">While it may depend on a power size of the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>of the driving unit <b>13</b>, assuming that a direct-current (DC) motor with rated input power of 2.4 volt and 1.4 ampere level is used, application of noise to the communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> can be prevented if such a positional relation that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> are located at an interval of 50 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">When the toner container <b>1030</b> is mounted on the toner supplying device <b>70</b>, the RFID reader <b>1120</b> is located below the case <b>18</b><i>a </i>that is a body-side mechanism located relatively close to the opening <b>23</b>. On the other hand, the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>of the driving unit <b>13</b> that is a body-side mechanism for rotating the container body <b>1032</b> is located at an interval of about a length of an upstream side in the longitudinal direction of the container body <b>1032</b> from a position where a pumping unit is formed (i.e., a position where an angle of a spiral groove just upstream of the opening <b>23</b> becomes low, and, a stepped projecting portion is formed inside the container body such that the projecting portion guides the toner at around the inner wall of the container body toward a center portion where the opening <b>23</b> is formed). The motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>that is directly connected to the joint <b>13</b><i>c </i>is located outside of the joint <b>13</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The toner is a conductor with middle resistance, so that when the toner adheres to the RFID tag <b>1060</b>, an undesignated portion on the substrate <b>61</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> may be conducted, resulting in damaging a circuit of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">In the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, a space where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is located is separated from the opening <b>23</b> by the flange <b>1031</b>. The flange <b>1031</b> functions as a wall that prevents dispersion of the toner discharged from the opening <b>23</b> toward the RFID tag <b>1060</b> along with air flow. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the RFID tag <b>1060</b> from being covered with toner powder or fog when the toner is discharged from the opening <b>23</b>. As a result, it is possible to prevent a situation in which an undesignated portion of the substrate <b>61</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is conducted because of adhesion of toner to the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the circuit of the substrate is damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">A diameter of the flange <b>1031</b> that functions as a wall for preventing the dispersion of the toner discharged from the opening <b>23</b> toward the RFID tag <b>1060</b> along with air flow is set such that the inner wall surface of the container holding member <b>16</b> on the toner-supplying device body comes into contact with an end surface of the flange <b>1031</b> to the extent that the toner container <b>1030</b> can rotate, or a small space is formed between the inner wall surface of the container holding member <b>16</b> and the end surface of the flange <b>1031</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, on the flange <b>1031</b> is formed the driving-force transmitting protrusion <b>1032</b><i>c </i>that is to be engaged with the drive rib <b>16</b><i>b </i>formed on the inner peripheral surface of the container holding member <b>16</b> of the toner supplying device <b>70</b>. A position of the driving-force transmitting protrusion <b>1032</b><i>c </i>formed on the flange <b>1031</b> is changed along with rotation of the toner container <b>1030</b>, so that rotation driving force is conveyed to the toner supply wings <b>117</b> via the container holding member <b>16</b>. In this manner, the flange <b>1031</b> is configured to function as a part of a drive conveying unit that conveys rotation driving force to the toner supply wings <b>117</b> together with the driving-force transmitting protrusion <b>1032</b><i>c</i>. Thus, the flange <b>1031</b> can serve a plurality of functions, i.e., a function of an air-flow shielding member as a wall for preventing the dispersion of the toner discharged from the opening <b>23</b> toward the RFID tag <b>1060</b> along with air flow, and a function of the drive conveying unit that conveys the rotation driving force to the toner supply wings <b>117</b>. Therefore, compared to a configuration in which a member that serves one of the above functions is separately provided, the toner supplying device <b>70</b> can be downsized. In other words, a plurality of the functions (a drive conveying function and an air-flow shielding function) can be achieved simultaneously with a compact layout.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">When impact is directly applied to the RFID tag <b>1060</b> because of collision of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> with the floor due to dropping of the toner container <b>1030</b> to a floor, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> may be removed from the container body <b>1032</b>. Furthermore, even if the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is not removed from the RFID tag <b>1060</b>, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> may be damaged, resulting in disabling communication of information to the RFID reader <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the container body <b>1032</b> has a maximum projected area when viewed in a rotational axis direction of the toner container (i.e., a rotational axis direction of the spiral groove), and a projected area of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> viewed in the rotational direction of the toner container is within the projected area of the container body <b>1032</b>. Therefore, even when the toner container <b>1030</b> is dropped and an outer wall surface of the container body <b>1032</b> collides with a floor, it is possible to prevent a situation in which impact is directly applied to the RFID tag <b>1060</b> because the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is located inside the outer wall surface of the toner container.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The RFID tag <b>1060</b> to be attached to the container body <b>1032</b> should preferably be a passive tag that is compact, cheap, and operable with use of the electromagnetic wave from the RFID reader <b>1120</b> as drive energy. When such a passive tag is used, a communication distance to the RFID reader <b>1120</b> is limited to several tens of millimeters because the tag is equipped with a built-in antenna. However, in the present embodiment, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> are located close to each other, so that communication can be established without any difficulty. The RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> exchange the drive energy, a data signal, and the like with each other by using an electromagnetic induction method in which the drive energy and the data signal are sent through magnetic flux linkage of the antenna <b>121</b> of the RFID reader <b>1120</b> and the antenna <b>1064</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> located close to the antenna <b>121</b>. A frequency of the electromagnetic wave can be 13.56 megahertz as employed by a non-contact IC that is typically used as a cash card and the like, or can be others. The electromagnetic induction method enables more effective transmission of energy than a radio wave method, and it is widely used in a mainstream product of a current non-contact IC tag, leading to cost reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> of the container body <b>1032</b> in an upright position so that a distance between the RFID reader <b>1120</b> and the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can be made shorter. Accordingly, even the RFID tag <b>1060</b> that is capable of only a short-distance communication can establish communication with the RFID reader <b>1120</b>. When the spiral groove is formed in the inner wall of the container body, the toner in the container body <b>1032</b> is conveyed toward the opening <b>23</b> by rotating the toner container <b>1030</b>, so that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is rotated around a rotational axis of the toner container along with the rotation of the container body <b>1032</b>. Therefore, a distance from the RFID tag <b>1060</b> to the RFID reader <b>1120</b> and a communication direction are variable. However, a communicable range in a rotational range of the container can be increased compared to the configuration in which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> not in an upright position but in a lateral position.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Comparing a communication distance (i.e., a distance between the antenna <b>121</b> of the RFID reader <b>1120</b> and a center of the antenna <b>1064</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> within a communication available range (within a semicircle represented by a dashed line in the figure) of the RFID reader <b>1120</b>) in a situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the port <b>1024</b> not in the upright position but in the lateral position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> with the communication distance in a situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the port <b>1024</b> in the upright position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the communication distance in the situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> in the upright position is always shorter than the communication distance in the situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> in the lateral position. Therefore, more stable communication operation can be performed in the situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the port <b>1024</b> in the upright position than in the situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> in the lateral position.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, when the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> in the lateral position, even when the antenna <b>1064</b> is mounted on each of the front surface and the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b>, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> has to be located outside of the communication range of the RFID reader <b>1120</b> at a position where the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> faces the RFID reader <b>1120</b>, though this situation is not preferable. On the other hand, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, when the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> in the upright position and the antenna <b>1064</b> is mounted on each of the front surface and the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> with directivity of transmission and reception to each of the front surface and the back surface of the RFID tag <b>1060</b>, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can maintain the same performance for transmission and reception before and after the RFID tag <b>1060</b> passes above the antenna <b>121</b> of the RFID reader <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">In the toner container <b>1030</b> of the present embodiment, regarding a shape of a portion on the opening <b>23</b> side from a chain line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, a shape that has been obtained through injection molding as primary processing is remained as a final shape. A portion on the rear portion side of the container body <b>1032</b> from the chain line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is formed through blow molding as secondary processing. More specifically, the container body <b>1032</b> having the spiral groove on the inner wall thereof is formed by using material such as polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in such a manner that an intermediate molded product as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, which is obtained after completion of the primary processing (the injection molding), is put into a mold for the blow molding and then air is blown from an upper side of the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In this manner, at least the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> on the opening <b>23</b> side on which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be mounted is made of resin and formed through the injection molding. Polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET) that are suitable for the blow molding are so-called adhesive-resistant material, so that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can hardly be fixed to such material with a double-sided tape. The RFID tag <b>1060</b> may be attached to even PP by using a special adhesive or a special double-sided tape for the adhesive-resistant material. However, in the blow molding, it is difficult to improve an accuracy of dimension, so that it is resultantly difficult to make an attachment surface flat and obtain a desired accuracy of plane. Even when the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is fixed to the container body <b>1032</b> by using a rib and the like without using an adhesive, it may be difficult to obtain a desired dimension of engagement for fixing the substrate <b>61</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> by shrink fit or the like, or it may be difficult to form a protrusion for fixing (i.e., a small rib or the like can hardly be formed by the blow molding).</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">As described above, according to the present embodiment, at least the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>1030</b> on the opening <b>23</b> side on which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be mounted is made of resin and formed through the injection molding, so that material other than PP and PET can be used. Furthermore, even when the container body <b>1032</b> is integrally molded by using PP and PET, if a portion around the opening <b>23</b> is formed first through the injection molding, a desired accuracy of the attachment surface for the double-sided tape and the like can be obtained. Moreover, the desired accuracy of the dimension can be easily obtained, so that each structured portion (i.e., a rib, a concave portion, and the like) can be easily formed on the container body <b>1032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">To fix the RFID tag <b>1060</b> to the container body <b>1032</b>, the accuracy of the dimension of a fixation portion of the container body <b>1032</b> where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be fixed needs to be assured. The blow molding is employed for molding a plastic bottle of drink and enables integrated molding of a container. Therefore, when the container body <b>1032</b> is molded only through the blow molding, holes from which toner may be leaked can hardly be formed on the container body <b>1032</b>; however, a dimension of molding is less assured than in the injection molding. While the accuracy of the dimension needs to be assured for a portion of the container body <b>1032</b> where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be fixed so that a margin for attachment of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can be assured, if the container body <b>1032</b> is molded only through the blow molding, it is usually difficult to form the portion for fixing the RFID tag <b>1060</b> on the container body <b>1032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Therefore, as described in the present embodiment, if at least the outer peripheral surface of the toner container <b>1030</b> on the opening <b>23</b> side on which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be mounted is formed through the injection molding, the accuracy of the dimension of the above-mentioned portion for fixing the RFID tag <b>1060</b> to the container body <b>1032</b> can be assured.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Furthermore, the container body <b>1032</b> is formed through the blow molding after the injection molding is completed, so that the container body <b>1032</b> can be integrally molded. Therefore, while a container molded by assembling a plurality of parts may include a hole from which toner may be leaked because of mismatching of attachment portion of each parts, problem with formation of such a leakage hole can be prevented by employing the blow molding.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">In a fifteenth configuration example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> (i.e., electronic substrate) in a rectangular shape is formed into a tubular shape by attaching a front surface of one end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and a back surface of the other end portion of the RFID tag <b>90</b>. When the RFID tag <b>90</b> is attached to the container body <b>1032</b>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the rectangular shape is wound around the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> and then the front surface of one end portion and the back surface of the other end portion are stuck to each other by the adhesive member <b>45</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, instead of being attached to the rib pair <b>33</b> that is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> in the upright position. As a result, the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape can be attached to the container body <b>1032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51A</figref>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> of the present configuration example includes the flexible and heat-shrinkable electronic substrate <b>91</b>, the IC chip <b>92</b> that is mounted on the electronic substrate <b>91</b> and stores therein the above-mentioned information, the antenna unit <b>93</b> that is electrically connected to the IC chip <b>92</b> and arranged on the entire circumference of the electronic substrate <b>91</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">An RFID tag configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51B</figref> is also applicable. That is, the RFID tag includes the RFID tag <b>95</b>, which is formed of the electronic substrate <b>96</b> on which the IC chip <b>97</b> that stores therein information and the antenna unit <b>98</b> that is electrically connected to the IC chip <b>97</b> are mounted, and the flexible and heat-shrinkable holding member <b>99</b> that is in a tubular shape and holds the electronic substrate <b>96</b> of the RFID tag <b>95</b>. With use of this RFID tag, a commonly-available IC chip can be used, resulting in reduction in costs for the RFID tag.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">However, when the RFID tag as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51B</figref> is used, a communication distance between the RFID tag <b>95</b> and the antenna <b>121</b> of the RFID reader <b>1120</b> may become long when rotation of the toner container <b>1030</b> for the toner supply operation is stopped, depending on an attachment position of the RFID tag to the container body <b>1032</b>. If the communication distance becomes long, the RFID tag <b>95</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> may not perform good communication.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">In contrast, with use of the RFID tag <b>90</b> equipped with the antenna unit <b>93</b> that is arranged on the entire circumference of the electronic substrate <b>91</b>, a distance between the antenna unit <b>93</b> of the RFID tag <b>90</b> attached to the toner container <b>32</b> and the antenna <b>121</b> of the RFID reader <b>1120</b> that is mounted on the image forming apparatus body <b>100</b> can always be maintained at a desired distance when the rotation of the toner container <b>32</b> for the toner supply operation performed by the toner supplying device <b>70</b> is stopped. Therefore, the above-mentioned problem can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, the RFID tag <b>90</b> attached to the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> is controlled not to move in a longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., an axial direction of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape) by the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>that forms an edge of the opening <b>23</b> and the rib <b>57</b> that is arranged at a position where the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> can sandwich the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., a position separated from the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>at an interval substantially the same as a width of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container). In other words, both edges of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container are brought into contact with respective end walls of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> so that movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container can be restricted. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container with respect to the container body <b>1032</b> is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Regarding a relation between a size of each of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in a height direction (i.e., an outward direction from the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> of the container body <b>1032</b>) and a thickness of the RFID tag <b>90</b>, the size of each of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in the height direction can be either larger or smaller than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>90</b> as long as the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> can restrict the movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the longitudinal direction of the toner container. However, it is preferable to set the size of each of the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in the height direction to be larger than the thickness of the RFID tag <b>90</b> because the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b> in such sizes can more effectively prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>90</b> moves in the longitudinal direction of the toner container over the flange portion <b>23</b><i>a </i>and the rib <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Furthermore, the RFID tag in the tubular shape is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical port <b>1024</b>, so that the inner surface of the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the port <b>1024</b> are brought into contact with each other. Therefore, movement of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container (i.e., a direction perpendicular to the axial direction of the RFID tag <b>90</b> in the tubular shape) can be restricted over the entire circumference of the port <b>1024</b>. Accordingly, a relative position of the RFID tag <b>90</b> with respect to the container body <b>1032</b> in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In this manner, the RFID tag <b>90</b> can be attached to the container body <b>1032</b> at a fixed position without being attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> with an adhesive or the like. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent removal of the RFID tag <b>90</b> from the container body <b>1032</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">In the present configuration example, the RFID tag <b>90</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening <b>23</b>, so that the RFID tag <b>90</b> is located at a position more distant from the driving unit <b>13</b> than the RFID tag <b>90</b> that is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the rear portion of the container body <b>1032</b> equipped with the protrusion <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the protrusion <b>32</b><i>b </i>that are to be engaged with the driving unit <b>13</b>. Therefore, compared to a situation in which the RFID tag <b>90</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the rear portion, the electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>of the driving unit <b>13</b> is less applied to the communication between the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b>. As a result, occurrence of a communication failure due to the electromagnetic wave emitted from the motor <b>13</b><i>e </i>in the communication between the RFID tag <b>90</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> can be more prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Furthermore, while the RFID tag is attached to the container body <b>1032</b> of the toner container <b>1030</b> of the present configuration example in a manner different from that for the toner container <b>1030</b> of the fourteenth configuration example, various configurations and methods for molding the toner container <b>1030</b> described in the fourteenth configuration example can also be applied to the toner container <b>1030</b> of the present configuration example, and therefore, the same effects as described in the fourteenth configuration example can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a toner container as a powder container includes the container body <b>1032</b> that contains powder used for image formation; a drive transmitting unit that is arranged on one end of the container body <b>1032</b> and is engaged with the driving unit <b>13</b> of the image forming apparatus so as to receive rotation driving force from the driving unit <b>13</b>; the opening <b>23</b> that is arranged on other end of the container body <b>1032</b> and configured to discharge powder contained in the container body <b>1032</b> out of the container body <b>1032</b>; a conveying unit that conveys powder contained in the container body <b>1032</b> to the opening <b>23</b> along with rotation of the container body <b>1032</b>; and the RFID tag <b>1060</b> as an information storage unit that is arranged on an outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> near the opening <b>23</b>, and is configured to store therein at least information related to powder contained in the container body <b>1032</b> and exchange the information with the RFID reader <b>1120</b> as an information transmitting-receiving unit of the image forming apparatus in a non-contact manner. In the present embodiment, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening <b>23</b>, so that the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is located at a position more distant from the driving unit <b>13</b> than the RFID tag <b>1060</b> that is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the drive transmitting unit. Therefore, compared to a situation where the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the drive transmitting unit, the electromagnetic wave emitted from the driving unit <b>13</b> is less applied as a noise to the communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b>. As a result, occurrence of the communication failure due to the electromagnetic wave emitted from the driving unit <b>13</b> in the communication between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the RFID reader <b>1120</b> can be more prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Furthermore, according to another embodiment of the present invention, the container body <b>1032</b> has a maximum projected area when viewed from a direction of a rotational axis of the conveying unit, and a projected area of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is within the projected area of the container body <b>1032</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent direct application of impact on the RFID tag <b>1060</b> when the toner container is dropped, so that it is possible to prevent a situation in which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is removed from the container body <b>1032</b> or the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is damaged and information transmission and reception capability thereof is disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> includes at least the antenna <b>1064</b> for exchanging the information with the RFID reader <b>1120</b>, and the substrate <b>61</b> mounted with the antenna <b>1064</b>; and the substrate <b>61</b> is fixedly mounted on an outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening <b>23</b> in an upright position. Therefore, communication can be established even with an RFID tag that is capable of only a short-distance communication. More specifically, when a spiral groove is formed on the inner wall of the container body <b>1032</b>, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is caused to rotate, so that a distance from the RFID tag <b>1060</b> to the RFID reader <b>1120</b> and a communication direction are variable. However, a communicable range in a rotational range of the container can be increased compared to the configuration in which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is attached not in an upright position to the outer peripheral surface of the container body <b>1032</b> that is configured to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the substrate is supported by the rib pair <b>33</b> that is protruded from the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening <b>23</b>. Therefore, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> can be fixed only by inserting the substrate <b>61</b> into a space between the rib pair <b>33</b> by an operator by hand or using a tool, without adhesive or thermal deposition. Furthermore, the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is not just mounted on the outer peripheral surface of the container but inserted into the space between the rib pair <b>33</b> in a vertical direction. Therefore, the space between the rib pair <b>33</b> as a mounting portion of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> with respect to the container body <b>1032</b> can be assuredly viewed, resulting in reducing an occurrence of assembly failure.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, a convex portion is formed on a surface of the substrate <b>61</b> of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> facing the rib pair <b>33</b>, and either a hole or a concave portion to be engaged with the convex portion is formed on the rib pair <b>33</b>. Therefore, when the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is set by being inserted into a space between the rib pair <b>33</b>, the convex portion of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is engaged with the concave portion of the rib pair <b>33</b>. As a result, removal of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> from the container body <b>1032</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, an air-flow shielding member is arranged between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the opening <b>23</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the RFID tag <b>1060</b> from being covered with powder of fog discharged from the opening <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, a second drive transmitting unit is arranged between the RFID tag <b>1060</b> and the opening <b>23</b> such that second drive transmitting unit is engaged with a powder conveying mechanism of the image forming apparatus so as to transmit rotation driving force that has been transmitted to the container body <b>1032</b> from the driving unit <b>13</b> toward the powder conveying mechanism, wherein the air-flow shielding member is formed of a part of the second drive transmitting unit. Therefore, a plurality of the functions (a drive conveying function and an air-flow shielding function) can be achieved simultaneously with a compact layout.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, at least an outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening <b>23</b> on which the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is to be mounted is made of resin and formed after injection molding. Therefore, material other than PP and PET can be used. Furthermore, even when the container body <b>1032</b> is integrally molded by using PP and PET, if a portion around the opening <b>23</b> is formed first through the injection molding, a desired accuracy of the attachment surface for the double-sided tape and the like can be obtained. Moreover, the desired accuracy of the dimension can be easily obtained, so that each structured portion (i.e., a rib, a concave portion, and the like) can be easily formed on the container body <b>1032</b>. Furthermore, a fixation position of the RFID tag <b>1060</b> is set between the opening <b>23</b> and the container body <b>1032</b>, so that when a portion from the opening <b>23</b> and the fixation position is formed through the injection molding, the accuracy of the dimension for the fixation can be assured.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the container body <b>1032</b> is formed by performing blow molding on an intermediate product obtained through injection molding. Therefore, the shape of the container can be formed in an integrated manner. While a container formed of assembled parts may include a hole, from which toner may be leaked, because of mismatching of attachment portion of each parts, use of the blow molding can prevent formation of such a leakage hole.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the RFID tag is fixed to the container body with a heat-shrinkable ring member. Therefore, the RFID tag can be easily supported by the toner container even when the surface of the toner container <b>1030</b> is made of adhesive-resistant material.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Moreover, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, the conveying unit is a spiral protrusion formed on an inner wall surface of the container body <b>1032</b>. Therefore, toner contained in the toner container <b>1030</b> can be conveyed toward the opening <b>23</b> with simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Furthermore, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, in an image forming apparatus that includes an image carrier that carries a latent image; a developing unit that develops the latent image carried on the image carrier with powder developer; a powder supplying unit that is detachably equipped with a powder container containing the developer, and supplies the developer contained in the container body <b>1032</b> of the powder container to the developing unit; an RFID tag as an information storage unit that is attached to the container body <b>1032</b> and stores therein information related to the container body <b>1032</b>; and an RFID reader as a communicating unit that is attached to a body of the image forming apparatus and reads information stored in the information storage unit, which is preferable to use the toner container <b>1030</b> of the present embodiment as a powder container.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">According to one aspect of the present invention, the tubular member equipped with the information storage unit is attached to the container body such that the container body is located within an inner hole of the tubular member. Therefore, movement of the tubular member in a direction perpendicular to an axial direction of the tubular member can be restricted by the container body. Furthermore, movement of the tubular member, which is attached to the container body, in the axial direction of the tubular member can also be restricted. Thus, the movement of the tubular member attached to the container body can be restricted both in the axial direction and the direction perpendicular to the axial direction with respect to the container body. As a result, removal of the tubular member equipped with the information storage unit from the container body can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">Thus, according to the present invention, the information storage unit can be continuously attached to the powder container over time.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Furthermore, according to another aspect of the present invention, the information storage unit is attached to an outer peripheral surface of the container body near the opening, so that the information storage unit can be located more distant from the driving unit than an information storage unit attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the drive transmitting unit. Therefore, compared to a situation in which the information storage unit is attached to the outer peripheral surface of the container body near the drive transmitting unit, an electromagnetic wave emitted from the driving unit is less applied to the communication between the information storage unit and the information transmitting-receiving unit. Therefore, occurrence of communication failure because of the electro magnetic wave emitted from the driving unit in the communication between the information storage unit and the information transmitting-receiving unit can be more prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Thus, according to the present invention, occurrence of communication failure because of the electro magnetic wave emitted from the driving unit in the communication between the information storage unit and the information transmitting-receiving unit can be more prevented.</p>
