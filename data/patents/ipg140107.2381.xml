<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on the 7 of Nov. 2007 and there duly assigned Serial No. 10-2007-0113061.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a rechargeable battery and, more particularly, to a rechargeable battery which can improve productivity by improving an assembly structure of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a rechargeable battery is a battery which is rechargeable and is different from a disposable battery which is not rechargeable. The rechargeable battery has been widely used in the fields of electronic devices, such as cellular phones, notebook computers and camcorders. Particularly, a lithium rechargeable battery has an operational voltage of 3.6 V which is three times higher than that of an Ni&#x2014;Cd battery or an Ni&#x2014;H battery, which are frequently used as power sources of electronic devices, and which have high energy density per unit weight. As a result, the lithium-ion battery has developed rapidly in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The lithium rechargeable battery includes a bare cell and a protection circuit module (PCM) for electrically protecting the operation of the bare cell. The bare cell comprises an electrode assembly including a cathode plate, an anode plate and a separator interposed between them, a can receiving the electrode assembly and an electrolytic solution, and a cap assembly sealing an opening part of the can.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Methods of fixing the protection circuit module to the bare cell include a molding method using injected melted resin and an assembling method using an injection molded case.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method of fixing the protection circuit module to the bare cell by molding melted resin has a problem in that the high temperature of the melted resin causes undesirable effects on various elements included in the protection circuit module. Furthermore, it is difficult to form a molding resin at an exact position on one surface of the bare cell, thereby increasing defects.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conversely, the method of fixing the protection circuit module to the bare cell by the injection molded case does not affect the elements of the protection circuit module by hot temperature, and since it is an assembling method using a case, it is always possible to assemble at an exact position of the bare cell. In addition, the assembling process is simple.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the fixing method using the case, the case is fixed to the bare cell by a label sheet surrounding an outer circumference surface of the bare cell. In this regard, the case is fixed to the bare cell by adhesive force of the label sheet, which is a thin film, and thus the binding force of the case attached to the bare cell is very weak. Accordingly, the case is easily twisted from an upper surface of the bare cell or, in an undesirable case, may be separated from the bare cell.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, the conventional case is easily separated from the bare cell because the case is fixed to the bare cell only by the adhesive force of the label sheet. Thus, there is a problem that the reliability of products is prominently damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a rechargeable battery which can strongly fix a case to a bare cell so as not to be separated from the bare cell.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additional advantages, objects and features of the invention will be set forth, in part, in the following description, and will become apparent, in part, to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect of the present invention, a rechargeable battery comprises: a bare cell; a protection circuit module including a protection circuit board installed in the bare cell; a lead plate installed between the protection circuit board and the bare cell so as to electrically couple the protection circuit board and the bare cell; and a case connected to the bare cell so as to receive the protection circuit module on one surface of the bare cell; wherein at least one projection is formed on the lead plate and a projection fixing part combined with the projection is formed at the case so as to combine the case with the bare cell.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The lead plate may be installed on both ends of an upper surface of a cap plate of the bare cell, and includes a substrate fixing part welded to the protection circuit board and a bare cell fixing part welded to the bare cell, and the projection may be formed horizontally and outwardly from a side surface of the bare cell fixing part.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The lead plate may be fixed by laser-welding the bare cell fixing part to the upper surface of the cap plate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The projection fixing part of the case may be formed in the shape of a hole or a groove.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The case may include a sleeve covering an outer circumferential surface of an upper periphery of the bare cell, the sleeve being extended at its lower end part, and the projection fixing part may be formed on the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A label sheet may be attached to a side surface of the bare cell so as to cover the sleeve of the case.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the present invention, a rechargeable battery comprises: a bare cell; a protection circuit module including a protection circuit board installed in the bare cell; and an upper case connected to the bare cell while receiving the protection circuit module on one surface of the bare cell; wherein at least one projection is formed on the protection circuit board, and a projection fixing part combined with the projection is formed at the case so as to hold the case by means of the bare cell.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The projection of the protection circuit board is projected horizontally and outwardly from a side surface of the protection circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The projection fixing part of the upper case may be formed in the shape of a hole or a groove.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> are installed on respective ends of the upper surface of the cap plate <b>120</b>. The lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> are welded to the protection circuit board <b>210</b> and cap plate <b>120</b> so as to electrically couple them to each other. Substrate fixing parts <b>312</b> and <b>322</b> of the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, respectively, are welded to the protection circuit board <b>210</b>, and bare cell fixing parts <b>314</b> and <b>324</b> are welded to the bare cell <b>100</b>. The substrate fixing parts <b>312</b> and <b>322</b> are formed by bending upper parts of the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, respectively, and the bare cell fixing parts <b>314</b> and <b>324</b> are formed by bending lower parts of the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electrode terminal <b>130</b> of the bare cell <b>100</b> is electrically coupled to the electrical terminal <b>220</b> of the protection circuit board <b>210</b>. Furthermore, another electrical terminal (not shown) of the protection circuit board <b>210</b> is connected to the bare cell by the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>. In this regard, when the electrode terminal <b>130</b> of the bare cell <b>100</b> is connected to the electrical terminal <b>220</b> with negative polarity, another electrical terminal of the protection circuit board <b>210</b> has positive polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The upper case <b>400</b> is combined with the upper part of the bare cell <b>100</b> so as to receive the protection circuit board <b>210</b>. At this point, the upper case <b>400</b> is fixed by the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The upper case <b>400</b> is fixed by projections <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> formed on the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>, respectively, and projection fixing holes <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> and <b>438</b> formed on the upper case <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The projections <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> are horizontally projected from both side surfaces of the bare cell fixing parts <b>314</b> and <b>324</b> of the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>. However, the projections <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> may be formed on at least one side surface of the bare cell fixing parts <b>314</b> and <b>324</b>. In the case where the projections are formed on any one side surface, it is desirable that when the projection <b>316</b> is formed on one side surface of one lead plate <b>310</b>, the projection <b>328</b> be formed on the opposite side surface of the other lead plate <b>320</b>. This is the reason that it is desirable to fix the upper case <b>400</b> by forces simultaneously acting in directions facing each other.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The projection fixing holes <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> and <b>438</b> are formed on an upper end of the sleeve <b>410</b> of the upper case <b>400</b> so as to pass through the sleeve <b>410</b>.</p>

The label sheet <b>600</b> is attached so as to cover the sleeve <b>410</b> extended at both lower ends of the upper case <b>400</b>. Accordingly, the label sheet <b>600</b> is attached so as to cover the projection fixing holes <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> and <b>438</b>, thereby preventing the projection fixing holes <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>436</b> and <b>438</b> from being exposed to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, lower case <b>500</b> may be attached to the lower surface of the bare cell <b>100</b> by adhesive or the like. The lower case <b>500</b> is combined with a lower surface of the can <b>110</b> so as to protect the bare cell <b>100</b> from external impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view of the upper case according to a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, projection fixing parts may be formed in the shape of a groove on the upper case. That is, projection fixing grooves <b>432</b><i>a </i>and <b>434</b><i>a </i>are formed inside the upper case <b>400</b>A and thus, projections can be inserted into the upper case <b>100</b>A and fixed by the projection fixing grooves <b>432</b><i>a </i>and <b>434</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the projection fixing parts are formed in the shape of groove, it is possible to cover the projections <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> formed on the lead plates <b>310</b> and <b>320</b> so as not to be exposed to the outside. Accordingly, even if the label sheet <b>600</b> is not attached, the appearance of the rechargeable battery becomes good because the projections <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> are not exposed to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a bare cell and the upper case according to a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of a state wherein a label sheet according to the third exemplary embodiment is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the third embodiment, the same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, in the rechargeable battery, projections for holding by fixing an upper case <b>400</b>B to a bare cell <b>100</b> are formed on a protection circuit board <b>210</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Projections <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> are respectively formed on both side surfaces of front and rear parts of the protection circuit board <b>210</b>A outwardly and horizontally. Furthermore, projection fixing holes <b>442</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>446</b> and <b>448</b> are respectively formed at positions of the upper case <b>400</b>B corresponding to the projections <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> of the protection circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the rechargeable battery constituted as described above, in the process wherein the upper case <b>400</b>B is assembled on the upper part of the bare cell <b>100</b>, the projections <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> of the protection circuit board <b>210</b>A are inserted into the projection fixing holes <b>442</b>, <b>444</b>, <b>446</b> and <b>448</b> of the case <b>400</b>B. Thus, the case <b>400</b>B is fixed to the protection circuit board <b>210</b>A so as not to be separated from the upper part of the bare cell <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After the upper case <b>400</b>B is assembled, a label sheet <b>600</b> may be attached on an outer surface of the bare cell <b>100</b>. The label sheet <b>600</b> is attached so as to cover a sleeve <b>410</b> extended at left and right peripheral sides of a lower end of the case <b>400</b>B, thereby providing a binding force to maintain the upper case <b>400</b>B fixed to the bare cell <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view of the upper case according to a fourth exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the projection fixing part of the upper case may be formed in the shape of a groove. That is, projection fixing grooves <b>442</b><i>a </i>and <b>444</b><i>a </i>are formed inside an upper case <b>400</b>C, and thus projections can be inserted into and fixed by the projection fixing grooves <b>442</b><i>a </i>and <b>444</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">When the projection fixing parts are formed in the shape of groove as described above, the projections <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b> formed on the protection circuit board <b>210</b>A are not exposed to the outside of the upper case <b>400</b>C. Accordingly, the appearance of the rechargeable battery becomes good.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, the rechargeable battery according to the present invention produces the following effects.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">First, the case is stably fixed to the bare cell so as not to be separated from the bare cell, thereby improving reliability of products.</p>
