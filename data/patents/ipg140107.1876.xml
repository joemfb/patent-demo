<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to bone screws and, more particularly, to small bone screws that are cannulated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cannulated bone screws provided with an axial throughbore or cannula extending therethrough are known to allow use of guide wires that penetrate a bone at the desired implant site for the screw and guide the screw as it is being rotatably driven into the bone. One well known problem with bone screws is that as they start to go down in size in terms of the outer diameter of their threads, i.e., major diameter, the cannulas thereof likewise become very small so that only very thin guide wires can be used therewith. These thin guide wires are fairly flimsy and thus tend to bend and buckle, and walk on the surface of the bone when being inserted into the bone material. When this occurs, the location and/or angle of penetration varies from that which is desired making for inaccuracies in implanting the screw. In some instances, the screw will need to be backed out ruining the site and requiring identification of another implantation site, which can be difficult depending on the bone and bone location, and in any event is inconvenient to the doctor applying the screw into the bone.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Strength characteristics, such as the bending and torsional strength of a screw, are an important consideration with bone screws, particularly at small major diameter sizes thereof, e.g. 7.5 mm and less. Most failures of bone screws during insertion occur at the smaller screw sizes. More particularly, as the surgeon applies torque to the screw via a cannulated driver tool, the torsional forces can cause the screw to shear leaving only a lower portion that is partially driven into the bone material with the upper portion broken off from the remainder of the screw. At this point, additional medical intervention is necessary to remove or otherwise deal with the partially implanted screw portion and any broken off portions that may be loose at or around the implant site. Generally, with small screw sizes increasing the strength of the screws comes at the expense of having a larger cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Similarly, the pull-out resistance of small screws can be compromised with increasing strength. The pull-out resistance is typically dependant on the purchase of the screw or its thread depth. With stronger, thicker-walled screws, the depth of the threads cannot be maximized for a particular size screw. In other words, if the screw cannula size is kept constant and the thread major diameter is not changed, the screw purchase will increase only with a generally corresponding decrease in screw strength.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for a cannulated bone screw particularly in small sizes thereof that allows it to be used with larger and firmer guide wires during implantation thereof. More particularly, small sizes of screws are needed that have an optimal combination of screw strength, cannula size, and thread purchase.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, small cannulated bone screws are provided that are optimized in terms of their bending and torsional strength while still allowing for their implantation using relatively large diameter guide wires. To this end, the screws have a cannula that is maximized in size without a significant performance-related sacrifice such as in their strength characteristics. Also, the thread purchase of the small screws herein can be maximized so that the screws also have good pull-out resistance, as described further hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">More particularly, the bone screws at the smallest major diameter sizes, e.g., 3.0 mm-4.5 mm (which can be slightly oversized at 0.185 inch), include an optimum combination of strength and cannula size, without significantly sacrificing their pull-out resistance. For those small bone screws that are slightly larger, e.g. 5.5 mm-7.5 mm, the combination of their strength and pull-out resistance is optimized, without requiring a significant sacrifice in the size of their cannula. At these larger sizes, the size of the guide wire is typically not as much of a problem as with the smallest sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly in one aspect, the present high strength small bone screws can be divided into the smallest screws where after strength, the following features are optimized as listed in order of importance: (1) cannula size, and (2) thread purchase. With small bone screws having a larger size, these features are reversed in their order of importance from an optimization standpoint as: (1) thread purchase, and (2) cannula size, which reflects the identification of guide wire size as being more important for the smallest screws versus those that have a slightly larger size such as in the 5.5 mm-7.5 mm range.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, the invention relates to a set of small bone screws ranging in major diameter size from 3.0 mm up to 7.5 mm as by 0.5 mm increments, where the set is provided with an optimized combination of performance related characteristics including strength, cannula size, and thread purchase. As the entire screw set is optimized, a user need not seek out individual sizes of screws in the small screw range as set out above from different suppliers to achieve the high performance levels, as may be desired from these bone screws. Instead, the screw set herein can be obtained to achieve the high performance desired with any screw in this range of small sized screws. This range can be, more specifically, between 3.0 mm and 4.5 mm with their features optimized as discussed earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As previously described, screw breakage during implantation is a problem particularly at the small sizes for bone screws that the present invention addresses. With the high strength provided to the present bone screws, and particularly to the annular wall extending along the shank thereof, it has been found that with excessive applied torque to the screw at the screw head driving surfaces, as when bone material becomes harder or increasingly difficult to penetrate with the preferred self-tapping screws herein, rather than shearing of the screw shank, the screw is stripped as by deformation of the driving surfaces. In this manner, the present screws do not break into distinct portions as often occurs with prior small bone screws before stripping. Thus, there is not the problem of having to locate the broken off portion or pieces of screws at or around the implantation site during a surgical operation employing the small bone screws herein, and removal of the whole of the stripped screws is also easier.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, the present high strength small bone screws allow for shallower drive surfaces to be employed in the screw head. With greater screw strength, the drive surfaces can be made more resistant to stripping by decreasing their surface area as by making them shallower vis-a-vis standard depths for driving surfaces for a particularly sized screw head, while still allowing surgeons to apply sufficient levels of torque to the screw for driving it into the bone material. The strength of the screw wall is sufficiently high so that it is still greater than the resistance to stripping of the reduced depth driving surfaces so that stripping occurs prior to screw breakage at excessive applied torque levels. Accordingly, the present high strength small bone screws can have drive surfaces that are optimized in terms of their resistance to stripping and still having stripping occur at excessive torque levels and in any event prior to screw breakage along the shank wall thereof.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, a screw apparatus <b>10</b> in the form of bone screw <b>10</b><i>a </i>for being implanted into bone material is shown having one preferred configuration thereof. The bone screw apparatus <b>10</b> has an elongate shank <b>12</b> having proximal and distal ends <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively. The shank <b>12</b> has external threads <b>18</b> formed along the shank <b>12</b> between the ends <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> thereof. As shown in the screw <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the screw shank <b>12</b> is only partially threaded from the distal self-tapping and self-drilling end <b>16</b> to approximately mid-way along the length of the shank <b>12</b> leaving an unthreaded section <b>20</b> thereof. Alternatively, the entire length of the shank <b>12</b> less screw head <b>26</b> can be threaded, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and taking measurements for one of the listed screws <b>10</b>, the thread outer or major diameter can be approximately 0.138 inches or 3.5 millimeters. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1D</figref>, the shank <b>12</b> has a generally annular wall <b>13</b> including a throughbore or cannula <b>22</b> that extends the full way through the shank <b>12</b> from the proximal end <b>14</b> to the distal end <b>16</b> thereof. With the 3.5 millimeter major diameter on the threads <b>18</b>, the screw <b>10</b><i>a </i>herein is formed with a relatively large cannula <b>22</b> having a diameter of 0.068 inches or 1.73 millimeters. With a wall thickness as measured between the minor diameter of 0.096 inch and the cannula diameter 0.068 inch of approximately 0.014 inch, for the given thread outer diameter, the cannula bore diameter of 0.068 inches is significantly improved over prior similar small screws having like dimensions for their corresponding thread major diameter. The bending and torsional strength of the screws <b>10</b><i>a </i>is kept high and comparable to similarly sized prior screws, as will be discussed further hereinafter. The screw <b>10</b> has a maximum bending moment indicative of its bending strength of 13.002 in/lbs, and a maximum shear moment indicative of its torsinal strength or shear resistance of 12.999 in/lbs. Further, the thread depth of 0.021 inch and thus purchase of the 3.5 mm screw <b>10</b> is still approximately the same or slightly better than prior comparable screws.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As can be seen in the chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the cannula <b>22</b> of the 3 mm screw <b>10</b>, for instance, is increased by approximately eight percent over those provided in prior similar small screws. Likewise, the larger cannula allows for a larger guide wire <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to be utilized with the small screw <b>10</b> herein. In this regard, the guide wire <b>24</b> can likewise be increased in size by a similar percentage over guide wires used with prior small screws, assuming a 0.1 mm clearance provided between the outer diameter of the guide wire <b>24</b> and the diameter of the cannula bore <b>22</b>. It has been found that for the smallest screw sizes herein in the range of 3.0 mm to 4.5 mm, the cannula size has been maximized without a corresponding sacrifice in strength. In this manner, the present screws <b>10</b> of the smallest sizes herein can have the combination of the small size vis-a-vis their outer diameter, generally 4.5 millimeters and lower, while still obtaining the benefit of stiff guide wires <b>24</b> for use therewith by way of the relatively large diameter cannulas <b>22</b> formed therethrough. On the other hand, with the screws <b>10</b> at the larger end of the spectrum of small sizes, 5.5 mm-7.5 mm, where guide wire size is not as important, these larger screws <b>10</b> are provided with thread purchase that is optimized usually via a thinning of the screw wall <b>13</b> in comparison to prior screws while still maintaining the strength characteristics of the screws so that they are comparable to or exceed those of similarly sized prior screws. Even in these larger screw sizes, the diameter of their cannulas <b>22</b> will generally meet or exceed those of prior screws of similar sizes despite the greater emphasis placed on thread purchase at these sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to the charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, it can be seen that similar results are obtained for the bone screws <b>10</b> herein having thread diameters ranging from 3.0 millimeters up to 7.5 millimeters in terms of having larger cannula bores <b>22</b> therefor relative to prior cannulated screws. At the same time, the present screws <b>10</b> do not sacrifice performance and strength characteristics thereof relative to similarly sized prior screws which have smaller cannulas and/or worse performance and strength characteristics. In one respect, the threads <b>18</b> of the screws <b>10</b> herein can still be configured so that they are maximized in terms of holding power or purchase they provide in either cancellous bone material or in the cortex where less aggressive threads, i.e. smaller thread depth, can be employed. Particularly in cancellous material, the thread depth can be maximized while at the same time keeping the diameter of the cannula bore <b>22</b> to a maximum for fitting relatively large guide wires <b>24</b> therethrough. As mentioned, this is particularly true in the higher sizes for the present small bone screws <b>10</b> between 5.5 mm and 7.5 mm in their major diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The screw <b>10</b> is provided with an enlarged head <b>26</b> at its proximal end <b>14</b> having an internal driving surface such as hex surfaces <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 3B</figref>) for turning of the screw shank <b>12</b> about its axis <b>12</b><i>a </i>and sinking it into the bone material via an appropriately configured hex cannulated driver. Alternatively, the enlarged head can be provided with a cruciform or cross-slotted driving surfaces <b>30</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. One significant concern with small screws such as the screws <b>10</b> herein is that the applied torque or torsional forces via the driver to start threading the screws <b>10</b> into the hard bone material can cause shearing of the screw shank <b>12</b> such as at the head <b>26</b> thereof where the torque is being applied. In this regard, the present screws <b>10</b> are provided with predetermined levels of bending and torsional strength that meet or exceed those provided by similarly sized prior screws even where the prior screws have smaller cannulas and thus thicker shank walls than the present screws <b>10</b>, as illustrated in the empirically derived screw strength numbers in the chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For this purpose, the cannulated screws <b>10</b> herein are preferably formed from a predetermined high strength material. One such material that has been found useful for forming the screw <b>10</b> with the desired combination of strength, thread size for pull-out resistance and cannula size for allowing the present small screws <b>10</b> to be accurately guided by larger guide wires <b>24</b> is an austenitic stainless-steel alloy essentially nickle-free, e.g. a weight percentage of nickle of 0.010 maximum, and having a high nitrogen content, e.g. greater than 0.90 weight percentage. The BioDur&#xae; alloys provided by Carpenter Specialty Alloys of San Diego, Calif., have been found to be suitable for the above-specified purpose. To this end, the high strength of the preferred screw material herein allows the present screws to be more precisely constructed in terms of their cannula size and thread depth while still meeting the strength requirements for bone screws that are of the small sizes as presently described so as to more readily avoid over design in this area. Accordingly, the present screws <b>10</b> are provided with performance enhancements while allowing the strength with which they are formed to be carefully controlled to avoid screw breakage problems.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">More particularly, the strength of screw walls <b>13</b> are sufficiently high that even with excessive applied torque at the driving surfaces <b>28</b> or <b>30</b>, the screws <b>10</b> will not break as by shearing of their screw walls <b>13</b> and instead the high torques forces will first cause a stripping deformation of the drive surfaces <b>28</b> or <b>30</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, the head <b>26</b> can be provided with a central recess <b>32</b> that opens upwardly and has notches <b>34</b> extending radially therefrom. Four equally spaced, i.e. by 90 degrees, notches <b>34</b> can be provided to form the cross-slot or cruciform configuration for the driving surfaces <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The notches <b>34</b> are raised relative to the central recess <b>32</b> so that they are shallower than the recess at the radially inner interface therewith. In other words, the recess <b>32</b> has a greater depth at its center than do the radial notches <b>34</b>. By way of example for the 3.0 mm screw, the head <b>26</b> can have an axial length of approximately 0.055 inch, with the notches <b>34</b> recessed to an axial depth of 0.015 inch. The central recess <b>32</b> can have a maximum axial depth at its center of approximately 0.030 inch. With the 3.0 mm screw including sizes as shown in the charts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> and having its screw head <b>26</b> configured as described above, excessive-applied torque at the driving surfaces <b>30</b> will cause them to deform prior to breakage of the screw wall <b>13</b> due to the high strength thereof. It is believed that with the high strength screws <b>10</b> herein, the notches <b>34</b> including the drive surfaces <b>30</b> thereof can be further reduced in depth relative to the screw head size to better resist deformation thereof. This reduced depth driving surface <b>28</b> or <b>30</b> is sized so that a surgeon can still apply sufficient torque thereto via a cannulated driving tool for driving the screw <b>10</b> into bone material. Even with greater deformation resistance, the screw wall <b>13</b> has sufficient strength so that the reduced depth driving surfaces <b>28</b> or <b>30</b> will first deform prior to a shearing of the screw wall <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As is apparent, the present screws <b>10</b> are provided in a wide variety of sizes including shanks <b>12</b> that are partially threaded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and those that are fully threaded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) and having heads <b>26</b> with either hex or cruciform driving surfaces <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively. Each screw size based on screw major diameters can be provided with different screws at that size based on the end-to-end length of the shank <b>12</b> and the distance along the shank <b>12</b> from the distal end <b>16</b> that is threaded. Nevertheless, through the full range of the set of screws <b>10</b>, they are provided with a better or optimized combination of torsional and bending resistance strength, large cannula diameter and thread depth, with the last two features having an order of priority that depend on whether the screws <b>10</b> are toward the lower or upper ends of the range of screw sizes herein as previously described. In those instances where the prior screws have similar major diameters along with similar cannula sizes, it is believed that the present screws <b>10</b> will be improved in strength, especially from a torsional strength standpoint. In this regard, there are no prior systems that provide the full range of small screw sizes ranging from 3.0 millimeters to 7.5 millimeters with the corresponding large cannula sizes and/or thread depth as set forth herein. In particular, applicant's screws <b>10</b> are significantly improved in the smallest sizes of the screws from 3.0 millimeters to 4.5 millimeters where almost none of the prior screws are able to approach the large cannula sizes achieved herein along with the strength provided for the present smallest screws.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Ultimately, one screw performance ratio can be defined as being determined by dividing the thread major diameter by the cannula diameter which is minimized for the full range of the present screws <b>10</b>, and in particular for the smallest screw sizes, 3.0 mm to 4.5 mm. Where there are prior individual screws that meet this ratio, the prior screws will not be able to meet the strength characteristics of the present screws in particular with respect to the torsional and bending strength that the corresponding size screw <b>10</b> achieves or, especially at the larger screw sizes, 5.5 mm to 7.5 mm, the pull-out strength or resistance of the prior screw will be compromised by having less thread depth. Accordingly, another screw performance ratio can be defined as being determined by dividing the thread major diameter by the thread depth, which again is minimized for the present screws, and in particular for those that are toward the higher end in the range of small size screws <b>10</b> herein, 5.5 mm to 7.5 mm. Thus, each of the small sizes of screws <b>10</b> herein is able to exceed cannula sizes provided by prior screws and/or provide an enhanced or optimized combination of cannula size for improved screw implantation, thread purchase for providing high pull-out force resistance, and bending and/or torsional strength to allow the screw to resist shearing when being torqued for being rotatably driven into hard bone material. There are no prior small screws that have the above features, nor do they contemplate the same except in larger screw sizes where there is more room, i.e., screw material, for implementation of these optimized features and where such features may not be as critical, e.g. cannula size.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While there have been illustrated and described particular embodiments of the present invention, it will be appreciated that numerous changes and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the appended claims to cover all those changes and modifications which fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
