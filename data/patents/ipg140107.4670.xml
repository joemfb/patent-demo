<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method for sponsoring a communication service according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>, a telecommunication system for sponsoring a communication service according to the preamble of claim <b>8</b>, and a network node for sponsoring a communication service according to the preamble of claim <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such sponsoring of communication services is known for example from the method and system for providing an advertisement sponsored split charge prepaid service disclosed in the not pre-published Indian patent application 1838/CHE/2008.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the method and system disclosed in the not pre-published Indian patent application 1838/CHE/2008 a subscriber to said prepaid service receives sponsorship in terms of a bonus or a discount depending on the amount of advertisement said subscriber accepts during a call. To that end the connection to a called person is not established directly but only after the subscriber accepts or refuses the sponsorship for said call. A direct connection to the called person is not possible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another sponsored call service is provided via collect call or free call services. In these services a sponsor pays for the whole cost for a call made to a fixed telephone number. However, there is no flexibility in terms of the sponsored amount or the recipient of the call.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is thus to propose a method, a telecommunication system and a network node for sponsoring a communication service, that offers the availability and flexibility required in modern communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is achieved by a method according to the teaching of claim <b>1</b>, a telecommunication system according to the teaching of claim <b>8</b>, and a network node according to the teaching of claim <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The main idea of the invention is to sponsor a communication service, wherein said communication service is made available directly, in particular to a user of said communication service, and wherein a rule, in particular applicable for charging a sponsor of said communication service, is determined dynamically. The advantage of this method is that on the one hand the sponsorship is very flexible in terms of amount of sponsorship and sponsored party and on the other hand said communication service is made available to said user directly e.g. without any delay or disruption e.g. by advertisement or a prompt to said user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Advantageously a first cost for the usage of said communication service is charged at least partially to said sponsor, in particular by determining a second cost, in particular depending on said rule and said first cost. This means that the total cost for the usage of said service is billed entirely or in part to said sponsor, while not billing any cost at all or only a remainder to said user of said service. This is very advantageous e.g. in situations where said user is a subscriber to a prepaid communication service and would not be able to use or continue to use said prepaid communication service because he or she used up a prepaid credit amount.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously said rule depends on an originator or a recipient of said communication service. Thereby said sponsor sets up sponsorship only for certain uses of said communication service. For example a parent sets up sponsorship for his child e.g. for phone calls to certain phone numbers, like the parent's own phone number. Likewise an employee of a company is sponsored by his company or another employee of the same company.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously the invention enables to add an advertisement to said communication service. Thereby said sponsor profits from sponsoring said user, e.g. by adding an advertisement e.g. for a certain product sold by the sponsor to a Short Message Service (SMS) message sent by said sponsored user or received by said sponsored user.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously said rule is determined depending on information about said advertisement. Hence, the sponsored amount is determined flexibly depending e.g. on the sponsor, or the size of the advertisement sent to said user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Advantageously said sponsor is reimbursed at least partially, in particular by said user of said communication service, in particular by determining a third cost. Thereby said sponsor gets all or part of the sponsored amount back, as soon as said user has enough credit on his or her account. This is particularly interesting for peer sponsoring in a prepaid communication service, where a first peer sponsors a second peer e.g. in case the second peer used up all his or her prepaid credit. The sponsoring first peer is reimbursed automatically after the second peer recharged his or her prepaid credit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously said rule depends on information about the location of said user of said communication service. This way the use of said communication service from or to a certain geographic location is sponsored. For example a government agency sponsors all calls from a certain geographic area of a country.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a first part of a telecommunication system. Said telecommunication system <b>100</b> comprises a first user device <b>101</b>, e.g. a first cellular phone or a first fixed line phone, and a second user device <b>102</b>, e.g. a second cellular phone or a second fixed line phone, that are connected to a communication means <b>103</b>, e.g. a next generation networks (NGN), referred to as telecommunications network <b>103</b> below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">At least a part of said telecommunications network <b>103</b> is operated by a first service provider and comprises for example links and nodes arranged so that a communication service offered by said first service provider may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Said telecommunications network <b>103</b> further comprises for example switches adapted to be configured so that said communication service may be passed from said first user device <b>101</b> to said second user device <b>102</b> or vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally said telecommunications network <b>103</b> comprises for example measuring means, e.g. said switches that are adapted to determine, e.g. measure, first information about said communication service. Such measurements are for example charging events CE containing said first information. Charging events CE can be a set of charging information forwarded by the network/switching towards billing systems or prepaid systems. More specifically, for prepaid charging, the signalling protocol can be intelligent network application protocol (INAP, e.g. CS-1, CAMEL or IS-826 protocol), Diameter protocol, LDAP or XML protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following not exhaustive list gives possible contents of an exemplary charging event CE:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0026">A first identifier of an originator of said communication service, e.g. the local, national or international phone number of a caller or a called party,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0027">A second identifier of a recipient, e.g. the local, national or international phone number of a caller or a called party,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0028">A third identifier that is unique for said communication service, e.g. a message identifier,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0029">A type of service, e.g. voice, SMS, MMS, data, content,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0030">A user location, e.g. geographic area or radio cell of originator or recipient of said communication service,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0031">A direction of said communication service, e.g. outgoing call or SMS, incoming call or SMS, roaming call or SMS,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0032">A time information, e.g. day of week, time of day, or</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0033">A payment type, e.g. prepaid, post-paid.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">Any other information available about said communication service, said telecommunications network or a user or a sponsor of said communication service can be part of said first information e.g. said charging event CE as well.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">The invention is not limited to measurements in form of charging events CE. If said first information about said communication service is obtained differently, e.g. by means of call data records, event data records or a dedicated signalling protocol, the invention can be applied likewise. For the sake of clarity said first information about said communication service is referred to as charging event CE below.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0051">For example said at least one sponsorship rule SR reflects the parties bound by and the terms of a business agreement. The sponsorship rule SR, for example contains information about who sponsors, who is sponsored, and what type of service is sponsored. This information is used for example to decide which user and which type of service is sponsored, and to find said sponsor.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0052">Additionally said sponsorship rule SR contains a rule R for determining the amount that is sponsored by said sponsor. For example, in case said sponsor agrees to pay at least partially for the use of said communication service by said user, said rule R defines, how an amount to charge to said sponsor is determined. For example said sponsor agrees to pay for example 10% of a first cost C<b>1</b> of said use of said communication service. In this case said rule R defines that said sponsor is charged 10% of said first cost C<b>1</b>. Said rule R is for example defined using a first value s containing information about said sponsor, e.g. an account number of said sponsor, and a second value r, containing a percentage to be charged to said sponsor, for example:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R</i>=(<i>s,r</i>),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<p id="p-0039" num="0054">Said at least one sponsorship rule SR is for example entered by said sponsor or said customer service representative into said sponsorship database via a Web-interface adapted to access said sponsorship database <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0055">Said total cost C<b>1</b> is determined for example in terms of credit by said rating server <b>203</b>, i.e. money in a currency applicable to the country of the service provider's location. The invention is not limited to monetary costs, but is likewise applied to billing systems adapted to charging costs differently, for example using credit points.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0056">To determine said total cost C<b>1</b> said rating server <b>203</b> receives said charging event CE and said product and customer information PCI. Said total cost C<b>1</b> is for example determined depending on said charging event CE and said product and customer information PCI according to a telecommunications rating method. Such telecommunication rating methods are well known to a person skilled in the art, e.g. from the 3GPP standard, and not described further here.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0057">Said total cost C<b>1</b> is sent from said rating server <b>203</b> to said charging server <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0058">Additionally said charging server <b>202</b> receives said rule R from said balance management server <b>201</b>. Said charging server <b>202</b> determines a second cost C<b>2</b> depending on said rule R. For sake of clarity said second cost C<b>2</b> is referred to as sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0059">Said charging server <b>202</b> determines said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> for example depending on said total cost C<b>1</b>. For example according to said rule R a percentage r of said total cost C<b>1</b> will be charged to said sponsor. In that case the sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> is for example calculated depending on the product of rule R and total cost C<b>1</b>, for example as follows:

<p id="p-0045" num="0060">In case no rule R is available, for example because said use of said communication service is not sponsored, said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> is Zero.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0061">Said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> is for example send to said billing pool <b>204</b> for example to be billed to said sponsor according to a telecommunications billing method well known to the person skilled in the art, e.g. according to 3GPP standard.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0062">The setup of said billing center <b>104</b> is exemplary with respect to the components included in said billing center <b>104</b>. Said processing means and said storage means can be located outside of said billing center <b>104</b>, decentralized for example in several parts of said telecommunications network <b>103</b>. The invention covers such setups as well.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0063">Said balance management server <b>201</b> determines said rule R dynamically depending on said at least one sponsorship rule SR.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0064">According to a first embodiment of said invention, said rule R is determined depending on said originator or said recipient of said communication service. Therefore said at least one sponsorship rule SR is defined depending on information about said originator or said recipient. Additional information about said communication service can be added, but is not required. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored in said sponsorship database <b>204</b> and enables a very efficient way of sponsoring.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0065">For example if said sponsor decides to sponsor the usage of said communication service originating from said first user device <b>101</b>, said at least one sponsorship rule SR is defined as a mapping of said fourth identifier to said rule R, for example:

<p id="p-0051" num="0066">Said rule R contains for example said first value s referencing said sponsor, e.g. said account number, and said second value r, e.g. r=*0.1, indicating said percentage of said total cost C<b>1</b> that is to be charged to said sponsor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a first flowchart of a method according to said first embodiment of the invention. The method starts as soon as an charging event CE for example from a phone call made by said first user operating said first user device <b>101</b>, is received by said billing center <b>104</b>. Techniques for making said communication services available directly and for recording and sending said charging event CE to said billing center <b>104</b> are well known to a person skilled in the art for example from fixed line telecommunications systems or next generation networks.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0068">After the start a step <b>301</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0069">In step <b>301</b> a test is performed to determine whether said charging event CE is received. If said charging event CE is received, a step <b>302</b> is executed. Otherwise said step <b>301</b> is executed again to continue waiting for said charging event CE.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0070">In step <b>302</b> said total cost C<b>1</b> is determined according to a telecommunications rating method, for example depending on said charging event CE or said product and customer information PCI. Afterwards a step <b>303</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">In step <b>303</b> said rule R is determined dynamically. Said rule R is determined for example by firstly extracting said first identifier from said charging event CE and secondly by searching said at least one sponsorship rule SR that maps said first identifier to said rule R. For example by finding said at least one sponsorship rule SR in which said fourth identifier is included and matches said first identifier. If no sponsorship rule SR is found, said rule R is set to be invalid, for example by setting said first value s to Zero. Afterwards a step <b>304</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">In step <b>304</b> a test is performed to determine whether said rule R was determined. If said rule R was determined, e.g. said constant s is not equal to Zero, said sponsor is found and a step <b>306</b> is executed. Else said sponsor is not found and a step <b>305</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">In step <b>305</b> a billing procedure according to said telecommunications billing method for service without sponsorship is performed to determine said total cost C<b>1</b>. Such telecommunications billing methods are well known to persons skilled in the art and not explained further. Afterwards the method ends.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0074">In step <b>306</b> said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> is determined, for example by applying said rule R to said total cost C<b>1</b>. For example said rule R is defined as pair of data, containing said first value s referencing said sponsor, and said second value r, e.g. r=*0.1, defining e.g. said percentage of said total cost C<b>1</b> that is to be charged to said sponsor. In this case said second cost C<b>2</b> is calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C</i>2<i>=C</i>1<i>*r. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

<p id="p-0060" num="0075">Afterwards a step <b>307</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0076">In step <b>307</b> a test is performed to determine whether said second cost C<b>2</b> is equal to said total cost C<b>1</b>. If said second cost C<b>2</b> is equal to said total cost C<b>1</b>, the sponsor will be charged for the entire total cost C<b>1</b> and a step <b>308</b> is executed. Otherwise, a step <b>309</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0077">In said step <b>308</b> said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> is added to said billing pool <b>204</b>, e.g. by saving said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> and said first value s according to said known telecommunications billing method. Afterwards the method ends.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0078">In step <b>309</b> a third cost C<b>3</b> is determined. For the sake of clarity said third cost C<b>3</b> is referred to as user's cost C<b>3</b> below. Said user's cost C<b>3</b> is for example determined depending on said total cost C<b>1</b>, said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> or said rule R.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0079">For example said user's cost C<b>3</b> is calculated depending on the difference between said total cost C<b>1</b> and said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> for example as follows:
<br/>

</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0080">Afterwards step <b>310</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0081">In step <b>310</b> said user's cost is added to said billing pool <b>204</b>, e.g. by saving said user's cost C<b>3</b> and said first identifier according to said known telecommunications billing method. Said first identifier is determined from said charging event CE. Afterwards the method ends.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0082">The generation of invoices for and sending of said invoices to said user or said sponsor is for example done by means of said known telecommunications billing method and not explained further here.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0083">The invention is not limited to any specific type of service, end user device or telecommunications network. Furthermore said method is likewise applied to prepaid or post-paid communication services. For post-paid communication services the method according to the invention is started for example after said use of said communication service finished. For prepaid communication services the method according to the invention is for example started every time a new billing period starts.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0084">In case said communication service is a prepaid communication service, said at least one sponsorship rule SR is for example set up to allow said first user to use or continue to use said prepaid communication service even if his or her own prepaid credit is not enough to cover said first cost C<b>1</b> for said prepaid communication service. This way for example a government agency could enable all prepaid users to continue to make phone calls for example in case of an emergency situation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0085">To that end, the method according to said first embodiment is amended to comprise an additional step for testing if said user has enough prepaid credit PC left. Said additional step is not shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and executed between steps <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> of the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. All other steps are the same as the steps of said method according to said first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0086">If said user has enough prepaid credit left, said step <b>305</b> is executed to perform regular prepaid billing, according to well known telecommunications prepaid billing methods. Otherwise said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> is calculated in said step <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0087">In this case said step <b>306</b> is modified to additionally use information about said prepaid credit that is still left to said user. Said sponsor's cost is, for example determined depending on the difference of said total cost C<b>1</b> and said prepaid credit PC, for example as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C</i>2<i>=C</i>1<i>&#x2212;PC. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0088">Further modifying said sponsorship rule SR and said step <b>306</b>, a parent can act as a sponsor and set up sponsorship for his child only for calls made from the child to recipients defined by the parent. Or a company or a company employee can sponsor one employee for calls made from said employee's phone to other employees of said company.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0089">To that end said fifth identifier, i.e. information about the receiving party, for example the phone number of said recipient is included into said sponsorship rule SR. Then in said step <b>306</b> said second identifier, identifying said recipient of said communication service is extracted. Then an additional search is performed to find said at least one sponsorship rule that contains said fifth identifier matching said second identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0090">A second embodiment of said invention is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0091">Said second embodiment is based on said first embodiment of the invention and the structure is similar to that of the first embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0092">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> an additional third processing means <b>401</b> is connected to said telecommunications network <b>103</b>. For the sake of clarity said fourth processing means <b>401</b> is referred to as advertisement server <b>401</b> below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0093">According to said second embodiment, only unidirectional communication services SMS are sent from said first user device <b>101</b> to said second user device <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0079" num="0094">Furthermore said telecommunications network <b>103</b> is set up to redirect said unidirectional communication service SMS via said advertisement server <b>401</b>. Methods for such redirection are well known to a person skilled in the art and not further described here.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0095">Said advertisement server <b>401</b> analyses said unidirectional communication service SMS to determine whether said unidirectional communication service SMS is eligible for sponsoring.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0096">Said unidirectional communication service SMS is eligible for sponsoring, if said sponsorship database <b>205</b> contains at least one sponsorship rule SR that applies to said unidirectional communication service SMS.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0097">If for example said unidirectional communication service SMS, e.g. a short message service message, is sent from said first user device <b>101</b> to said second user device <b>102</b>, said unidirectional communication service SMS contains said first identifier, which identifies said originator and said second identifier which identifies said recipient of said unidirectional communication service SMS. Additionally said unidirectional communication service SMS contains said third identifier, for example said message identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0098">Said advertisement server <b>401</b> extracts said first identifier from said unidirectional communication service SMS and looks up said at least one sponsorship rule SR, by finding said at least one sponsorship rule that contains said fourth identifier matching said first identifier. Therefore said advertisement server <b>401</b> is connected for example via a data link to said sponsorship database <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0099">If at least one sponsorship rule SR is found, said unidirectional communication service SMS is sponsored, and said advertisement server adds an advertisement to said unidirectional communication service SMS to create a modified communication service SMSA. Said advertisement depends for example on said sponsorship rule SR, in particular on said first value s, referencing said sponsor. The advertisement server <b>401</b> looks up said advertisement for example in an advertisement database that maps said first value s to said advertisement. Said advertisement database is for example configured by said sponsor before said service is offered.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0100">Said modified communication service SMSA is then sent to said second user device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0101">Alternatively unidirectional communication services SMS sent to said first user device <b>101</b> are redirected in the same way to said advertisement server <b>401</b> and a modified communication service SMSA is sent to said first user device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0102">Said advertisement server <b>401</b> keeps an advertisement data record ADR, which contains for example the at least one sponsorship rule SR, said first identifier and said third identifier. Said advertisement data record ADR is sent to said billing center <b>104</b> via a second data.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0103">The set up of the billing center <b>104</b> according to said second embodiment of the invention is for example based on the setup depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0104">Additionally or alternatively to said charging event CE the balance management server <b>201</b> according to said second embodiment receives said advertisement data record ADR. Both are stored for example temporarily in a volatile storage means for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0105">The method according to said second embodiment is based on the method according to said first embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0106">In an additional step that is executed between steps <b>302</b> and <b>303</b> a test is performed to determine whether an advertisement data record ADR matching said charging event CE has been received. For example a match is found, if said third identifier is contained in said charging event CE and said advertisement data record ADR. If a match is found, step <b>303</b> is executed. Otherwise a waiting procedure is started, to wait for the advertisement data record ADR. If no matching advertisement data record ADR is received within a predetermined period of time, said waiting procedure is stopped and step <b>303</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0107">According to said second embodiment step <b>303</b> of said first embodiment is modified to determine said rule R depending on said advertisement data record ADR. Said rule R is for example determined from said at least one sponsorship rule SR contained in said advertisement data record ADR.

<p id="p-0093" num="0108">All other steps are the same as the corresponding steps of said first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109">The first embodiment and the second embodiment apply to prepaid communication services as well as post-paid communication services.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">In a third embodiment of said invention said sponsor sponsors a prepaid communication service for said user in case a balance B, e.g. a credit left on a prepaid account, is equal or less than a predetermined first threshold, e.g. Zero. The sponsor then is reimbursed for said sponsorship by means of charging at least a part of said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> to said user, after said balance B is more than a predetermined second threshold, e.g. said user reloaded his prepaid account.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">Said third embodiment of the invention is based on the method according to said first embodiment or said second embodiment, hence all steps for determining said rule R, said total cost C<b>1</b>, said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> as well as the storage of said sponsor's cost C<b>2</b> are equivalent to the steps of aforementioned methods.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0112">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the telecommunication system and network node according to said third embodiment contain additionally a fourth processing means <b>501</b> and a third storage means <b>502</b> for storing said balance B.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0113">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the fourth processing means <b>501</b> receives said rule R from said balance management server <b>201</b>, said second cost C<b>2</b> from said charging server <b>202</b> and said balance B from said third storage means <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">This means that said balance B resembles for example an accumulation of said third cost C<b>3</b> charged to said user and payments from said user received by said billing center <b>104</b>.</p>

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R</i>1<i>=C</i>2<i>&#x2212;B, </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C</i>3<i>=R</i>1.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0124">Afterwards a step <b>605</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0125">In step <b>605</b> a test is performed to determine whether said reimbursement R<b>1</b> is greater than a third threshold, for example greater than Zero. In case said reimbursement R<b>1</b> is greater than said third threshold said user has enough credit on his prepaid account to perform reimbursement and a step <b>606</b> is executed. Otherwise the step <b>603</b> is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0126">In step <b>606</b> said reimbursement R<b>1</b> is stored as credit for said sponsor to said billing pool <b>204</b>. Furthermore said user's cost C<b>3</b> is charged to said user by sending it to said third storage means <b>502</b>. Said balance B is updated at the same time. Afterwards the method ends.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0127">Another embodiments of said invention include sponsorship rules SR that allow said balance management server <b>201</b> to determine a sponsored usage of said service by means of location of said user. To that end said balance management server <b>201</b> is adapted to determine said location for example from said first identifier, e.g. the phone number of the first user device <b>101</b> used by said user. This is particularly advantageous in case a government agency acts as sponsor for example for all phone calls made from a certain geographic area.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0128">Also said at least one sponsorship rule can be used to enable said service provider to charge for example higher costs to said sponsor, than to said user, for example to cover the cost of said service provider for providing said sponsorship service.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0129">Several of said at least one sponsorship rule SR mentioned above can be combined in many ways flexibly to create new sponsorship rules.</p>
