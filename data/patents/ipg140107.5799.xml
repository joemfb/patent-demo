<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This field generally relates to pushing data to a mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some mobile devices, such as cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable navigation devices (PNDs) and handheld game consoles, include applications that receive data over the network. Data sent to the mobile device may be either pushed or pulled. When data is pulled, the mobile device generally requests the data from a server. Pulling data enables the mobile device to retrieve data when it needs it. However, pulling data may also result in the mobile device making data requests when no new updates have been made or may result in delay in receiving data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When data is pushed, the server generally controls when data is sent to the mobile device. Pushing data enables the server to send data only when new updates are available. Further, the server may choose not to send data whenever new updates are available, instead periodically sending batch updates. However, because the server controls when the updates are made, the server may send updates when the mobile device does not need them. These updates may result in unneeded power consumption on the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Systems and methods are needed to push data to mobile devices more efficiently.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments relate to pushing data to mobile devices more efficiently. In a first embodiment, a computer-implemented method receives pushed data on a mobile device. The method includes: (a) recording, at a memory of the mobile device, information describing activity occurring on the mobile device during a first time period; (b) sending, from the mobile device to a server, data indicating the first time period and activity data indicating whether the mobile device was active during the first time period; and (c) during a second time period occurring after the recording (a) and sending (b), receiving application data pushed to the mobile device at a first rate determined based at least in part on the activity data sent to the server in (b), wherein the second time period is determined by the server based at least in part on the data indicating the first time period.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a second embodiment, a computer-implemented method for pushes data to a mobile device. The method includes: (a) receiving, on a server remote from the mobile device, data indicating a past time period and usage data of the mobile device during the past time period; (b) determining a time period in the future that corresponds to the past time period received in (a); (c) determining when to push application data to the mobile device during the future time period, wherein the application data is pushed periodically at a rate determined according to the usage data during the past time period received in (a); and (d) during the time period determined in (b), sending application data to the mobile device periodically as determined in (c).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram that illustrates a system for scheduling data pushes to a mobile device based on activity of the mobile device, according to an embodiment. System <b>100</b> includes a server <b>110</b> and a mobile device <b>120</b> coupled via one or more networks <b>102</b>, such as the Internet. Mobile device <b>120</b> includes a usage data provider module <b>122</b>, a push data receiver module <b>126</b> and a usage database <b>124</b>. Server <b>110</b> includes a usage data recorder module <b>112</b>, a push scheduler module <b>114</b>, and a data push module <b>116</b>. Mobile device <b>120</b> can be any wireless computing device capable of transmitting and/or receiving information wirelessly, such as a cellular telephone, portable digital assistant (PDA), tablet computing device, laptop, notebook, or netbook computer, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In general, system <b>100</b> may operate as follows. Mobile device <b>120</b> may record usage data in usage database <b>124</b>. Usage data provider module <b>122</b> may send usage data to server <b>110</b> via network(s) <b>102</b>. On server <b>110</b>, usage data recorder module <b>112</b> may receive the usage data. Push scheduler module <b>114</b> may use the usage data to determine a schedule for pushing data to mobile device <b>120</b>. At times specified by the schedule, data push module <b>116</b> may push data to push data receiver module <b>126</b> on mobile device <b>120</b>. Each of the components and its operation are described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As mentioned above, usage database <b>124</b> may store data relating to the usage associated with the mobile device. In embodiments, usage database <b>124</b> may store times and/or time periods when a user touches a touch screen included on the mobile device, when the mobile device is in sleep mode, or when the mobile device is unlocked. In an alternative embodiment, usage database <b>124</b> may store times and/or time periods when a user is using specific applications installed on the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A mobile device sleeps when it is in a state where it consumes less power than an awake state. While a mobile device consumes less power in a sleep state, it may consume more power than being turned off completely. To execute one or more operations, the mobile device generally must transition from a sleep state to an awake state. Transitioning from a sleep state to an awake state may take less time than starting the mobile device from a power-off state. A mobile device may automatically enter a sleep state after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Similar to the sleep state, the mobile device may also automatically enter a lock state after a period of inactivity. The lock state may serve to avoid inadvertent or unauthorized access to the mobile device, by only accepting a specific input to unlock the device. In an example, the mobile device may not accept any other input until a particular touch gesture input is received. Receipt of the particular touch gesture input may confirm that the user intends to access the device and that the touches are not accidental touches that may for example occur when the mobile device is in a user's pocket or purse. In addition to preventing inadvertent access, the lock state may prevent unauthorized access, such as access to a user's personal data, to the mobile device. The lock screen module may receive an input to authenticate the user and, in response to the authenticated input, unlock the mobile device. In an example, the input may be a touch gesture that the user had pre-set for authentication purposes. While in the lock state, the mobile device may display a pre-specified lock screen view.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Usage data provider module <b>122</b> may access usage database <b>124</b> and sends data to server <b>110</b>. The data sent by usage data provider module <b>122</b> may indicate a time period and usage data associated with the mobile device during the time period. An example <b>400</b> of data sent by usage data provider module <b>122</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In an embodiment, usage data provider module <b>122</b> may define and/or provide data that indicates one or more time periods during which the mobile device is an active state. In examples, the time periods when the mobile device is in an active state may be specified by which the mobile device sleeps or when the user is/was not currently operating and/or otherwise engaged with the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other examples, the time periods when the device is active may be designated by the periods when the screen is on, when an application is launched and running, when the user is inpuantting data (e.g., via button presses or screen touches), when user latency (e.g., the time that the user responds takes to a notification, such as an email notification) exceeds a threshold, etc. These various parameters may be used together to determine whether a device is active or even how actively the device is being used and, thus, how frequently to push data to the device. In examples, the various parameters may be used to determine a score, and the score may be used to determine the push schedule. In one example, the parameters may be each assigned a weight, and the score may be determined by taking the weighted average of the various parameters. In another example, the parameters may be inserted into a neural network or other machine learning algorithm that has been previously trained to determine a score based on the parameters. As is described below, the score may be used to determine a frequency (e.g., rate) at which to push data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, usage data provider module <b>122</b> may provide data that indicates a series of time periods in which the mobile device is active. Conversely, usage data provider module <b>122</b> may provide data that indicates a series of time periods in which the mobile device is inactive. In another embodiment, usage data provider module <b>122</b> may provide data indicating a time period when specific applications are not being used.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Usage data recorder module <b>112</b> may receive the data from usage data provider module <b>122</b>. In an embodiment, usage data recorder module <b>112</b> may save the usage data and corresponding time periods associated with a mobile device to a database (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Push scheduler module <b>114</b> can determine a schedule to push data to the mobile device based on the data gathered by usage data recorder module <b>112</b>. As described below, pushing data may involve sending data to a mobile device without a specific request for the data. The schedule includes at least one time period in the future and a frequency at which to push data during the future time period. Push scheduler module <b>114</b> determines the schedule based on past activity data.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, push schedule module <b>114</b> may determine the scheduling to instruct an application to push a data less frequently during inactive periods than during active periods. Specifically, push schedule module <b>114</b> forecasts future periods of inactivity based on the prior periods of inactivity. Push schedule module <b>114</b> may forecast periods of inactivity by assuming that a user's schedule is periodic, e.g., the scheduled remains relatively constant from week to week. If the mobile device was inactive until 6 am on previous Mondays, then push schedule module <b>114</b> may determine the push schedule to be more frequent after 6 am on Mondays, and less frequent before 6 am on Mondays.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For each time period, the push schedule may include a frequency associated with the time period. In one embodiment, push schedule module <b>114</b> may use a pre-defined value for forecasted periods of active usage (e.g., 1 min updates) and may use another pre-determined value for periods of inactive usage (e.g., 30 min updates). In another embodiment, the frequency may correspond to an amount of usage anticipated for that period. As mentioned above, the usage parameters such as a frequent at which the user makes screen touches or a latency time for a user to respond to a notification may be used to determine a score indicating how actively the mobile device is being used. In that embodiment, the score for a particular past time period may be used to forecast a degree of usage in a future time period. In this way, the schedule may include frequencies for each time period that correspond to anticipated usage for that time period. An example schedule <b>450</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Data push module <b>116</b> may send application data to mobile device <b>120</b> as determined by push scheduler module <b>114</b>. In an example, the data may be pushed periodically. Data may be &#x201c;pushed,&#x201d; as opposed to &#x201c;pulled,&#x201d; when data is sent from server <b>110</b> to mobile device <b>120</b>, when the transmission is not directly in response to a request from mobile device <b>120</b>. Data push module <b>116</b> may, for example, periodically send batch updates, sending the mobile device all known changes that have occurred to a data set since a previous update. While pushing data periodically, data push module <b>116</b> may be configured to &#x201c;skip&#x201d; a period if, for example, there is no data or little data to push. Data push module <b>116</b> sends application data at a frequency specified in the schedule determined by push scheduler module <b>114</b>. In this way, data push module <b>116</b> may push application data to mobile device <b>120</b> less frequently during periods of nonusage. In examples, data push module may push email data or social networking data.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Push data receiver module <b>126</b> may receive application data pushed by data push module <b>116</b>. As set forth above, the data is pushed based on forecasted usage data. By receiving push data less often during periods of inactivity when the pushed data is not needed, push data receiver module <b>126</b> conserves battery power of mobile device <b>120</b>. Each of the components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram that illustrates a system <b>200</b> for scheduling data pushes from an application server to a mobile device based on usage associated with the mobile device, according to an embodiment. In addition to the components of system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>200</b> includes mobile application(s) <b>230</b>, a usage detector module <b>228</b>, a usage analyzer database <b>218</b>, and application server(s) <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Mobile applications <b>230</b> may enable the mobile device to perform different functions. For example, the applications <b>230</b> may include a calendar application, an email application, or a media player application. In further examples, mobile device <b>120</b> may enable a user to cause mobile device <b>120</b> to download and install further applications <b>230</b> that add additional functionality to mobile device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Usage detector module <b>228</b> may be coupled to at least one of the mobile applications <b>230</b> to monitor whether it is active. Usage detector module <b>228</b> may monitor activity associated with the mobile device <b>120</b> at different times and records the mobile device's activity over time in usage database <b>124</b>. In an embodiment, usage detector module <b>228</b> may record when specific applications are in use, such as when calendar or email applications are in use. In another embodiment, usage detector module <b>228</b> may detect when mobile device <b>120</b> receives a user input, such as a touch input. In other embodiments, usage detector module <b>228</b> may record when mobile device <b>120</b> is asleep or locked, or, conversely, when mobile device <b>120</b> is awake or unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As mentioned above, usage database <b>124</b> may store usage data associated with mobile device <b>120</b>. Usage data provider module <b>122</b> may send data from usage database <b>124</b> to scheduling server <b>260</b> as activity data <b>252</b>. Usage data provider module <b>122</b> may aggregate and format data from usage database <b>124</b> to put it in a form for transmission. For example, usage data provider module <b>122</b> may determine time periods of inactivity (i.e., time periods during which the device is not being used and/or interacted with by a user) from usage database <b>124</b> and send the time periods in activity data <b>252</b>. An example <b>400</b> of activity data <b>252</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, activity data <b>252</b> may not include information or data identifying a user of the mobile device to protect the privacy of the user. To further protect the user's privacy, scheduling server <b>260</b> may be managed by a trusted entity and may communicate with mobile device <b>120</b> via a secure connection. For example, activity data <b>252</b> may be encrypted using a public key on mobile device <b>120</b>, and only scheduling server <b>260</b> may have the corresponding private key. Further, a user may be able to configure data usage provider module <b>122</b> to not send activity data <b>252</b>. In this way, a user can opt-in or opt-out of providing to scheduling server <b>260</b> any activity data associated with/based at least in part on her usage of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Scheduling server <b>260</b> may receive activity data <b>252</b>. In an embodiment, scheduling server <b>260</b> includes usage data recorder module <b>112</b>, usage analyzer database <b>218</b> and push scheduler module <b>114</b>. Usage data recorder module <b>112</b> receives activity data <b>252</b> and stores at least a portion of activity data <b>252</b> in usage analyzer database <b>218</b>. In an example, usage analyzer database <b>218</b> may only store usage data for a specified time period before it is automatically deleted. In this way, scheduling server <b>260</b> may protect the user's privacy.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">While only one mobile device <b>120</b> is shown for simplicity, scheduling server <b>260</b> may accept usage data from many different mobile devices. To encrypt usage data from the different mobile devices, each may include a public key corresponding to a private key of scheduling server <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Push scheduler module <b>114</b> may determine scheduling data <b>254</b> specifying when to push data to the mobile device. Scheduling data <b>254</b> may specify a frequency at which to push data during a particular time period in the future. Push scheduler module <b>114</b> may determine scheduling data <b>254</b> based on the data stored in usage analyzer database <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, push scheduler module <b>114</b> may determine scheduling data <b>254</b> by merely determining the times during the week when the mobile device, or a particular application having instructions stored on the mobile device, is not in use. In other embodiments, push scheduler module <b>114</b> may forecast periods when a user would likely not use the mobile device (or applications thereon) using pattern recognition algorithms. An example <b>450</b> of scheduling data <b>254</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Once determined, scheduling data <b>254</b> is sent from scheduling server <b>260</b> to application servers <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By having a scheduling server <b>260</b> separate from application servers <b>240</b>, there is no need to send activity data <b>252</b> to individual application servers <b>240</b>. In other words, data that specifies the user's past usage habits is not sent to individual application servers <b>240</b>. Only the data speculating how the user may use the mobile devices in the future is sent to application servers <b>240</b>. In this way, separating the functionality of scheduling server <b>260</b> and application servers <b>240</b> may serve to address privacy concerns.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Application servers <b>240</b> push application data <b>256</b> to mobile devices. Application data can include, for example, calendar data, email data, social networking, and media data, such as podcasts. In an example, each application server <b>240</b> may serve application data for a corresponding mobile application <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Application servers <b>240</b> each receive scheduling data <b>254</b>. Each application server <b>240</b> includes a data push module <b>116</b> to push application data <b>256</b> at frequencies specified by the scheduling data <b>254</b>. In an example, during periods of active usage, data push module <b>116</b> may push data to mobile device <b>120</b> more frequently than during periods when the mobile device is being used less intensively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment, scheduling server <b>260</b> may send different scheduling data <b>254</b> to different application servers <b>240</b>. For example, scheduling server <b>260</b> may send to an application server <b>240</b> scheduling data that specifically forecasts the usage of a mobile application <b>230</b> that corresponds to the application server <b>240</b>. In this way, data pushes can be scheduled more precisely based on usage of a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Usage database <b>124</b> and usage analyzer database <b>218</b> may be any type of persistent memory including, for example, a SQL database.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Mobile device <b>120</b>, scheduling server <b>260</b>, and application servers <b>240</b> may be implemented on any type of computing device. Such computing device can include, but is not limited to, a personal computer, mobile device such as a mobile phone, workstation, embedded system, game console, television, set-top box, or any other computing device. Further, a computing device can include, but is not limited to, a device having a processor and memory for executing and storing instructions. Software may include one or more applications and an operating system. Hardware can include, but is not limited to, a general-purpose processor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field-programmable gate array (FPGA), memory graphical user interface display and/or the like. The computing device may also have multiple processors and multiple shared or separate memory components. For example, the computing device may be a clustered computing environment or server farm.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments of the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer program products, i.e., one or more modules of computer program instructions encoded on a tangible program carrier for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The computer readable medium can be a machine readable storage device, a machine readable storage substrate, a memory device, a composition of matter effecting a machine readable propagated signal, or a combination of one or more of them.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A computer program (also known as a program, software, software application, script, or code) can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, or declarative or procedural languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program does not necessarily correspond to a file in a file system. A program can be stored in a portion of a file that holds other programs or data (e.g., one or more scripts stored in a markup language document), in a single file dedicated to the program in question, or in multiple coordinated files (e.g., files that store one or more modules, sub programs, or portions of code). A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers that are located at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Processors suitable for the execution of a computer program include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and any one or more processors of any kind of digital computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for performing instructions and one or more memory devices for storing instructions and data. Generally, a computer will also include, or be operatively coupled to receive data from or transfer data to, or both, one or more mass storage devices for storing data, e.g., magnetic, magneto optical disks, or optical disks. However, a computer need not have such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart that illustrates a method <b>300</b> for scheduling data pushes, which may be used in operation of system <b>200</b>. For clarity, method <b>300</b> is described with respect to components of system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that it is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Method <b>300</b> begins by detecting activity data of mobile device <b>120</b> at step <b>302</b>. At step <b>304</b>, usage data may be sent to the scheduling server <b>260</b>. As mentioned above, the usage data sent at step <b>304</b> may indicate an amount of usage during a past time period. In an example, the usage data may simply indicate a time period in which mobile device <b>120</b> was not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At step <b>306</b>, scheduling, server <b>260</b> may receive the usage data. Based on the past usage data received at step <b>306</b>, a push schedule is determined at step <b>308</b>. The push schedule may specify time periods in the future and, for the time periods, frequencies at which to push data to the mobile device at step <b>308</b>. At step <b>310</b>, scheduling server <b>260</b> may send scheduling data with at least a portion of the push schedule to application server <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At step <b>312</b>, application server <b>240</b> may receive the scheduling data. Application server <b>240</b> may push application data to mobile device <b>120</b> at times specified by the scheduling data at step <b>314</b>. In this way, application server <b>240</b> may push application data to mobile device <b>120</b> less frequently when the mobile device is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a diagram <b>400</b> illustrating an example of activity data provided by the mobile device.
