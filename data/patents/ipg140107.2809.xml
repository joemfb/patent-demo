<br/>
Compound 1 is described and claimed in International PCT publication WO 2006002421 and has the following molecular formula: C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>28</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Compound 1 has been demonstrated to restore the function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, the defective cell membrane protein responsible for the progression of CF. Defects in the CFTR protein can affect the transport of chloride and other ions across cells, and lead to the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs of patients with CF. This mucus can foster chronic infection and inflammation, and can result in irreversible lung damage. Potentiator compounds such as Compound 1 can increase the probability that the CFTR channel is open, which could result in an increase in chloride transport across the cell surface in some patients. In laboratory experiments, using cells from patients with CF where CFTR proteins are present on the cell surface, Compound 1 has restored the function of defective CFTR channels.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Solid forms of Compound 1 are described herein. The properties of a solid relevant to its efficacy as a drug can be dependent on the form of the solid. For example, in a drug substance, variation in the solid form can lead to differences in properties such as dissolution rate, oral absorption, bioavailability, toxicology results and even clinical trial results. In some embodiments, the solid forms of Compound 1 are co-forms, for example, salts, solvates, co-crystals and hydrates of Compound 1.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0190">Crystal structures of forms I, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XIII, XV, and XVI have been solved. The structural data of these crystal forms are given below: Data for each form was collected either on a Bruker 1000 SMART CCD diffractometer at 120K using Mo K&#x3b1; radiation or on a Bruker APEX II CCD diffractometer at 100K using Cu K&#x3b1; radiation. Single crystals were picked from mother liquors. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the APEX software. The structures were solved and refined with the SHELX-TL package.</p>

<p id="p-0229" num="0261">Methods of Using Compound 1 and Solid Forms Thereof</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0262">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a condition, disease, or disorder implicated by CFTR. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating a condition, disease, or disorder implicated by a deficiency of CFTR activity, the method comprising administering a composition comprising a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein to a subject, preferably a mammal, in need thereof (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI).</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0263">A &#x201c;CFTR-mediated disease&#x201d; as used herein is a disease selected from cystic fibrosis, Hereditary emphysema, Hereditary hemochromatosis, Coagulation-Fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as Protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, Lipid processing deficiencies, such as Familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, Abetalipoproteinemia, Lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/Pseudo-Hurler, Mucopolysaccharidoses, Sandhof/Tay-Sachs, Crigler-Najjar type II, Polyendocrinopathy/Hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus, Laron dwarfism, Myleoperoxidase deficiency, Primary hypoparathyroidism, Melanoma, Glycanosis CDG type 1, Hereditary emphysema, Congenital hyperthyroidism, Osteogenesis imperfecta, Hereditary hypofibrinogenemia, ACT deficiency, Diabetes insipidus (DI), Neurophyseal DI, Neprogenic DI, Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome, Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington, Spinocerebullar ataxia type I, Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and Myotonic dystrophy, as well as Spongiform encephalopathies, such as Hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Fabry disease, Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, COPD, dry-eye disease, and Sjogren's disease.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0264">In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method of treating cystic fibrosis, hereditary emphysema, hereditary hemochromatosis, coagulation-fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, lipid processing deficiencies, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, abetalipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/pseudo-Hurler, mucopolysaccharidoses, Sandhof/Tay-Sachs, Crigler-Najjar type II, polyendocrinopathy/hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus, Laron dwarfism, myleoperoxidase deficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism, melanoma, glycanosis CDG type 1, congenital hyperthyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, hereditary hypofibrinogenemia, ACT deficiency, Diabetes insipidus (DI), neurophyseal DI, neprogenic DI, Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome, Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington, spinocerebullar ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and myotonic dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease, Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, COPD, dry-eye disease, or Sjogren's disease, comprising the step of administering to said mammal an effective amount of a composition comprising a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0265">According to an alternative preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cystic fibrosis comprising the step of administering to said mammal a composition comprising a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI).</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0266">According to the invention an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of a solid state form of Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is that amount effective for treating or lessening the severity of any of the diseases recited above.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0267">A solid state form of Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for treating or lessening the severity of one or more of the diseases recited above.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0268">In certain embodiments, a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients who exhibit residual CFTR activity in the apical membrane of respiratory and non-respiratory epithelia. The presence of residual CFTR activity at the epithelial surface can be readily detected using methods known in the art, e.g., standard electrophysiological, biochemical, or histochemical techniques. Such methods identify CFTR activity using in vivo or ex vivo electrophysiological techniques, measurement of sweat or salivary Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup> concentrations, or ex vivo biochemical or histochemical techniques to monitor cell surface density. Using such methods, residual CFTR activity can be readily detected in patients heterozygous or homozygous for a variety of different mutations, including patients homozygous or heterozygous for the most common mutation, &#x394;F508.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0269">In one embodiment, a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients within certain genotypes exhibiting residual CFTR activity, e.g., class III mutations (impaired regulation or gating), class IV mutations (altered conductance), or class V mutations (reduced synthesis) (Lee R. Choo-Kang, Pamela L., Zeitlin, <i>Type I, II, III, IV, and V cystic fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Defects and Opportunities of Therapy</i>; Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine 6:521-529, 2000). Other patient genotypes that exhibit residual CFTR activity include patients homozygous for one of these classes or heterozygous with any other class of mutations, including class I mutations, class II mutations, or a mutation that lacks classification.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0270">In one embodiment, a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof is useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients within certain clinical phenotypes, e.g., a moderate to mild clinical phenotype that typically correlates with the amount of residual CFTR activity in the apical membrane of epithelia. Such phenotypes include patients exhibiting pancreatic insufficiency or patients diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis and congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or mild lung disease.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0271">The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression &#x201c;dosage unit form&#x201d; as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term &#x201c;patient&#x201d;, as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0272">The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0273">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0274">Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0275">The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0276">In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0277">Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0278">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar--agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0279">Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0280">The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0281">Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are prepared by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0282">It will also be appreciated that the solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof can be employed in combination therapies, that is, a solid form described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as &#x201c;appropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0283">In one embodiment, the additional agent is selected from a mucolytic agent, bronchodialator, an anti-biotic, an anti-infective agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, a CFTR modulator other than a compound of the present invention, or a nutritional agent.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0284">The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0285">A solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device comprising a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a solid state form of Compound 1 described herein (e.g., one of Forms I through XVI) or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition thereof, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition.</p>
