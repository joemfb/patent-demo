<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 61/297,378 entitled &#x201c;Filler Panel with Cable Management Feature&#x201d; filed Jan. 22, 2010, the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to filler panels for equipment shelves and, more particularly, to a filler panel having a cable management feature.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The infrastructure behind modern electronic systems increasingly requires deployment of multiple communication devices in systems that consolidate the various device components into racks or shelves, which may reduce the storage and operation space required by the owner of the infrastructure as well as easing the effort required for operation or maintenance. The devices stored in these racks or shelves may include communication network components such as amplifiers, switches, network management cards, network interface cards, or other devices. However, in many instances not all available space within the rack is in use at a given point in time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Filler panels are devices used to fill the unused space in such a rack or shelf. These panels serve many uses, including electromagnetic shielding (to ensure proper operation of the system components) and aesthetic appearance of the rack as a whole. Filler panels are also used to maintain airflow, meet certification requirements (e.g., GR-63-CORE and GR-1089-CORE), and provide EMI/ESD functionality. As more electronic devices are implemented and operated in consolidated racks or shelves, manufacturers and suppliers of such racks face increasing challenges in maintaining performance levels required by end-users while reducing the manufacturing and operating costs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional filler panels have been made from metal or mostly metal and are often rectangular boxes. Such a design use a lot of material and are costly. Filler panels typically come in three shapes&#x2014;rectangular box style, cover style, and blade style. The rectangular filler panels are typically of a four-walled construction. The cover style is just a cover that covers an opening of a shelf when a unit is not installed in the opening. The blade style is a combination of a cover and a single walled blade that guides the filler panel into the opening in the shelf. It covers the opening but uses a single walled blade to form the filler panel. Certain filler panels have a crude means to store a limited number of connectors (one or two) outside of the shelf. The connectors are stored in a removable foam pocket that is attached to the outside of the filler panel (outside of the shelf when the filler panel is installed).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present description relates to a new filler panel design for use in electronic device shelves, racks, cabinets and the like (generally referred to herein as &#x201c;shelves&#x201d;). Such a filler panel may be used to fill unused portions of the shelf, such as slots or bays, that do not have an associated electronic device installed. For the purposes of this disclosure, an electronic device may include any device or component configured for use in an electronics system, whether optical, mechanical, electrical, or otherwise. For example, an electronic device may be an optical amplifier card, a network storage device, a network interface card, multiplexer, a dispersion compensation module, or other device or component used in an electronics system and configured to be stored, maintained, and/or operated within a storage shelf, rack or cabinet. Such a shelf, rack or cabinet may be of standard size that accepts modular components, or may be custom-built and sized for a particular purpose. An electronic device may also include any electronic device or component configured for storage and/or operation in a shelf, rack or cabinet system, such as a computer server that houses server blades or other circuit boards in a shelf. The figures discussed herein disclose a filler panel for use in a telecommunications node; however, this should not be seen to limit the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, the filler panel disclosed herein may be applicable to many other environments, such as the storage and operation of computer servers, RF/Microwave equipment, or other devices requiring the use of electromagnetic shielding and blockage of open space within a storage shelf, rack or cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Although the terms &#x201c;electronics&#x201d; shelf and &#x201c;electronic&#x201d; device are used, it should be understood that in certain embodiments an electronic device (as that term is used herein) may be a passive component that does not actually include any electronics. As an example only, a shelf of an optical communications node may include passive dispersion compensation modules and other modules that do not include electronics. Such modules are included within the scope of the term &#x201c;electronic device&#x201d; as used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Due to the close proximity of multiple electronic devices within the shelf, the aggregate electromagnetic fields produced by the electronic devices, which may be significant, may leak from the shelf. Thus, filler panels may be composed of materials that provide for electromagnetic shielding in order to prevent this leakage. There are two primary, related difficulties in creating filler panels with the requisite level of electromagnetic shielding. The most difficult of these is cost. Various known materials may provide acceptable levels of electromagnetic shielding. For instance, metals and conductive polymers, such as plastics impregnated with conductive fibers (e.g., steel), may be used for filler panels. While conductive polymers offer a less expensive alternative to using metallic or other conductive materials for manufacture of filler panels, these materials remain expensive. Additionally, the material properties of this relatively new class of materials remains poorly understood in comparison to traditional conductive materials (e.g., metals) or traditional, nonconductive plastics.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second, related difficulty is aesthetics. The presence of the conductive material within a conductive polymer may make it difficult or impossible to provide a customized or matchable color or design to a specific end-user. The properties of traditional metallic conductors, whether used alone or as a fiber within the conductive polymer, increase the variability of coloring the filler panel. As a result, the aesthetic appeal of filler panels from different batches, or obtained at different times, may be undesirable in the eyes of the end-user. A solution to both difficulties is to manufacture only a portion of filler panel from a conductive material (when necessary for electromagnetic shielding), while using less expensive materials that may be more readily customizable for the remainder.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, another problem that exists with the use of shelves and existing filler panels is that such filler panels do not provide an adequate way to deal with the cabling or wiring that may be associated with the empty shelf areas that the filler panels are occupying. For example, an optical communication shelf may have optical cables pre-positioned at the shelf such that any new optical cards added to the shelf can be quickly and easily installed in the shelf and connected to the appropriate optical cables. Embodiments of the present disclosure also provide a cable management feature that enables the user to easily store such pre-positioned cables inside the shelf and filler panel to protect the cables from damage.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate a filler panel <b>100</b> that may be used in a shelf <b>10</b> that supports one or more electronic devices, such as communication equipment. In some embodiments, the shelf <b>10</b> may be used in optical networking equipment, such as in the Fujitsu Flashwave 9500 series platform. As mentioned above, filler panel(s) <b>100</b> may be used when all of the slots, bays or the other openings (generally referred to herein as &#x201c;slots&#x201d; <b>12</b> within the shelf <b>10</b> are not currently taken by electronic devices, such as optical line cards, amplifier cards, controller cards, and the like. For instance, the manufacturer of the shelf may provide expansion slots within the shelf <b>10</b> so that the end-user may later expand its use of the shelf <b>10</b> without needing to purchase an additional shelf. Filler panel <b>100</b> is an innovative modular design that uses color-matched non-conductive plastic and a small portion of conductive material (when necessary) that can be used to meet thermal and FCC emissions requirements while providing flexible cable/wire/fiber management for a wide range of cable/wire/fiber types.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Filler panel <b>100</b> includes a main body <b>120</b> that is made of a non-conductive plastic and a electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b> that is used to provide electromagnetic shielding. The main body <b>120</b> is formed to generally fill the area of the electronics shelf in which it is inserted and may be made of any suitable type of plastic or other suitable material. For example, in one embodiment, main body <b>120</b> is made of a blend of polystyrene and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). In another embodiment, main body <b>120</b> may made of Cycoloy. In particular embodiments, main body <b>120</b> is UL94-V0 fire rated. Main body <b>120</b> may be formed by injection molding or any other suitable process. Main body <b>120</b> has a front wall <b>124</b>, a side wall <b>126</b>, and a back wall <b>128</b>. The front wall <b>124</b> and back wall <b>128</b> may have a width that is similar to the width of the slot in which the filler panel <b>100</b> is to be inserted. The side wall <b>126</b> may have a depth that is similar the depth of the slot in which the filler panel <b>100</b> is to be inserted (minus the depth of electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b>). The lack of a second side wall may provide for access to clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> for cable storage.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b> may be a conductive plastic (such as a polycarbonate/ABS base with embedded nickel-coated carbon fiber, as one example), but could also be any other type of conductive material, such as metal. Electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b> may be formed by injection molding or any other suitable process. Electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b> may be configured in certain embodiments to interface with or generally conform to an electronic interface intended to be coupled with an electronic device, such as an electronics card, inserted into the slot of the shelf. In the illustrated embodiment, the electromagnetic shielding is needed at the back of the shelf and thus electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b> is positioned at the back end of the card (the end that is inserted first into the shelf) and coupled to back wall <b>128</b>. However, the electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b> could also be located at the front end of the card and reconfigured accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As discussed above, filler panel <b>100</b> also has a cable management feature that is implemented in the illustrated embodiment through the use of several retaining clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may be formed as part of the main body <b>120</b> and are configured to hold cables, wire, fibers or the like (hereinafter generally referred to as &#x201c;cables&#x201d;). Each clip <b>102</b> is designed to hold the end of one or more cables (such as connectors located on the end of the cables) and clip <b>104</b> is designed to hold several cables that are routed through an opening <b>106</b> in the filler panel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the use of clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to hold several different types of cables <b>110</b> and their associated connectors <b>112</b>. Clips <b>102</b> may support any suitable type and size of connectors <b>112</b> and clip <b>104</b> may be configured to hold any suitable number and size of cables <b>110</b>. Clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are shaped such that a part of a connector <b>112</b> or a cable <b>110</b> may be inserted into the clip and retained. For example, clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may comprise a generally &#x201c;C&#x201d; shaped arm that is somewhat flexible (due to the nature of the plastic used to form clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>). The arm may be flexed to insert a connector <b>112</b> or a cable <b>110</b> under the arm and may then return to it original position to retain the connector <b>112</b> or cable(s) <b>110</b>. Any other suitable clip configurations may alternatively be used. Clips may be formed integrally with side wall <b>126</b> (for example, molded as part of side wall <b>126</b>) or may be separately formed and coupled for side wall <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate similar features of a filler panel <b>200</b> configured for a larger expansion bay in a shelf. Like filler panel <b>100</b>, filler panel <b>200</b> may have a main body <b>220</b> and electromagnetic shielding portions <b>222</b> (two or more electromagnetic shielding portions <b>222</b> may be present to accommodate the larger bay size and/or the existence of multiple card slots in the bay). Main body <b>220</b> may be fabricated from the same materials as main body <b>120</b> and electromagnetic shielding portions <b>222</b> may be fabricated from the same materials as electromagnetic shielding portion <b>122</b>. Main body <b>220</b> may have a front wall <b>224</b>, a side wall <b>226</b>, and a back wall <b>228</b>. The front wall <b>224</b> and back walls <b>228</b> may have a width that is similar to the width of the slot in which the filler panel <b>200</b> is to be inserted. The side wall <b>226</b> may have a depth that is similar the depth of the slot in which the filler panel <b>200</b> is to be inserted (minus the depth of electromagnetic shielding portion <b>222</b>). The lack of a second side wall may provide for access to clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> for cable storage. As with filler panel <b>100</b>, filler panel <b>200</b> has clips <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> for cable management. Filler panel <b>200</b> may also include a cable retention slot <b>240</b> which is a hole formed in a support rib <b>242</b> of the panel <b>200</b>. Cables may be feed through slot <b>240</b> before being secured in clips <b>102</b>. Retention slot <b>240</b> aids the user when seating or unseating a filler panel into a electronic/passive shelf by keeping cables out of the way (keeps fibers from drooping and getting entangled with adjacent material). Filler panel <b>200</b> may also include cable guides <b>244</b> which guides the cables between clip <b>104</b> and retention slot <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Filler panel <b>200</b> also includes a number of slots <b>210</b> which can accommodate the storage of cables inside the front wall of panel <b>200</b>. The cables may be easily inserted into slots <b>210</b> while the filler panel <b>200</b> is installed enabling easier storage of and access to the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the use of such slots <b>210</b> to stow a number of cables. As illustrated, each slot <b>210</b> is configured (e.g., through molding as part of main body <b>220</b>) to hold the connector <b>112</b> of a cable such that the cable is held in place. While clips <b>102</b> serve to hold cables out of the way and may be used for storage of cables that will be needed if a electronic device is inserted at some point in the slot of the card shelf occupied by filler panel <b>200</b>, slots <b>210</b> allow for storage of cables for easier access and without the need to remove the filler panel. For example, slots <b>210</b> may be used to hold optical fiber connectors (for example, Dual LC or 2&#xd7; Single LC fiber connectors). The connectors may slide in from the side of slots <b>210</b> such that the cable boot exits the front openings. Slots <b>210</b> may alternatively be configured to accept other connectors. Slots <b>210</b> may have an associated partition <b>230</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to prevent airflow into the main body <b>220</b>. Partition <b>230</b> maintains airflow through main body and prevents air from escaping through slots <b>210</b>.</p>
