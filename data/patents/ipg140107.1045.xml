<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This patent application is for a guitar case storage rack or stand. It is novel because it is for cases and not directly for instruments and because it has a number of practical, new features. The invention provides a previously unheard of combination of security and access. The gold standard for guitar storage is &#x201c;case-kept.&#x201d; In the past, &#x201c;case-kept&#x201d; also has meant inaccessible. However, the invention in this application provides for &#x201c;case-kept&#x201d; security while, at the same time, providing for really more accessibility than with instruments that hang on walls or rest on stands. First, the lids of the cases are held closed or open at the users will. Second, the case rack rolls, spins, and stays immobile at the will of the user. Third, the case rack transforms into a dolly to be used for such things as heavy amplifiers, monitors, mixing boards, and the like. Finally, the case rack adjusts to accommodate a wide range of cases.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing storage racks for guitars and similar instruments (for example, banjos, and bass guitars) hold instruments in a number of ways. For example, the instruments hang from their necks just below their headstocks or they rest on bottom edge of their lower bouts and lean their backs against the device at the upper bout, or they lean their necks against the device. In contrast to storing guitars, cases such as guitar cases and other similar instrument cases are generally stored in closets by rotating the case so that it rests against a closet wall. There are existing case racks that rely on rotating the cases. Alternatively, cases are tipped back to rest on a wall. This invention is related to tipping a case back to lean against one wall and rotating it clockwise at the same time to lean against another perpendicular wall as if in an inside corner. What will become clear is that this simple solution only replicates the attitude of a case held by the invention; it does not address all the problems that are solved by this invention. For example, the lid binds when trying to open it while the case is leaning back against one wall and rotated against a perpendicular wall. There are other problems like the relative insecurity of simply using the walls for support and the immobility of the arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The essential features of this invention are unprecedented in the market. This is a patent application for a case rack that simultaneously holds a case tipped backward and rotated to the right so that one case or a plurality of cases are held such that the lids of the cases are easily left closed or left open. When open, the guitars do not fall out. The ability to be held open or closed allows for very rapid access to a plurality, defined as one or more, of instruments while providing case-kept protection of the instrument or instruments when they are not in use. By arranging a plurality of cases around a central axis so that each tipped backwards and each is rotated to the right, the cases are held in a very compact group. This is in contrast to spreading cases out on a floor or a table or leaning them against a wall.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The case rack can be mobile which increases the access to instruments in addition to allowing the rack with cases to move from one place to another. It can spin around its central axis and roll in any direction. Spinning is particularly useful, because an instrumentalist can remain in one place, sitting or standing, and have rapid access to any of the cases on the rack by spinning the rack. In order to reduce the tendency for the case rack to roll inadvertently, the case rack can be made immobile.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the case rack folds and rolls in its folded configuration. As a result, it can be said that the case rack transforms into a dolly. In order to reduce the tendency for the dolly to roll inadvertently, it can be made immobile. The folding of the rack into the dolly configuration is accomplished by removing the cap from the rack and then folding the hinged struts into the shape of a cross. Finally, the cap is reattached below the folded supports. The fact that the case rack folds also means that the rack itself stores very compactly.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates multiple guitar cases being contained by the invention in this patent application, a guitar case rack or stand. This shows the cases being tipped back as indicated by arrow <b>1</b> and being rotated to the right, turned clockwise, as indicated by arrow <b>2</b>. The upshot of a guitar case being tipped backward and simultaneously rotated to the right is that if the lid of a case is left open, it stays open, and a guitar in the case does not fall out of the case. In addition, if the lid is left closed, it stays closed even if it is not locked or latched.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that when there is a plurality of guitar cases in a row, it is useful to rotate the cases approximately twenty four degrees off of vertical to achieve maximum compactness. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cases are rotated twenty four degrees, <b>3</b>, so that the lower bout of one case fits into the waist of the case to its left.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The overall shape of the case rack is pyramidal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the cap, <b>4</b>, the base, <b>5</b>, and the struts, <b>6</b>. The sides of the pyramid are approximately 18 degrees off of vertical. So the sides are very steep. There is, of course, a trade-off that involves compactness and security regarding the tendency of guitars to stay in their cases. We find that 18 degrees provides ample security and remarkable compactness.</p>

Number <b>7</b> shows the top of the cap which is surrounded by a lip intended to contain small objects such as guitar picks, tuners, capos and the like. Number <b>8</b> shows that the struts are set back from the base and cap sides. This setback allows the rack to accommodate cases with convex backs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the supports for the guitars. The number <b>9</b> shows the supports at the cap that are perpendicular to the sides of the cap. The number <b>10</b> shows a similar support on an extension that is used to accommodate rectangular cases. All these supports are dowels that are foam covered. The number <b>11</b> shows supports that are parallel to the sides of the cap but run perpendicular to the case necks. The end of the supports labeled <b>11</b> have a rubber covering that would be like a cane tip. Note that the supports labeled <b>11</b> are not all necessarily the same length. Length varies to accommodate differences in the width of cases. For example a short support is shown in the drawing on the side of the case rack that is meant to accommodate a rectangular case.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">CONCLUSIONS, RAMIFICATIONS, AND SCOPE</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This invention is a guitar case rack. It is not a guitar rack. It can accommodate the cases for a variety of instruments: guitars, bass guitars, banjos, banjitars and so on. It can also accommodate cases with various designs: ordinary hourglass-shaped cases, rectangular cases, cases with convex backs, and cases with concave neck backs. The goal is to allow easy access to instruments while, at the same time, providing good security for instruments in their cases as well as compact storage for the cases.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One aspect of access to the instruments is facilitated by holding the cases tipped back and simultaneously rotated to the right. This combination allows the lids to be opened and to stay open and to keep guitars from falling out regardless of whether the cases have been left open. There are other guitar case racks that rely on rotating the cases to the right, but these racks require the cases to be removed from the rack and put elsewhere, a table or the floor, to open the lid and to get access to the instrument. The combination of tipping the case back and rotating it to the right allows the case to stay on the rack while the instruments are accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another aspect of access is facilitated by the case rack being mobile. Being able to spin the rack is especially important as it allows the instrumentalist to stay in one position and switch instruments quickly. This facilitates A-B comparisons of instruments in the studio and changing instruments in performance settings. The ability of the rack to roll allows a plurality of guitars to easily be moved in their cases from one part of a studio to another, from one studio to another, from the stage to backstage, or from backstage to a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The downsides of being able to spin and roll are obvious. First, it creates a temptation for some people to use the case rack inappropriately, as a people mover. Of course, consumers must be warned against misuse of this product. Second, the case rack could move inadvertently because it is bumped or because it is placed on a floor that is not flat. The consequences of moving inadvertently are potentially serious: for example, a case rack could roll off a stage. However, the casters that allow the case rack to spin and roll can be of the locking type and thus can remove the most serious risks if the locks are used. Also, when immobility is desired, the casters can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Two distinct goals are achieved by making the case rack fold. First, the case rack itself can be stored compactly. Second, it can be used as a dolly. Suppose that a band is preparing to leave an event. First, the band or its crew rolls the rack filled with guitars in their cases to their vehicle. They remove the guitars in their cases from the rack for transit, fold the rack into its dolly configuration, and return to the stage to get other equipment such as amplifiers and drum kits. After getting this equipment to the vehicle, the rack is stored in the vehicle and off they go: people, guitars, other equipment, and the case rack. Obviously, this process is reversed when they arrive at the venue. In addition, the fact that the case rack folds facilitates shipping with no assembly required.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This invention is for a guitar case rack that holds a plurality of guitar cases with the case lids open or closed. It spins, rolls, or stays in place at the desire of the user. It folds and still rolls transforming into a robust dolly. It can accommodate a wide variety of case designs.</p>
