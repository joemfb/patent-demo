<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon which deposits polycrystalline silicon on the surface of a heated silicon seed rod to produce a polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-164298, filed Jun. 24, 2008, and Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-135831, filed Jun. 5, 2009, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An apparatus employing Siemens method is known as an apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon. In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon using the Siemens method, a number of silicon seed rods are arranged in the reactor. The silicon seed rods in the reactor are heated, and raw material gas including mixed gas of chlorosilane gas and hydrogen gas is supplied to the reactor to come into contact with the heated silicon seed rods. On a surface of a silicon seed rod, polycrystalline silicon is produced by a hydrogen reduction reaction and a thermal decomposition reaction of the raw material gas.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such an apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon, the silicon seed rods are disposed so as to stand upright on the electrodes arranged at an inner bottom portion of the reactor. Then, an electric current is applied to the silicon seed rods from the electrodes, and the silicon seed rods generate heat by the resistance thereof. At this time, the raw material gas which is jetted from below is come into contact with the surfaces of the silicon seed rods to form polycrystalline silicon rods. A plurality of the electrodes holding the silicon seed rods is provided so as be distributed over almost the whole region of the inner bottom face of the reactor, and as described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 2007-107030, is provided in through-holes of a bottom plate of the reactor so as to surrounded by an annular insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon described above, the gas temperature in the reactor becomes elevated to 500 to 600&#xb0; C. at a maximum. Thus, the electrode holders holding electrodes are cooled by circulating cooling water in the electrode holders. However, since the insulating material provided between the through-holes of a bottom plate of the reactor and the electrode holders cannot be directly cooled, the shape thereof is apt to be damaged due to the heat in the reactor, which is apt to cause deterioration of the insulating function. In this case, if a ceramic-based insulating material is used, there is a possibility that the insulating material will become damaged, since the insulating material is not be capable of absorbing the thermal expansion difference between the bottom plate of the reactor and the electrode holder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was contrived in view of such a problem, and an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon which can absorb the thermal expansion difference between a bottom plate of a reactor and the electrode holders, and can realize excellent insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention includes a reactor to which a raw material gas is supplied, and a silicon seed rod heated in the reactor, and deposits polycrystalline silicon on the surface of the silicon seed rod. The apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention has an electrode, an electrode holder, and an annular insulating material. The electrode extends in a vertical direction to hold the silicon seed rod. The electrode holder has a cooling flow passage formed therein for circulating a cooling medium, and the electrode holder is inserted into a through-hole formed in a bottom plate of the reactor to hold the electrode. The annular insulating material arranges between an inner peripheral surface of the through-hole and an outer peripheral surface of the electrode holder to electrically insulate the bottom plate and the electrode holder from each other. Furthermore, in the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention, an outer peripheral surface of the electrode holder is provided with an enlarged diameter portion which contacts at least a portion of a top face of an upper end of the annular insulating material and has a portion of the cooling flow passage formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">That is, the top face of the upper end of the annular insulating material in the state of being inserted into the bottom plate of the reactor is directed to the inside of the reactor. Thus, if the insulating material is kept in the state of being exposed into the reactor from a gap between the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole and the electrode holder, the radiant heat from the silicon seed rod or the like with the reactor will directly act on the upper end of the annular insulating material through the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole and the electrode holder. In this present invention, the electrode holder is provided with the enlarged diameter portion which contacts at least a portion of the top face of the upper end of the annular insulating material, whereby the electrode holder absorbs the radiant heat directed to the top face. Thus, the radiant heat which directly acts on the annular insulating material can be reduced. Moreover, since the cooling medium also circulates through the enlarged diameter portion, the cooling effect on the annular insulating material can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention, preferably, the enlarged diameter portion covers the whole top face of the upper end of the annular insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this case, since the enlarged diameter portion is provided so as to cover the whole top face of the upper end of the annular insulating material whereby the radiant heat from the reactor is interrupted by the enlarged diameter portion, the annular insulating material can be more effectively protected from the radiant heat. Additionally, since the whole top face of the upper end of the annular insulating material is cooled by the enlarged diameter portion, deterioration of the shape and insulating function of the annular insulating material can be more effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention, preferably, the cooling medium cools the enlarged diameter portion, and then cools the vicinity of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this case, the cooling medium circulating through the inside of the electrode holder cools the enlarged diameter portion of a relatively low temperature, and then cools the vicinity of the electrode of a relatively high temperature, so that the enlarged diameter portion can be maintained at a low temperature. Thus, the temperature of the annular insulating material can be effectively prevented from reaching a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention, preferably, the cooling flow passage has an outer peripheral flow passage through which the cooling medium is circulated at an outer peripheral portion in the electrode holder toward the upper end thereof along the longitudinal direction of the electrode holder, and an inner peripheral flow passage through which the cooling medium is circulated inside the outer peripheral flow passage toward the lower end of the electrode holder along the longitudinal direction, and a portion of the outer peripheral flow passage is formed in the enlarged diameter portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this case, the cooling medium is circulated at the outer peripheral portion in the electrode holder toward the upper end of the electrode holder, and is then circulated inside the outer peripheral flow passage toward the lower end of the electrode holder, so that the electrode holder can be efficiently cooled to the upper end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention, preferably, the annular insulating material is made of resin having elasticity. In this case, damage to the annular insulating material caused by the thermal expansion difference between the bottom plate and the electrode holder is prevented, the thermal expansion difference between the bottom plate and the electrode holder is absorbed by an annular insulator, and displacement of the silicon seed rod and damage to deposited polycrystalline silicon are prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon of the present invention, the enlarged diameter portion provided in the electrode holder intercepts the radiant heat from the silicon seed rod to the annular insulating material, and cools the annular insulating material. Thus, the annular insulating material can be effectively protected from the heat at the time of reaction, and the insulation and elasticity of the annular insulating material can be reliably maintained. Accordingly, synthetic resin or the like can be used as the annular insulating material, and the soundness of the whole apparatus can be maintained such that the thermal expansion difference can be absorbed while securing the insulation between the bottom plate and the electrode.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an overall view of the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon to which the present invention is applied. A reactor <b>1</b> of the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon includes a bottom plate <b>2</b> which constitutes a reactor bottom, and a bell-shaped bell jar <b>3</b> detachably attached on the bottom plate <b>2</b>. The upper face of the bottom plate <b>2</b> is formed on a substantially flat horizontal plane. Since the bell jar <b>3</b> is bell-shaped as a whole, and the ceiling of the bell jar is dome-shaped, the internal space of the bell jar is formed such that the central portion thereof is the highest and the outer peripheral portion thereof is the lowest. Additionally, the bottom plate <b>2</b> and the wall of the bell jar <b>3</b> have a jacket structure (not shown), and are cooled by cooling water.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The bottom plate <b>2</b> is provided with a plurality of electrode units <b>5</b> to which silicon seed rods <b>4</b> are attached, a plurality of jet nozzles (gas supply ports) <b>6</b> for jetting a raw material gas including a chlorosilane gas and a hydrogen gas into the reactor, and a plurality of gas discharge ports <b>7</b> for discharging the gas after reaction to the outside of the reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The plurality of the jet nozzles <b>6</b> for the raw material gas are distributed at suitable intervals over most of the upper face of the bottom plate <b>2</b> of the reactor <b>1</b> so that the raw material gas can be uniformly supplied to each of the silicon seed rods <b>4</b>. The jet nozzles <b>6</b> are connected to a raw material gas supply source <b>8</b> outside the reactor <b>1</b>. Additionally, the plurality of gas discharge ports <b>7</b> are set at suitable intervals in a circumferential direction in the vicinity of an outer peripheral portion on the bottom plate <b>2</b>, and are connected to an exhaust gas processing system <b>9</b>. A power supply circuit <b>10</b> is connected to the electrode units <b>5</b>. The bottom plate <b>2</b> has a jacket structure, and the inside thereof is formed with a cooling flow passage (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The silicon seed rods <b>4</b> are fixed in a state where the lower ends thereof are inserted into the electrode units <b>5</b>, respectively, and thereby extend upward so as to stand upright. One short connecting member <b>12</b> is attached to the upper ends of every two of the silicon seed rods <b>4</b> so as to connect them together as a pair. The connecting member <b>12</b> is also made of the same silicon as the silicon seed rods <b>4</b>. A seed assembly <b>13</b> is assembled by these two silicon seed rods <b>4</b> and the connecting member <b>12</b> connecting these together so as to be substantially H-shaped (inversed U-shaped) as a whole. Since the electrode units <b>5</b> are arranged concentrically from the center of the reactor <b>1</b>, seed assemblies <b>13</b> are arranged substantially concentrically from the center of the reactor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, electrode units <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod holding one silicon seed rod <b>4</b> and electrode units <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods holding two silicon seed rods <b>4</b> are arranged as the electrode units <b>5</b> in the reactor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The electrode units <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod and the electrode units <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, are able to connect three sets of seed assemblies <b>13</b> in series as one unit. At this time, one electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod, two electrode units <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods, and one electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod are lined up in this order from an end of a unit row. In this case, three sets of seed assemblies <b>13</b> are provided so as to stride over four electrode units <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B. Each of silicon seed rods <b>4</b> forming one seed assembly <b>13</b> is held by adjacent different electrode units <b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">That is, one of two silicon seed rods <b>4</b> of the seed assembly <b>13</b> is held at the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod, and one silicon seed rod <b>4</b> of each of two sets of seed assemblies <b>13</b> is held at the electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods. A power cable is connected to the electrode units <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod at both ends of the row so that an electric current flows thereto. At this time, in the electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods, an electric current flows between both electrodes <b>47</b> through an arm portion <b>42</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, two kinds of electrodes are used, and the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod holding one silicon seed rod <b>4</b>, and the electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods holding every two silicon seed rods <b>4</b> are provided. Thereby, the number of electrode units can be reduced (for example, about &#x2154;) compared with a case where all silicon rods are held one by one. In a case where the number of electrode units is small, the number of through-holes formed in the bottom plate <b>2</b> of the reactor <b>1</b> can also be reduced, and the bottom plate <b>2</b> can be maintained as a rigid structure. Additionally, since a number of silicon seed rods <b>4</b> can be held by a small number of electrode units, a number of silicon seed rods <b>4</b> can be set into the reactor <b>1</b>, and productivity can be increased. Additionally, since the number of electrode units is reduced, cooling pipes or power cables to be arranged below the bottom plate <b>2</b> can also be reduced, and the maintenance workability thereof improves.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the structure of each electrode unit will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First, the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod holding one silicon seed rod <b>4</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electrode unit <b>5</b>A includes an electrode holder <b>22</b> and an electrode <b>23</b>. The electrode holder <b>22</b> is provided in the state of being inserted into a through-hole <b>21</b> formed in the bottom plate <b>2</b> of the reactor <b>1</b>, and the electrode <b>23</b> is provided at the upper end of the electrode holder <b>22</b> to hold the silicon seed rod <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The electrode holder <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is formed in a rod shape, and made of a conductive material, such as stainless steel. The electrode holder <b>22</b> is formed by integrating a straight rod portion <b>24</b>, a hollow disc-like enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b>, and a male thread portion <b>26</b>. The straight rod portion <b>24</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>21</b> along a vertical direction. The hollow disc-like enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> is coaxially formed at the upper end of the straight rod portion <b>24</b>, and the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> has a diameter larger than that of the rod portion <b>24</b>. A ring-shaped space <b>25</b><i>a </i>is formed in the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> coaxially with the electrode holder <b>22</b>, and the space <b>25</b><i>a </i>has an outer diameter larger than the maximum diameter of the rod portion <b>24</b>. The male thread portion <b>26</b> further protrudes upward from the top face of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b>. Additionally, below the rod portion <b>24</b>, a male thread portion <b>28</b> is formed at a position where it protrudes from the bottom plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electrode holder <b>22</b> is formed in a hollow shape. Inside the electrode holder <b>22</b>, an inner tube <b>30</b> which has a smaller external diameter than the internal diameter of the electrode holder <b>22</b> and divides the inside of the electrode holder <b>22</b> into an outer peripheral space and an inner peripheral space (core) is provided coaxially with the electrode holder <b>22</b>. The upper end of the inner tube <b>30</b> abuts on the inner surface of the upper end of the electrode holder <b>22</b>, and this upper end is formed with an opening <b>30</b><i>a </i>which allows the inside and outside of the inner tube <b>30</b> to communicate with each other. Thereby, a cooling flow passage <b>27</b> adapted such that an outer peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>A formed between the inner tube <b>30</b> and the electrode holder <b>22</b> and an inner peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>B formed in the inner tube <b>30</b> communicate with each other by the opening <b>30</b><i>a </i>is formed from the rod portion <b>24</b> to the male thread portion <b>26</b> inside the electrode holder <b>22</b>. A cooling medium circulates through the cooling flow passage <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A ring plate <b>31</b> is provided at an outer peripheral surface of the inner tube <b>30</b> so as to be substantially orthogonal to the inner tube <b>30</b> at a position corresponding to the space <b>25</b><i>a </i>in the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b>. By means of the ring plate <b>31</b>, the circulation direction of the cooling medium which circulates through the outer peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>A is guided into the space <b>25</b><i>a </i>in the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b>. A plate-like spacer <b>32</b> which secures the spacing between the inner peripheral surface of the electrode holder <b>22</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the inner tube <b>30</b> at a position corresponding to the male thread portion <b>28</b> is further provided at the outer peripheral surface of the inner tube <b>30</b> so as to extend along the axis direction of the inner tube <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Meanwhile, the through-hole <b>21</b> of the bottom plate <b>2</b> in a state where the electrode holder <b>22</b> is inserted includes a lower straight portion <b>21</b>A and an upper tapered portion <b>21</b>B whose diameter gradually increased upward. The straight portion <b>21</b>A is formed so as to have a larger internal diameter than the external diameter of the rod portion <b>24</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b>. Thereby, a ring-shaped space <b>25</b><i>a </i>is formed around the rod portion <b>24</b>. The tapered portion <b>21</b>B is formed at an inclination angle of, for example, 5&#xb0; to 15&#xb0; with respect to a vertical axis. An opening of an upper end of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B is formed with a counterbore <b>33</b> whose diameter further increases than the maximum internal diameter of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An annular insulating material <b>34</b> is provided between the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole <b>21</b> and the rod portion <b>24</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b> so as to surround the electrode holder <b>22</b>. The annular insulating material <b>34</b> is formed from high-melting point insulating resin having elasticity, such as fluorine-based resin represented by, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and perfluoroalkoxyalkane (PFA). The annular insulating material <b>34</b> includes two members of a sleeve <b>35</b> with a collar to be inserted into the straight portion <b>21</b>A of the through-hole <b>21</b>, and a cone member <b>36</b> arranged at the tapered portion <b>21</b>B of the through-hole <b>21</b>. For example, PTFE to be used as the material of the annular insulating material <b>34</b> has a melting point (ASTM standard: D792) of 327&#xb0; C., and a bending elastic modulus (ASTM standard: D790) of 0.55 GPa, a tensile elastic modulus (ASTM standard: D638) of 0.44 GPa to 0.55 GPa, and a linear coefficient of expansion (ASTM standard: D696) of 10&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>/&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The cone member <b>36</b> has an outer surface formed in a tapered shape of the same inclination angle as the inner peripheral surface of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B of the through-hole <b>21</b>. The cone member <b>36</b> is inserted into the through-hole <b>21</b> from above the bottom plate <b>2</b>, and is made to abut on the inner surface of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B of the through-hole <b>21</b>. The bottom face of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b> abuts on the top face of an upper end of the cone member <b>36</b>. The enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> is set to have an external diameter that is almost equal to the maximum external diameter of the cone member <b>36</b>, i.e., the external diameter of the top face of the upper end of the cone member <b>36</b>, and covers the whole top face of the cone member <b>36</b> (annular insulating material <b>34</b>). When the distance between the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the side face of the counterbore <b>33</b> is larger enough to avoid the short-circuit between the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the side face of the counterbore <b>33</b>, it is preferable that the external diameter of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> be slightly larger than the external diameter of the top face of the upper end of the cone member <b>36</b> to enhance the cooling effect on the annular insulating material. When the distance between the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the side face of the counterbore <b>33</b> is small, it is preferable that the external diameter of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> be slightly smaller than the external diameter of the top face of the upper end of the cone member <b>36</b> to avoid the short-circuit between the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the side face of the counterbore <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">O rings <b>43</b> are respectively provided at inner peripheral portion of upper end surface and the outer peripheral surface of the cone member <b>36</b>. The airtightness between the cone member <b>36</b> and the electrode holder <b>22</b>, and the airtightness between the cone member <b>36</b> and the bottom plate <b>2</b>, i.e., the airtightness in the through-hole <b>21</b> of the reactor <b>1</b> are maintained by the O rings <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sleeve <b>35</b> with a collar is inserted into the straight portion <b>21</b>A so that a collar portion <b>37</b> integrally formed at a lower end thereof abuts on the rear surface of the bottom plate <b>2</b> of the reactor <b>1</b>. The upper face of the collar portion <b>37</b> is pressed against the rear surface of the bottom plate <b>2</b> by a nut <b>38</b> threaded into the male thread portion <b>28</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b>. Pair of ring washers <b>39</b><i>a </i>and a disc spring <b>39</b><i>b </i>are arranged between the lower face of collar portion <b>37</b> and the nut <b>38</b>, the disc spring <b>39</b><i>b </i>is arranged between the pair of ring washers <b>39</b><i>a</i>. While the upper face of the collar portion <b>37</b> is pressed against the rear surface of the bottom plate <b>2</b> by a nut <b>38</b>, the press strength is adjusted appropriately by the disc spring <b>39</b><i>b</i>. It is preferable that the ring washers <b>39</b><i>a </i>be made of stainless steel (SUS304), and it is preferable that the disc spring <b>39</b><i>b </i>be made of stainless steel (SUS631).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the distance between the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the nut <b>38</b> becomes short by fastening the nut <b>38</b>, the electrode holder <b>22</b> is pulled downward with respect to the bottom plate <b>2</b>, and the annular insulated member <b>34</b> is sandwiched between the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the nut <b>38</b>. Moreover, the outer peripheral surface of the cone member <b>36</b> is pressed against the inner peripheral surface of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B of the through-hole <b>21</b> by the sandwiching force, and the annular insulating material <b>34</b> and the electrode holder <b>22</b> are integrally fixed to the bottom plate <b>2</b>. At this time, while checking the height of the lower face of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b> from the bottom face of the counterbore <b>33</b>, a lower portion of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> approaches the bottom plate <b>2</b>. At this time, the amount of screwing of the nut <b>38</b> is adjusted to prevent electric short-circuiting between a lower portion of the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> and the bottom plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By the elastic deformation of the disc spring <b>39</b><i>b </i>and the annular insulating material <b>34</b> (the sleeve <b>35</b> with a collar and the cone member <b>36</b> made of resin), the relative displacement in the vertical direction between the electrode holder <b>22</b> and the bottom plate <b>2</b> is permitted. Accordingly, the thermal expansion difference between the electrode holder <b>22</b> and the bottom plate <b>2</b> is absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this fixed state, the upper end of the cone member <b>36</b> of the annular insulating material <b>34</b> protrude slightly upward from the upper end of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B of the through-hole <b>21</b>, and is made to face the counterbore <b>33</b>. For this reason, the cone member <b>36</b> is set to have a larger external diameter than the maximum external diameter of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B at the upper end thereof so as to protrude from the bottom face of the counterbore <b>33</b> and so as not to protrude upward from the upper end of the counterbore <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Meanwhile, the electrode <b>23</b> is formed in a columnar shape as a whole and made of carbon or the like. The electrode <b>23</b> has a female thread portion <b>43</b>, which is screwed into the male thread portion <b>26</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b>, at the lower end thereof, and has a hole <b>23</b><i>a</i>, which fixes the silicon seed rod <b>4</b> in an inserted state, at the upper end thereof, and the hole <b>23</b><i>a </i>is formed along an axial center.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The cooling flow passage <b>27</b> formed in the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cooling medium flows into the outer peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>A through an inlet <b>127</b>A provided at the lower portion of the electrode holder <b>22</b>, and circulates upward. Then, the cooling medium is guided by the ring plate <b>31</b> to circulate through the space <b>25</b><i>a </i>in the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b>, and then reaches the inside of the male thread portion <b>26</b>, i.e., the vicinity of the electrode <b>23</b>. When the inside of the outer peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>A is filled with the cooling medium until the cooling medium contacts the inner surface of the upper end of the electrode holder <b>22</b>, the cooling medium flows into the inner tube <b>30</b> from the opening <b>30</b><i>a </i>provided at the upper end of the inner tube <b>30</b>. Then, the cooling medium circulates downward through the inside of the inner tube <b>30</b>, i.e., the inner peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>B, and flows to the outside of the electrode holder <b>22</b> from an outlet <b>127</b>B provided at the lower end of the inner tube <b>30</b>. That is, the cooling medium cools the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> at a relatively low temperature while circulating through the outer peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>A, and then, cools the vicinity of the electrode <b>23</b> at a relatively high temperature, and is discharged from the electrode holder <b>22</b> through the inner peripheral flow passage <b>27</b>B.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods will be described. The electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods is shown in an enlarged manner in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods has the same configuration as the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod in that it includes an electrode holder <b>46</b> provided in the state of being inserted into the through-hole <b>21</b> formed at the bottom plate <b>2</b> of the reactor <b>1</b>, and an electrode <b>47</b> provided at the upper end of the electrode holder <b>46</b>. The electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods is different from the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod in that the electrode holder <b>46</b> is bifurcated at the upper end thereof, and the electrodes <b>47</b> are respectively provided at both ends of the electrode holder <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The electrode holder <b>46</b> of the electrode unit <b>5</b>B is configured such that a rod-shaped rod portion <b>41</b>, and an arm portion <b>42</b> orthogonal to an upper end of the rod portion <b>41</b> are integrally formed. The electrode holder <b>46</b> is made of a conductive material, such as stainless steel. A hollow annular enlarged diameter portion <b>45</b> is attached to a longitudinal midway position of the rod portion <b>41</b>. Additionally, the same male thread portion <b>46</b><i>a </i>as the male thread portion <b>28</b> in the first embodiment is formed at the position of the rod portion <b>41</b> protruding from the bottom face of the bottom plate <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since the through-hole <b>21</b> (the straight portion <b>21</b>A and the tapered portion <b>21</b>B) of the bottom plate <b>2</b> in a state where the electrode holder <b>46</b> is inserted, the counterbore <b>33</b> formed at the opening of the upper end of the tapered portion <b>21</b>B, the annular insulating material <b>34</b> (the sleeve <b>35</b> with a collar and the cone member <b>36</b>) provided between the inner peripheral surface of the through-hole <b>21</b> and the rod portion <b>41</b> of the electrode holder <b>46</b>, the nut member <b>38</b> screwed to the male thread portion <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the rod portion <b>41</b>, the ring washers <b>39</b><i>a</i>, etc. have the same configuration and effects as the electrode unit <b>5</b>A for one silicon seed rod, their description thereof will be omitted.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By configuring the electrode unit <b>5</b>B for two silicon seed rods in this way, a cooling flow passage <b>40</b> is formed inside the electrode holder <b>46</b> by the outer peripheral flow passage <b>40</b>A and inner peripheral flow passage <b>40</b>B at the lower portion of the rod portion <b>41</b>, the annular space <b>45</b><i>b </i>of the enlarged diameter portion <b>45</b>, the left space <b>41</b><i>c </i>and right space <b>41</b><i>d </i>at the upper portion of the rod portion <b>41</b>, and the straight space <b>42</b><i>b </i>and circular space <b>42</b><i>c </i>of the arm portion <b>42</b>.</p>

When the cooling medium reaches the first partition plate <b>48</b>A, the cooling medium is interrupted by the first partition plate <b>48</b>A, flows into the annular space <b>45</b><i>b </i>in the enlarged diameter portion <b>45</b> through the first opening <b>41</b><i>a</i>, and cools the enlarged diameter portion <b>45</b>. Then, the cooling medium circulates to the upper side of the first partition plate <b>48</b>A and the left side of the second partition plate <b>48</b>B, i.e., to the left space <b>41</b><i>c </i>through the second opening <b>41</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After the cooling medium which has flowed into the left space <b>41</b><i>c </i>is guided to the left circular inner space <b>42</b><i>c </i>from a lower left portion of the straight inner space <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the arm portion <b>42</b> by the second partition plate <b>48</b>B and the third partition plate <b>48</b>C. Then, the cooling medium circulates above the third partition plate <b>48</b>C in the straight inner space <b>42</b><i>b</i>, and is guided to a lower right portion of the straight inner space <b>42</b><i>b </i>through the right circular inner space <b>42</b><i>c</i>. In this period, the cooling medium cools the vicinity of the electrode <b>47</b>. Then, when the cooling medium circulates through the right space <b>41</b><i>d </i>along the second partition plate <b>48</b>B and reaches the first partition plate <b>48</b>A, the cooling medium flows into the inner peripheral flow passage <b>40</b>B in the inner tube <b>49</b> through the through-hole <b>148</b>A, and is discharged from the electrode holder <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the apparatus for producing polycrystalline silicon configured in this way, an electric current is applied to the silicon seed rod <b>4</b> from each electrode unit <b>5</b> (the electrode unit <b>5</b>A, the electrode unit <b>5</b>B), bringing the silicon seed rod <b>4</b> into a resistance heating state. Additionally, even among the silicon seed rods <b>4</b>, a silicon seed rod <b>4</b> receives radiant heat from an adjacent silicon seed rod <b>4</b>, and is heated, and thereby, these silicon seed rods <b>4</b> are brought into a high-temperature state by a synergetic effect. As a result, the raw material gas which has contacted the surface of the silicon seed rod <b>4</b> in a high-temperature state reacts to deposit polycrystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Since the radiant heat from the silicon seed rods <b>4</b> acts also on each electrode unit <b>5</b>A or electrode unit <b>5</b>B on the bottom plate <b>2</b> of the reactor <b>1</b> and a portion of the upper end of the annular insulating material <b>34</b> which is weak to heat is also exposed in the counterbore <b>33</b>, the influence of heat is concerned. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, since the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> of the electrode holder <b>22</b> and the enlarged diameter portion <b>45</b> of the electrode holder <b>46</b> are arranged on the top face of the upper end of the annular insulating material <b>34</b> so that they are covered, the radiant heat which directly acts on the upper end surface decreases. Moreover, since the electrode holder <b>22</b> or the electrode holder <b>46</b> is cooled by the cooling medium circulating therethrough, the annular insulating material <b>34</b> is also effectively cooled. In particular, the annular insulating material <b>34</b> is effectively cooled as the cooling medium circulates through the space provided inside the enlarged diameter portion <b>25</b> or the enlarged diameter portion <b>45</b> which covers the top face of the upper end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As such, since deformation, deterioration, etc. of the annular insulating material <b>34</b> caused by a high temperature are suppressed, and the elasticity thereof is maintained even in the hot reactor <b>1</b>, the thermal deformation of each member can be absorbed, the action of stress can be suppressed, and the function of a facility is suitably maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the present invention is not limited to the configuration of the above embodiment, but in the detailed configuration various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, the enlarged diameter portion of the electrode holder may be provided so as to cover at least a portion of the top face to such a degree that deformation, deterioration, etc. of the annular insulating material can be prevented. The enlarged diameter portion of the electrode holder does not necessarily cover the whole top face of the upper end surface of the annular insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, although a cooling flow passage of only one system is provided in the above embodiment, a cooling flow passage for cooling the enlarged diameter portion and a cooling flow passage for cooling the vicinity of an electrode may be provided independently.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While preferred embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated above, it should be understood that these are exemplary of the invention and are not to be considered as limiting. Additions, omissions, substitutions, and other modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be considered as being limited by the foregoing description, and is only limited by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
