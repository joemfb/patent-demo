<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-058951, filed on Mar. 16, 2010 in the Japan Patent Office, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a copier, a printer, a facsimile machine, or a multi-functional apparatus having some combination of these functions, and a fixing unit disposed in the image forming apparatus, and more particularly, to an image forming apparatus having a fixing unit to increase and decrease a nip pressure between a fixing member and a pressure member.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, image forming apparatuses such as copiers and printers employ a fixing unit having a fixing member and a pressure member to conduct a fixing process, in which a fixing nip is set between the fixing member and the pressure member with a pressurized condition, and a recording medium is transported through the fixing nip for conducting a fixing process. For example, JP-2007-79160-A, JP-H10-282828-A, and JP-2006-23427-A disclose such configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, it is known that the size or extent of the nip width and the nip pressure at the fixing nip in the fixing unit greatly affects fixing performance. Further, because the recording medium receives relatively greater pressure and heat at the fixing nip position, after the recording medium exits the fixing nip, it is known that the recording medium sometimes experiences curling such as back curling. Specifically, the recording medium may be curved or warped along a curvature of the pressure member, and curved or warped to that side of the recording medium on which no image is formed (that is, the pressure member side). A technique is known for correcting such curling by, for example, correcting, canceling, or offsetting such curling, in which a second curling is applied to the recording medium in a direction opposite the direction of the first curling of the recording medium exiting the fixing nip.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, JP-2006-23427-A discloses another technology or method to correct curling of the recording medium involving a curling correction unit equipped with a curling guide. Depending on the thickness or other properties of the recording medium transported to the fixing nip, an angle of the de-curling guide is varied to provide effective curling correction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such conventional fixing units, depending on the type of recording media and an image area ratio of the output image, the pressure at a fixing nip (nip pressure) is adjusted so that a good fused image can be obtained consistently. However, the amount of curling of the recording medium may fluctuate because the nip pressure varies in response to the recording medium. If the fixing nip pressure is increased, the recording medium might curl more. In such a case, jamming of recording medium (or sheet jamming) may occur along a transportation route through which the recording medium is transported after the fixing nip, thus degrading image quality.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect of the present a fixing unit is devised. The fixing unit includes a fixing member to fuse a toner image on a recording medium by heating and melting the toner image on the recording medium; a pressure member to press against the fixing member, to define a first nip, as a fixing nip, between the fixing member and the pressure member through which the recording medium is transported; a shifting unit to move the pressure member relative to the fixing member to increase or decrease a pressure of the first nip; a curling correction unit disposed downstream from the first nip in a transport direction of the recording medium that imparts a second curling direction to the recording medium, opposite of a first curling direction of the recording medium exiting the first nip; and a variable setting unit operatively connected to the curling correction unit to variably set an amount of the second curling direction to be applied to the recording medium by the curling correction unit depending on the first nip pressure increased or decreased by the shifting unit.</p>

The charger <b>12</b> charges the surface of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K. The development unit <b>13</b> develops an electrostatic latent image formed on each of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K. The cleaning unit <b>15</b> recovers non-transferred toner from each of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K. The intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit <b>16</b> cleans the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b>. The intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> is transferred with a plurality of toner images as superimposed image thereon. The secondary transfer roller <b>18</b> transfers a color image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> to the recording medium P. The fixing unit <b>19</b> fuses toner image (or non-fused image) on the recording medium P using, for example, an electromagnetic induction heating system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereinafter, a description is given of a color image forming operation in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. At first, the document scanner <b>4</b> optically scans image information (or data) of document D placed on a contact glass <b>5</b>. Specifically, the document scanner <b>4</b> irradiates light emit from a lamp to image of the document D on the contact glass <b>5</b> to scan the document D. Then, light reflected at the document D is focused at a color sensor via mirrors and a lens. Color image information (or data) of the document D read by the color sensor for each of color lights such as RGB (red, green, blue) components is then converted to an electrical image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, based on image signal of RGB components, an image processing unit conducts a color conversion processing, a color correction processing, a space frequency correction processing, or the like to obtain color image information or data of yellow, magenta, cyan, black. Then, image information or data of each of yellow, magenta, cyan, black is transmitted to the writing unit <b>2</b>. Then, the writing unit <b>2</b> emits a laser beam (exposing light) corresponding to image information or data of each color to each of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Meanwhile, each of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K rotates in a clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, the surface of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K is uniformly charged by the charger <b>12</b>, disposed opposite the photoconductor (charging process), by which a charging potential is formed on each of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K. Then, the charged surface of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K comes to an irradiation position of each of laser beams.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the writing unit <b>2</b>, laser beams, corresponding to image signal of color, emit from four light sources, and then each of laser beams passes through light path, differently set for each of color components of yellow, magenta, cyan, black (exposure process).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A laser beam corresponding to yellow component is irradiated to the surface of the photoconductor <b>11</b>Y. When the laser beam of yellow component is irradiated, the laser beam is being scanned along a rotation axis direction (main scanning direction) of the photoconductor <b>11</b>Y by a polygon mirror rotating at a high speed. With such process, an electrostatic latent image corresponding to yellow component is formed on the surface of photoconductor <b>11</b>Y charged by the charger <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Similarly, an electrostatic latent image corresponding to magenta component is formed on the surface of photoconductor <b>11</b>M charged by the charger <b>12</b> by irradiating a laser beam corresponding to magenta component. Similarly, an electrostatic latent image corresponding to cyan component is formed on the surface of photoconductor <b>11</b>C charged by the charger <b>12</b> by irradiating a laser beam corresponding to cyan component. Similarly, an electrostatic latent image corresponding to black component is formed on the surface of photoconductor <b>11</b>K charged by the charger <b>12</b> by irradiating a laser beam corresponding to black component.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Then, the surface of photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K having the formed electrostatic latent image comes to a position facing the development unit <b>13</b>. Then, the development unit <b>13</b> supplies toner of each color onto the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K to develop the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K (development process).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After the development process, the surface of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K comes to a position facing the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b>. At such position, a transfer bias roller is disposed inside the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> while contacting the inner face of the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b>. Toner images formed on the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K are sequentially transferred on the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> at a position of the transfer bias roller as superimposed image (primary transfer process).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the primary transfer process, the surface of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K comes to a position facing the cleaning unit <b>15</b>. The cleaning unit <b>15</b> recovers non-transferred toner remaining on the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K (cleaning process). After the cleaning process, the surface of the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K passes through a position facing a decharger, by which an image forming process for the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K ends.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> having the superimposed-and-transferred toner image comes to a position facing the secondary transfer roller <b>18</b>. At such position, the secondary transfer roller <b>18</b> and a secondary transfer backup roller sandwich the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> to set a secondary transfer nip. Toner images, consisting of four superimposed colors and formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b>, are transferred to the recording medium P transported to the position of secondary transfer nip (secondary transfer process). In such secondary transfer process, some toner may remain on the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> as non-transferred toner, which is not transferred to the recording medium P. After the secondary transfer process, the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> comes to a position facing the intermediate transfer belt cleaning unit <b>16</b>. Then, non-transferred toner remaining on the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> is recovered at such position. Then, a transfer process conducted with the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> ends.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The recording medium P, transported to the position of secondary transfer nip, is transported from the sheet feeder <b>7</b> disposed at a under part of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> via a transportation route K<b>1</b> disposed with a sheet feed roller <b>8</b>, a registration roller, or the like. Specifically, the sheet feeder <b>7</b> stores and stacks a plurality of sheets as recording medium P. When the sheet feed roller <b>8</b> is rotated by driving force in a counter-clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an uppermost sheet is fed to the transportation route K<b>1</b> as recording medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The recording medium P transported to the transportation route K<b>1</b> is temporarily stopped at a position of a roller nip of registration roller by stopping the rotation of registration roller. Then, the registration roller is rotated at a given timing synchronized with formation of a color image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>17</b> to feed the recording medium P to the secondary transfer nip. Then, a desired color image is transferred on the recording medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After such process, the recording medium P having the color image transferred at the position of the secondary transfer nip is transported to the fixing unit <b>19</b>. In the fixing unit <b>19</b>, heat and pressure are applied to the recording medium P using a fixing roller and a pressure roller, by which the transferred color image is fused on the recording medium P. After the fixing process, the recording medium P is ejected outside of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> using a sheet ejection roller <b>9</b> as an output image recorded sheet in a direction shown by an dotted arrow, by which an image forming operation ends.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A description is now given of configuration and operation of the fixing unit <b>19</b> disposed in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the fixing unit <b>19</b> may include an induction heating unit <b>25</b> such as magnetic flux generator, a fixing roller <b>20</b> used as a fixing member and facing the induction heating unit <b>25</b>, a pressure roller <b>30</b> used as pressure member which can be pressingly contacted against the fixing roller <b>20</b>, an entry guide <b>41</b> such as plate, a roll <b>42</b>, a separator <b>43</b> such as plate, a guide <b>50</b>, and a curling correction unit <b>70</b>, for example. The fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> may form a first nip therebetween, which is a fixing nip set between the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fixing roller <b>20</b>, used as the fixing member, may include a metal core <b>23</b>, an insulation elastic layer <b>22</b>, and a sleeve layer <b>21</b>. The metal core <b>23</b> may be made of iron, stainless steel or the like. The insulation elastic layer <b>22</b> and the sleeve layer <b>21</b>, made of resin such as foamed silicone rubber, are sequentially overlaid on the metal core <b>23</b>, and the fixing roller <b>20</b> may have an outside diameter such as 40 mm or so. The sleeve layer <b>21</b> may include a base layer, a first anti-oxidation layer, a heating layer, a second anti-oxidation layer, an elastic layer, and a separation layer from an inner side to an outer side of the fixing roller <b>20</b>. As such, the sleeve layer <b>21</b> may have a multi-layered structure sequentially overlaying multiple layers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the base layer may be made of stainless having a thickness of 40 &#x3bc;m or so. The first anti-oxidation layer and the second anti-oxidation layer may be formed by a strike coating of nickel with a thickness of 1 &#x3bc;m or less. The heating layer may be made of cupper having a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m or so. The elastic layer may be made of a silicone rubber having a thickness of 150 &#x3bc;m or so. The separation layer may be made of PFA (tetrafluoroethylene/perfluoroalkyl/vinyl ether copolymer) having a thickness of 30 &#x3bc;m or so. The fixing roller <b>20</b>, configured as such, can be heated when the heating layer of the sleeve layer <b>21</b> is heated by the induction heating unit <b>25</b> using electromagnetic induction by magnetic flux generated by the induction heating unit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, the configuration of the fixing roller <b>20</b> is not limited to the above configuration. For example, the sleeve layer <b>21</b> may not be adhered to the insulation elastic layer <b>22</b> of the fixing roller <b>20</b> (fixing-assist roller), but may be prepared as a different member. If the sleeve layer <b>21</b> (or fixing sleeve) is prepared as a different member as such, a member to prevent movement of the sleeve layer <b>21</b> in a width direction (or thrust direction) during a fixing operation may be preferably disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In such fixing unit <b>19</b>, at a position facing the fixing roller <b>20</b> from an upstream of the fixing nip (upstream of transport direction), a plurality of the rolls <b>42</b> may be disposed in a width direction, and each of the rolls <b>42</b> guides the recording medium P to the fixing nip. The outer periphery of the roll <b>42</b> may be formed as a saw like shape to prevent on occurrence of scratching of image even if the roll <b>42</b> contacts non-fused image on the recording medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, at a position facing the fixing roller <b>20</b> and a downstream from the fixing nip (downstream of transport direction), the separator <b>43</b> such as plate may be disposed. The separator <b>43</b> is used to prevent an absorbed and/or wound condition of the recording medium P onto the fixing roller <b>20</b> after the recording medium P is exiting the fixing nip after the fixing process. If the recording medium P is to absorb on the fixing roller <b>20</b> after the fixing process, the separator <b>43</b> may interfere the front edge of recording medium P to forcibly separate the recording medium P from the fixing roller <b>20</b>. Further, a thermopile (non-contact type temperature sensor) or a thermistor (contact type temperature sensor) may be disposed around the fixing roller <b>20</b> to detect temperature of the fixing roller <b>20</b> (fixing temperature). Based on the detection result of thermopile or thermistor, heating amount of the induction heating unit <b>25</b> may be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A description is given of the pressure roller <b>30</b>, used as pressure member, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pressure roller <b>30</b> may include a cylindrical member <b>32</b>, an elastic layer <b>31</b>, and a separation layer formed on each other. The cylindrical member <b>32</b> may be made from aluminum, cupper, or the like, the elastic layer <b>31</b> may be made of silicone rubber, and the separation layer may be made of resin such PFA. The elastic layer <b>31</b> may be formed with a given thickness such as from 1 mm to 5 mm. Further, the separation layer may be formed with a given thickness such as from 20 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m. The pressure roller <b>30</b> can be pressed and contacted against the fixing roller <b>20</b>, and the recording medium P is transported through a pressingly contacted portion between the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>, and the pressingly contacted portion may be referred to as the first nip used as the fixing nip. Further, to enhance heating efficiency of the fixing roller <b>20</b>, a heater <b>33</b> such as halogen heater may be disposed in the pressure roller <b>30</b>, in which when electric power is supplied to the heater <b>33</b>, radiant heat of the heater <b>33</b> can heat the pressure roller <b>30</b>, and the surface of the fixing roller <b>20</b> can be heated using the pressure roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At a position facing the pressure roller <b>30</b> and the upstream from the fixing nip, the entry guide <b>41</b> such as plate may be disposed. The entry guide <b>41</b> guides the recording medium P to the fixing nip. Further, at a position facing the pressure roller <b>30</b> and the downstream from the fixing nip, the guide <b>50</b> may be disposed. The guide <b>50</b> may be disposed at a position facing a non-fixing face of the recording medium P exiting the fixing nip. When the recording medium P is exiting the fixing nip after conducting the fixing process, the guide <b>50</b> guides the recording medium P to the transportation route.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at the downstream from the fixing nip (the downstream of transport direction of the recording medium P from the fixing nip), the curling correction unit <b>70</b> is disposed. The curling correction unit <b>70</b> may apply curling to the recording medium P having a first curling direction after exiting the fixing nip, in which the curling correction unit <b>70</b> may apply a second curling direction, which is opposite to the first curling direction of the recording medium P.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specifically, the curling correction unit <b>70</b> may include two rollers such as a metal roller <b>71</b> and an elastic roller <b>72</b>. The metal roller <b>71</b> is a metal roller made from carbon steel or the like having a given outside diameter (e.g., 8 mm or so), and a PFA tube having a give a thickness (e.g., 30 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m) may be coated on the metal roller. The elastic roller <b>72</b> includes a metal core made from carbon steel or the like having a given outside diameter (e.g., 15 mm or so), and a silicone rubber layer having a give a thickness (e.g., 2 mm to 3 mm) coated on the metal core. Further, a PFA tube having a give a thickness (e.g., 30 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m) may be coated on the silicone rubber layer. When such two rollers <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> are pressingly contacted, a second nip is formed between the rollers <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> through which the recording medium P is transported and passed. A shape of the second nip may follow a curvature of the metal roller <b>71</b>. Further, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the metal roller <b>71</b> may be rotated in a counter-clockwise direction by a driving force caused by a driver such as a motor, and the elastic roller <b>72</b> may be rotated in a clockwise direction by a frictional resistance with the metal roller <b>71</b> at the second nip, which means the elastic roller <b>72</b> is a driven roller driven and rotated by the metal roller <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the recording medium P is exiting the first nip, a curling (back curling) may occur toward a side of the recording medium on which no image is formed (that is, on the side of the pressure roller <b>30</b>, in which the recording medium P may curl, curve, or warp along a curvature of the pressure roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the recording medium P having the back curling is fed to the curling correction unit <b>70</b> having the second nip, the second curling direction (or face curling), which is opposite to the back curling, is applied to the recording medium P to offset the back curling, by which curling of the recording medium P can be corrected. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the curling correction unit <b>70</b> is disposed downstream from the guide <b>50</b> in the transport direction of the recording medium P. Alternatively, the curling correction unit <b>70</b> may be a disposed closer to the first nip.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the fixing unit <b>19</b> may include a variable setting unit and a shifting unit, in which the variable setting unit variably sets a face curling amount to be applied to the recording medium P by the curling correction unit <b>70</b>, and the shifting unit is used to increase or decrease a nip pressure between the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>. In response to the increase/decrease of nip pressure by the shifting unit, the variable setting unit is controlled, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the induction heating unit <b>25</b> may include a coil unit <b>26</b> (exciting coil), a core unit <b>27</b> (exciting coil core), and a coil guide <b>28</b>. The coil unit <b>26</b> includes Litz wire, which is a bundle of thin wires, wound and extended in a width direction on the coil guide <b>28</b> disposed to cover a part of outer face of the fixing roller <b>20</b>. The coil guide <b>28</b> may be made of a resin material having high thermal resistance, and retains the coil unit <b>26</b> by facing with the fixing roller <b>20</b>. The core unit <b>27</b> may be made or ferromagnetic material such as ferrite having relative magnetic permeability of 2500 or so, and may be configured as an arch core, a center core, a side core to form efficient magnetic flux directed to the heating layer of the fixing roller <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Such configured fixing unit <b>19</b> may be operated as follows. A drive motor drives the fixing roller <b>20</b> to rotate the fixing roller <b>20</b> in a counter-clockwise direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and then the pressure roller <b>30</b> is driven and rotated in a clockwise direction. Then the sleeve layer <b>21</b> (heating layer) of the fixing roller <b>20</b> is heated by magnetic flux generated by the induction heating unit <b>25</b> at a position facing the induction heating unit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, an electronic oscillator circuit flows high frequency alternating current using a power source that can supply variable frequency to the coil unit <b>26</b> such as 10 KHz to 1 MHz or 20 KHz to 800 KHz, by which magnetic force can be formed from the coil unit <b>26</b> to the sleeve layer <b>21</b> of the fixing roller <b>20</b> while switching or alternating the direction of magnetic force. By forming such alternating magnetic field, eddy current occurs on the heating layer of the sleeve layer <b>21</b>, and then Joule heat is generated by electrical resistance of the heating layer, by which induction heating is conducted. As such, the sleeve layer <b>21</b> of the fixing roller <b>20</b> can be heated by induction heating effect at the heating layer itself.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Then, the surface of fixing roller <b>20</b> heated by the induction heating unit <b>25</b> comes to a contact portion with the pressure roller <b>30</b> (i.e., first nip or fixing nip), and heat and melt a toner image T (toner) on the transported recording medium P. Specifically, after the above described image forming process, the recording medium P carrying the toner image T is fed to the first nip set between the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> with a guidance of the entry guide <b>41</b> (or the roll <b>42</b>), which is shown by an arrow Y<b>1</b> showing a transport direction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Then, the toner image T is fused on the recording medium P using heat of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and pressure of the pressure roller <b>30</b>, and the recording medium P is exiting the first nip of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>. The recording medium P exiting the first nip is guided to the second nip of the curling correction unit <b>70</b> using the guide <b>50</b>. After the curling correction is conducted, the recording medium P is exiting the curling correction unit <b>70</b> which is shown by an arrow Y<b>2</b> showing a transport direction. Meanwhile, the surface of fixing roller <b>20</b> passing through the first nip comes to the position facing the induction heating unit <b>25</b> again. Such a series of processing is continuously repeated, by which the fixing process in the image forming process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A description is given of configuration and operation of the fixing unit <b>19</b> according to an example embodiment with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a schematic configuration of the shifting unit and the variable setting unit in the fixing unit <b>19</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a condition when the nip pressure is reduced or decreased in the fixing unit <b>19</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a condition when a pressure roller is separated in the fixing unit <b>19</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the fixing unit <b>19</b> has a shifting unit to move the pressure roller <b>30</b> with respect to the fixing roller <b>20</b>, and a variable setting unit to variably set a curling amount to be applied to the recording medium P. The shifting unit includes shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> to move the pressure roller <b>30</b> with respect to the fixing roller <b>20</b> to increase or decrease pressure at the first nip (nip pressure). The variable setting unit includes variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> to variably set a curling amount to be applied to the recording medium P by the curling correction unit <b>70</b>, wherein the curling amount is an amount of curling in a second direction opposite to the first curling direction of the recording medium P exiting the first nip. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, some devices, such as devices <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>, may be used, for example, for both of the shifting unit and variable setting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As for the metal roller <b>71</b> and the elastic roller <b>72</b>, the variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> move the elastic roller <b>72</b> to increase or decrease a contact pressure of the two rollers <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> (nip pressure at the second nip). Then, in response to the nip pressure increased or decreased by the shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, the variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> variably set the second curling direction amount, which is the opposite direction of first curling amount.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Specifically, the variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> may be controlled as follows: the greater the increase/decrease of nip pressure by the shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, the greater the second curling direction amount, opposite direction of first curling amount, by the variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>. Conversely, the smaller the increase/decrease of nip pressure by the shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, the smaller the second curling direction amount, opposite direction of first curling amount, by the variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, in the example embodiment, a relative movement of the pressure roller <b>30</b> by the shifting unit, and a relative movement of the elastic roller <b>72</b> by the variable setting unit, can be conducted interlockingly by one drive source that drives an eccentric cam <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at each end of width direction of the fixing unit <b>19</b>, a first lever <b>81</b>, a second lever <b>85</b>, the eccentric cam <b>86</b>, and two compression springs <b>83</b> and <b>88</b> may be disposed as the shifting devices or variable setting devices.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first lever <b>81</b> is pivotable about a support shaft <b>81</b><i>a </i>fixed to a side plate of the fixing unit <b>19</b>.

One end of the compression spring <b>83</b>, connected to the one end of the first lever <b>81</b>, is connected to one end of the second lever <b>85</b>. Further, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a force from the one side of 100 Newtons (100 N) is applied to the first lever <b>81</b> by the compression spring <b>83</b>, a force from the one side of 300 N is applied to the pressure roller <b>30</b> by the first lever <b>81</b> having a leverage ratio of three (3).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second lever <b>85</b> is pivotable about a support shaft <b>85</b><i>a </i>fixed to a side plate of the fixing unit <b>19</b>. Further, one end of the second lever <b>85</b> contacts the eccentric cam <b>86</b>, and the compression spring <b>88</b> is connected to the center side of the second lever <b>85</b>. One end of the compression spring <b>88</b>, connected to the center side of the second lever <b>85</b>, is connected to a plain bearing <b>87</b> which rotatably supports a shaft of the elastic roller <b>72</b>. Further, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a force from the one side of 10 N is applied to the elastic roller <b>72</b> by the compression spring <b>88</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The eccentric cam <b>86</b> has a rotation shaft <b>86</b><i>a</i>, which is connected to a stepping motor via a series of gears. When the stepping motor is driven, the eccentric cam <b>86</b> rotates about the rotation shaft <b>86</b><i>a</i>, by which the first lever <b>81</b> and the second lever <b>85</b> can interlockingly pivot. With such a configuration, the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> (nip pressure of the first nip), and the nip pressure of the metal roller <b>71</b> and the elastic roller <b>72</b> (nip pressure of the second nip), can be interlockingly increased or decreased. Further, pulse control of the stepping motor connected to the rotation shaft <b>86</b><i>a </i>is conducted using an encoder, by which a rotation direction or angle of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a rotation direction or angle of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> is controlled so that the top dead center of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> contacts the second lever <b>85</b>, the second lever <b>85</b> is moved to a closest position to the elastic roller <b>72</b>, and the first lever <b>81</b> is moved to a closest position to the pressure roller <b>30</b>. Accordingly, when the nip pressure at the first nip of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> reaches its maximum, the nip pressure at the second nip in the curling correction unit <b>70</b> reaches its maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Such condition may be effective when the type of recording medium P transported to the first nip is not particularly suitable for fixing performance (for example, the recording medium is relatively thick paper), or when the image area ratio is relatively high for the toner image fused on the recording medium P transported to the first nip (for example, a solid black image is formed). In such a case, by setting a greater value for the nip pressure at the first nip, the fixing performance of an output image can be enhanced. By setting a greater value for the nip pressure at the first nip, a greater curling is more likely to occur to the recording medium P exiting the first nip, and thereby a curling correction amount at the curling correction unit <b>70</b> (the nip pressure at the second nip) may be set to a greater value.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the eccentric cam <b>86</b> is rotated 90 degrees from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the second lever <b>85</b> is moved away from the elastic roller <b>72</b> (separated or distanced position) from the condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the first lever <b>81</b> is moved away from the pressure roller <b>30</b> (separated or distanced position) from the condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Accordingly, the nip pressure at the first nip of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> can be reduced or decreased, and the nip pressure at the second nip in the curling correction unit <b>70</b> can be also reduced or decreased. Further, in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a force from the one side of 150 N is applied to the pressure roller <b>30</b>, and a force from the one side of 6 N is applied to the elastic roller <b>72</b>. Such condition may be effective when the type of recording medium P transported to the first nip is suitable for fixing (for example, relatively thin paper used as the recording medium), or when the image area ratio is relatively small for toner image fused on the recording medium P transported to the first nip (for example, image area ratio of 5% or so is formed). In such a case, by setting a smaller value for the nip pressure at the first nip, a condition sufficient for good fixing performance of an output image and preventing fixing failure such as hot offset can be devised. By setting a smaller value for the nip pressure at the first nip, curling may be less likely to occur to the recording medium P exiting the first nip, and thereby a curling correction amount at the curling correction unit <b>70</b> (the nip pressure at the second nip) may be set to a smaller value.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As such, the first lever <b>81</b>, the compression spring <b>83</b>, the second lever <b>85</b>, and the eccentric cam <b>86</b> may function as the shifting unit to increase or decrease the nip pressure at the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>. Further, the second lever <b>85</b>, the eccentric cam <b>86</b>, the compression spring <b>88</b> may function as the variable setting unit to variably set a second curling amount to be applied to the recording medium P by the curling correction unit <b>70</b>. Further, because the shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> and the variable devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> can be interlockingly controlled by one drive source such as the stepping motor to drive the eccentric cam <b>86</b>, the cost reduction of apparatus and the compact in size of apparatus can be devised.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, in the above-described explanation, the adjustment of the nip pressure and the curling correction amount are conducted in two steps (the conditions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). Furthermore, by controlling the position of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> in the rotation direction into several steps, the adjustment of the nip pressure and the curling correction amount can be conducted by multi-steps.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, controls of the above-described shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> and the variable devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, controlled by controlling a rotation position of eccentric cam <b>86</b>, may be preferably conducted in response to, for example, types of recording medium P and/or image area ratio of the fused image. Specifically, the type (such as thickness) of recording medium P can be determined using detection information of a sheet thickness detector disposed at the sheet feeder <b>7</b> or the transportation route of recording medium P, or input information input from an operation panel of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> by a user. Then, based on such information, the nip pressure and curling correction amount may be controlled to a preferable value. Further, the image area ratio of fused image can be determined using image data (or writing data) to be written to the photoconductors <b>11</b>Y, <b>11</b>M, <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>K by laser beams emitted from the writing unit. Then, based on such information, the nip pressure and curling correction amount may be controlled to a preferable value. With such control, the fixing performance of output image can be constantly at a good enough level and curling may not occur to the recording medium P ejected from the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> for various types of recording medium P and/or various image area ratio of fused image</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the recording medium P in transportation is stopped in the first nip (e.g., when sheet-jamming occurs), the shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> are configured to decrease the nip pressure automatically or manually so that the stacked recording medium P can be removed. Then, by interlocking the pressure decreasing operation of the shifting devices <b>81</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, the variable setting devices <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are also configured to decrease the contact pressure at the second nip of the two rollers <b>71</b> and <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the eccentric cam <b>86</b> is rotated and the bottom dead center of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> contacts the second lever <b>85</b>, the second lever <b>85</b> is moved away from the elastic roller <b>72</b> to a farthest position, and the first lever <b>81</b> is moved away from the pressure roller <b>30</b> to a farthest position therefrom. In such a condition, the pressure roller <b>30</b> can be separated from the fixing roller <b>20</b>, and the elastic roller <b>72</b> can be also separated from the metal roller <b>71</b>. In such a state, the nip pressure at the first nip of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> becomes zero, and the nip pressure at the second nip in the curling correction unit <b>70</b> also becomes zero.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When the recording medium P is jammed and is stopped at the first nip, such separated condition can be set, and an operator such as a user or a customer service representative can remove the recording medium P from the fixing unit <b>19</b>. In this state, the nip pressure at the first nip of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>, and the nip pressure at the second nip in the curling correction unit <b>70</b> is also decreased, in particular decreased to zero, by which the jammed recording medium P can be easily removed without resistance such as resistance from devices.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, when the sheet jamming occurs to the recording medium P in the fixing unit <b>19</b>, the eccentric cam <b>86</b> at the normal condition (conditions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the fixing unit <b>19</b> needs to be rotated to the condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Such rotation movement of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> can be conducted as follow: a sheet jamming detector disposed near the fixing unit <b>19</b> detects sheet jamming of the recording medium P, then based on the detection result, the stepping motor can be automatically controlled to drive and rotate the eccentric cam <b>86</b>. Further, such rotation movement of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> can be conducted using a different configuration as follows: an operator manually opens a body cover of apparatus for removing sheet jamming of the recording medium P, in which rotation movement of the eccentric cam <b>86</b> can be interlockingly conducted when the body cover is opened by devising a given configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a description is now given of the effect of the configuration described above using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates load from the one side of the elastic roller <b>72</b> in the curling correction unit <b>70</b>, and the vertical axis indicates curling amount of the recording medium P, in which positive values denote face curling (second curling direction) and negative values denote the back curling (first curling direction).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the solid circle (&#x25cf;) indicates curling amount when the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> is high, such as 300 N, (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and the solid square (&#x25aa;) indicates curling amount when the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> is low, such as 150 N (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the greater the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>, the greater the back curling amount. Further, the greater the load on the elastic roller <b>72</b>, the greater the face curling amount. Accordingly, it is preferable to control an increase or decrease of the nip pressure at the metal roller <b>71</b> and the elastic roller <b>72</b> by matching with the nip pressure to the increase or decrease of the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the final curling amount of the recording medium P can be set to substantially zero by setting a given combination for the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> and the load of the elastic roller <b>72</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> is 300 N and the load of the elastic roller <b>72</b> is set to 10 N, the curling amount becomes substantially zero. Conversely, when the nip pressure of the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> is 150 N and the load of the elastic roller <b>72</b> is set to 6 N, the curling amount becomes zero. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, other values between and beyond those described above may be set for pressure or the like depending on the specific configuration of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the above described example embodiment, even when the first nip pressure is increased or decreased, in response to the increased or decreased first nip pressure, the second curling direction amount applied to the recording medium P, the opposite direction of first curling direction amount, can be variably set, by which curling occurred to the recording medium P exiting the first nip can be uniformly corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, in the above described example embodiment, the fixing unit <b>19</b> uses an electromagnetic induction heating system having the coil unit <b>26</b> (exciting coil) as a heating device. However, the above described example embodiment can be applied to any types of fixing unit using a heater as the heating device in an image forming apparatus of electrophotography.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, in the above described example embodiment, the fixing roller <b>20</b> is used as the fixing member and the pressure roller <b>30</b> is used as the pressure member in the fixing unit. However, other member can be used as the fixing member and the pressure member. For example, a fixing belt or a fixing film may be used as the fixing member, and a pressure belt and a pressure pad can be used as the pressure member for the fixing unit for the above described example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, in the above described example embodiment, the first nip formed by the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> is configured to follow the curvature of the pressure roller <b>30</b> in the fixing unit <b>19</b>. However, the first nip formed by the fixing roller <b>20</b> and the pressure roller <b>30</b> can be configured to follow the curvature of the fixing roller <b>20</b> in the fixing unit <b>19</b>. In such a case, the first curling direction of the recording medium P exiting the first nip is the opposite direction of the first curling direction described in the above described example embodiment, in which the second curling direction to be applied to the recording medium P by the curling correction unit <b>70</b> needs to be set to the opposite direction of the second curling direction described in the above described example embodiment. Specifically, the position of the metal roller <b>71</b> and the elastic roller <b>72</b> may be reversed. In such a case too, the effect of an example embodiment can be similarly attained.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, in the above described example embodiment, the shifting unit is configured to move the pressure roller <b>30</b>, but the shifting unit can be configured to move the fixing roller <b>20</b> instead. Further, in the above described example embodiment, the variable setting unit is configured to move the elastic roller <b>72</b>, but the variable setting unit can be configured to move the metal roller <b>71</b> instead. In such a case too, the effect of an example embodiment can be similarly attained.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the above described example embodiment, even when the first nip pressure is increased or decreased, in response to the increased or decreased first nip pressure, the second curling direction amount can be variably set, which is the opposite direction of curling applied to the recording medium at the first nip, by which curling occurring to the recording medium exiting the first nip can be uniformly corrected, and such configuration can be applied to fixing units and image forming apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Numerous additional modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the disclosure of the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
