<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The addition of foaming agents and additives to firefighting water streams can be particularly useful for fighting fires, for example, fires in office buildings, industrial factories, chemical plants, petrochemical plants and petroleum refineries. The use of compressed air firefighting foam requires that air and a foam concentrate be mixed and added at constant proportions to the water stream. When the foam extinguisher solution is delivered, the foam effectively extinguishes the flames of chemical and petroleum fires, which would not be effectively extinguished by the application of water alone.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Compressed air foam technology improves the firefighting capacity of water and foam chemicals by producing a higher energy stream that penetrates the fire and by producing a higher quality foam bubble structure than is obtainable by other methods. The size of the compressed air foam bubble can be varied by controlling the ratio of compressed air to foam solution. Further, compressed air foam lines are lighter than water lines and place less stress on the firefighters and allow a greater degree of mobility. This facilitates reduced water damage, quicker fire knockdown, and a &#x201c;safer&#x201d; environment for both the firefighters and potential victims. Moreover, the compressed air foam will reduce the associated smoke damage by absorbing smoke from the air.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, current compressed air foam systems are not applicable to being transported to space restricted areas or to be permanently fixed in space restricted areas.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed is a firefighting station that is applicable to space restricted areas and can utilize existing pressurized air and water infrastructures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a firefighting station. The firefighting station includes an optional portable cart, one or more chemical foam proportioners, one or more first manifolds, one or more first valves, one or more first check valves, one or more second manifolds and one or more optional chemical fire suppression agent reservoirs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The firefighting station, as described herein, may be a rapid attack cart system. In this system, pressurized water is supplied from a hydrant, a portable pump, a relay station, for example, a fire truck, a home water system, an industrial type water connection, a feed from a hotel, or another fire hose station. The firefighting station would allow rapid response and deployment into areas where normal fire truck would not have the clearance to respond. For example, the firefighting station could be stationed or deployed in a high threat area, for example, an industrial conveyor belt in a restricted space. The firefighting station could be wheeled or permanently stationed near the fire area, hooked up to water hydrant and a source of pressurized air, and produce a chemical foam, a compressed air foam, water, a dry chemical fire suppression agent, or a combination thereof, either individually or simultaneously. The firefighting station could also be configured with break-apart feature for carrying or for storage in small compartments, for example, in a fire truck compartment. The firefighting station could also be stationed with permanent water and gas piping in hazardous areas of a plant or refueling center.</p>

The firefighting station includes an optional portable cart, one or more chemical foam proportioners, one or more first manifolds, one or more first valves, one or more first check valves, one or more second manifolds and one or more optional chemical fire suppression agent reservoirs.</p>
<p id="p-0563" num="0594">The firefighting station, as described herein, may be a rapid attack cart system. In this system, pressurized water is supplied from a hydrant, a portable pump, a relay station, for example, a fire truck, a home water system, an industrial type water connection, a feed from a hotel, or another fire hose station. The firefighting station would allow rapid response and deployment into areas where normal fire truck would not have the clearance to respond. For example, the firefighting station could be stationed or deployed in a high threat area, for example, an industrial conveyor belt in a restricted space. The firefighting station could be wheeled or permanently stationed near the fire area, hooked up to water hydrant and a source of pressurized air, and produce a chemical foam, a compressed air foam, water, a dry chemical fire suppression agent, or a combination thereof, either individually or simultaneously. The firefighting station could also be configured with break-apart feature for carrying or for storage in small compartments, for example, in a fire truck compartment. The firefighting station could also be stationed with permanent water and gas piping in hazardous areas of a plant or refueling center.</p>

Class A foam is useful for fires involving solid combustibles, building materials, structures, rubbish, vehicles, industrial, marine, wild lands, and the like. Other classes of foam can be stored in the one or more foam systems. For example, class B foam is used for flammable liquid fires, class C foam is more effective against electrical fires, and class D foam is best suited for combustible metals. The one or more foam systems may contain other fire retardants and chemical agents.</p>
<p id="p-0613" num="0644">In the claims provided herein, the steps specified to be taken in a claimed method or process may be carried out in any order without departing from the principles of the invention, except when a temporal or operational sequence is explicitly defined by claim language. Recitation in a claim to the effect that first a step is performed then several other steps are performed shall be taken to mean that the first step is performed before any of the other steps, but the other steps may be performed in any sequence unless a sequence is further specified within the other steps. For example, claim elements that recite &#x201c;first A, then B, C, and D, and lastly E&#x201d; shall be construed to mean step A must be first, step E must be last, but steps B, C, and D may be carried out in any sequence between steps A and E and the process of that sequence will still fall within the four corners of the claim.</p>
<p id="p-0614" num="0645">Furthermore, in the claims provided herein, specified steps may be carried out concurrently unless explicit claim language requires that they be carried out separately or as parts of different processing operations. For example, a claimed step of doing X and a claimed step of doing Y may be conducted simultaneously within a single operation, and the resulting process will be covered by the claim. Thus, a step of doing X, a step of doing Y, and a step of doing Z may be conducted simultaneously within a single process step, or in two separate process steps, or in three separate process steps, and that process will still fall within the four corners of a claim that recites those three steps.</p>
<p id="p-0615" num="0646">Similarly, except as explicitly required by claim language, a single substance or component may meet more than a single functional requirement, provided that the single substance fulfills the more than one functional requirement as specified by claim language.</p>
