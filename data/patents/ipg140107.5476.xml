<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/181,918 entitled &#x201c;PAY FOR PLACEMENT SEARCH ENGINE WITH REAL-TIME ACCOUNT PROCESSING&#x201d; which was filed on Feb. 11, 2000.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to marketing distribution via a computer network and more particularly relates to systems and methods for marketing using the distribution of a pay for performance search database using a network of affiliate service providers.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Internet has quickly grown from an obscure resource for high level researchers to a ubiquitous resource having hundreds of millions of pages of content which is accessible by millions of users. To locate and access specific information of interest within this vast collection of distributed content, various search engines exist which query the pages of content on a continuous basis and generate a searchable database in which the various pages of content are listed. A user desiring access to content enters a set of search terms in a search engine which are believed to be relevant to the desired content. A list of content pages which match some relevancy criteria is provided by the search engine in response.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are numerous search engines, such as www.excite.com, www.yahoo.com, www.altavista.com and www.google.com, which provide such a service. While the particulars of each search algorithm differ, each of these search engines provide results which are listed by some algorithmically determined relevancy measure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An alternative to the computer generated relevancy measure which is provided by a number of conventional search engines, some search engines, such as www.goto.com, provide a pay for placement feature which effects where particular content will be listed in response to a user search. In this pay for placement model, advertisers pay a bid amount for certain keywords which are expected to be relevant to the goods and services offered on the content pages they provide. If a user's search includes a keyword which has been purchased by one or more advertisers, these content pages will be listed with a higher priority, in descending order, starting from the highest bidding advertising. In the goto.com pay for placement model, advertisers pay the bid amount when a user clicks on the displayed content page listing, which provides a hypertext link to the advertisers content pages. The pay for placement model results in the generation of a database of advertisers which are willing to pay a certain denomination when a user actively clicks on a listing. However, in known search engines, this database is only accessible through the search service provider's own Internet webpage, which limits the reach of this service to advertisers. In other words, the scope of access to such a search engine is directly related to the brand recognition of the search engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to provide a system and method for marketing which uses the broad distribution of access to a pay for performance database of advertisers as a marketing vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a further object of the invention to distribute access to a pay for performance database to a large number of unique users through a network of affiliate service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a further object of the invention to provide a system and method of marketing wherein advertisers and affiliate service providers can assess the performance of their participation in the system in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A system for marketing distribution over a computer data network in accordance with the invention includes at least one advertising client computer, at least one affiliate service provider computer, at least one query client computer and a server computer which are coupled to the data network. The server computer maintains an advertiser account database and an advertiser keywords database which has a number of keyword entries and entry denominations which are associated with advertising content pages of the advertising client computers. The server also includes a query processing subsection which is operatively coupled to the advertiser keywords database. The query processing subsection is responsive to a search term entered on a query client computer which is provided to the server computer via one of the affiliate service provider computers. The query processing subsection returns search results to the query client which includes those entries in the advertiser keywords database which match the search term entered by the query client computer. The search results are ordered in accordance with the denomination associated with the entries in the advertiser keyword database and have a link to the associated content pages. The denomination provides a pay for performance aspect to the search results. Advertisers pay the amount of the denomination when the entry is selected by the client. Affiliate service providers are credited an amount, such as a portion of the denomination, when the entry is selected by the client. The use of a number of affiliate service providers expands access to the advertiser keyword database to a large number of unique users.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, at the time an advertiser enters a bid on a selected keyword, the server performs a relevancy determination prior to accepting the bid amount. In performing the relevancy determination, the site title, description and/or content are compared against the selected keyword to determine if the keyword satisfies a minimum relevancy measure. The relevancy determination can include a thesaurus, synonym checker and a category/association groupings database. In the event that the automated relevancy determination algorithm rejects the bid, the advertiser can select a different keyword or submit the keyword to a human operator associated with the server to make a final determination of relevancy. This minimum relevancy measure prevents advertisers from placing a bid on non-relevant keywords and insures that the results which are provided to users are relevant to the search query.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the server computer also includes an account processing subsection which allows authorized users to view and modify the contents of the account database and the advertiser keywords database.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method for marketing distribution over a computer network in accordance with the present invention includes maintaining an advertiser keyword database having a plurality of entries which are associated with advertising content. Each of the entries includes at least one keyword and a denomination associated with the keyword. A search interface is provided to a number of affiliate service providers which in turn provides access to the advertiser keyword database for users of the affiliate service providers. At least one keyword which is entered in the search interface by a user of an affiliate service provider is used to search the advertiser keyword database to find entries which match the at least one keyword entered in the search. Entries in the advertiser keyword database which match the keywords from the search are provided to the user of the affiliate service provider. The search results are sorted in order in accordance with the denominations associated with the entries. The method further includes determining if the user selected at least one of the entries from the search results and, if so, debiting an advertisers account for the value of the denomination associated with the selected entry.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As in the system setforth above, it is preferable for the keywords selected by the advertiser to be subjected to a relevancy determination to insure that the selected keywords are appropriate for the advertisers content pages. When an advertisers selects a keyword and places a bid, the bid will only be accepted if a minimum relevancy threshold is satisfied. Only those advertisers whose content satisfies the minimum relevancy threshold will be listed among the pay for performance results.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the method further includes crediting the account of the affiliate service provider, such as with a portion of the denomination associated with the selected entry.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also preferred that the accounts of the affiliate service provider and the advertisers be accessible to authorized users in real time. This allows the keywords to be altered and the denominations associated with the keywords to also be altered to improve the performance of the marketing method.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified block diagram of a system for practicing the present marketing method which involves distributing a pay for performance database to query clients via search engine front-end software which is distributed to a number of affiliate service providers. The system includes a server <b>100</b> which is operatively coupled to a data network <b>110</b>, such as the Internet, via appropriate communication processing and I/O circuitry <b>120</b> which are well known in the art. The server <b>100</b> maintains the pay for performance database, performs query processing and also performs account processing functions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In query processing, when a key word search is entered by a query client <b>130</b>, which is a remote computer, network appliance or set top box, coupled to the server <b>100</b> via the Internet <b>110</b>, the communication processing block <b>120</b> passes the search query to a query processing block <b>130</b>. The query processing block <b>130</b> submits the keyword search to both a proprietary pay-for placement advertiser keyword database <b>140</b> in the server <b>100</b> and a generic search engine database <b>150</b> via the Internet <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The generic search engine database can take the form generally known in the art which are generated by various web crawler and web spider techniques, such as the database offered by Inkotomi. The query processing block <b>130</b> can receive relevant responses to the keyword search inquiry from both the generic search engine database <b>150</b> and from the pay-for-performance <b>140</b>. The results are merged by the query processing block <b>130</b> with the results from advertiser keyword database <b>140</b> having priority over the results from the generic search engine database <b>150</b>. The results from the advertiser keyword database <b>140</b> are further sorted in descending order based on a denomination associated with the keyword in the advertiser keyword database <b>140</b>, which is generally a cash amount paid per &#x201c;click through&#x201d; by advertisers purchasing the keywords. In this way, the advertiser keyword database <b>140</b> is a pay-for-performance database.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Prior to adding an entry in the advertiser keyword database <b>140</b>, the server can perform a relevancy algorithm which determines if the advertiser's content satisfies a minimum relevancy measure compared to the selected keyword. Various levels of relevancy measures can be used. For example, as a first relevancy measure, the title, description and content of the advertiser's website can be evaluated to determine if the selected keyword, or an equivalent from a thesaurus database, are present. An additional relevancy measure can be to evaluate the content of the advertiser's web page to determine the categories of goods and services which are being offered by the advertiser and then comparing the selected categories to potential categories for the selected keywords. For example, for a keyword FISHING, several categories of content such as watersports, fishing, bait &#x26; tackle, wilderness travel, sporting goods, etc., would be appropriate. If the advertiser's content did not appear to fall within one of the categories, the bid can be rejected and the advertiser can select a different keyword or request manual review by a human operator. By including an initial relevancy screening at the keyword selection process, the integrity of the pay-for-performance results which are returned to a ser in response to a search having a selected keyword are insured.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram which illustrates the hierarchy of the present system and method for distributing access to and results from a pay for performance database. The system includes the server <b>100</b> which is coupled to a large number of affiliate service provider computers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. While three such affiliate service provider computers are illustrated, there is no limit on the number of such affiliates and a typical system will preferably involve hundreds, or thousands of such affiliates. The affiliate service provider computers can be almost any computer connected to the data network which have content of interest to a number of users. The affiliate service provider computers can be community sites, content sites, special interest sites and the like. Each affiliate service provider computer <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> has an associated group of clients <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> which are associated therewith. The clients are simply users of the computer network which access the content and or services of the affiliate service provider computer. Although, as the number of affiliates increases the amount of overlap in clients <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> associated with the affiliates <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> also increases, there is a substantial number of unique clients associated with each affiliate service provider. Thus, the use of an affiliate network <b>190</b> provides the server <b>100</b> with access to a large number of clients. The lines shown between the clients <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> and affiliate service providers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> illustrate an association or affiliation, rather than a physical connection. As described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the client computers, affiliate service providers and server <b>100</b> are generally coupled to a public data network, such as the Internet, where mutual bidirectional communication is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart which further illustrates the interaction between the server <b>100</b>, affiliate service providers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and clients <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the server <b>100</b> maintains an advertiser client keyword database <b>140</b> (step <b>302</b>). In this database, the server <b>100</b> stores a list of keywords which have been bid on by one or more advertisers along with associated denominations, or bid amounts, for the keywords. The advertisers can review this database and determine their placement in a search which includes a particular search term by comparing the bid price they are willing to pay when a client selects there content as compared to competitive bid prices for the same keyword. The server also includes a query processing subsystem <b>130</b> which allows client queries to be parsed and compared against the advertising keyword database <b>140</b> to determine if there is one or more match.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to participate in the system, the affiliate service providers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> must have appropriate affiliate software which provides a search term entry field to the client computers, passes the search terms entered by the clients to the server <b>100</b> and allows the search results to be returned to the clients. The affiliate software also provides a mechanism for reporting to the server <b>100</b> when a client selects an entry from the search results for subsequent account processing and routing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the affiliate software is preferably distributed to the affiliate service provider by the server <b>100</b> via the Internet network connection (step <b>304</b>). Of course, computer readable media with the affiliate software thereon can also be provided to the affiliate if desired. The affiliate software will present a search term entry field on the affiliate service provider Internet content page where a client <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> can enter one or more search terms (step <b>306</b>). When the client enters a search term, the affiliate software submits the search to the server <b>100</b> for query processing (step <b>308</b>). The search results from the server <b>100</b> are then returned to the client. Preferably, the search results include both the direct hits in the advertiser keyword database <b>140</b> followed by the results from a conventional generic search engine database <b>150</b>, such as that provided by Inkotomi, Inc (step <b>310</b>). The results can be provided to the client by passing the data to the affiliate service provider <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, or by temporally linking the client to a separate web page provided by the server <b>100</b>. Generally, the search results take the form of a list of titles and descriptions of relevant content along with a hypertext link to the content. For those results which are provided from the advertiser keyword database, an indication of the price paid by the advertiser for such ranking may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To select content of interest from the search results, the client selects the entry, such as by clicking on the entry using a graphical user interface (GUI) at the client location. If the query client selects an entry in the search result (step <b>312</b>), the server is notified of the selection (step <b>314</b>). The notification can take the form of a message provided by the affiliate network provider, or can take the form of routing the client through the server <b>100</b> or associated redirect computer on the way to the destination of the selected content. In either case, the client will be routed to location of the selected content, which is generally specified as a network address or uniform resource locator (URL) (step <b>316</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The notification to the server in step <b>314</b> provides an indication of the affiliate service provider which referred the client as well as an indication of the content that was selected. From this information, the server <b>100</b> can perform account processing. The account processing includes debiting the advertiser of the selected content the denominated bid amount for the client's &#x201c;click-through&#x201d; to the advertisers content (step <b>318</b>). A portion of the proceeds from the advertiser, or some other fee arrangement, is attributable to the affiliate service provider as compensation for the referral. Therefore, the account processing also includes crediting the account of the affiliate for the appropriate sum (step <b>320</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The account processing will be described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As noted above, the advertiser keyword database <b>140</b> provides a list of advertisers who have placed bids for premium placement in results for queries using particular search terms, or keywords. To effect this operation, the server <b>100</b> includes an account processing block <b>160</b>. The account processing block <b>160</b> is coupled to advertising clients <b>170</b> via the Internet <b>110</b>. The account processing block allows advertisers to bid for various keywords in real time, open a payment account in real time, and access keyword performance data in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The account processing block <b>160</b> is coupled to a credit processing block <b>170</b> which communicates with remote credit providers to establish an advertiser account in real time. To open an account, a prospective advertising client <b>170</b> provides accessible credit information, such as credit card, debit card, or online account information to the server <b>100</b> which authenticates the credit information and effects a fund transfer from the remote credit account to an advertiser account stored in an account database <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The account processing block <b>160</b> provides numerous account features which allow an advertising client to efficiently select keywords, bid on keywords and evaluate the performance of various keywords, all in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exemplary screen display that would be presented on an advertising client computer <b>170</b> display when accessing a listing manager portion of the server <b>100</b>. The server <b>100</b> has a number of user accessible functional areas, which are denoted as tabs, buttons, or the like, on one or more page of accessible content from server <b>100</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> there is a lobby tab <b>402</b>, where an advertising subscriber can find general information, a listing manager tab <b>402</b>, an account manager tab <b>406</b>, an add funds tab <b>408</b>, a keyword center tab <b>410</b> and a help desk tab <b>412</b>. Theses various user areas are selected by an advertising client, preferably by use of a GUI interface which is associated with Internet web browsing software installed in the advertising client computer unit or set top box. When a particular tab is selected, that page of content is brought forward on the display and various options and data entry fields are presented. Of course, the features of the server functions should be password protected to insure that only authorized users can access the account database.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the exemplary options which can be displayed in response to the listing manager tab <b>404</b> being selected. This section of the server allows an advertising subscriber to manage an existing entry in the account database <b>414</b>, create a new listing in the account database <b>416</b>, or delete an entry from the account database <b>418</b>. The main portion of the display illustrates a current website profile for an existing database entry. The profile generally includes a website title <b>420</b>, a website address or URL <b>422</b> and a description of the content of the website <b>424</b>. Optionally, a box can be provided to indicated that the website contains adult content <b>426</b>. This feature can be used for filtering adult content away from minors or for indicating that such content is present so that clients can make an informed decision as to whether to access the particular site. A save changes button <b>428</b> and a clear changes button <b>430</b> may be provided to confirm or remove edits which have been entered by the advertising subscriber. In addition to title, address and description, for the pay for performance feature, the website profile must be associated with one or more purchased keywords. The website profile includes a link <b>432</b>, such as a hypertext link to the advertiser keyword database portion of the account database.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides an exemplary keyword manager screen which can be accessed by selecting link <b>432</b>. The keyword manager screen allows an authorized user to view, add, modify and delete keywords and bid denominations which are associated with a particular website profile. The keyword manager screen generally provides a listing of current keywords <b>502</b> which are associated with a given profile. The current bid <b>504</b> and bid rank <b>506</b> are also displayed in association with the keywords. In addition, the top bids, such as the top five bids, for that keyword can also be displayed. The current bid and top five bid fields generally show the amount of currency (such as U.S. $) that the advertiser is willing to pay each time that a client clicks on the listing of the website in response to a particular search using the keyword. New keywords can be added using an add keyword button <b>510</b> or link. Existing keywords can be deleted using a delete keyword button or link <b>512</b>. Similarly, an existing keyword can be modified, such as by altering the spelling or bid amount, by selecting the modify a keyword button or link <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To assist in selecting keywords, the keyword center tab <b>410</b> can be selected and a screen display, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, can be provided by the server to the advertising client. The keyword center can display the top search terms <b>602</b> used over a predefined interval, such as a week. Using a data entry field <b>604</b>, an advertising subscriber can enter a term and view the types of goods and services generally being sought by query clients entering this term in a search. Alternatively, the data entry field <b>604</b> can be used for accessing a thesaurus feature to identify similar or related search terms to the term which was entered.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to the initial account set up and keyword management functions, the server also allows advertising subscribers to view and evaluate various account performance indicators in real time. This allows the advertisers to actively select those terms which are most effective at driving traffic to their websites and to update the current bid amount accordingly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exemplary screen display illustrating an overview of account activity for a given website for which nine search terms have been bid upon. The display illustrates the search terms <b>702</b>, the number of click throughs for each search term <b>704</b> and then presents this data in graphical form <b>706</b>. The user can change the month being viewed using the month selector field <b>708</b> to review past performance. The account performance screen also includes links to other display options such as account overview <b>710</b>, activity overview <b>712</b>, financial overview <b>714</b> and banner overview <b>716</b>, which provide real time reports with respect to various aspects of the advertisers account.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> are exemplary screen displays which an advertising client can use to evaluate the traffic and revenue which is provided by the affiliate service providers in the affiliate network <b>190</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, two graphs are presented showing the number of affiliate searches which included one or more search terms for a given website profile in two consecutive months, such as a previous month <b>802</b> and a current month <b>804</b>. By clicking on a link <b>806</b> to affiliate revenue, the amount of revenue generated by affiliate searches can be provided. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the amount of revenue can be illustrated as a pair of graphs showing the revenue for all of the search terms of a given website in consecutive months, such as a previous month <b>902</b> and a current month <b>904</b>. By evaluating the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the user can evaluate determine if the selected search terms are providing an adequate amount of interest. From the graphs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the advertising subscriber can determine how effective the current bid, title and description of the website are in converting searches to click through traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The use of an affiliate network is a valuable way of driving a large number of unique query clients to the pay for performance advertisers database of keywords. This database can also be accessed directly by a web page associated with the server <b>100</b>. In addition, the database can be accessed using a software application which can be installed directly on the query client's computer and effectively provides a short cut which directly launches the query client to the server <b>100</b>. In this case a software application can be installed on the client computer either by distributing computer readable media through conventional channels, such as the mail, or by downloading the software from the server <b>100</b> or other download host computer. The software provides an active region on the client computer display, such as an icon in a Windows display environment, which can be directly accessed by the client, i.e., the client need not navigate to either the server <b>100</b> or an affiliate service provider computer to receive a search prompt. In response to the entry of a search term by the client, the software establishes a connection over the network with the server <b>100</b> such that the search can be processed in a manner as described above. After the software is initially launched and the server <b>100</b> is accessed, the client receives search results and can act on those search results in a manner consistent with that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present system and method for marketing using a pay for performance search engine system allows advertisers to reach relevant customers by purchasing one or more keywords which are closely related to the goods and services offered by the advertiser. The customer benefits from the pay for performance search results in that relevance of the results is highly likely since the advertiser is paying for each &#x201c;click through&#x201d; of a payed for search result hit. The advertiser benefits in that only actual click-throughs, i.e., traffic to the advertisers site, are paid for, rather than paying for a large number passive views of advertising content. The real-time processing of the account processing section allows advertisers to establish an account and purchase key words immediately, without the need to wait for payment to be mailed in to the service provider or billed at a later date. the real time processing also allows advertisers to immediately see the high bids currently being paid for the top placements of a desired key word. The use of an affiliate network provides broad access to the advertiser keyword database to a large number of unique clients without the search server requiring high profile brand equity. Affiliate service providers benefit in that they are compensated when one of their users acts upon the results of as search conducted through the affiliate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated that the various processing blocks can be implemented on a single computer or on multiple computers which are interconnected via a network. It will be further appreciated that the various operations described herein can be implemented in numerous combinations of hardware and software, all of which are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
