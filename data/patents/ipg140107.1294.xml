<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A linear recliner assembly in use with a seat having a seat back pivotally engaged relative to a seat bottom. A housing exhibits a communicating interior between a first and second ends. A drive rod is supported in linearly displaceable fashion from the first end and is secured to the seat bottom. The second end pivotally engages the seatback spaced from its pivot point. A rotatable gear located at a fixed lineal position within the housing receives the drive rod in threadably inter-engaged fashion. A trigger mechanism pivotally secured to the housing exhibits a downwardly biased detent communicating through an opening in the housing to seat between succeeding teeth of the gear. A spring supported within the housing contacts the drive rod. Upon release of the detent, a reclining force applied to the seatback results in displacement of the housing against the drive rod to bias the spring. The spring influencing the drive rod in a reverse direction such that, upon release of said detent when the seatback is in the reclined position, the spring influences the seatback to reverse pivot to a returned upright position.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a linear recliner assembly in use with a recliner seat having a seat back pivotally engaged with a seat bottom. More specifically, the present invention discloses a manually operable recliner assembly including an exteriorly threaded drive rod inter-engaged with one or more interiorly threaded and rotating gear stop elements. The drive rod is displaced in a first direction within the assembly housing, consistent with a seat occupant physically reclining the seat back, an inner end bushing secured to the rod compressing against an interiorly positioned spring. Upon re-triggering the release of the gear stop elements, the compressed spring influences the drive rod in a reverse linear extending fashion from the housing, thereby influencing the seatback to a reverse pivoting and upright position.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art is documented with examples of linear seat recliners. As is further known, most such seat recliners require a power input in order to cycle such as a threaded rod which influences a seat back pivotally connected to a frame location of a seat bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of such power linear seat recliner assemblies are set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,199,764 and 4,962,963, both to Robinson, and which controllably adjusts the angular position of a seat back relative to a seat cushion. A master recliner mechanism includes an integrally mounted motor, a slave recliner mechanism, and an actuator cable connecting the slave and master recliner mechanisms for transmitting torque from the motor to the slave recliner mechanism. The motor simultaneously drives each of the recliner mechanisms, each of which having a threaded rod assembly interconnected to a transmission assembly for providing desired speed reduction and linear reciprocal movement of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional manual linear type seat recliners are known and include such as that disclosed in Conroy U.S. Pat. No. 4,669,781 which teaches a polygonal cross sectional shaped rod pivotally connected to the seat back. A nut exhibits a generally fixed position relative to the seat cushion and threadably engages around the rod. The nut is movable to first and second angular positions relative to the rod such that, and in the first position, the nut engages the rod at the threaded apices to lock the rod in position relative to the nut. Upon being rotated to the second position, the rod is released for adjusting the angular position of the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also shown in Pickles U.S. Pat. No. 5,582,461 is an infinitely adjustable linear actuator which adjusts the relative position of two relatively movable components of a vehicle seat. The linear actuator includes a rotatable element fixedly mounted about a threaded shaft. First and second moving members are mounted within a housing, disposed on opposite sides of an annular collar formed on the rotatable element. The moving members are movable between a first position in which they disengage the rotatable element from bearing surfaces at opposite ends of the housing to form a high rotational resistance connection preventing rotation of the rotatable element and the interconnected threaded shaft and a second position in which the moving members are spaced from the rotatable element to enable the rotatable element to move axially into low resistance engagement with the bearings in the housing to enable free rotation of the rotatable element and the threaded shaft.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention discloses a manually operable linear recliner assembly in use with a recliner seat having a seat back pivotally engaged seat bottom. More specifically, the present invention discloses a manually operable recliner assembly including an exteriorly threaded drive rod inter-engaged with one or more interiorly threaded and rotating gear stop elements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The linear recliner assembly is pivotally engaged relative to a seat bottom. A housing body exhibits a communicating interior between a first and second ends. A drive rod is supported in linearly displaceable fashion from the first end and is secured to such as a frame location of the seat bottom. The second end pivotally engages the seatback at a location spaced from its pivot point.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A rotatable gear is located at a fixed lineal position within the housing and receives the drive rod in threadably inter-engaged fashion. A trigger mechanism is pivotally secured to an exterior of the housing and exhibits a downwardly biased detent communicating through an opening in the housing to seat between succeeding teeth of the gear. A spring supported within the housing contacts the drive rod. Upon release of the detent, an external reclining force applied to the seatback results in displacement of the housing against the drive rod to bias the spring. The spring influences the drive rod in a reverse direction such that, upon release of said detent when the seatback is in the reclined position, the spring influences the seatback to reverse pivot to a returned upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional features include the housing exhibiting a central tubular portion with a first end cap through which slidably displaces the drive rod and a second end cap which is pivotally mounted to the seatback. A secondary housing includes a trigger support portion and slidably inserts in coaxially fitting fashion within the central tubular portion, and in particular a linear extending recess associated with the central tubular portion through which projects the trigger support portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A cable attachment bracket secures to the central tubular portion in proximity to the trigger mechanism and to which is mounted a fixed outer sheath portion of a cable, with an inner translating portion extending from the outer sheath and engaging a clip secured to an upper projecting location of the trigger mechanism. A pair of torsion springs are secured upon opposing sides of a pivotal axis defining support pin, this extending crosswise through the trigger support portion and the trigger mechanism. In this fashion, the detent is continually biased in downward engaging direction with the rotatable gear teeth to restrain rotation of the gear to linear displacement of the drive rod, and unless the cable is triggered (such as by a remotely located lever) in order to move the seat back between the reclined and upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other features associated with the present design include such as the provision of (eccentric) load supporting thrust bearings arranged on either side of the rotatable gear, as well as a support bushing positioned in end facing contact with a selected thrust bearing. Other features include a cylindrical shaped drive support portion secured to an end face of the rotatable gear, as well as an end bushing secured to an interiorly extending end of the drive rod, this including an exposed end face which biases against the extending coiled ends of the compressible spring.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to the several illustrations, the present invention discloses a manually operable linear recliner assembly in use with a recliner seat having a seat back pivotally engaged relative to a seat bottom. More specifically, the present invention discloses a manually operable recliner assembly including, most broadly, an exteriorly threaded and linearly displaceable drive rod threadably inter-engaged with a stationary positioned and rotating gear supported within the recliner assembly and which is selectively permitted to rotate by an engaging trigger mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In combination with a biasing coil spring contained with the housing, relative linear motion of the drive rod relative to the housing (caused by a seat occupant manually reclining the seat back) results in the spring being compressed. Upon re-triggering the release of the gear in the reclined position, the spring causes the drive rod to displace in an opposite direction, corresponding to an upright return position of the seatback.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantages associated with the present design include the ability to effectively recline the seat back manually, while facilitating the compressed spring force for returning the seat back to the upright design position, this saving dramatically on the expense and requirements of other powered seat variants. Additional advantages include the high cycling capabilities of the system, this maintaining the integrity of the design after repeated recline to upright return iterations. In this fashion, the construction of the manual recliner assembly is such that it provides a durable assembly which can endure numerous cycling requirements over a long life.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While not limited to any one type of application, it is further understood and envisioned that the linear recliner assembly can be incorporated into any type of seat design not limited to vehicular applications, and in which seatback upright return is desired without requiring additional physical input. Such applications can include airline seats, as well as use in furniture and in addition to contemplated vehicle uses.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an operational view is illustrated at <b>10</b> the linear recliner assembly fixedly secured at a forward end to a frame location <b>2</b> of a seat bottom <b>4</b>. A rotating coupling is illustrated at <b>6</b> mounted over the fixed frame location <b>2</b>, the coupling receiving the forward mounting end of the recliner assembly. Further illustrated at <b>8</b> is a generally lower-most extending location of a seatback, this being arranged a spaced distance from a pivot point (see nut) <b>9</b> of the seat back, and such that, upon reclining of the seat back, the lower-most location will reverse pivot (i.e. exhibit a rotating direction opposite to that of the upper seat back) in a force exerting direction towards the assembly <b>10</b>. In this fashion, the linear recliner assembly is pivotally engaged relative to a seat bottom at both the forward seat frame mounted coupling <b>6</b> and the lower extending seat back location <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As further illustrated throughout the several views, a housing body exhibits a communicating interior extending between first and second ends. More specifically, a central tubular portion <b>12</b> is provided with a first end cap <b>14</b> secured over the first end of the central tubular portion <b>12</b>, the first end cap exhibiting an end face located and centrally positioned opening through which slidably displaces an exteriorly threaded (e.g. exhibiting such as a triple spiraling threaded profile) drive rod <b>16</b>. A second end cap <b>18</b> is secured over the second end of the central tubular portion <b>12</b> and terminates in a pair of linear extending and spaced apart mounting portions, see at <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, these aligning with mounting portions of the pivotal seatback mounting location <b>8</b>. A mounting pin <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) extends crosswise through aligning apertures (see at <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) defined in the mounting portions <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> as well as an aligning aperture (not shown) in the seatback location <b>8</b> for pivotally mounting the recliner assembly to the seatback as well as to the seat bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A secondary (likewise cylindrical shaped) housing is provided at <b>30</b> (see as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and includes a trigger support, illustrated as a pair of spaced apart and upwardly/linearly projecting bridge portions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. The dimensioning of the secondary cylindrical shaped housing <b>30</b> is such that it is capable of coaxially and slidably inserting within the open end of the main central housing <b>12</b>, the housing <b>12</b> further exhibiting a linear extending recess <b>36</b> (again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) extending from the associated end for a distance and corresponding to the dimension necessary to seat the linear projecting dimension of the trigger support portions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A rotatable gear <b>38</b> (see as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is located at a fixed lineal position within the housing and receives the drive rod <b>16</b> in threadably inter-engaged fashion, the gear <b>38</b> illustrating an inner annular wall (not shown) upon which a plurality of spiral threads are inscribed, these engaging such as the triple threaded exterior spiral profile of the drive rod <b>16</b>. As further shown, the gear <b>38</b> exhibits a plurality of outer peripherally and circumferentially extending teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As best shown again in the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as well the sectional exploded illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and the rotated two dimensional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a pair of (eccentric) load supporting thrust bearings <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are arranged on either side of the stationary positioned and rotatable gear <b>38</b>. Each of the thrust bearings, as best again shown by thrust bearing <b>40</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, includes a central load supporting disk portion <b>44</b> incorporating an annular array of individual bearings mounted thereto, the central disk <b>44</b> being sandwiched between a pair of outer disk coverings <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additional features shown include a support bushing <b>50</b> positioned in end facing contact with selected thrust bearing <b>40</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and so that the support bushing <b>50</b> is seated in abutting contact with the first end cap <b>14</b>, with the threaded drive rod <b>16</b> projecting through aligning central apertures in the support bushing <b>50</b> and the end cap <b>14</b>. Other features include a cylindrical shaped drive support portion <b>52</b>, this securing to an end face of the rotatable gear <b>38</b>. An end bushing <b>54</b> is secured to an interiorly extending end of the drive rod <b>16</b> (such as by fasteners including hex or pin screws, not shown, inserting in lateral projecting fashion through mounting apertures <b>56</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A coiled spring <b>58</b> is seated within the central housing <b>12</b>, proximate the second end cap <b>18</b>, and such that it biases against an end face of the end bushing <b>54</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a spacer washer <b>60</b> is sandwiched between the exposed face of the end bushing <b>54</b> and a terminating coil of the spring <b>58</b>. Comparing the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the assembled and partially transparent view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (as well as the cutaway line art illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) the manner in which the inner working components of the recliner assembly are mounted within the housing is clearly shown.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A trigger mechanism is provided as a main body <b>62</b> exhibiting a generally flattened planar shape and, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, includes a height increased forward portion <b>64</b> and a substantially planar rear underside <b>66</b>. The main body <b>62</b> is pivotally secured at an exterior of the housing, such as by aligning the body <b>62</b> between the pair of spaced apart and upwardly/linearly projecting bridge portions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A pair of torsion springs are shown at <b>68</b> and <b>70</b>, these being secured upon opposing sides of a pivotal axis established by apertured locations in the forward portion <b>64</b> of the trigger body <b>62</b> and the portions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> (see again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and through which is inserted a support pin <b>65</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to pivotally support the trigger mechanism body <b>62</b> between the bridge portions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> collectively defining the trigger support. A detent <b>74</b> is provided as (without limitation) a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped rigid wire and which is secured to a rear of the main trigger body <b>62</b> in downward extending fashion (as shown including the extending ends of the detent <b>74</b> mounting in vertical passageways in the trigger body and such that the detent extends from the planar rear underside <b>66</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this fashion, the detent <b>74</b> is continually biased in downward engaging direction through the linear extending recess <b>36</b>, and so that the interconnecting and crosswise extending end portion of the detent <b>74</b> seats within a valley location established between any succeeding pair of gear teeth to restrain rotation of the gear <b>38</b>, thereby preventing resultant linear displacement of the drive rod <b>16</b>. Additional features include a cable attachment bracket <b>76</b> secured to the central tubular portion <b>12</b>, the bracket <b>76</b> including an upward terminating cable mount portion <b>78</b> arranged in proximity to the trigger mechanism <b>62</b> and to which is mounted a fixed outer sheath portion <b>80</b> of a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An inner translating portion <b>82</b> extends from the outer sheath <b>80</b> and engages a clip <b>84</b> secured (such as by pins <b>86</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to the upper projecting forward location <b>64</b> of the trigger mechanism <b>62</b>. As further shown, the opposite extending legs associated with each of the torsional springs <b>68</b> and <b>70</b> include a first end biasing the bridge portions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and a second end downwardly biasing the main trigger body <b>62</b>. The inner cable portion <b>82</b> is triggered (such as by a remotely located lever not shown) in a retracting direction toward the fixed outer sheath <b>80</b>, in order to pivotally disengage the detent <b>74</b> from the gear teeth <b>38</b> to move the seat back between the reclined and upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In use, and upon release of the detent <b>74</b> from the gear <b>38</b>, an external reclining force applied to the seatback (such as by the user leaning back against the seat) results in displacement of the housing (e.g. central body <b>12</b> with end caps <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>) against the drive rod <b>16</b> (this resulting in an inwardly directed rotational to translational force delivered by the lowermost seat back portion <b>8</b> against the cylinder housing and as further shown by rotational arrow <b>88</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This results in the drive rod <b>16</b> displacing against (and inwardly) relative to the housing, to bias the coil spring <b>58</b> (see as further best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this manner, the spring <b>58</b> influences the drive rod <b>16</b> in a reverse direction such that, upon release of said detent <b>74</b> when the seatback is in the reclined position, the spring <b>58</b> influences the seatback to reverse pivot to a returned upright position (again <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As previously explained, the drive rod <b>16</b> is displaced in the first reclining direction within the assembly housing, consistent with a seat occupant (not shown) physically reclining the seat back (i.e. by pushing against the seat back following triggering the release of the detent <b>74</b> from the gear <b>38</b>) and so that the inner end bushing <b>54</b> secured to the drive rod <b>16</b> compresses against the interiorly positioned spring <b>58</b>. Upon re-triggering the release of the gear stop elements, the compressed spring <b>58</b> acts as a reverse direction driving force, thereby influencing the drive rod <b>16</b> in a reverse linear extending fashion from the housing, again in order to influence the seatback to a reverse pivoting and upright position.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exploded view is generally shown at <b>90</b> of a linear recliner assembly according to a further embodiment, such as in comparison to that previously depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A redesigned central tubular portion <b>92</b> is provided (compared to that depicted at <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A modified slot is formed within a linear extending and intermediate location of the tubular portion <b>92</b> and is depicted by a first narrower slot defined by a first side wall profile <b>94</b> which communicates with a widened/enlarged aperture defined by three sided and inwardly facing end profile <b>96</b>.</p>
