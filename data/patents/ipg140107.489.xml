<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A convertible winter garment converts from a cap or hat configuration to a neck gaiter, face cover, or hand warmer. The garment is a four-edged fabric with two layers such that opposing side edges of the fabric provide openings for insertion of the user's hands between the layers when the garment is used as a hand warmer. A transparent window through one layer of the garment permits observation of a mobile device held between the layers. Clips mounted along the edge opposing the longest edge can be attached to edges of the bill of a baseball cap worn by the user and anchor the garment to the baseball cap. In one embodiment, a bill having view openings is attached to the garment such that it can be used to shield the user's face from either overhead or below.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Many types of winter headgear exist, as do scarves, neck gaiters, balaclavas, gloves and hand warmers. Hats and caps are used atop the wearer's head while second and third garments are required when the user wishes to cover his or her face or neck and hands. A convertible garment would reduce the number of winter head and neck covering garments a person will need and would permit conversion of the garment into alternate configurations as needs and wishes dictate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention presents a convertible garment which can be used as a cap or hat and which can be converted for use as a face covering, a neck gaiter, a hand warmer or a short cape. An embodiment is also disclosed which is particularly useful for game hunters who desire to cover as much of their skin as possible so that the game being hunted will not detect their presence.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The first embodiment of the invention provides a head covering which is designed to overlie a baseball cap or sun visor with a brim. The invention includes a flexible fabric body which may include dual layers and which when unfolded becomes a four-edged flexible body with opposing longer first and second edges and shorter side edges. The fabric body includes left and right portions which mirror each other and when unfolded and laid flat, the body resembles a butterfly's wings in shape. The body is narrowed along its centerline connecting the longer edges. The opposing shorter side edges of the fabric diverge as they approach their connections with the first edge of the fabric body. Closure elements which may be hook and loop fastener sets, or snaps, buttons, or lacing, are attached to the fabric along the first edge with one half of the first edge connecting with the other half of the first edge through use of the closure elements when the garment is to be used as a cap or hood. The second edge of the fabric body is slightly concave to allow observation of the signage on the front panel of a baseball cap worn under the garment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment the fabric body may include two layers so the opposing shorter edges of the fabric body may include hand openings between the layers. In addition, when used as a hand warmer, the invention may include a flexible transparent window or an opening which provides a view of the face or display of a mobile device such as a mobile phone or other personal electronic device thereby allowing manipulation of the controls of the electronic device for sending of text messages or looking for information accessible on the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, the dual layer garment may include closable openings for the users' thumbs to pass through when the hands have been inserted between the layers of the garment so that an electronic device held exterior to the unfolded garment can be manipulated by the user's thumbs as is commonly done for text messaging or for operation of video games stored on the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another embodiment, the garment can be configured to include a bill which may be placed to extend from the user's forehead or which can be reconfigured to serve as a camouflaging shield for the user's face or as a spacer between the user's mouth and the garment when the embodiment is configured as a face covering.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a primary object of the invention to provide a versatile garment which may be converted from a cap configuration to a face shield or to a neck gaiter or to a hand warmer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another objective of the invention to provide a hunter's garment which may be converted from cap to face shield and which includes a bill which may be used to shield the user's eyes and face from sunlight or as a shield to prevent game from seeing features of the face of the hunter or as a spacer to enhance breathability when the garment is configured as a face shield.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further objective of the invention to provide a hand warmer with which a user can enjoy using a mobile device without removing his or her hands from the hand warmer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other desirable objectives of the invention will be understood from examination of the detailed description and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Fabric body <b>46</b> is preferably flexible and includes a first portion <b>20</b> and a second portion <b>22</b>, each of which is a mirror image of the other, the portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> being symmetrical about an imaginary centerline <b>44</b> passing through the fabric body <b>46</b> where it narrows, the centerline being generally coincident with a centerline seam <b>4</b> of the garment <b>2</b>. First portion <b>20</b> and second portion <b>22</b> are substantially equal in area.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Fabric body <b>46</b> may include the centerline seam <b>4</b> and side seams <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, all of which converge and meet at center <b>42</b> of first edge <b>24</b>. Centerline seam <b>4</b> and side seams <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>divide garment <b>2</b> into panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, while a circumferential seam <b>6</b> defines circumferential panel <b>29</b> which adjoins panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The segmentation of fabric body <b>46</b> into panels <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>facilitates conformance of the garment <b>2</b> to the curvature of the typical user's head <b>3</b> as well as to permit garment <b>2</b> to surround a user's neck. If the fabrics used for garment <b>2</b> are sufficiently elastomeric, seams <b>4</b>, <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, and <b>6</b> may not be necessary. Fabric body <b>46</b> is widest near side edges <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> and may be made from Polarfleece&#xae; material, flexible nylon fabric, wool and other typical clothing fabrics.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The opposing ends of second edge <b>34</b> and first edge <b>24</b> are joined by free side edges <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> at first corners <b>36</b>, <b>36</b><i>a </i>and second corners <b>38</b>, <b>38</b><i>a</i>. Free side edges <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> are generally equivalent in length and shorter than either first edge <b>24</b> or second edge <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fasteners <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> provide closures to selectively retain first segment <b>26</b> to second segment <b>28</b>. First fastener <b>30</b> may be one part of a fastener pair (such as a hook and loop fastener) which may detachably fasten to a complementary second part <b>30</b><i>a </i>(See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) attached to the reverse surface of fabric body <b>46</b>.

A second fastener <b>30</b> may not always be required to hold first segment <b>26</b> adjacent to second segment <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, first edge <b>24</b> may be observed to converge toward second edge <b>34</b> as first edge <b>24</b> approaches centerline <b>44</b>, making fabric body <b>46</b> narrowest generally about its imaginary centerline <b>44</b>. Each of first segment <b>26</b> and second segment <b>28</b> of first edge <b>24</b> curves away from center <b>42</b> to make each segment <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> slightly convex. It is important that the distance between first edge <b>24</b> and second edge <b>34</b> be least in the central region <b>52</b> which adjoins imaginary centerline <b>44</b> on either side thereof. Preferably fabric body <b>46</b> is narrowest between first edge <b>24</b> and second edge <b>34</b> along imaginary centerline <b>44</b>. On either side of central region <b>52</b> are distal regions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> of fabric body <b>46</b>, the distal regions <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> comprising most of first and second portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> respectively and which extend from central region <b>52</b> to side edges <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Second edge <b>34</b> may include a central slightly stiffened hem <b>60</b>, the hem <b>60</b> facilitating the second edge <b>34</b> to create a frame for the front display panel <b>11</b> of a baseball cap <b>7</b> worn under the garment <b>2</b> when garment <b>2</b> is configured as a cap as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>. Optional clips <b>8</b> for attachment to the bill <b>9</b> of a baseball cap <b>7</b> are retained to second edge <b>34</b> and are spaced apart around centerline <b>44</b> approximately the width of a bill of a baseball cap. Clips <b>8</b> are joined to garment <b>2</b> by extenders or loops <b>12</b> which may be constructed of elastic cord. Clips <b>8</b> are preferably of a variety which will frictionally grip a thin object such as the bill <b>9</b> of the baseball cap <b>7</b> but yet can be detached by manipulation without the use of tools. Clips <b>8</b> may be temporarily stored in pockets which may be attached to or formed in fabric body <b>46</b> near second edge <b>34</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order to configure garment <b>2</b> as a head covering or cap, first segment <b>26</b> of first edge <b>24</b> may be moved into side by side relationship or into a slight overlap with second segment <b>28</b> of first edge <b>24</b> by folding fabric body <b>46</b> about center <b>42</b> of first edge <b>24</b>, with first segment <b>26</b> becoming removably attached to second segment <b>28</b>, thereby creating closeable seam <b>14</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>, first embodiment garment <b>2</b> is shown in place on the head <b>3</b> of a user who is wearing a billed cap such as a baseball cap <b>7</b> having a bill <b>9</b>. The garment <b>2</b> overlies part of the front panel <b>11</b> of the cap <b>7</b> as well as most of the side and rear panels (not visible) of the baseball cap, allowing signage on the front panel <b>11</b> to be observable and the bill <b>9</b> to be employed in the usual way for shielding the face <b>5</b> of the user from overhead sunlight.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be seen that garment <b>2</b> is provided with a closable seam <b>14</b> which is selectively closed by hook and loop fasteners <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> or by other suitable fasteners such as snaps, hooks, a zipper, buttons or by lacing or a drawstring. Closable seam <b>14</b> extends from the center <b>42</b> of first edge <b>24</b> of the garment <b>2</b> to corners <b>38</b>, <b>38</b><i>a</i>. Closable seam <b>14</b> joins first portion <b>20</b> of garment <b>2</b> to second portion <b>22</b> thereof when garment <b>2</b> is configured as a cap as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. An insignificant gap <b>16</b> along closable seam <b>14</b> may result from removable attachment of the first segment <b>26</b> to second segment <b>28</b>, depending on quantity and placement of fasteners <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, garment <b>2</b> is shown in a first transition step in reconfiguring garment <b>2</b> from a cap as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to a face cover seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Fasteners <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> provide closures to selectively retain first segment <b>26</b> of first edge <b>24</b> to second segment <b>28</b> thereof.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">First fasteners <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>a</i>, when interconnected may be used to narrow or close a gap <b>16</b> (See. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) between first segment <b>26</b> and second segment <b>28</b> while second fasteners <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>maintain the second corners <b>38</b>, <b>38</b><i>a </i>in an overlapping, detachably connected arrangement. Use of second fasteners <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>alone may be sufficient to reduce any gap <b>16</b> between first segment <b>26</b> of and second segment <b>28</b> to an acceptable minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Clips <b>8</b> are retained to garment <b>2</b> inboard from first corners <b>36</b>, <b>36</b><i>a </i>and spaced apart an amount approximately the width of the bill <b>9</b> of the baseball cap <b>7</b> worn by the user. Small sewn-in pockets (not shown) may be included on fabric body <b>46</b> to store clips <b>8</b> when they are not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, one sees that garment <b>2</b> has been rotated about the attachment of clips <b>8</b> to bill <b>9</b>, and placed below bill <b>9</b> such that garment <b>2</b> covers the nose, mouth and lower face of the user whose hands <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> are used to effectuate the transformation of garment <b>2</b> from a cap to a face shield as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> illustrate the garment <b>2</b> converted to a fate shield while garment <b>2</b> remains attached by clips <b>8</b> to bill <b>9</b>. The first and second portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of fabric body <b>46</b> now enclose opposing sides of the lower portion of the face <b>5</b> of the user, in condition to protect the mouth, jaw, and ears of the user from winter conditions or to obscure those facial features when certain game hunting activities prescribe camouflaging the user's skin. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it can be seen that first and second segments <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of first edge <b>24</b> are now positioned at the nape <b>15</b> and are secured together by detachable closures, for example second fasteners <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>. In the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that second free edge <b>50</b> extends along the neck of the user to the user's nape <b>15</b> while second edge <b>34</b> frames the uncovered part of the user's face and extends around the head of the user, while the garment <b>2</b> cooperates with baseball cap <b>7</b> to cover the user's head.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref> depict a second embodiment, namely garment <b>102</b>. This embodiment nonetheless shares central features with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-8</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, second embodiment garment <b>102</b> is configured as a cap. A plurality of cords or laces <b>154</b> interconnect first half <b>120</b> of fabric body <b>146</b> to second half <b>122</b> thereof. Laces <b>154</b> pass through lace openings <b>158</b> which may be arranged to oppose so that the openings <b>158</b> of first half <b>120</b> align generally with the lace openings <b>158</b> of second half <b>122</b>. First segment <b>126</b> and second segment <b>128</b> of the first edges <b>124</b> are drawn together by laces <b>154</b> when the user pulls on the free ends <b>156</b> of each lace <b>154</b> at generally the same time. A small elongate gap <b>160</b> may exist between the first segment <b>126</b> and second segment <b>128</b>. Lace openings <b>158</b> permit the laces <b>154</b> to be laced such that a lace <b>154</b> passes through aligned lace openings <b>158</b>. However, laces <b>154</b> may be installed such that a given lace <b>154</b> passes between non-aligned lace openings <b>156</b>. Lace openings <b>156</b> are formed on fabric body <b>146</b> along first and second segments <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> of first edge <b>124</b> from near the midpoint <b>142</b> at least a majority of the length of first and second segments <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. Corners <b>138</b>, <b>138</b><i>a </i>overlap and are held removably attached in that condition by closure elements such as hook and loop fasteners, clips, a zipper, buttons or equivalents thereto. Laces <b>154</b> maintain tension on opposing first and second segments <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> by friction between them and lace openings <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">From examination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, it can be seen that garment <b>102</b> can be relocated about the face <b>5</b> or about the neck <b>21</b> of the user. To effect the relocation, garment <b>102</b> is pulled away from the user's head <b>103</b> such that gap <b>160</b> widens and the hook and loop fasteners or other closure elements which retain corners <b>138</b>, <b>138</b><i>a </i>in overlap are disconnected, resulting in first segment <b>126</b> of first edge <b>124</b> becoming fully separated from second segment <b>128</b> thereof. Garment <b>102</b> may then be placed about the lower area of the face <b>5</b> by inverting the garment <b>102</b> such that its first edge <b>124</b> is oriented at the bottom of garment <b>102</b> and second edge <b>134</b> is oriented at the top when garment <b>102</b> is converted to a face cover as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> or configured as a neck gaiter as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Therefore, laces <b>154</b> loosen as they are drawn into lace opening <b>158</b> as gap <b>160</b> is increased (See. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and as corners <b>138</b>, <b>138</b><i>a </i>of the respective halves <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> are separated. Garment <b>102</b> can then be wrapped around the face <b>5</b> or neck <b>21</b> of the user and corners <b>136</b> may again be joined by detachable fasteners, carried on the corners <b>138</b>, <b>138</b><i>a </i>of the fabric body.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-15</figref>, a third embodiment of the invention is seen. Garment <b>302</b> comprises a fabric panel <b>346</b> trimmed with fur strips <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> attached to each of opposing free edges <b>348</b>, <b>350</b>. Fabric panel <b>346</b> includes first region <b>320</b> and second region <b>322</b>, both of which are generally concave. First edge <b>324</b> is divided into substantially equal length first and second segments <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> respectively. First and second segments <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> of first edge <b>324</b> include complementary closure devices <b>330</b> which may be snap fasteners <b>330</b> or buttons or hook and loop fasteners so that when desired, first and second segments <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> may be joined in a slightly overlapping fashion, the fabric panel <b>346</b> then being useful as a hood as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Second edge <b>334</b> of panel <b>346</b> opposes first edge <b>324</b> and frames the face <b>5</b> of the user when garment <b>302</b> is used as a hood. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, panel <b>346</b> lies on the user's shoulders with first edge <b>324</b> lying beside the neck <b>21</b> of the user. For an alternative means of selectively retaining first segment <b>326</b> of first edge <b>324</b> to second segment <b>328</b> thereof, a hollow seam passageway may be formed along first edge <b>324</b> for receiving a drawstring. The drawstring can be drawn taut to draw first segment <b>326</b> alongside second segment <b>328</b> when the garment <b>302</b> is used as a hood as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the first segment and second segments <b>326</b>, <b>328</b> being positioned at the rear of the user's head and the gap between them being reduced by pulling on the drawstring.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>, a fourth embodiment of the invention is shown which shares many features in common with the first, second and third embodiments described earlier. Garment <b>402</b> can be configured as a cap as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> and as a cape in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in addition to being configurable as a fanny cover or apron tied about the user's waist or also alternatively as a hand warmer, such as is illustrated by the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Garment <b>402</b> comprises a first portion <b>420</b> which is generally equivalent in area to second portion <b>422</b>. Both first portion <b>420</b> and second portion <b>422</b> are necessarily concave (convex if viewed from the opposing side), or at least flexible enough to become concave, in order to conform to the head of a user. When configured as a cap as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, fabric body <b>446</b> includes a first edge <b>424</b> which is divided into roughly equal first and second segments <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> which may be drawn into proximity by drawstring <b>430</b> which is threaded through a seam passageway <b>438</b> sewn into or otherwise formed along the entire length of first edge <b>424</b>. Therefore, drawstring <b>430</b> may be used to draw first segment <b>426</b> and second segment <b>428</b> together when the user pulls on string ends <b>432</b>, <b>433</b>. After pulling the drawstring <b>430</b> sufficiently snug to narrow any gap between first and second segments <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>, the user may tie ends <b>432</b>, <b>433</b> together in a shoelace knot or other knot to prevent separation of first segment <b>426</b> from second segment <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-18</figref>, fur trim <b>454</b> may be attached to fabric body <b>446</b> along second edge <b>434</b>. Because second edge <b>434</b> opposes first edge <b>424</b> on fabric body <b>446</b>, when drawstring <b>430</b> is unleashed, fabric body <b>446</b> may be spread to a generally flat configuration. It is important to note that fabric body <b>446</b> is at least four-sided with first edge <b>424</b> and second edge <b>434</b> each being longer than opposing side edges <b>448</b>, <b>450</b>. Each side edge <b>448</b>, <b>450</b> may be adorned with fur trim <b>454</b> as well, to make a cold weather cap.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is important to understand that fabric body <b>446</b> must slightly narrow as it approaches its imaginary midline <b>404</b> from opposing side edges <b>448</b>, <b>450</b>. No seam must necessarily follow imaginary midline <b>404</b>. Fabric body <b>446</b> is therefore widest at opposing side edges <b>448</b>, <b>450</b>, with first portion <b>420</b> being substantially a mirror image of second portion <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Garment <b>402</b> is shown in its unfolded configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> where garment <b>402</b> is shown in use as a short cape with first edge <b>424</b> adjacent the user's neck <b>21</b>. The drawstring <b>430</b> (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) can be used to tie garment <b>402</b> at the front of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Garment <b>402</b>, when spread as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> may be used as an apron or carried as a fanny pack with drawstring <b>430</b> tied about the user's waist and fabric body <b>446</b> suspended below the user's waist. In addition, with the addition of appropriate fastening elements, garment <b>402</b>, in the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, could be detachably fastened to a coat to provide a decorative or functional collar or as a hood attachment, with the garment <b>402</b> being easily detachably from the coat so that it could be used in another configuration as illustrated in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-26</figref> disclose a fifth embodiment of the invention. Garment <b>502</b> may configure as a double layered cap, or it may be configured with one layer of the garment <b>502</b> being convertible to a face shield (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-23</figref>) or a hunter's face cover (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring specifically again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, garment <b>502</b> comprises a first panel <b>506</b> which can be arranged to overlie a cap member <b>508</b>. First panel <b>506</b> and cap member <b>508</b> are each constructed of fabric, preferably cotton, fleece, wool or synthetic versions thereof. A bill element <b>510</b> is attached at the second edge <b>534</b> of garment <b>502</b> and bill element <b>510</b> may be manipulated from a position between first panel <b>506</b> and cap member <b>508</b> and may extend outward to shield the user's face <b>5</b> from overhead sunlight. Bill element <b>510</b> is provided with at least one, and preferably two spaced apart view openings <b>512</b> therethrough, the openings <b>512</b> being spaced apart about the same distance as the separation of a typical user's eyes. Openings <b>512</b> provide observation holes for the user. Bill element <b>510</b> is preferably of stiffer fabric than first panel <b>506</b> and cap member <b>508</b> but nonetheless must flex somewhat. Bill element <b>510</b> may alternatively be constructed of a mesh fabric which the user can see through, or with mesh inserts in the bill element <b>510</b> in place of the openings <b>512</b>. Bill element <b>510</b> may be made of stitched together layers of fabrics and stiffeners but must remain flexible enough to generally conform to the forehead of the user or to the mouth area of the user, when the garment is configured as a face cover.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">First panel <b>506</b> is preferably flexible to conform to the shape of a user's scalp when positioned overlying cap member <b>508</b>. As a result, first distal region <b>520</b> and second distal region <b>522</b> are capable of becoming concave to conform to the user's head.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">First panel <b>506</b> wraps about the user's head overlying cap member <b>508</b> and is attached thereto along lateral seams <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> such that first panel <b>506</b> can rotate around seams <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> after detachment of rear corners <b>538</b>, <b>538</b><i>a </i>from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First panel <b>506</b> includes a first edge <b>524</b> comprising first and second segments <b>526</b>, <b>528</b>. A gap <b>560</b> may remain between first segment <b>526</b> and second segment <b>528</b> when rear corners <b>538</b>, <b>538</b><i>a </i>are selectively joined by hook and loop fasteners or other selectively detachable closure elements attached to first panel <b>506</b> on opposing faces of first panel <b>506</b> at corners <b>538</b>, <b>538</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, it can be seen that first panel <b>506</b> is being manipulated from its cap configuration seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> to the face shield position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The user may employ his or her hands <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> to pull first panel <b>506</b> downward, rotating first panel about seams <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> while cap element <b>508</b> of garment <b>502</b> stays in place on the user's head. It is seen that bill element <b>510</b> is positioned between first panel <b>506</b> and the user's face <b>5</b> during this maneuver.</p>
