<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of networking. More specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to providing information corresponding to a context.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The convergence of advances in the fields of networking, wireless communications, mobile computing, and the Internet, has made it technologically feasible to provide virtually any type of information and/or services to individuals at virtually anytime and any place. It is envisioned that small, unobtrusive devices can be set up to transmit specific information regarding an object, business, or point of reference associated with that particular device. These devices serve as &#x201c;information access points&#x201d; (IAPs) for providing specific, localized information. A passerby, can access this information by pointing his or her personal communications device, such as a cell phone, personal digital assistant, or any type of mobile computing device, at the IAP device and download the transmitted information.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a painting at a museum could have an associated IAP device that continuously broadcasts information regarding that painting. A visitor to the museum who is interested in that painting could then direct his or her portable communications device at the IAP device to receive textual, audio, and/or visual information regarding that painting. Alternatively, the IAP device could provide the visitor with a URL or some type of pointer to a web site that has the desired information. Furthermore, that person may be interested in finding where other paintings by that same artist may be found in the museum. This would require that the IAP devices have known physical locations (e.g., latitude and longitude). It would be of great benefit were most, if not all, IAP devices to have known locations. An individual could then be directed to the nearest restaurant, restroom, bus stop, hospital, newsstand, ATM machine, pay phone, etc., by virtue of the IAP devices. IAPs thus serve as an informational beacon.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Physical IAP beacons have been used for attracting attention to and providing information, such as a URL about a particular location deploying it. Physical beacons however can have inherent limitations due to their physical character. For instance, physical beacons must be manually placed, and if necessary, manually repositioned. They must also be manually programmed with their associated URL, and manually reprogrammed if the URL changes. Further, physical beacons are not dynamic or responsive to changes in their environment. For example, a physical beacon associated with an item placed on sale will not shut off if the item is out of stock. The performance of physical beacons can be sensitive to environmental constraints such as temperature, humidity, shock and vibration, and power problems (such as AC power failure or a battery running down) and they can be damaged thereby. Further still, physical beacons that require visible (e.g., line of sight) source detection such as infrared, barcode, Watermark, etc., can be blocked by other physical objects. For example, a line of sight source detection physical beacon can be accidentally blocked if a large truck parks in front of a store displaying the beacon; malicious blocking is also not inconceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Virtual beacons comprise a point in three dimensional space such as a geographic location with an associated URL. Virtual beacons are typically electronically created and maintained, such as by a computing system on the Web. Virtual beacons have advantages over corresponding physical beacons. Such advantages accrue to virtual beacons because of the limitations inherent in physical beacons discussed above. The point in three-dimensional space comprising a virtual beacon is typically associated with a physical object such as a building or other structure, a point of interest, or a sign such as an advertising billboard. A device can be enabled to respond to a virtual beacon. One such device enablement is WebSign&#x2122; (by Hewlett Packard, a corporation in Palo Alto, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A virtual beacon enabled device can be pointed at the physical object, point of interest, or sign associated with the point in three-dimensional space. When so pointed, the device can detect the virtual beacon associated therewith and its associated URL. The device can then retrieve an associated Web page, as directed by the URL. This allows a user to obtain useful information relevant to the physical object, point of interest, or sign associated with the point in three-dimensional space. To be effective, a virtual beacon enabled device will respond to a virtual beacon and retrieve its associated URL when the geographic location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of the associated physical object, point of interest, or sign falls within a search window of the device. The search window can correspond to the device being within some maximum range of the virtual beacon. The virtual beacon will then transmit to the device the latitude and longitude and/or another geographic location identity to the device, as well as the associated URL.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There exist many different ways by which to establish a beacon's location. One method entails utilizing traditional surveying techniques to fix the location of an IAP device. Unfortunately, this method is quite time consuming and expensive. As such, traditional surveying techniques are typically limited to known landmarks or to locations of significance. It would be cost prohibitive to survey in each and every one of the multitudes of IAP devices. Another method entails using the Global Positioning System (GPS) to establish the locations of IAP devices. However, GPS generally requires a direct line-of-sight to several of the orbiting satellites. Consequently, GPS cannot be used to establish the locations of indoor IAP devices. Another commonly used technique involves cellular triangulation. Unfortunately, cellular triangulation has limited accuracy (e.g., 100 meters for standard cell sizes and less than 25 meters for microcells). Furthermore, cellular triangulation is susceptible to multi-pathing problems indoors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Whatever technique is utilized to establish a beacon's location, conventional beacons are static in their area of coverage. A static beacon however lacks the capability to change the information it provides in response to changing or variable factors, conditions, criteria, situations, occurrences and sequences of occurrences, and circumstances. Further, conventional static beacons lack directionality and thus do not change their information despite the fact that a user may be close to the location of the beacon, or even at the location, but not immediately accessible to the beacon. Such absence of directionality can be misleading in a situation where a user is at the beacon location, but the location remains inaccessible to the user. Static beacons also have static locations, such that the beacon is fixed in three-dimensional space. Thus, the beacons are unable to move, despite the fact that a user who left the beacon for another user may have changed position.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A device for limiting access to information corresponding to a context. The device has context logic configured to determine context and a trusted computing platform coupled to the context logic. The trusted computing has a computer readable medium and a filter coupled to the computer readable medium. The filter is configured to receive context from the context logic and retrieve context information from the computer readable medium associated with the context.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A data structure disposed in a computer readable memory providing information corresponding to a location is disclosed. In the following detailed description of the present invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or by using alternate elements or methods. In other instances well known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A flexible data structure corresponding to one embodiment of the present invention provides a dynamic ability to correlate information that is pertinent to a user with a location. The data structure can be dynamic in its area of coverage, unlike static conventional IAPs and physical beacons. Further, the capability to change the information the data structure provides in response to changing or variable factors, conditions, criteria, situations, occurrences and sequences of occurrences, and circumstances is provided. These and other advantages of embodiments of the present invention, a data structure disposed in a computer readable memory providing information corresponding to a location, are discussed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Section I</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a data structure disposed in a computer readable memory providing information corresponding to a location. The description of specific features of the data structure disposed in a computer readable memory providing information corresponding to a location commences at Section II with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Presented first, Section I, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> represent a discussion of creating a virtual link between a physical location and its web representation, which provides an exemplary system for creating a data structure disposed in a computer readable memory providing information corresponding to a location.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a web navigation system <b>40</b> that implements one embodiment of the present invention. The web navigation system <b>40</b> includes a virtual beacon creator <b>50</b>, a virtual beacon server <b>60</b>, and a virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b>. A wireless network <b>42</b> is used for communications among the above mentioned systems <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>70</b>. In addition, a wired network can be used for communication between the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> and the virtual beacon server <b>60</b>, and/or between the systems <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, and <b>70</b>. Wireless network <b>42</b> is used to exemplify one network medium upon which embodiments of the present invention may be practiced. However, the present invention is not limited to use with wireless networks. Embodiments of the present invention are well suited to use with any network connection modality. As used herein, unless otherwise stated to the contrary the term &#x201c;wireless&#x201d; is used to exemplify other connection modalities, as well.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> can also be referred to as a virtual link creator. The virtual beacon server can also be referred to as a virtual link server. In addition, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> can be referred to as a virtual link receiver or a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows a physical location <b>45</b> and a web page <b>46</b> hosted in a content web server (not shown). The web page <b>46</b> can be accessed via the wireless network <b>42</b> by the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b>. This means that the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> has Internet access capability. The web page <b>46</b> is related to the physical location <b>45</b>. This means that the physical location <b>45</b> is represented in the virtual world by the web page <b>46</b>. Alternatively, the physical location <b>45</b> has two or more web pages and the web page <b>46</b> represents two or more physical locations. Web page <b>46</b> (and other Web pages) can be cached. Beacon rules can be executed locally (e.g., on a user's device). Beacon rules can be executed locally, in one embodiment, with a secured database and run with secured algorithms (e.g., processes).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the web navigation system <b>40</b> bridges the physical real world and the virtual world together such that easy, quick, and convenient web navigation is achieved with minimized physical effort for the bridging. The web navigation system <b>40</b> achieves this by allowing the web address of the web page <b>46</b> for the physical location <b>45</b> to be virtually posted at the physical location <b>45</b> without employing any physical object (e.g., a physical beacon, a display screen, or a poster) to post the web address at the physical location <b>45</b>. This means that the web navigation system <b>40</b> provides a virtual beacon (or virtual link) (e.g., the virtual beacon <b>91</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that functions to post, display, or broadcast the web address of the web page <b>46</b> at the physical location <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;physical beacon&#x201d; refers to an electronic device or module that stores a web address and can transmit or broadcast the stored web address. The term &#x201c;virtual beacon&#x201d; or &#x201c;virtual link&#x201d;, however, does not refer to any physical object such as the physical object such as the physical beacon. Instead, this term refers to an electronic file that contains the web address. The electronic file, however, serves the similar function as the physical beacon. The virtual beacon or virtual link can also be referred to as a web-sign.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, the term &#x201c;physical location&#x201d; refers not only to a geographical location, but to a physical entity as well. As described above, a physical entity can be a bookstore, a museum, a conference room, a hotel room, or an item displayed at the bookstore or museum. The physical entity can also be a convention center, a car displayed at the convention center, or a bus terminal or stop.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the term &#x201c;physical location&#x201d; refers to both the three dimensional (and other) geographical location as well as physical entity, there is no confusion because every geographical location has a unique positional data (e.g., latitude is &#x201c;53.456789&#x201d; and longitude is &#x201c;123.456789&#x201d;). This is also true for any physical entity located at a geographical location. In this case, the physical entity assumes the positional data of the geographical location at which the physical entity is located. This allows the term &#x201c;physical location&#x201d; to refer to either the geographical location or a physical entity at a geographical location. The physical location <b>45</b> can be referred to using the street address (e.g., 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, Calif.), or the unique positional data. But if the street address is used to refer to the location <b>45</b>, map data can be stored to convert the street address into the actual positional data. In one embodiment, a relative positioning system can be used, wherein relevant objects can be positioned in relation to a local geographical reference point.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As will be described in more detail below, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> creates the virtual beacon <b>91</b> for the physical location <b>45</b>. The virtual beacon <b>91</b> is essentially a location-based electronic file (e.g., the file <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This means that the electronic file <b>92</b> contains the positional data of the physical location <b>45</b> and the web address of the web page <b>46</b>. In addition, other data (e.g., access range, direction, name of the web address, time range during which the virtual beacon is active) may also be included in the electronic file <b>92</b> that forms the virtual beacon <b>91</b>. The location-based electronic file <b>92</b> is then sent by the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> via either the wireless network <b>42</b> or the wired network <b>43</b>. Each of the networks <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> employs an open standard communication protocol (e.g., the Hyper Text Transport Protocol (http)) for communication. Thus, each of the networks <b>42</b>-<b>43</b> is an Internet network. In one embodiment, information can be passed via a private network, which can use a private protocol, in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The virtual beacon server <b>60</b> then sends the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> to any external receiver system (e.g., the receiver system <b>70</b>) via the wireless network <b>42</b> when the external receiver system is at a particular location and sends a request for all virtual beacon files that have positional data indicating locations that are near the location at which the receiver system is currently located. For example, when the receiver system <b>70</b> is near the physical location <b>45</b> and requests to receive all virtual beacon files that contain positional data indicating locations that are near the location at which the receiver system <b>70</b> is located, the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> will send the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> to the receiver system <b>70</b>. The receiver system <b>70</b> then uses the web address contained in the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> to access the web page <b>46</b>, thus allowing the web address of the web page <b>46</b> to be virtually posted at the physical location <b>45</b> without employing any physical object to host the web address at the physical location <b>45</b>. This makes the virtual beacon <b>91</b> a virtual link or virtual beacon that is not physically located at the physical location <b>45</b>. The web navigation system <b>40</b> will be described in more detail below, also in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> creates the virtual beacon <b>91</b> by creating the electronic file <b>92</b> (both shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for the physical location <b>45</b>. As described above, the virtual beacon <b>91</b> is not a physical object, but rather a location-based electronic file (e.g., the electronic file <b>92</b>) that contains data. The data contained in the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> include a positional data of the physical location <b>45</b> (e.g., latitude=&#x201c;37.345&#x201d; and longitude=&#x201c;&#x2212;122.56&#x201d;). An altitude can be added as well (e.g., altitude=&#x201c;123&#x201d;). In addition, the data contained in the electronic file <b>92</b> also include an access range data (e.g., range=2000 feet), a tag or label data (e.g., &#x3c;label&#x3e;=the hospital). Moreover, other data may also be included. For example, the data in the electronic file <b>92</b> may include a directional data specifying the direction or orientation of the beacon projection of the virtual beacon <b>91</b>, as well as time range data indicating the times during which the virtual beacon <b>91</b> is active. The beacon projection means the direction at which the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> can be received by an external receiver system (e.g., the receiver system <b>70</b>) at or near the location of the virtual beacon <b>91</b>. These other data can be collectively referred to as control data, property data, or control information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be implemented by a computer system with communication functions with external networks. In other embodiments, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> can be implemented by software, hardware, or firmware. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the structure of the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b>, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> includes an association module <b>62</b>, a user interface <b>64</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>66</b>, a web gateway <b>68</b>, a positioning module <b>72</b>, and a computing element (e.g., processor) <b>99</b>. The user interface <b>64</b> is used to interact with the user of the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b>, and to receive user inputs <b>74</b>-<b>78</b> of data that will be used to form the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the user inputs include a range data input <b>74</b>, a position data input <b>75</b>, a tag/label data input <b>76</b>, a time data input <b>77</b>, and a web address (e.g., URL) data input <b>78</b>. In addition, the user interface <b>64</b> may also access a map data database <b>79</b>. This database <b>79</b> is used when the position data input <b>75</b> is actually an address input (e.g., &#x201c;3000 History Street, Palo Alto, Calif.&#x201d;). In this case, the user interface <b>64</b> accesses the database <b>79</b> to convert the address input into the positional data (e.g., latitude=&#x201c;12.345&#x201d; and longitude=&#x201c;89.123&#x201d;; an altitude can also be part of the positional data).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one example of the user interface <b>64</b>. The user interface <b>64</b> provides the interface (e.g., <b>64</b><i>a</i>) for address input and the interface (e.g., <b>64</b><i>b</i>) for positional data input. The interface <b>64</b><i>b </i>also includes fields for other user data inputs (e.g., range, time, label, web address).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the association module <b>62</b> receives all the user inputs <b>74</b>-<b>78</b> from the user interface <b>64</b>. The association module <b>62</b> then forms the electronic file <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that represents the virtual beacon <b>91</b>. The electronic file <b>92</b> contains (1) the positional data of the physical location <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at which the virtual beacon <b>91</b> is created or specified and (2) the control data (e.g., the web address of the web page <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) associated with the physical location <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the access range of the virtual beacon <b>91</b>, and the tag/label of the web address, etc.). The association module <b>62</b> can be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The positioning module <b>72</b> is employed to provide the positional data of the current position of the creator <b>50</b>. This allows the association module <b>62</b> to require no positional data input from the user interface <b>64</b> when creating a virtual beacon file. In this case, the user of the creator <b>50</b> only needs to indicate that the virtual beacon takes the current position of the creator <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the positioning module <b>72</b> is a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver module. Alternatively, the positioning module <b>72</b> can be implemented using other known technology. For instance, position can be determined via a range and pair of angles relative to a user's position, such as by using angular positioning devices and/or range finding devices.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, the location-based electronic file <b>92</b> is then sent by the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> via either the wireless network <b>42</b> or the wired network <b>43</b>. Each of the networks <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> can employ an open standard communication protocol such as the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) for communications, or a private protocol. Thus, each of the networks <b>42</b>-<b>43</b> is an Internet network or a private network. The virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b> received by the server <b>60</b> from the creator <b>50</b> are in a format such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML). Alternatively, other known web data formats may be employed for the virtual beacon electronic file <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The transmission from the virtual beacon creator <b>50</b> is dependent on the connection of the creator <b>50</b> with the external server <b>60</b>. If the creator <b>50</b> is connected to the wired network <b>43</b>, then the web gateway <b>68</b> is used to transmit the electronic file <b>92</b> created by the creator <b>50</b>. If the creator <b>50</b> is connected to the wireless network <b>42</b>, then the electronic file <b>92</b> is transmitted by the wireless transceiver <b>66</b>. If the creator <b>50</b> is connected to both networks <b>42</b>-<b>43</b>, then the electronic file <b>92</b> can be sent by either network. The wireless transceiver <b>66</b> can be implemented using known technology and the web gateway <b>68</b> can be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> receives the location-based electronic file <b>92</b> representing the virtual beacon <b>91</b> (both shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for the physical location <b>45</b>, the server <b>60</b> stores the electronic file <b>92</b>. When requested, the server <b>60</b> sends the electronic file <b>92</b> to the requesting receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b>). The server <b>60</b> sends the virtual beacon files it has stored either in the web format (e.g., XML format) or in the email format. Thus, the server <b>60</b> is basically a combination of a web server and an email server. The server <b>60</b> has a web address so that remote systems having web browsing capability can access the server <b>60</b>. In addition, the server <b>60</b> also has an email address. The structure of the server <b>60</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the server <b>60</b> includes a gateway <b>101</b>, an email or other server <b>102</b>, a web server <b>103</b>, a file server <b>147</b>, a virtual beacon store <b>104</b>, and a filtering module <b>105</b>. Alternatively, the server <b>60</b> can function without some of the above mentioned modules. For example, the server <b>60</b> may not have the filtering module <b>105</b> or the email module <b>102</b>. The gateway <b>101</b> is used to interface the server <b>60</b> with the networks <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thus, the gateway <b>101</b> is also an Internet-enabled gateway. Gateway <b>101</b> can also be a proprietary protocol gateway.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The email or other server <b>102</b> is used to send virtual beacon electronic files (e.g., the file <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to remote receivers (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The email or other server <b>102</b> has an email or other address and can send the virtual beacon files in e-mail or another format. The email or other server <b>102</b> can be implemented using known technology. The email or other server <b>102</b> is typically using to delivery the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b> to a remote receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) instantly (e.g., without waiting for the receiver to request such virtual beacons). The server <b>102</b> can also send the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b> to a remote receiver when the receiver requests such files. Any file transfer method known in the art can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The web server <b>103</b> is used to delivery the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b> to a remote receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) when the receiver requests such files (e.g., on-demand delivery). The web server <b>103</b> also includes a web address so that external systems can access the web server <b>103</b> for the virtual beacon files stored in the store <b>104</b>. The web server <b>103</b> can be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During operation, the gateway <b>101</b> receives external location-based virtual beacon files (e.g., the electronic file <b>92</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) from external virtual beacon creators (e.g., the creator <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The gateway <b>101</b> then sends the file to the virtual beacon store <b>104</b> where the file is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the gateway <b>101</b> receives a request from an external receiver (e.g., receiver <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for virtual beacon files with positional data indicating positions that are in the vicinity of the position of the requesting receiver, the gateway <b>101</b> will cause the email server <b>102</b>, the web server <b>103</b>, or the file server <b>104</b> to reply. Which one of the servers <b>102</b>-<b>103</b> should be engaged to reply depends on the request. If the request is an email request, then the email server <b>102</b> is engaged. If the request is a web request, the web server <b>103</b> is used. If the request is a file request, the file server <b>104</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the email server <b>102</b> is also used to perform the instant delivery service of the virtual beacon files. In this case, the email server <b>102</b> needs to know the recipient's email address (e.g., subscription). In this case, as soon as the gateway <b>101</b> receives a new file for a new virtual beacon, the email server <b>102</b> checks to see if it needs to send the newly created virtual beacon to one or more of its existing subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The filtering module <b>105</b> is used to filter out the virtual beacon files that are not supposed to be sent out. The filtering module <b>105</b> does this by using the access range of the requesting receiver and the projection range (or access range) of a virtual beacon to determine if the virtual beacon file needs to be transferred. For example, if a virtual beacon file specifies an access range (e.g., a projection range) of 300 yards while the request from the requesting receiver (e.g., the receiver <b>70</b>; client device <b>820</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) specifies a range of twenty miles as an area of interest, and if the virtual beacon specifies a location that is within twenty miles and 300 yards from the current position or location of the requesting receiver, then the virtual beacon file will be transferred to the requesting receiver without being filtering out by the filtering module <b>105</b>. The filtering module <b>105</b> may also implement different filtering schemes. Alternatively, the server <b>60</b> does not include this module. Filtering module <b>105</b> may also be deployed upon the client (e.g., user) device.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is employed to receive the virtual beacons (e.g., the virtual beacon <b>91</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) from the server <b>60</b>. The receiver <b>70</b> is a portable or mobile electronic device with wireless (and/or wired) Internet access functionality. In one embodiment, the receiver <b>70</b> is a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or a personal organize. In another embodiment, the receiver <b>70</b> is a palm-top computer or a mobile computer. Alternatively, the receiver <b>70</b> can be any kind of information appliance, or any kind of small portable handheld electronic device or appliance which has limited processing, storage, and display resources (e.g., a watch, a cellular phone, or a pager). The computational element <b>99</b> in the user device <b>70</b> can be a separate computing element or an element embedded within a computation array such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The operation of the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is as follows. When the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> (e.g., client device <b>820</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) is at a particular physical location (e.g., a bank, a convention center, a bus stop, or simply at a corner of a street in a town, a landmark, historical location, or point of interest, etc., or any other geographical location) and the user thereof acts to have all the virtual beacons located in the area of interest of the receiver <b>70</b>, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> accesses the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> via the wireless network <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, when the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> is at or near the physical location <b>45</b> and wants to know all the virtual beacons in the area of interest of receiver <b>70</b>, for example, around the current location at which the receiver <b>70</b> is located or someplace of interest to the user of receiver <b>70</b>, the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> sends a request to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> and receives all the virtual beacon files that contain the positional data indicating positions that are within the area of interest specified by the receiver <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The area of interest specified by client receiver device <b>70</b> can, but does not have to be, a range surrounding the current location of the receiver device <b>70</b>. In this way, a user of receiver <b>70</b> can take a &#x201c;virtual tour&#x201d; of an area of interest around a particular geographical location, via the virtual beacon files available from virtual beacon server <b>60</b> corresponding to that area of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The area of interest is specified by the receiver <b>70</b> in its request to the virtual beacon server <b>60</b>. For example, the receiver <b>70</b> can specify an area of interest of fifteen miles, twenty miles, or thirty miles, etc. Where the area of interest is set to fifteen miles, any virtual beacon with an access range located within the fifteen mile area of interest of the receiver <b>70</b> will be sent from the sender <b>60</b> to the receiver <b>70</b>. Importantly, in one embodiment, this allows a user the ability to pre-cache virtual beacon files locally on board receiver <b>70</b> (e.g., client device <b>820</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) where the access range of the virtual beacons intersects the area of interest specified for the receiver <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, server <b>60</b> can be aware of the location of receiver <b>70</b>. However, in another embodiment, server <b>60</b> remains aware of the location of receiver <b>70</b>. Advantageously, the privacy of a user is promoted in one embodiment, because the virtual beacons transferred to the client receiver <b>70</b> do not imply a location of the user; rather only an interest in an area. The area of interest and access range will be described in more detail below, in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The receiver <b>70</b> then displays all the virtual beacons received from the server <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows one example of the displayed virtual beacons of the receiver <b>70</b>. The virtual beacon files sent from the server <b>60</b> to the receiver <b>70</b> are in the XML data format in one embodiment. In another embodiment, virtual beacons can comprise another data format. The receiver <b>70</b> can also have a local filtering element (e.g., filter <b>825</b>R; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) to selectively display virtual beacons.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, the wireless network <b>42</b> is a wireless Internet network that allows the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> to communicate with the virtual beacon server <b>60</b> using an open standard communication protocol (e.g., HTTP or an email protocol, etc.) or a private protocol. Thus in one embodiment, the communication between the server <b>60</b> and the receiver <b>70</b> can follow typical Internet, file, or email communication. Thus, server <b>60</b> has a web address, file transfer protocol (FTP) address, or email address and the receiver <b>70</b> includes a web browsing capability, file transfer capability, and/or email capability. The receiver <b>70</b> accesses the server <b>60</b> using a web browser and the web address of the server <b>60</b>. If email is used for the communication, the receiver <b>70</b> accesses the server <b>60</b> using its email software and the email address of the server <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The receiver <b>70</b> accesses the server <b>60</b> with a request (not shown). In the request, the receiver <b>70</b> specifies an area of interest. The area of interest can be for instance the current position of receiver <b>70</b> or a location the user of receiver <b>70</b> desires to explore by virtual tour. In the present embodiment, positional data of the area of interest (e.g., current position, etc.) of the receiver <b>70</b> is included in the request. Positional location can also be transferred as a relative location or position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the receiver <b>70</b> also specifies, in the request, the virtual access range of the virtual beacons to be received. This effectively limits the range or distance that the receiver <b>70</b> can receive a location-based virtual beacon file. For instance, if a virtual beacon file specifies an access range that is beyond the specified area of interest of receiver <b>70</b>, such as from the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>, the receiver <b>70</b> will not receive that virtual beacon file from the server <b>60</b>. If however the virtual beacon file specifies an access range that is within the specified area of interest of the receiver <b>70</b>, such as from the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>, the receiver <b>70</b> will receive that virtual beacon file from the server <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, this characterizes one default operating mode.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Alternatively, the request does not specify the virtual access range of the virtual beacons to be received. In this case, the access range data is stored in the receiver <b>70</b> and the filtering process takes place within the receiver <b>70</b> before the receiver <b>70</b> displays the received virtual beacon files.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The concept of access range is introduced to limit the display (e.g., visualization) of data. Access range may also tend to economize on traffic between the server <b>60</b> and the receiver <b>70</b> along the network <b>42</b>. As is known, physical beacons have physical constraints, which can effectively limit access range. While a system where users are not limited by the physical constraints is desirable, some constraints can still be useful. For example, without any restraint, a system could cause users to see a very large number of virtual beacons, which could have unwanted effects such as cognitive confusion and beacon display overload.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the web navigation system <b>40</b>, a virtual beacon is a virtual entity; thus a virtual access range constraint is desirable. Users can experience the virtual beacons only within their respective digital horizons. As used herein, a digital horizon is a set of all the virtual beacons that are &#x201c;activated&#x201d; as a result of the user being in their range. While range is the property of an individual virtual beacon, the digital horizon is the temporal and spatial property of an individual user.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the structure of the virtual beacon receiver <b>70</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows that receiver <b>70</b> includes a positioning module <b>111</b>, an orientation module <b>112</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>113</b>, a web browser <b>114</b>, an email (and/or e.g., a file transfer) module <b>115</b>, a kernel <b>116</b>, and a virtual beacon projector <b>110</b>. These modules are connected together via an internal bus <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The positioning module <b>111</b> provides the positional data of the current position of the receiver <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, the positioning module <b>111</b> is a GPS receiver module. Alternatively, the positioning module <b>111</b> can be implemented using other known technology. Positioning can also comprise relative positioning and reference a local coordinate system.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The orientation module <b>112</b> determines the orientation of the receiver <b>70</b>. This means that the orientation module <b>112</b> determines the direction or orientation the receiver <b>70</b> is currently facing. In one embodiment, the orientation module comprises a magnetic compass and/or an inclinometer. Inertial reference systems, accelerometers, and/or gyrocompasses can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The wireless transceiver <b>113</b> is used to send requests for virtual beacons to the remote server <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and to receive virtual beacon electronic files from the server <b>60</b> via the network <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The transceiver <b>113</b> can be implemented using any known communication technology and is network-specific. Thus the transceiver <b>113</b> will not be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The web browser <b>114</b> is used to generate the request and to use the request to access the remote server <b>60</b>. In other words, the web browser <b>114</b> is used to control communication between the server <b>60</b> and the receiver <b>70</b>. The web browser <b>114</b> can also be implemented using known technology. Like the web browser <b>114</b>, the email module <b>115</b> is used to generate the request in email format and to use the request to access the remote server <b>60</b>. The email module <b>115</b> can also be implemented using known technology.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The kernel <b>116</b> is used to communicate and control power management and other features of the hardware of the receiver <b>70</b>. It also acts as an interface, abstracting the hardware from the other components. This is important as different hardware configuration could be used for different application. The other important functionality of the kernel <b>116</b> includes keeping the onboard cache refreshed. On the users demand, the kernel <b>116</b> queries the positioning module <b>111</b> for the current location, ambiguates it by truncating the trailing digits, and uses the data to queries the server <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The response is stored in the internal database <b>133</b>, associated with the virtual beacon projector <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The main function of the projector <b>110</b> is to display the received virtual beacon files. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows one example of the display. Each virtual beacon is displayed with the location information with respect to the current location of the receiver <b>70</b>. The structure of the projector <b>110</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the virtual beacon projector <b>110</b> includes a vectoring filter <b>131</b>, a digital horizon module <b>132</b>, a database <b>133</b>, and a user interface <b>134</b>. The user interface <b>134</b> is employed to allow the user of the receiver to communicate with the projector <b>110</b>. For example, when the projector <b>110</b> displays a number of virtual beacons such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the user wants to access the web page of one of them, the user can do so by clicking on one of the listed hyperlinks. The user interface <b>134</b> also includes a display (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The user interface <b>134</b> can be implemented using known technology and will not be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The digital horizon module <b>132</b> is used to restrict the virtual access range of the receiver <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6A</figref>). This limits the range or distance that the receiver <b>70</b> can receive a location-based virtual beacon file. As described above, the user should only be able to experience the virtual beacons in his digital horizon. We define a digital horizon as a set of all the virtual beacons that are &#x201c;activated&#x201d; as a result of the user being in their range. While range is the property of an individual virtual beacon, the digital horizon is the temporal and spatial property of an individual user. Thus, the range data is stored in the buffer <b>133</b> and the filtering process takes place within the receiver <b>70</b> before the receiver <b>70</b> displays the received virtual beacon files. Alternatively, the digital horizon module <b>132</b> is not included in the projector <b>110</b> and the filtering process takes place in the server <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The vectoring filter <b>131</b> is used to filter the virtual beacons that are in the direction pointed by the receiver <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b>A) and display them on the user interface <b>134</b>. The kernel <b>116</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in response to changes in the magnetometer readings of the orientation module <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, invokes the vectoring filter <b>131</b>.</p>

However, the contextual information <b>830</b>V received by filter <b>825</b>V effectively comprises a version of contextual information <b>830</b>R, which is sanitized (e.g., edited) to promote (e.g., safeguard, protect, etc.) the privacy of the user. In response to the information <b>855</b> and the context <b>830</b>V, server <b>103</b> provides a set of virtual beacons <b>850</b> to real world <b>800</b>R.</p>

Such characteristics can include, but are not limited to, time sensitivity, directionality, dynamic flexibility, a defined area of coverage, a dynamic area of coverage (where the virtual beacon has such dynamic flexibility), mobility (e.g., the ability for the virtual beacon to move), sequentiality, and the ability to dynamically vary accessibility based on external criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The dynamically flexible accessibility of a virtual beacon deployed within network <b>800</b> can be based on external criteria that include, but are not limited to, user criteria, user profile information, user interests, user capabilities, user security, and user ownership of particular content, credentials, and/or cookies. Any of these criteria may be combined in any manner so as to include complex sequential and non-sequential relationships. Thus, the dynamically flexible accessibility can be made sensitive to, or in one embodiment partially or wholly dependent upon the information loaded into a particular client device <b>820</b>, including information set <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Virtual beacon <b>850</b> correlates a point in three-dimensional space with an associated URL. Time sensitivity confers upon virtual beacon <b>850</b> the capability of comprising an intelligent, dynamic virtual beacon in four-dimensional space linked to a corresponding URL. With virtual beacon <b>850</b> configured with time sensitivity, client device <b>820</b> will only detect the beacon during a specific set time interval. For instance, a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with a particular store is only detectable by a user's device <b>820</b> during the time interval during which the store is open.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Conferred with the characteristic of directionality, virtual beacon <b>850</b> is detectable by client device <b>820</b> only when the device has or is deployed in a particular angular or directional aspect with respect to the point in three dimensional space corresponding to the virtual beacon. Continuing with the previous example, a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with a particular store is only detectable (e.g., receivable) by a user's device <b>820</b> only when the user is at an accessible part of the store, such as the storefront or another authorized access thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Dynamic flexibility is conferred upon virtual beacon <b>850</b> by UI programmer <b>801</b>. Thus, if time sensitivity, directionality, or other characteristics must be changed, virtual beacon <b>850</b> may simply be reset with the new time, directionality, or other characteristics. Continuing with the previous example of a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with a particular store, the store's operating hours may change, such as a seasonal adjustment wherein the store is open later in summer to take advantage of longer daylight hours. In this event, the time interval that the virtual beacon <b>850</b> is detectable by a device <b>820</b> is simply reset by UI programmer <b>801</b> to reflect the new store hours. The store may make open unused door or construct another on the side of the store. In this event, the direction from which the virtual beacon <b>850</b> is detectable by a device <b>820</b> is simply reset by UI programmer <b>801</b> to extend to the side housing the new entrance, as well as the storefront.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Area of coverage programming by UI programmer <b>801</b> renders virtual beacon <b>850</b> detectable by a device <b>820</b> only when the area of interest specified by device <b>820</b> resides within a defined three-dimensional space. In one embodiment, the access range of the virtual beacon can be set. For example, a certain virtual beacon <b>850</b> may be associated with a hotel. However, its area of coverage programming renders the virtual beacon <b>850</b> detectable only by devices <b>820</b> that are present within a certain large conference hall, such as to guide a conference participant to various exhibits, speaker stations, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Further, area of coverage programming can be set in one embodiment to correspond with user actions, such as physical actions taken with respect to client device <b>820</b>. In one embodiment, this programming can be done locally upon device <b>820</b>. Virtual beacons downloaded to device <b>820</b> can be displayed in response to the user actions. Importantly, in one embodiment, this allows a user the ability to pre-cache virtual beacon files locally on board client device <b>820</b>, such as where the access range of the virtual beacons intersects the area of interest specified by the client device <b>820</b>. Advantageously, the privacy of a user is promoted in one embodiment, because the virtual beacons transferred to the client device <b>820</b> do not imply a location of the user; rather only an interest in an area.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Device <b>820</b> can be programmed to display downloaded virtual beacons in response to its inclination and/or declination with respect to the ground plane upon which the user is standing, which can be detected and converted to corresponding data by tilt detector <b>824</b>. Thus, if a user points the device <b>820</b> down (e.g., towards the ground), virtual beacon <b>850</b> that has been downloaded thereto is displayed to provide a URL with information about ground transportation, utilities such as rest rooms or other conveniences, or any other information coded to correspond to pointing device <b>820</b> downwards. Likewise, if a user points device <b>820</b> upwards (e.g., away from the ground), virtual beacon <b>850</b> that has been downloaded thereto is displayed to provide a URL with information about air transportation, rooftop restaurants, rooftop bars, or other rooftop service establishments, or any other information coded to correspond to pointing device <b>820</b> upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another embodiment, server <b>60</b> can be aware of the location of device <b>820</b>. The information can similarly be provided by server <b>803</b> responsive to the user action. For instance, server <b>803</b> can be programmed to be responsive to the inclination and/or declination of device <b>820</b> with respect to the ground plane upon which the user is standing, which can be detected and converted to corresponding data by tilt detector <b>824</b>. Thus, if a user points the device down (e.g., towards the ground), server <b>803</b> can responsively send a virtual beacon <b>850</b> that provides a URL with information about ground transportation, utilities such as rest rooms or other conveniences, or any other information coded to correspond to pointing device <b>820</b> downwards. Likewise, if a user points device <b>820</b> upwards (e.g., away from the ground), server <b>803</b> can responsively send a virtual beacon <b>850</b> that provides a URL with information about air transportation, rooftop restaurants, rooftop bars, or other rooftop service establishments, or any other information coded to correspond to pointing device <b>820</b> upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Conferred with the characteristic of mobility (e.g., motion), virtual beacon <b>850</b> can move within three-dimensional space. This feature can be useful for an application such as guiding users around and through the particular three-dimensional space through which virtual beacon <b>850</b> is moving by varying the region that client device <b>820</b> detects it. Thus, a user may be guided through a museum. Further, as users move following the moving beacon <b>850</b>, they can be provided with information specific to each region of the three-dimensional space to which they are guided by linking with their device <b>820</b> to a particular URL corresponding to each region.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Continuing with the previous example of a moving virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with a museum, each URL can describe what is displayed within the corresponding region, such as artifacts, works of art, or the like. Textual beacons can be displayed as well as a graphical views, including graphics of any format (e.g., JPG and MPEG files) and audio files. Upon visiting a certain landmark or point of interest, a user can be guided by a moving virtual beacon <b>850</b> to, for example, the next landmark to visit within a historical area. Upon taking in a particular scene or view at one observation point in a scenic or historically or otherwise significant area, a user can be guided using a device <b>820</b> to the next observation point, or to the direction of the next view from the one they are at. Further, a virtual beacon <b>850</b> conferred with motion can effectuate a virtual game based on a user finding the virtual beacon using their device <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Where a virtual beacon <b>850</b> is conferred with dynamic flexibility, it can further be conferred with a dynamic area of coverage, based upon another parameter such as time and/or criteria corresponding to information set <b>830</b> such as identity, interests, etc. Where the area of coverage of virtual beacon <b>850</b> changes based upon time, a device sensitive to the beacon can guide its users to the place they are to be at a certain time. An event can comprise more than one stage, each stage held or occurring in a different location. Users attending the event can be guided to the right place at the right time using their beacon-sensitive devices <b>820</b>, by means of the virtual beacon <b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">A wedding exemplifies such an event. The wedding's ceremony may be held in a certain church, to which ceremony invitees are guided by virtual beacon <b>850</b>. Upon completion of the ceremony, the wedding party moves from the church to a certain reception hall, to which reception invitees are guided by the same virtual beacon <b>850</b>, conferred with a dynamic area of coverage. If an invitee to both the ceremony and the reception shows up at the church late, e.g., after the wedding party has departed the church to the reception hall, the virtual beacon <b>850</b>, conferred with a dynamic area of coverage, can link the user to two associated URLs, one which provides a link to a map to the reception hall, and another for example, providing information about the church, perhaps historically interesting information; perhaps religious information, times of services, and the like. Even this latter information can be rendered with temporal significance in one embodiment. For instance, if it is temporally close to the winter holiday season, graphical information such as a JPEG file of the church can be sent depicting the church set in a snowy background, perhaps garlanded &#x26; wreathed. If temporally it is spring, summer, or autumn however, the church can be shown with seasonally or other temporally significant graphics.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In one embodiment, a virtual beacon <b>850</b> can be downloaded at any time. However, based on context (and other facets gleaned from information set <b>830</b>), the virtual beacon may only be accessed (e.g., receivable and displayable by) by device <b>820</b> at a certain time prescribed by the context. In one embodiment, this access restriction is effectuated by intelligent agent <b>825</b>, based on context information (e.g., context <b>830</b>R; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>) used by the intelligent agent.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Besides temporally dynamic, the area of coverage of a virtual beacon <b>850</b> can be dynamic based on other criteria. Continuing with the instant wedding example, certain users may be invited to the reception, but perhaps not to the ceremony. Virtual beacon <b>850</b> can be programmed for dynamic area of coverage based upon the identities of the wedding invitees. Arriving at the church during the ceremony, the virtual beacon <b>850</b>, conferred with a dynamic area of coverage, can link the user who is invited only to the reception to the two associated URLs discussed above, for example. One provides a link to a map and directions to the reception hall and the time that the reception is to begin. The other for example provides the information about the church. One user may be a member of the wedding party, such as the &#x201c;best man.&#x201d; The link received by that user can direct him to a particular door behind the church to dress in the ceremonial attire and attend the rehearsal. Based on context, this link would only be provided to the best man, and would not be provided to anyone else.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Conferred with the characteristic of sequentiality, a certain virtual beacon <b>850</b> can be detected only after another (e.g., one or more) defined beacon has been acquired, or other sequential criteria are met. An example of a sequentially dynamic virtual beacon is an event such as a fair at which a virtual beacon is used inside the fairgrounds, such as to identify a particular exhibit, show, or attraction. However, the virtual beacons identifying the exhibit, show, or attraction therein are not detectable by a user device <b>820</b> until that device has first acquired a virtual beacon <b>850</b> corresponding to admission. Thus, a user must be admitted to the fair before acquiring the virtual beacons therein. Sequentiality allows a user to detect event occurrences in a logical fashion, wherein the event is dependent upon the occurrence of other events. In this case, a user's device <b>820</b> can only detect a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with one event or situation after a particular other event, set of events, sequence of events, or any combination thereof, as programmed by UI programmer <b>801</b>, has occurred, such as a certain virtual beacon is detectable by a client device only after the client device has received a particular email from the associated location.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, a user may only detect a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with an approaching service plaza within a toll road and within the client device search window, upon passing a certain tollbooth. Another user may only detect a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with a certain courtesy kiosk after visiting a certain number of stores in a shopping mall. Another example is that of a virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with a ski resort: its associated virtual beacon <b>850</b> is only detectable when the resort is open and the road by which it is accessed is clear.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A virtual beacon <b>850</b> can also be conferred with a characteristic corresponding to the physical accessibility to the point in three-dimensional space corresponding to the beacon, to a particular user. For instance, a certain virtual beacon may be associated with a filling station wherein the station is proximate to but not accessible from a toll road. Thus, the device <b>820</b> of user driving on the toll road would not be able to see (e.g., display) the virtual beacon associated with the inaccessible filling station, although the user may be passing quite close to the station. As the access range of the virtual beacon is within the area of interest specified by the client device, the virtual beacon is received, in one embodiment, however, it is filtered, so as not to be displayed. Although the access range of the virtual beacon intersects with the area of interest specified by the device <b>820</b>, the virtual beacon is not displayed. Advantageously, the virtual beacon thus does not confuse the user, who cannot presently access the location associated with it.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Likewise, another filling station may be located within a service plaza on the toll road and have its own associated virtual beacon. The virtual beacon associated with the filling station in the toll road service plaza would be detectable by a user's device <b>820</b> where the user is approaching the vicinity of the service plaza. However, that virtual beacon would not be detectable by a user who is not on the toll road, despite the fact that they may be quite close by, such as driving on a frontage road adjacent to the toll road, but inaccessible to it.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">A virtual beacon <b>850</b> can be conferred with the ability to be detected based upon user criteria. For instance, the virtual beacon can be programmed to be detectable based on a particular user criterion, or upon any combination of user criteria, user profile information, and/or characteristics, such as within user profile <b>840</b> or information set <b>830</b>. As discussed above, such criteria can comprise physical information about the user such as age, height, weight, gender, etc., interests <b>837</b>, previously acquired information or credentials, cookies, education level, passed on permissions, and similar information. Characteristics of client device <b>820</b> such as the device's authentication, display, and selected I/O and other capabilities can also comprise such user criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Any of the characteristics discussed above: time, directionality, area of coverage, motion, dynamic area of coverage, sequentiality, physical accessibility, and user criteria, can be combined in any manner including simple and complex sequential and non-sequential relationships to confer corresponding attributes to a virtual beacon <b>850</b>. For instance, continuing with the toll road and filling station examples above, a physical accessibility attribute of a virtual beacon <b>850</b> may comprise a user having engaged in a sequence of first paying a toll and then driving within the area of coverage of the toll road service plaza filling station before the virtual beacon <b>850</b> associated with the toll road service plaza filling station becomes detectable by the user's device <b>820</b>. Further, the virtual beacon <b>850</b> may only be detectable during hours the filling station is open. Through programming with these characteristics and their various combinations, virtual beacons can acquire a significant degree of intelligence of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">An intelligent agent <b>825</b> can be associated with a collection of virtual beacons <b>850</b> and can be deployed on either the virtual beacon server <b>803</b> side or the client <b>820</b> side of Internet <b>810</b>. The intelligent agent <b>825</b> can detect that a certain client device <b>820</b> is accessing virtual beacons <b>850</b> associated with groups of locations (e.g., points in three-dimensional space), attempt to ascertain a correlation between the members of this group of locations, and responsively enable other virtual beacons <b>850</b> that it infers may be of interest to the user of client device <b>820</b>, and that fall within the client's search window, as described above in Section I. Further, users of a client device <b>820</b> can utilize intelligent agent <b>825</b> to have a group of associated locations correlated by the users, themselves activate their associated virtual beacons <b>850</b> in response to a request transmitted by their device <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Where intelligent agent <b>825</b> must sort through non-indexed and other data, time is saved and computational resources are used efficiently in one embodiment by offloading such sorts to a co-processing module, which can be implemented using a configurable logic array such as a PGA, or by other means.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">For instance, an intelligent agent <b>825</b> associated with a collection of virtual beacons <b>850</b> can detect that a user is accessing certain of the virtual beacons <b>850</b> belonging to the group, such as that a user is visiting all or some of the major wineries in a particular area. Upon detecting this, intelligent agent <b>825</b> can enable (e.g., activate) virtual beacons <b>850</b> associated with smaller and/or less known wineries in that area (e.g., that fall within the client's search window, as described above in Section I). A user can utilize the intelligent agent <b>825</b> to request activation of all virtual beacons within the client's search window that match a certain criterion or group of criteria, such as a particular purchase criterion. For example, the user requests the intelligent agent <b>825</b> to activate the virtual beacons <b>850</b> associated with all open stores within the search window that have a particular product currently available. Criteria can be added; for instance, request the intelligent agent <b>825</b> to activate the virtual beacons <b>850</b> associated with all open stores within the search window that have a particular product currently available, on sale, or below a certain price.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The dynamic and intelligent character of virtual beacons <b>850</b> allow the provision of timely and useful information, without superfluousness, to users of enabled devices <b>820</b>. Correlations of events are thus enabled by network <b>800</b>. For instance, upon a change in weather, such as an unexpected rainstorm, virtual beacons <b>850</b> associated with local shops affected by the weather are enabled to advertise the sale of items useful in that weather milieu, such as umbrellas.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In one embodiment, a virtual beacon expires, e.g., is deactivated upon the occurrence of some associated, pre-programmed condition, such as upon a client device visiting and departing from the actual geographical location to which the virtual beacon is associated, an associated store closes, weather clears, an event is over, etc. This can advantageously save computing and network resources, as well as preventing now superfluous or temporarily erroneous information from presentation to an enabled client device and any possible associated nuisance.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">For instance, expiring, e.g., deactivating, a virtual beacon at night for a landmark or attraction that is only open during daylight hours prevents the virtual beacon from mis-attracting a user of an activated client device to the now-closed place. This feature is also useful for applying virtual beacons as a tour guide or route marker. For example, for a tourist user who only wants to visit a monument, landmark, etc. once, the virtual beacon can expire for that user's client device upon departing from the vicinity of the location.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Virtual beacons <b>850</b> can also be made available upon subscription, evinced for example by a credential or cookie placed upon the device <b>820</b> in return for paying a subscription fee. Subscription type virtual beacons <b>850</b> can provide access to pay-for-view type URLs or other services, tour guide services, such as by using a motion-enabled virtual beacon, premium type services at a location, and other services.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one embodiment, virtual beacons <b>850</b> effectuate virtual tours of a location outside of the user's current location. In such a virtual tour, a user device <b>820</b> provides context via intelligent agent <b>825</b> corresponding to a desire, interest, whim, or the like to visit another (e.g., remote) location, at some future time for instance. Responsively, virtual beacons <b>850</b> corresponding to the location and/or to the prospective time (e.g., season) of the visit are sent to device <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Conferred with any of the characteristics discussed above: time, directionality, area of coverage, motion, dynamic area of coverage, sequentiality, physical accessibility, and user criteria, and any simple or complex sequential or non-sequential combination of these characteristics, virtual beacon <b>850</b> functions to intelligently dynamically provide information corresponding to a point in three-dimensional space to a user of a device <b>820</b> sensitive to the virtual beacon.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart of a process <b>900</b> for programming a virtual beacon. Process <b>900</b> begins with a step <b>901</b>, wherein a request is received to correlate a point in three-dimensional (3-D) space with a certain URL, e.g., to create a virtual beacon for that point with the specified URL.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In step <b>902</b>, the requested properties for the virtual beacon are ascertained by an entity receiving the request. Such an entity can control a user interface programming tool (e.g., UI programmer <b>801</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) for configuring a virtual beacon.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In step <b>903</b>, it is determined whether the virtual beacon is to be dynamic. If so, then in step <b>904</b>, an intelligent and dynamic virtual beacon is configured according to the ascertained requested properties.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The requested intelligent and dynamic properties can include any of the characteristics discussed above, such as time, directionality, area of coverage, motion, dynamic area of coverage, sequentiality, physical accessibility, and user criteria. The requested intelligent and dynamic properties can also include any simple or complex sequential or non-sequential combination of these characteristics, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">If it is determined that the virtual beacon is to be a simple static (e.g., non-dynamic) virtual beacon, then in step <b>905</b>, a static virtual beacon is configured, upon which process <b>900</b> can be complete.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In step <b>906</b>, it is determined whether conditions specified by programming the virtual beacon have changed. If so, then in step <b>907</b>, the virtual beacon is modified accordingly, such as by re-programming.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">For example, for a virtual beacon associated with a point in three-dimensional space corresponding to a certain store, when the scheduled time of day at which the store closes is reached, the virtual beacon is deactivated. The next day, when the scheduled time of day at which the store opens is reached, the virtual beacon is reactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In one embodiment, a virtual beacon expires, e.g., is deactivated upon the occurrence of some associated, pre-programmed condition, such as upon a client device visiting and departing from the actual geographical location to which the virtual beacon is associated. This can advantageously save computing and network resources, as well as preventing now superfluous information from presentation to a client device. A user device (e.g., device <b>820</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) can also be pre-programmed to look for activation and reactivation of such a virtual beacon.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Upon execution of step <b>907</b>, or if it is determined in step <b>906</b> that the conditions specified by programming the virtual beacon have not changed, then process <b>900</b> loops back to repeat step <b>906</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Exemplary Applications</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C depict useful exemplary applications of virtual beacons. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> depicts an exemplary &#x201c;Shop at this Store&#x201d; store having an associated virtual beacon <b>1000</b>. Virtual beacon <b>1000</b> links the store (e.g., the point in three-dimensional space corresponding to the store's geographical location) to an exemplary corresponding URL, such as &#x201c;www.shopatthisstore.com&#x201d;. The store's geographical location comprises latitude, longitude, and elevation. Elevation can be given if relevant, or it can be implied from the latitude and longitude, such as by reference to corresponding contour maps. Where given, it can be expressed in elevation with respect to sea level or stated to correspond to a certain floor, such as for a store located in a multi-story building.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Virtual beacon <b>1000</b> comprises a set of tags <b>1050</b> to include the latitude, longitude (and elevation, if relevant), and the associated URL. The associated URL will be visible (e.g., detectable) by an enabled client device (e.g., device <b>820</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) if the latitude and longitude (e.g., Lat/Lon) fall within the client's search window, as described above in Section I, and the criteria defined by the tags are met. In the present exemplary implementation, the criteria defined by the tags are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Time: the virtual beacon is only visible during hours the store is open</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Area of coverage: the virtual beacon is only visible within one tenth kilometer of the store's Lat/Lon</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Directionality: the virtual beacon is only visible from the front of the store</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Sequentiality: entering the store enables combinations of certain criteria</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Physical Accessibility: the virtual beacon is not visible from an adjacent toll road (e.g., because the store is inaccessible therefrom)</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">User Criteria: the virtual beacon is only visible to an adult's device</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Combine these Characteristics:</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">inside store+int=photography: show new URL:/550213 (e.g., once the user is inside the store&#x2014;e.g., sequence&#x2014;AND the user's interests stored on the user's device&#x2014;e.g., interests <b>837</b> of information set <b>830</b>; FIG. <b>8</b>&#x2014;includes &#x201c;photography,&#x201d; show a new webpage associated with the store's main URL&#x2014;e.g.&#x2014;wherein the new URL states that &#x201c;cameras are on sale,&#x201d; listing brands, descriptions, accessories, prices, duration of the sale, etc.)</p>

Process <b>1200</b> begins with step <b>1201</b>, wherein context is sought that characterizes a user of the client device.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The context comprises data in one embodiment and can be stored on the client device or elsewhere. The context can include, for instance, an attribute of the user that can be selected from among identity, profile, history, a preference, a credential, capability, an interest, and a privacy selection, or another characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In step <b>1202</b>, in response to seeking the context, the context is filtered so as to deter locating the user. Advantageously, this serves to help protect the user's privacy. Upon filtering the context, it is determined from the context whether the data structure is pertinent to the user. If it is determined that the data structure is pertinent to the user, then in step <b>1204</b>, the data structure is sent to the client device.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The context can change dynamically in response to a condition relating to the temporal pertinence of the information with respect to the context.

The processing for displaying downloaded virtual beacons can be done locally (e.g., at device <b>820</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>) to help ensure privacy for users.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Limiting Access to Information Corresponding to a Context</heading>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As previously described herein, in some cases a set of virtual beacons are loaded onto a database of a device. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the local database <b>841</b> contains contextual information. The contextual information may be downloaded from the virtual beacon server <b>803</b>. The filter <b>825</b>R accesses context information <b>830</b>R from the local database <b>841</b> based on context <b>826</b> (e.g., location, time, direction).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As an example of a motivation to prevent the unauthorized release of the contextual information <b>830</b>R from the local database <b>841</b> consider the following example. A company may wish to develop an advertisement campaign based on an enigma game. The win the game, a player must solve a sequence of puzzles or questions. In this example game, the answer to each question/puzzle is a location. The user receives the next question upon reaching the location. The winner is the player who reaches the final destination first. The game can be set up by having players download all virtual beacons for the entire game to their mobile device. By downloading all of the virtual beacons at once, a player's privacy is protected in that a back-end server does not know the player's location. That is, if the next virtual beacon were only downloaded when the player was at the location that is the answer to the previous question in the enigma game, then the player's location could be tracked.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Thus, downloading all of the virtual beacons for the game helps to protect the player's privacy. If the players are honest, the enigma game can unfold fairly. However, it is possible that a player might hack into the database on their device to reveal all the virtual beacons without actually solving the questions to the enigma game. Embodiments of the present invention provide a security measure to reduce or eliminate such unauthorized access to contextual information (e.g., virtual beacons) stored in a local database. These embodiments have applications other than the exemplary game.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> describes a system <b>1300</b> for securely providing information corresponding to a context, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> comprises a backend or virtual beacon server <b>1303</b> and a mobile device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>having a trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>a</i>. The backend server <b>1303</b> can be implemented in a similar manner as virtual beacon server <b>60</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and described herein or the virtual beacon server <b>803</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and described herein. However, the backend server <b>1303</b> of the present embodiment is not limited to these implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>comprises a trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>a</i>, which in this embodiment has a secure virtual beacon database <b>1341</b><i>a </i>and a trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a</i>. The mobile device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>downloads secure virtual beacons from the backend server <b>1303</b> using a session key after authenticating with the backend server <b>1303</b>. The secure virtual beacons are stored in the secure virtual beacon database <b>1341</b><i>a </i>on the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>a </i>and are only accessible if the proper context is presented to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a </i>on the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>a</i>. That is, a context is associated with each virtual beacon. For example, the context may be a given location and time. Both the location and time may have a range in values.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The mobile device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>has context logic <b>1330</b> that is able to determine context awareness. The context awareness includes, but is not limited to, location, time, tilt, and elevation. As an example, the context awareness logic <b>1330</b> may be implemented by components depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. In particular those components may include an electronic compass <b>821</b>, a GPS device <b>822</b>, a clock <b>823</b>, and a tilt detector <b>824</b>. It will be understood that the context logic <b>1330</b> of this embodiment of the present invention is not limited to these components for collecting context awareness data. For example, an altimeter (not depicted) may be used. Moreover, the context awareness may be based on information entered via a graphical user interface, keypad, or other input device (not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The context logic <b>1330</b> is coupled to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a</i>, such that the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a </i>may access the context from the context logic <b>1330</b>. The trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a </i>determines what, if any, context information should be released from the secure virtual beacon database <b>1341</b><i>a </i>based on the context from the context logic <b>1330</b>. Thus, the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a </i>accesses the secure virtual beacon database <b>1341</b><i>a </i>and transfers a virtual beacon (e.g., context information) to the UI <b>1320</b> if the context for the virtual beacon is presented to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a</i>. For example, if the context for a given virtual beacon is the longitude and latitude of a landmark, then the associated virtual beacon will be accessed and displayed on the UI if that context is presented to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The context may be transferred from the context logic <b>1330</b> to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a </i>at any convenient interval. It may be convenient to transfer the context every 10 seconds, for example. The frequency of transferring the context to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>a </i>is not critical and may be a function of computing parameters of the mobile device <b>1305</b> and trusted platform <b>1310</b>.</p>

The mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>optionally includes a non-secure filter <b>1365</b> associated with the non-secure virtual beacon database <b>1360</b>. The mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>may have more data storage available on the mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>than is available on the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>a</i>, so providing for a second database for virtual beacons may allow for more virtual beacon storage. Further, the computing power of the mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>a </i>may be greater than the computing power of the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>a </i>so processing some of the virtual beacons externally from the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>a </i>may allow for improved performance. However, this embodiment of the present invention is very secure. The processing and display of virtual beacons stored in the non-secure virtual beacon database <b>1360</b> may be similar to embodiments discussed herein. For example the processing and display of virtual beacons stored in the non-secure virtual beacon database <b>1360</b> may be similar to the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>b </i>has a secure database <b>1561</b> external to the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b </i>that is used to store encrypted secure context information. Thus, a portion of the data stored in connection with the secure virtual beacons is stored external to the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b</i>. The mobile computing device <b>1305</b><i>b </i>also has a decryption engine <b>1526</b> external to the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>b</i>. Thus, additional computing duties are performed external to the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b</i>, as compared to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">The trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>b</i>, in this embodiment, has a secure database <b>1341</b><i>b </i>that is used to store remaining portions of the data associated with the secure virtual beacons that is not stored external to the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the mobile device <b>1305</b><i>b </i>downloads information from the backend or virtual beacon server <b>1303</b> in two stages.

This information may include, for each virtual beacon: an identifier, context information, and an encryption key. This information is stored in the clear, in this embodiment.

<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The second stage of the download from the back-end server <b>1303</b> is to the (encrypted) secure database <b>1561</b> external to the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>b</i>.

Most of this information is encrypted. However, the identifier is stored in the clear in this implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>b </i>has a trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>b </i>that receives context awareness data (e.g., time, location, etc.) from the context logic <b>1330</b>, which the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>b </i>uses to determine which, if any, information should be retrieved from the secure database <b>1341</b><i>b </i>on the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b </i>and exported to the decryption engine <b>1526</b>.

<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The decryption engine <b>1526</b> uses the virtual beacon identifier to locate the appropriate entry in the encrypted secure database <b>1561</b>. As previously discussed the virtual beacon identifier that is stored in the encrypted secure database <b>1561</b> may in fact not be encrypted so as to facilitate the database search for it. Using the encryption key, the decryption engine <b>1526</b> decrypts the context information for the appropriate entry in the encrypted secure database <b>1561</b> and transfers the decrypted information on to the user interface (UI) <b>1320</b>. For example, a virtual beacon that was encrypted in the encrypted secure database <b>1561</b> is decrypted and forwarded to the UI <b>1320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Thus, the secure virtual beacons are stored in the encrypted secure database <b>1561</b> and are only accessible if the proper context is presented to the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>b</i>. However, the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>b </i>does not, in this embodiment, directly access the virtual beacons, as a decryption engine <b>1526</b> external to the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b </i>performs that computing duty.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a diagram illustrating a system <b>1700</b> for securely providing information corresponding to a context, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>c </i>has a decryption engine <b>1726</b>, which is used to decrypt information in an encrypted secure database <b>1761</b> that is external to the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>c</i>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the decryption keys never leave the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the mobile device <b>1305</b><i>c </i>downloads information from the backend or virtual beacon server <b>1303</b> in two stages in a similar fashion to the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>c </i>has a trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>c </i>that receives context awareness data from the context logic <b>1330</b>, which the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>c </i>uses to determine which, if any, information should be retrieved from the secure database <b>1341</b><i>c </i>on the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>c</i>. In this implementation, the information that the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>c </i>retrieves from the secure virtual beacon database <b>1341</b><i>c </i>includes a virtual beacon identifier and its encryption key. This information is passed on to the decryption engine <b>1726</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>c </i>does not export information external to the trusted platform. Rather, the information output by the trusted platform filter <b>1325</b><i>c </i>stays on the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The decryption engine <b>1726</b> on the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>c </i>uses the virtual beacon identifier to locate the appropriate entry in the encrypted secure database <b>1761</b>. Using the encryption key, the decryption engine <b>1726</b> decrypts the context information for the appropriate entry in the encrypted secure database <b>1761</b> and transfers the decrypted information on to the UI <b>1320</b>. For example, a virtual beacon that was encrypted in the encrypted secure database <b>1761</b> is decrypted and forwarded to the UI <b>1320</b>. Thus, the decryption keys never leave the trusted computing platform <b>1310</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a flowchart of a process for securely providing information corresponding to a context, according to an embodiment of the present invention. Steps of process <b>1600</b> may be stored as instructions on a computer readable medium and executed on a processor. Steps of process <b>1600</b> are executed by the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>b </i>and decryption engine <b>1526</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> in one implementation. Steps of process <b>1600</b> are executed by the trusted platform <b>1310</b><i>c </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> in another implementation. However process <b>1600</b> is not so limited. In step <b>1610</b>, a first part of context information that is external to a device is accessed and stored on a trusted computing platform. For example, a mobile device establishes a connection to back-end server, authenticates itself, and establishes a session. Using an obtained session key, the following is downloaded for each virtual beacon: an identifier, context information, and an encryption key.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In step <b>1620</b>, a second part of context information that is external to a device is accessed and stored on a secure databases external to the trusted computing platform. The second part of the information may include, for each virtual beacon: an identifier, a label, a URL, and other information that is pertinent to virtual beacon. Typically, the identifier is not stored in encrypted form. The rest of the second part of information is both downloaded and stored encrypted.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In step <b>1630</b>, context is accessed. For example, a filter on the trusted platform accesses the context from context logic. The context may include time, location, elevation, tilt, etc. The context logic may include various components such as an electronic compass, a GPS device, a clock, a tilt detector, and an altimeter may be used to collect context. The context may also be received from a user input device.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In step <b>1640</b>, a portion of the information stored on the trusted secure database is accessed based on the context that was accessed in step <b>1630</b>. The accessing may be performed by a filter, such as filter <b>1325</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> or filter <b>1325</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The information accessed from the secure virtual beacon database may include a virtual beacon identifier and its encryption key.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In step <b>1650</b>, the portions of the information that were accessed from the trusted secure database in step <b>1640</b> are output from the trusted platform to a decryption engine. In one implementation, the decryption engine is on the trusted platform. In another implementation, the decryption engine is external to the trusted platform. Thus, in the latter implementation, the encryption/decryption keys do not leave the trusted platform.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In step <b>1660</b>, the decryption engine uses the virtual beacon identifier to determine which entry in the secure databases external to the trusted computing platform described in step <b>1620</b> is relevant. The decryption engine uses the encryption key to decrypt various information associated with that entry.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In step <b>1670</b>, the decryption engine forwards the decrypted information on to a user interface for display. For example, a virtual beacon is forwarded to and displayed. Thus, if the proper context information was provided to the filter on the trusted platform, the decryption engine will decrypt the information associated with the context and forward it to the display. The process <b>1600</b> then ends.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Thus, embodiments of the present invention, securely providing information corresponding to a context, is thus described. While the present invention has been described in particular embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present invention should not be construed as limited by such embodiments, but rather construed according to the below claims.</p>
