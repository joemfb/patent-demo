<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the filing date of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/579,132, filed Dec. 22, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a method and system for transferring material between vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain prior art systems may use global positioning system (GPS) receivers to maintain proper spacing between two vehicles during the unloading or transferring of material (e.g., an agricultural material) between the vehicles (e.g., moving vehicles). However, such prior art systems may lack a reliable, user friendly mechanism for coordinating the unloading activities between pairs of vehicles in the fleet. Thus, there is a need for an improved system for managing the unloading of agricultural material from a vehicle to account for pragmatic coordination of the unloading activities between pairs of vehicles in the fleet.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment, the method or system comprises a first location-determining receiver for determining a lead vehicle location of a lead vehicle. A first wireless communications device receives a follower vehicle location of a follower vehicle. A user interface is adapted for alerting an operator of the lead vehicle if the follower vehicle location is within a proximity zone of the lead vehicle (or within a predefined radius of the lead vehicle location and a predetermined angular difference with respect to a heading of the lead vehicle). The user interface provides an operator of the lead vehicle with a user interface response mechanism in response to a received data message request from the follower vehicle within the predefined radius and predetermined angular distance such that the operator can accept or reject jointly coordinated movement (e.g., pairing) of the lead vehicle and follower vehicle for unloading the lead vehicle during an unloading period. The first wireless communications device is adapted to transmit an alignment data message to the follower vehicle to maintain a target offset between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle if the operator accepts the jointly coordinated movement. The target offset is based on a first vehicle identifier of the follower vehicle, a second vehicle identifier of the lead vehicle, and preset target offset stored in at data storage device associated with the lead vehicle.</p>

The lead vehicle system <b>13</b> and the follower vehicle system <b>15</b> can communicate with each other via wireless communication devices (<b>14</b>, <b>50</b>). Although one lead vehicle system <b>13</b> and one follower vehicle system <b>15</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in practice multiple lead vehicle systems may be used in conjunction with multiple follower vehicle systems in the same work area (e.g., field).</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first data storage device <b>22</b> comprises an alarm module <b>36</b>, an alignment module <b>38</b> and a fill state module <b>46</b>. In one embodiment, the alignment module <b>38</b> further comprises lateral data, longitudinal data, and vehicle identifiers <b>44</b>. An alignment module <b>38</b> may comprise software instructions, a software module, or an electronic module that allows an operator of the lead vehicle to do one or more of following via the first user interface <b>24</b>: (1) set, preset, or record a target offset between the lead vehicle and follower vehicle for unloading of material; (2) recall, retrieve or activate the set, preset or recorded target offset in preparation for unloading of material; and (3) maintain the target offset by facilitating communications between the follower vehicle and lead vehicle; and (4) deactivate the set, preset, or recorded target offset after loading is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fill state detector <b>16</b> may comprise one or more of the following: a weight sensor (e.g., piezo-electric sensor or network of piezo-resistive sensors) for sensing the weight or mass of material (e.g., agricultural material) within a container associated with the lead vehicle; a mass flow sensor for sensing the mass or volume of agricultural material harvested by the lead vehicle (e.g., combine); an auger monitor for monitoring the duration of operation of an unloading auger associated with agricultural material in a container associated with the lead vehicle; and one or more optically activated or mechanically activated switches mounted in or around the container for holding the agricultural material to detect various discrete levels (e.g., one-quarter full, one-half full, three-quarters full, or completely full) of the agricultural material in the container. Further, each fill state detector <b>16</b> may comprise one or more sensors that provide digital logic levels or analog logic levels that are converted by analog-to-digital converters and processed by a data processor or logic circuitry.

The location tracking module <b>60</b> allows the second data processor <b>52</b> to track all current locations of the lead vehicle or lead vehicles with systems <b>13</b> in a work area or region. The second wireless communications device <b>50</b> can poll, interrogate, or receive lead vehicle location data from each lead vehicle system <b>13</b> (e.g., within radio frequency range) that transmits location data and a corresponding vehicle identifier. The fill state tracking module <b>62</b> allows the second data processor <b>52</b> to track the current fill statuses of the lead vehicles with systems <b>13</b> in a work area or region. The second wireless communications device <b>50</b> can poll, interrogate, or receive lead vehicle fill status data from each lead vehicle system <b>13</b> (e.g., within radio frequency range) that transmits fill status data and a corresponding vehicle identifier. The location tracking module <b>60</b> and the fill state tracking module <b>62</b> facilitate display of locations of lead vehicles and corresponding fill status on the second user interface <b>56</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The vehicle controller <b>28</b> may comprise a data processor that is capable of generating command data that includes one or more of the following: steering command data, braking command data, propulsion command data, speed data, acceleration data, vehicle heading angle, deceleration data, and tracking error data. In one embodiment, the vehicle controller <b>28</b> may comprise path planner, an obstacle detector, and an obstacle avoidance system, a dead reckoning navigation system, or another navigation system. The vehicle controller <b>28</b> is capable of communicating command data to the propulsion system <b>34</b>, the steering system <b>30</b>, and the braking system <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The propulsion system <b>34</b> may comprise an internal combustion engine that is controlled by a fuel injection system, a throttle system, or another fuel metering device that can be controlled via an electrical or electronic signal. The steering system <b>30</b> may comprise an electro-hydraulic steering system, a solenoid-controlled mechanical steering system, an electric motor-controlled rack-and-pinion steering system, or an electric motor-controlled steering system. The braking system <b>32</b> may comprise an electro-hydraulic braking system, a solenoid-controlled mechanical braking system, a regenerative electromagnetic braking system, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The lead vehicle is associated with a vehicle identifier <b>44</b> (e.g., first vehicle identifier) that is unique and facilitates distinguishing of the lead vehicle from other vehicles (e.g., lead vehicle or follower vehicle). Similarly, the follower vehicle is associated with a vehicle identifier <b>44</b> (e.g., second vehicle identifier) that is unique and facilitates distinguishing the follower vehicle from other vehicles. In one configuration, the vehicle identifier <b>44</b> is stored in the first data storage device <b>22</b> of the lead vehicle system <b>13</b>. In one embodiment, the vehicle identifiers <b>44</b> stored in the first data storage device <b>22</b> remain stored in the data storage device (e.g., nonvolatile electronic memory) even when the lead vehicle system <b>13</b> or lead vehicle is turned off or powered down.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first data storage device <b>22</b> may store lateral data <b>40</b>, longitudinal data, target offset data, heading data, and vehicle identifiers <b>44</b>. In one embodiment, the target offset data may comprise a lateral data <b>40</b> and longitudinal data <b>42</b>. In another embodiment, the target offset data may be expressed as a vector with lateral and longitudinal vector components or in polar coordinates. The target offset may be established by a calibration process, while the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle are operating in a target alignment (with suitable generally constant spatial separation for unloading material) when the operator of the lead vehicle records such target alignment by activating a switch of the first user interface <b>24</b> or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first data processor <b>18</b> manages, supervises or controls enabling, activating or deactivating the automatic tracking or control of the follower vehicle with a target offset with respect to the lead vehicle, or mutually aligned position of a pair of the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> supports ad hoc formation of pairs of lead vehicle and follower vehicles for a sufficient time period to allow for unloading of material (e.g., agricultural material) from the lead vehicle. In any pair of vehicles, the lead and follower vehicle are coupled virtually by operating with the target offset, spatially separated from one another by a generally constant spatial separation during a transitory unloading period. The vehicles are not actually physically coupled together during the unloading period. Once the lead vehicle is unloaded, the pair of the lead vehicle and follower vehicle is separated or disbanded until the container in the lead vehicle is full of material (e.g., harvested grain). However, the lead vehicle is free to couple or create a new pair with a different follower vehicle than the first follower vehicle that was previously coupled with the lead vehicle for unloading. In this way, the lead vehicle can be unloaded without delay by forming a pair (of a lead vehicle and a follower vehicle) with any available follower vehicle (in a fleet) that is not unloading another lead vehicle, transporting agricultural material, or busy with another task.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A second user interface <b>56</b> of the follower vehicle may display a plan view or an overhead field view of vehicle locations or relative locations of the active vehicles of a fleet in the field, along with respective bin fill status of a container associated with the lead vehicle. Further, if multiple lead vehicles are present, the second user interface <b>56</b> may display vehicle locations and respective bin fill statuses for corresponding lead vehicles. The second user interface <b>56</b> of the follower vehicle may alert the operator of the follower vehicle with respect to any lead vehicles that are equal to or greater than a threshold level of fullness (e.g., approximately seventy five percent) or if the operator of the lead vehicle has requested unloading of the lead vehicle. In response to observing a lead vehicle with fill status greater than a threshold level or an unloading request, the operator controls a follower vehicle to approach the lead vehicle or the approaching follower vehicle claims or reserves the unloading of the lead vehicle by generating and transmitting a data message (e.g., a reservation data message) to the fleet of follower vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each pair of the lead vehicle and follower vehicle may be associated with a particular target offset. The target offset may include a lateral offset component between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle and a longitudinal offset between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle. Longitudinal offset refers to the fore/aft relative position of the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle. The target offset, the lateral offset and the longitudinal offset may be established by one or more of the following: the dimensions of the lead vehicle, the dimensions of the follower vehicle, the wheelbase of the lead vehicle, the wheelbase of the follower vehicle, the turning radius of the lead vehicle, the turning radius of the follower vehicle, and the loaded weight of the lead vehicle, and the loaded weight of the follower vehicle. The first data storage device <b>22</b> may store respective lateral data <b>40</b> and the longitudinal data <b>42</b> for a corresponding vehicle identifier or pair of vehicle identifiers for a particular pair of a lead vehicle and follower vehicle. The lateral data <b>40</b> and the longitudinal data <b>42</b> are used to maintain the target offset between a pair of vehicles (e.g., leader-follower vehicle pair) during unloading.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first wireless communications device <b>14</b> and the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> supports the communication of one or more of the following: motion data, position data, location data, speed data, velocity data, acceleration data, and heading data between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle to maintain the target offset between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The vehicle controller <b>28</b> of the lead vehicle system <b>13</b> supports control of the navigation of the lead vehicle and the maintenance of the target offset. The vehicle controller <b>28</b> of the lead vehicle may control the propulsion system <b>34</b>, the steering system <b>30</b> and the braking system <b>32</b> to steer, accelerate, or decelerate the lead vehicle, for example. In the follower vehicle, the second user interface <b>56</b> may provide the operator with a display (e.g., light bar) such that the operator can steer or guide the vehicle consistent with the target offset.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> transmits a command data message between the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> at the lead vehicle and the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> at the follower vehicle. The second data processor <b>52</b> is adapted to (or programmed with software instructions to) display the command data message received from the lead vehicle such that an operator of the follower vehicle can track manually the path of the lead vehicle by the operator's operation of the steering wheel of the follower vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The system <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is similar to the system <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except the follower vehicle system <b>115</b> of the system <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further comprises a propulsion system <b>34</b>, a steering system <b>30</b>, a braking system <b>32</b> and a vehicle controller <b>28</b>. Like reference numbers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> indicate like elements. The vehicle controller <b>28</b> is capable of automatically steering the follower vehicle in an unmanned mode, or an automated steering mode where the operator supervises the automatic steering and propulsion of the vehicle, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, in response to the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> receiving a data message from the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> that the lead vehicle fill status is greater than a threshold level or an unloading request, the vehicle controller <b>28</b> (e.g., of the follower vehicle) controls the follower vehicle via a propulsion system <b>34</b>, the steering system <b>30</b>, and the braking system <b>32</b> to approach a vehicle location of the lead vehicle that has the fill status at or above the threshold level.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, while the leader vehicle and the follower vehicle are coupled for coordinated movement for unloading material, the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> transmits a command data message between the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> at the lead vehicle and the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> at the follower vehicle. The second data processor <b>52</b> is adapted to (or programmed with software instructions to) process the command data message by a vehicle controller <b>28</b> (of the follower vehicle) and steering system <b>30</b> where the follower vehicle automatically tracks a path of the lead vehicle consistent with the command data message received at the follower vehicle. The command data may be generated by the first data processor <b>18</b> or the alignment module <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is flow chart of one embodiment of a method for transferring agricultural material between two vehicles. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> begins in step S<b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step S<b>300</b>, the first location-determining receiver <b>12</b> determines a lead vehicle location (e.g., a combine location) of a lead vehicle (e.g., combine or harvesting machine).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step S<b>302</b>, a first wireless communication device <b>14</b> receives a follower vehicle location (e.g., cart location) of a follower vehicle (e.g., grain cart or truck). For example, the second location-determining receiver <b>48</b> determines a follower vehicle location and the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> transmits the follower vehicle location data to the first wireless communications device <b>14</b>, which receives the follower vehicle location data.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step S<b>305</b>, the first data processor <b>18</b> or the alignment module <b>38</b> determines whether or not the operator accepts or activates jointly coordinated movement (e.g., virtual coupling, as opposed to physical coupling) of the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle for unloading material from the lead vehicle for an unloading period. If the operator accepts or activates the jointly coordinated movement via the user interface <b>24</b> of the lead vehicle system <b>13</b>, the method continues with step S<b>306</b>. However, if the operator rejects (or does not accept or does not activate) the jointly coordinated movement via the first user interface <b>24</b>, the method returns to step S<b>300</b>, where the lead vehicle may be approached by another (e.g., the next) follower vehicle within the fleet or the original follower vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step S<b>306</b>, the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> transmits an alignment data message to the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> of follower vehicle to maintain a target offset (e.g., target lateral separation and target longitudinal separation) between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle if the follower vehicle location is within: (1) a proximity zone of the lead vehicle, or (2) the predefined radius of the lead vehicle location and within the predetermined angular difference with respect to a heading of the lead vehicle. In one embodiment, a target offset is defined by a target lateral separation and target longitudinal separation between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle. The target lateral separation is based on a first vehicle identifier <b>44</b> of the lead vehicle, a second vehicle identifier <b>44</b> of the follower vehicle, and target offset stored in the first data storage device <b>22</b> associated with the lead vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is similar to the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, except the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> further comprises additional steps S<b>400</b>, S<b>402</b> and S<b>304</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step S<b>402</b> after step S<b>400</b>, the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> may transmit the estimated fill state and lead vehicle location to a second wireless communications device <b>50</b> of a follower vehicle or fleet of follower vehicles such that an available one of the follower vehicles can approach the lead vehicle to facilitate unloading of a lead vehicle that has a fill state equal to or greater than a threshold level (e.g., approximately seventy-five percent of the maximum storage capacity) of a storage container (e.g., a grain cart) associated with the lead vehicle (e.g., combine).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step S<b>302</b>, a first wireless communications device <b>14</b> receives a follower vehicle location (e.g., cart location) of a follower vehicle (e.g., grain cart or truck).

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step S<b>304</b>, a first user interface <b>24</b> or first data processor <b>18</b> of the lead vehicle system <b>13</b> alerts an operator of the lead vehicle if the follower vehicle location is within a proximity zone of the lead vehicle, if the follower vehicle is within a predefined radius (e.g., <b>602</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the lead vehicle location and predetermined angular difference with respect to a heading (e.g., direction of travel) of the lead vehicle. Although other predefined radii fall within the scope of the claims, in one example the predefined radius (e.g., <b>602</b>) is approximately 50 (fifty) meters or 170 (one-hundred and seventy) feet. Although other predetermined angular differences (e.g., <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) fall within the scope of the claims, in one example the predetermined angular difference (e.g., <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>) is within an angular range of approximately 80 (eighty) degrees (e.g., plus or minus 80 degrees) from the heading of the lead vehicle. In one configuration, the proximity zone (e.g., <b>603</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle is defined by the predefined radius and the predetermined angular difference. For example, the follower vehicle lies within the proximity zone (e.g., <b>603</b>) if the predetermined angular difference is within an arc or range of approximately 200 (two hundred) degrees from approximately 80 degrees to approximately 280 (two hundred and eighty) degrees toward the back and sides of the lead vehicle. In one embodiment, the first user interface <b>24</b> alerts the operator of the lead vehicle to the proximity of the follower vehicle (e.g., in the proximity zone) by an audible tone.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step S<b>305</b>, the first data processor <b>18</b> or alignment module <b>38</b> determines whether or not the operator accepts jointly coordinated movement (e.g., virtual coupling) of the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle for unloading of the lead vehicle for an unloading time period. If the operator accepts or activates the jointly coordinated movement via the user interface <b>24</b> of the lead vehicle system <b>13</b>, the method continues with step S<b>504</b> and step S<b>306</b>. However, if the operator rejects (or does not accept or does not activate) the jointly coordinated movement via the first user interface <b>24</b>, the method returns to step S<b>300</b>, where the lead vehicle may be approached by another (e.g., the next) follower vehicle within the fleet or the original follower vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step S<b>504</b>, the first data processor <b>18</b> or the first data storage device <b>22</b> retrieves the recorded target offset from the data storage device (e.g., by the operator of the lead vehicle activating a single switch). Step S<b>504</b> may be carried out in accordance with various techniques that may be applied alternately or cumulatively.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Under a first technique, the preset target offset comprises a preset lateral separation and a preset longitudinal separation between the vehicles, where the preset target offset is established by visual observation of an operator of the lead vehicle that is moving in alignment with a follower vehicle and where a first vehicle identifier of the follower vehicle and the associated preset target offset are recorded in the first data storage device <b>22</b> associated with the lead vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Under a second technique, the preset target offset comprises a preset lateral separation and a preset longitudinal separation that are established by entering or selecting the dimensions, wheelbase and minimum turning radius of the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle, where the first vehicle identifier and the associated preset target offset are recorded in the first data storage device <b>22</b> associated with the lead vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Under a third technique, the operator of the lead vehicle establishes the preset target offset by the operator of the lead vehicle activating a single switch of the first user interface <b>24</b> to record or read the present target offset in the first data storage device <b>24</b>, where the preset target offset comprises a preset lateral separation and a preset longitudinal separation between a cooperating pair of the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle. By one touch contact with the switch of the first user interface <b>24</b>, an operator of the lead vehicle may establish or set a preset target offset between the vehicles; the operator may recall readily and quickly the preset target offset during later operation of the lead vehicle via the switch or first user interface <b>24</b> by one touch contact with, or command of, the switch, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step S<b>306</b>, the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> transmits an alignment data message to the second wireless communications device <b>50</b> of the follower vehicle to maintain a target offset (e.g., target lateral separation and target longitudinal separation) between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle if the follower vehicle location is within the predefined radius of the lead vehicle location and within the predetermined angular difference with respect to a heading of the lead vehicle. The target lateral separation is based on a first vehicle identifier <b>44</b> of the follower vehicle, a second vehicle identifier <b>44</b> of the lead vehicle, and target offset stored in the first data storage device <b>22</b> associated with the lead vehicle. In one configuration, the lead vehicle may operate in a leader mode while the follower vehicle operates in a follower mode following the lead vehicle in the direction of travel of the lead vehicle and with a follower vehicle heading that tracks a lead vehicle heading (e.g., or a tracking error of the lead vehicle heading).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an overhead or plan view of a follower vehicle <b>611</b> that approaches a lead vehicle <b>608</b> within a predefined radius <b>602</b> of the lead vehicle <b>608</b> and within a predetermined angular difference (<b>606</b>, <b>604</b>) with respect to the heading <b>704</b> of the lead vehicle <b>608</b>. In one example, the predetermined angular difference extends over a range or arc from approximately 80 degrees of the lead vehicle heading to approximately 280 degrees of the lead vehicle heading. In another example, the predetermined angular difference defines a proximity zone <b>603</b> bounded by linear segments <b>605</b> of the angular difference (<b>604</b>,<b>606</b>) and the predefined radius <b>602</b>, where any available follower vehicle within the proximity zone <b>603</b> is eligible to unload material from the lead vehicle <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The lead vehicle <b>608</b> is equipped with a lead vehicle system <b>13</b>; the follower vehicle <b>611</b> is equipped with a follower vehicle system (<b>15</b> or <b>115</b>). As illustrated, the lead vehicle <b>608</b> comprises a combine or harvesting machine, and the follower vehicle <b>611</b> comprises the combination of a tractor <b>610</b> and a grain cart <b>612</b>, although other vehicle configurations fall within the scope of the appended claims and are not limited by the illustrative vehicle configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As the follower vehicle enters a spatial zone or proximity zone <b>603</b> within the predetermined angular distance (<b>604</b>, <b>606</b>) and within the predefined radius <b>602</b> (e.g., behind and to the left side of the lead vehicle) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the first user interface <b>24</b> of the lead vehicle system <b>13</b> alerts the operator that the follower vehicle <b>611</b> is available for unloading the container of the lead vehicle <b>608</b> as a virtual coupled pair of the lead vehicle <b>608</b> and the follower vehicle <b>611</b>. The pair is virtually coupled because there is no actual physical connection between the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle; yet, the follower vehicle tracks the lead vehicle with the target offset or another generally fixed or constant spatial separation.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an overhead or plan view of a lead vehicle <b>608</b> and a follower vehicle <b>611</b> engaged in coordinated movement (e.g., virtual coupling) or maintaining a target offset <b>710</b> with respect to each other. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be illustrative of step S<b>306</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, although other <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may apply to other steps or procedures within the scope of the appended claims. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the target offset <b>710</b> comprises a target lateral separation <b>714</b> and a target longitudinal separation <b>712</b>. The target lateral separation <b>714</b> may be measured perpendicularly to the direction of travel or heading <b>704</b> of the lead vehicle or the heading of the follower vehicle <b>705</b>. In one example, the target lateral separation <b>714</b> and the target longitudinal separation <b>712</b> may be expressed as vectors or Cartesian components of the target offset. As shown, the chute outlet <b>613</b> of the combine or lead vehicle <b>608</b> is aligned over a region <b>615</b> (e.g., central region) of the cart <b>612</b> for unloading agricultural material (e.g., grain) into the cart <b>612</b>, while the lead vehicle <b>608</b> and the follower vehicle <b>611</b> are both moving such that the lead vehicle <b>608</b> can continue harvesting crop, or performing another work task, while simultaneously unloading previously collected material (e.g., previously harvested crop) into the cart. The method and system are well suited for simultaneous unloading of the container <b>707</b> (e.g., grain tank) of the lead vehicle while harvesting.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">During unloading, the lead vehicle and the follower vehicle move in the direction of travel (<b>704</b>, <b>705</b>), respectively. The heading <b>707</b> of the lead vehicle or a heading error <b>707</b> of the lead vehicle may be determined with reference to the direction of travel <b>704</b> of the vehicle or with respect to an absolute direction, such as the magnetic North pole of the Earth. The heading <b>705</b> of the follower vehicle <b>611</b> or a heading error <b>708</b> of the follower vehicle <b>611</b> may be determined with reference to the direction of travel <b>705</b> of the follower vehicle <b>611</b> or with respect to an absolute direction, such as the magnetic North pole of the Earth. The lead vehicle system <b>13</b> may communicate its heading <b>704</b> and its heading error <b>707</b> of the lead vehicle <b>608</b> to the follower vehicle system (<b>15</b> or <b>115</b>) via the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> and the second wireless communications device <b>50</b>. Simultaneously, the follower vehicle system may communicate its heading <b>705</b> and its heading error <b>708</b> via the first wireless communications device <b>14</b> and the second wireless communications device <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, the system and method disclosed herein promotes efficient operation of a farm or agricultural operation by supporting real-time iterative pairing of respective lead vehicles and different follower vehicles within a fleet to minimize down-time of lead vehicles that otherwise might be waiting for one or more follower vehicles to unload material from a respective lead vehicle. Accordingly, the lead vehicle or lead vehicles within a fleet can continue harvesting material, or doing other tasks, without stopping and waiting for the assignment of a follower vehicle to facilitate the transfer or unloading of material from the lead vehicle. Further, the system and method disclosed herein is well suited for facilitating virtual coupling between vehicles, or coordinated movement consistent with a target offset or constant spatial separation between a pair of a lead vehicle and follower vehicle to support transferring or unloading of material from the lead vehicle to the follower vehicle. An operator of the lead vehicle may establish or set a preset target offset between the vehicles via a switch or user interface, and the operator may recall readily the preset target offset during later operation of the lead vehicle via the switch or user interface by a one touch contact with, or command of, the switch, for example. Although the lead vehicle may comprise a combine or a harvesting machine that stores harvested agricultural material in a container (e.g., grain tank), in alternate embodiments the lead vehicle may comprise any heavy equipment for mining, earth-moving, construction, or forestry. Similarly, although the follower vehicle may comprise a grain cart, in alternate embodiments the follower vehicle may comprise a truck or other heavy equipment.</p>
