<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such supports are arranged in pairs in the front region of semi-trailers and in fast gear they can be brought into the support or transport position and, if necessary, for low-gear operation they can be used to lift a partial mass of the semi-trailer. In so doing, during the fast-gear operation, the fast-gear gearwheel coupled to the crank drive drives a pinion which is seated in an unrotatable manner on an overlying transmission output shaft. As in the low-gear operation, force is transmitted to a crown wheel via a bevel pinion which also is seated on the output shaft of the transmission in order to drive the spindle drive. From WO 2008/019973 a support for semi-trailers is known in which, for the transmission of power, after each gearwheel stage of the change-over transmission a separate transmission stage with bevel gear toothing is provided, which makes possible an increased fast gear. In this support, with respect to height, the crank drive is arranged above the transmission output journal. Therefore, for semi-trailers with a particularly low-lying frame, the mounting facilities are restricted in the case of such a support.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to provide a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers having a transmission with a crank drive which, with respect to height, is arranged below the output shaft and, nevertheless, has an increased fast gear.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the invention a height-adjustable support for semi-trailers or the like is provided, comprising a shaft tube body which is preferably stationarily mounted or mountable on the chassis of a semi-trailer, respectively, a slidable support inner tube arranged in the shaft tube body, at whose lower end region a foot is mounted and which is connected by means of a nut located on a spindle which is drivable by means of a transmission having a switchable spur gear region and bevel gear assemblies, wherein the transmission has a switchable spur gear region and bevel gear assemblies, wherein a switching region of the transmission is formed of a low-gear pinion and a fast-gear gearwheel which are attributed to a crank drive, as well as a low-gear gearwheel and a fast-gear pinion to which alternatively by means of clutch coupling elements power is transmitted from the crank drive via the low-gear pinion to the low-gear gearwheel or from the crank drive via the fast-gear gearwheel to the fast-gear pinion, and wherein on an output shaft a tab or slide drive unit is rotatably supported which tab drive unit comprises the fast-gear pinion and a fast-gear bevel pinion which are connected to one another in an unrotatable manner by means of a connecting member. In the support which is proposed, it is possible to arrange the crank drive in a known way lower than the output shaft of its transmission. Preferably, the fast-gear pinion can be seated on a tab drive unit which can also comprise an unrotatable bevel pinion for the fast gear or a fast-gear bevel pinion, respectively. Advantageously, the tab drive unit is supported in a rotatable manner on the output shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Preferably, the tab drive unit is formed as a single piece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Preferably, the tab drive unit and the output shaft have the same axis of rotation. An identity of axes of the tab drive unit and the output shaft is possible so that the tab drive unit and the output shaft have the same axis of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Expediently, the identity of axes of the output shaft and the tab drive unit makes it possible that the fast-gear bevel pinion engages with a bevel gear toothing of a smaller diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Advantageously, the fast-gear bevel pinion engages with a small-diameter bevel gear toothing which is connected to the spindle in an unrotatable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Expediently, the low-gear gearwheel is seated on the output shaft in an unrotatable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, a low-gear bevel pinion is seated on the output shaft in an unrotatable manner, which low-gear bevel pinion preferably engages with a large-diameter bevel gear toothing which is connected to the spindle in an unrotatable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously, the tab drive unit is arranged between the low-gear gearwheel and the low-gear bevel pinion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the small-diameter bevel gear toothing is arranged concentrically to a large-diameter bevel gear toothing. The bevel gear toothing having the smaller diameter can be arranged concentrically to a bevel gear toothing having a larger diameter, which bevel gear toothing is used to drive the spindle drive in the low-gear stage. As far as the transmission and the transmission ratio are concerned, these are the prerequisites also for an increased fast-gear stage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Expediently, the crank drive is connected to the low-gear pinion and to a carrier device for the fast-gear gearwheel which is arranged concentrically thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the crank drive points axially towards the spindle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further advantages and features of the invention result from the following description of preferred embodiments with respect to the drawings, wherein individual features of different embodiments can be combined to form new embodiments. The figures show:</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The support <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is fixed in pairs to the chassis of a semi-trailer in its front region. The supports <b>10</b> of each pair are connected to one another by means of a connecting shaft <b>11</b> on their output shafts <b>12</b> and are retracted in their transport position, i.e. they are in their shortened state. Prior to uncoupling the semi-trailer from the road tractor, the supports <b>10</b> are extended. The support <b>10</b> has a support outer tube or a shaft tube body <b>13</b>, respectively, and a support inner tube <b>14</b> arranged therein and slidable in the longitudinal direction. The inner section of the shaft tube body <b>13</b> and the support inner tube <b>14</b> preferably have square cross-sections. The support <b>10</b> is expediently fixed to the semi-trailer frame by means of flange legs <b>13</b><i>a </i>located on the shaft tube body <b>13</b>. At the lower end of the support inner tube <b>14</b> a foot <b>15</b> is arranged or mounted, respectively, for placement onto the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support <b>10</b> has a spindle <b>16</b> with a nut <b>17</b>. The nut <b>17</b> is connected to the support inner tube <b>14</b>.

Above the load-bearing floor <b>19</b>, in concentric crown-wheel like arrangement and connected to the spindle <b>16</b> in an unrotatable manner, there are a large-diameter bevel gear or a large-diameter bevel gear toothing <b>20</b>, respectively, and a small-diameter bevel gear or a small-diameter bevel gear toothing <b>21</b>, respectively. Above the bevel gear toothings <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> the output shaft <b>12</b> is arranged. On the output shaft <b>12</b>, at the front, there is a low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b> and, at the rear, there is a low-gear bevel pinion <b>23</b>, both mounted in an unrotatable manner. In between, on the output shaft <b>12</b>, a tab drive unit <b>24</b> is supported in a rotatable manner. The tab drive unit <b>24</b> has a fast-gear pinion <b>24</b><i>a </i>and, spaced with respect to this pinion, a fast-gear bevel pinion <b>24</b><i>b </i>which, by means of a connecting member <b>24</b><i>c</i>, are connected to one another in an unrotatable manner. In the front region of the shaft tube body <b>13</b> and below the output shaft <b>12</b>, there is an axially slidable crank drive <b>25</b>. The crank drive <b>25</b> is in connection with a low-gear pinion <b>26</b> and a carrier device <b>27</b> for a fast-gear gearwheel <b>28</b> which is arranged concentrically thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The transmission function of the support <b>10</b> is described as follows: In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transmission is depicted in the freewheel state. In this state, the crank drive <b>25</b> is in the idle position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to activate the fast-gear stage, the crank drive <b>25</b> is axially slightly drawn towards the outside. As a result, the carrier device <b>27</b> engages with the fast-gear gearwheel <b>28</b> and an axial fixing (not shown) of the crank drive <b>25</b> locks. When turning the crank drive <b>25</b>, torque or force is transmitted from the fast-gear gearwheel <b>28</b> to the fast-gear pinion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the tab drive unit <b>24</b> with a step-up transmission ratio and then continued from the fast-gear bevel pinion <b>24</b><i>b </i>to the small-diameter bevel gear toothing <b>21</b> so as to drive the spindle <b>16</b>. Thus, the nut <b>17</b> as well as the support inner tube <b>14</b> are rapidly moved.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For the low-gear operation the crank drive <b>25</b> is inserted up to its axial locking, thereby causing the low-gear pinion <b>26</b> to engage with the low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b>. When cranking the crank drive <b>25</b>, force flows from the low-gear pinion <b>26</b> to the low-gear gearwheel <b>22</b> with a step-down transmission ratio. The output shaft <b>12</b> then transmits the increased torque to the low-gear bevel pinion <b>23</b>. The low-gear bevel pinion <b>23</b> engages with the large-diameter bevel gear toothing <b>20</b> and, thus, drives the spindle <b>16</b>, again with a step-down transmission ratio.</p>
