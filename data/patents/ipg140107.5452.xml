<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method, apparatus, system, and computer program product for managing scheduling of appointments with respect to a quorum requirement. The solution includes scheduling an appointment with each of a plurality of invitees, receiving one or more appointment management requests associated with the appointment from the invitees, the one or more appointment management requests including a change in the appointment, determining that a subset of the appointment management requests constitute a common request, determining that invitees that sent the common request satisfy the quorum constraint for the appointment, and implementing the common request in response to invitees that sent the common request satisfying the quorum constraint. The common request may include an acceptance, a cancellation notice, a cancellation request, and a re-scheduling request.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the quorum management of a calendaring and/or scheduling system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a more connected world users are provided with tools for scheduling and managing of appointments such as meetings and other appointments. Inevitably, the productivity and success of the appointment or meeting depends on a specific set of one or more people attending the meeting. This particular set of people attending the appointment constitutes a quorum. Many appointments require a quorum to be present in order for the decisions made at the appointment or meeting to be binding and effective. Tools exist for inviting and coordinating of the scheduling of the appointment for a plurality of people using a variety of intercommunicating calendaring and scheduling tools. These existing tools permit appointment invitations to be sent to invitees and permit the invitees to accept the invitation, reject the invitation, propose a different appointment time and/or day, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, these tools do not permit the management of the appointment based on whether or not a quorum will be present at the appointment or meeting. Furthermore, these tools fail to allow members of the quorum to manage the scheduling, re-scheduling, or cancellation of the appointment. What is needed is a calendaring and scheduling tool that incorporates the existence of a quorum into the setting up the appointment as well as permitting the quorum to manage or adjust the appointment as needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present invention have been developed to provide quorum management of appointment scheduling. The method in accordance with one embodiment includes scheduling an appointment with each of a plurality of invitees in response to an acceptance from one or more of the invitees, the one or more invitees that have accepted the appointment collectively satisfying a quorum constraint associated with the appointment. Next, the method receives one or more appointment management requests associated with the appointment from the invitees, the one or more appointment management requests comprising a change in the appointment. Then, the method determines that a subset of the appointment management requests comprise a common request. The method also determines that invitees that sent the common request satisfy the quorum constraint for the appointment. Finally, the method implements the common request in response to invitees that sent the common request satisfying the quorum constraint.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, the method may determine that the subset of common appointment management requests are cancellation notices from appointment invitees that previously accepted the appointment, the cancellation notices notifying that a previous acceptance of the appointment by an invitee is revoked. Consequently, implementing the common request may include canceling the appointment for invitees that have accepted the appointment in response to invitees that sent the common request satisfying the quorum constraint.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The method may also determine that the subset of common appointment management requests are re-scheduling requests from appointment invitees that previously accepted the appointment, the re-scheduling requests notifying of a change to one of a time and place for the appointment. In addition, the determining that a subset of the appointment management requests comprise a common request also determines that the common request includes one of the same time change, the same place change, and a combination of time change and place change that is the same. In response, in certain embodiments implementing the common request further comprises re-scheduling the appointment for invitees that have accepted the appointment such that the re-scheduled appointment satisfies the common request from a set of invitees that satisfy the quorum constraint.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, the method sends a modified appointment invitation to each invitee that has not sent a re-scheduling request, the modified appointment invitation corresponding to the re-scheduled appointment. The method may also receive one or more responses to the modified appointment invitations from each invitee that has not sent a re-scheduling request, and schedule the re-scheduled appointment with each invitee that responds to the modified appointment invitation in response to the invitees that sent the common request satisfying the quorum constraint.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the method determines that the subset of common appointment management requests are cancellation requests, the cancellation requests requesting cancellation of the appointment and provides access to the cancellation requests to each of the appointment invitees. As a result, the implementation of the common request further comprises canceling the appointment for invitees that have accepted the appointment in response to invitees that sent the common request satisfying the quorum constraint.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, the quorum constraint comprises one or more of: a minimum number of appointment attendees, a percentage of appointment attendees, a required appointment attendee, an appointment attendee designated to fill a specified role for the appointment, and an appointment attendee having a specified characteristic. In addition, the specified characteristic may comprise one or more of membership in a specified organization and a relationship to a specified individual in a social network. In certain embodiments, an appointment request is associated with an appointment policy. The appointment policy defines the quorum constraint for each appointment associated with the appointment policy.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention may be implemented an apparatus, a computer program product, and a system executing the operations of the method described above. The apparatus and/or system implementation may include an invitation module, a receiving module, an acceptance module, a quorum constraint module, and a scheduling module. The apparatus and/or system implementation may also include a cancellation notice module, a cancellation module, a re-scheduling request module, and a cancellation request module. Each of these modules will be described in more detail below as example embodiments of the invention are described.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Many of the functional units described in this specification have been labeled as modules, in order to more particularly emphasize their implementation independence. For example, a module may be implemented as a hardware circuit comprising custom VLSI circuits or gate arrays, off-the-shelf semiconductors such as logic chips, transistors, or other tangible discrete components. A module may also be implemented in programmable hardware devices such as field programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic, programmable logic devices, computer processors, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Modules may also be implemented in software for execution by various types of calculating processors. An identified module of executable code may, for instance, comprise one or more physical or logical blocks of computer instructions which may, for instance, be organized as an object, procedure, or function. Nevertheless, the executable instructions of an identified module need not be physically located together, but may comprise disparate instructions stored in different locations which, when joined logically together, comprise the module and achieve the stated purpose for the module.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Indeed, a module of executable code may be a single instruction, or many instructions, and may even be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across several memory devices. Similarly, operational data may be identified and illustrated herein within modules, and may be embodied in any suitable form and organized within any suitable type of data structure. The operational data may be collected as a single data set, or may be distributed over different locations including over different storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; or similar language means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; and similar language throughout this specification may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, an embodiment of the present invention may be embodied as a method, apparatus, system, or computer program product. Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Furthermore, an embodiment of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-readable storage medium having computer-readable program code embodied in the medium.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Any suitable computer usable or computer readable medium may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but is not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device. Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium could be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer readable program code may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to the Internet, wire line, optical fiber cable, RF, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Computer program code for carrying out operations of quorum management of appointment scheduling may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of an embodiment of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a system for quorum management of appointment scheduling. The system <b>100</b> may include a plurality of appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a </i>in electronic communication with an appointment scheduler <b>120</b> across a network connection <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a </i>are any user capable of receiving an appointment invitation and accepting the appointment invitation from the appointment scheduler <b>120</b>. An appointment invitation is an electronic message sent to an electronic device operated by the appointment invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The appointment invitation is a request the appointment invitee <b>110</b><i>a </i>be present at an appointment at a particular time and place. The appointment invitation may be sent to a single appointment invitee <b>110</b><i>a </i>or to a plurality of appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>either directly or by way of one or more invitees <b>110</b> forwarding the appointment invitation to other invitees <b>110</b>. The appointment invitation may include controls on how the appointment invitation may be distributed. The appointment may be a business meeting, an ad hoc meeting, an activity, a conference, a social event, a rally, an eating event, or the like. The appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be members of the same company, organization, government or corporate department, family, neighborhood, social network, or the like. Alternatively, or in another embodiment, the appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a </i>are from different companies, organizations, government or corporate departments, social networks, and the like. The appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a </i>may receive and accept the appointment invitations using a variety of computing devices including a desktop, a laptop, a personal computer, a workstation, a terminal, a PDA, a cell phone, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The user of the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> may comprise an appointment invitee <b>110</b><i>a </i>or another user tasked with setting up the appointment. The appointment scheduler <b>120</b> coordinates the identification of appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, the distribution of the appointment invitations, the receipt of appointment invitation responses, and the scheduling of the appointment. In one embodiment, the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> comprises a computing device such as a server, a personal computer, a PDA, a desktop, a laptop, a workstation, a terminal, a cell phone, and the like. In certain embodiments, the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> reserves a time and one or more physical resources (such as a conference room, venue, or equipment to be used with the appointment) until the appointment is actually scheduled, re-scheduled, or canceled.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An appointment invitation response is an electronic message sent from or on behalf of one or more of the appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>as a result of the appointment invitation. Appointment invitation responses may be of various types each providing a different set of instructions for the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> relating to the appointment. In one embodiment, the appointment invitation response may comprise a response accepting the appointment invitation (also referred to herein as an &#x201c;acceptance&#x201d;), a cancellation notice, and an appointment management request.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An acceptance is an acknowledgement that the invitation was received and that, barring an unforeseen change, the invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>will be in attendance at the appointment. A cancellation notice is a message from an invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>canceling a previous acceptance that had accepted an appointment invitation. An appointment management request is a request to change the appointment attendance details or other attributes of the appointment and may include a re-scheduling request, a cancellation notice, a cancellation request, or the like. A re-scheduling request is a request from an invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to change scheduling details such as one or more of the time, place, or resources (such as a conference room, venue, A/V or other physical equipment) for the appointment. A cancellation request is a request from an invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to cancel the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that a cancellation notice is different from a cancellation request. An invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can send a cancellation notice once an acceptance of an appointment invitation occurs. A cancellation notice is notice to the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> (and potentially to other invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>) that the previous acceptance of the appointment is revoked. Thus, the invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>does not plan to be present at the appointment. An invitee <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can send a cancellation request at any time after an appointment invitation is received. The cancellation request does not require that an acceptance be made.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> exchange appointment invitations, acceptances, cancellation notices, and appointment management request over an electronic network <b>130</b>. The network <b>130</b> may comprise an interconnected set of computing devices such as a Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), or global communications network such as the internet. The network <b>130</b> may include one or more devices connected by one or more wired or wireless communication links such that the invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and appointment managers <b>120</b> can effectively communicate electronic messages.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> schedules the appointment only if the invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that accept the appointment satisfy a quorum constraint. In one or more embodiments, the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> cancels the appointment if the invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that accept the appointment no longer satisfy a quorum constraint. For example, as a result of the cancellation notices received, the quorum constraint is no longer satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition or alternatively, in one embodiment, the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> implements an appointment management request if a subset of appointment management requests comprise a common request and the invitees that sent the common request satisfy the quorum constraint. An appointment management request comprises a requested change for the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A quorum constraint is a requirement associated with the appointment relating to the invitees that accept the appointment invitation. The quorum constraint defines a subset of the invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>required to accept the appointment invitation in order for the appointment to be scheduled and/or to take place. The quorum constraint defines the minimum number of attendees (invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>that accept the invitation and are expected to then attend) that should be present at the appointment in order for the matters on the agenda for the appointment to be acted upon. Typically, without a set of invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>(also referred to as attendees) that satisfy the quorum constraint present the appointment is ineffective and is of little consequence. Therefore, if the quorum constraint is not satisfied, the most effective alternative may be to cancel or re-schedule the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used in the embodiments of the present invention, a variety of conditions may be used to define the quorum constraint. As used herein, each invitee is expected to attend the appointment, especially if the invitee has provided an acceptance. Therefore, invitee and attendee are used interchangeably. In certain embodiments, the quorum constraint comprises acceptance of the invitation by a minimum number of appointment invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, a predefined percentage of appointment invitees, a particular required invitee, an invitee designated to fill a specified role at the appointment (i.e. someone accepting to serve as chairperson or scribe or the like), an invitee having a specified characteristic, or the like. In certain embodiments, the specified characteristic comprises membership of the invitee in a specified organization and/or a relationship of the invitee to a specified individual in a social network. For example, the specified characteristic may be invitees that have a colleague relationship in a social network to a user organizing the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a representative example of a quorum constraint is illustrated by dashed box <b>140</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the quorum constraint <b>140</b> may be defined as three of the four invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>or a particular set of invitees such as invitee <b>110</b><i>b </i>and invitee <b>110</b><i>d</i>. Management of appointments by way of a quorum constraint <b>140</b> either in scheduling, re-scheduling, or canceling of an appointment can save a significant amount of time by ensuring that the appointment is not scheduled unless the invitees <b>110</b> or group of invitees <b>110</b> with the needed information or authority have accepted the invitation. Or the appointment may be canceled if the quorum constraint is not satisfied. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention, permit the members of the quorum, those invitees <b>110</b> that satisfy the quorum constraint, to control whether the appointment is canceled or re-scheduled.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an apparatus for quorum management of appointment scheduling. The apparatus includes an appointment scheduler <b>200</b> comprising an invitation module <b>210</b>, a receiving module <b>220</b>, an acceptance module <b>230</b>, a quorum constraint module <b>240</b>, and a scheduling module <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The invitation module <b>210</b> sends an appointment invitation to each of a plurality of invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. A user operating the appointment scheduler <b>200</b> by way of a user interface may define the plurality of invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The invitees <b>110</b> may be defined directly or indirectly such as by way of their membership in one or more groups and/or organizations. For example, a user may define the invitees <b>110</b> as all members of the accounting department of a company.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The receiving module <b>220</b> receives one or more responses to the appointment invitations from the invitees <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In certain embodiments, the receiving module <b>220</b> is further configured to receive responses that are not specifically responses to the appointment invitations. Responses received by the receiving module <b>220</b> may comprise appointment management requests. For example, the receiving module <b>220</b> may receive cancellation notices, re-scheduling requests, cancellation requests and the like. In one embodiment, the receiving module <b>220</b> communicates the responses to the acceptance module <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The acceptance module <b>230</b> determines if the responses received by the receiving module <b>220</b> are acceptances. If so, the acceptance module <b>230</b> communicates information about the acceptance to the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> and scheduling module <b>250</b>. If not, the acceptance module <b>230</b> may send the response to the quorum constraint module <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The quorum constraint module <b>240</b>, in one embodiment, determines that invitees <b>110</b> that have accepted the appointment invitation satisfy the quorum constraint. In certain embodiments, the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> determines the quorum constraint defined for the appointment associated with a particular acceptance. Next, the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> may tally the number of acceptances for the appointment in order to determine if the quorum constraint is satisfied. Alternatively, or in another embodiment, the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> may retrieve information about invitees that have sent acceptances and/or about previously received and stored appointment management requests in order to properly determine whether the quorum constraint is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> reviews responses that are not acceptances and determines if those responses require that the status of the invitation be changed in order to satisfy responses having common requests from invitees that collectively satisfy the quorum constraint. For example if a set of invitees that satisfy the quorum constraint have sent the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> a re-scheduling request the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> recognizes this is the case and communicates with the scheduling module <b>250</b> to implement the common re-scheduling request. In this manner, invitees <b>110</b> that satisfy the quorum constraint are able to collective manage the appointment to change the time and/or place and whether the appointment is canceled.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The scheduling module <b>250</b> schedules the appointment with each invitee <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the scheduling module <b>250</b> schedules the appointment with each invitee <b>110</b> that sent an acceptance to the appointment scheduler <b>200</b>. In certain embodiments, the scheduling module <b>250</b> schedules the appointment with each of the invitees <b>110</b> in response to the invitees that have accepted the invitation having satisfied the quorum constraint as indicated by the quorum constraint module <b>240</b>. Scheduling the appointment may comprise converting a reservation of a time slot on an invitee's calendar from a reservation to a confirmed appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an apparatus for quorum management of appointment scheduling. The apparatus includes an appointment scheduler <b>300</b> comprising modules that are similar to the like numbered and named modules described in relation to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> including an invitation module <b>310</b>, a receiving module <b>320</b>, an acceptance module <b>330</b>, a quorum constraint module <b>340</b>, and a scheduling module <b>350</b>. Each of these modules may operate in substantially the same manner as those described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with the differences described below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The quorum constraint module <b>340</b> comprises a cancellation notice module <b>360</b>, a cancellation request module <b>370</b>, a cancellation module <b>380</b>, and a re-scheduling module <b>390</b>. The cancellation notice module <b>360</b> determines that one or more responses received by the receiving module <b>320</b> are cancellation notices from appointment invitees that have previously accepted the appointment invitation. The cancellation notices cancel a previous response accepting the appointment invitation. The cancellation notice module <b>360</b> communicates with the cancellation module <b>380</b> to handle the cancellation notice.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cancellation module <b>380</b> cancels a previous acceptance of the appointment for each invitee <b>110</b> that has sent a cancellation notice. The cancellation of the appointment may involve the cancellation of a reserved time slot on an invitee's calendar. In certain embodiments, in response to a cancellation notice, the quorum constraint module <b>340</b> determines whether the invitees that have accepted the appointment invitation as a result of implementing the cancellation notice fail to satisfy the quorum constraint. If so, the cancellation module <b>380</b> cancels the appointment for each invitee that has accepted the appointment invitation in response to the unsatisfied quorum constraint. In this manner, an appointment for which the quorum constraint is no longer satisfied as a result of a cancellation notice is not scheduled.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cancellation request module <b>370</b> determines that one or more responses received by the receiving module <b>320</b> are cancellation requests from appointment invitees. The cancellation requests propose a cancellation of the appointment associated with the appointment invitation. In response to the cancellation request, the quorum constraint module <b>340</b> determines that the invitees that have submitted cancellation requests for canceling the appointment satisfy the quorum constraint in response to a comparison of the cancellation requests. If the invitees that have sent cancellation requests satisfy the quorum constraint, the cancellation request module <b>370</b> signals the cancellation module <b>380</b> to cancel the appointment for each invitee <b>110</b>. In this manner, the invitees that constitute the quorum (i.e. satisfy the quorum constraint) are also able to manage the keeping or canceling or re-scheduling of the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In certain embodiments, the cancellation request module <b>370</b> provides access to the fact that cancellation requests have been received to each of the appointment invitees. The cancellation request module <b>370</b> may provide access to the fact that cancellation requests have been made by one or more invitees through a variety of messaging mechanisms. For example, in one embodiment, the invitation module <b>310</b> may send each invitee a notice when a cancellation request is received. That notice may indicate who the invitee is that sent the cancellation request. Alternatively, the reserved time slot for the appointment may include an indicator that prompts a user to retrieve information that indicates that a cancellation request has been received. Once the invitees are informed of a cancellation request, this may prompt more cancellation requests. Alternatively, the information about the cancellation requests may prompt revocation of cancellation requests. Advantageously, the providing of this information about cancellation requests allows those invitees that constitute the quorum to manage the appointment even before the time the appointment is to be held.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The re-scheduling request module <b>390</b> determines that one or more responses received by the receiving module <b>320</b> are re-scheduling requests from appointment invitees that previously accepted the appointment invitation. The re-scheduling requests propose a change for an appointment associated with the appointment invitation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In response to the re-scheduling request, the quorum constraint module <b>340</b> determines that the invitees that have submitted re-scheduling requests for re-scheduling the appointment have submitted a common re-scheduling request and that the invitees submitting common re-scheduling requests satisfy the quorum constraint in response to a comparison of the re-scheduling requests. A common re-scheduling request (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;common request&#x201d;) is two or more re-scheduling requests which propose a same time change and/or a same place change and/or one or more appointment attribute changes that are the same.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If a common re-scheduling request is identified and the invitees that have sent re-scheduling requests satisfy the quorum constraint, the re-scheduling request module <b>390</b> signals the scheduling module <b>350</b> to schedule a re-scheduled appointment for each invitee <b>110</b> that sent a re-scheduling request. In addition, the cancellation module <b>380</b> is configured to cancel the appointment for invitees that have accepted the appointment invitation.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In certain embodiments, the quorum constraint module <b>340</b> signals the invitation module <b>310</b> to send a modified appointment invitation to each invitee that has not sent a common re-scheduling request. The modified appointment invitation may correspond to the re-scheduled appointment. In addition, the receiving module <b>320</b> may receive one or more responses to the modified appointment invitations from each invitee that has not sent a common re-scheduling request.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The scheduling module <b>350</b> may schedule the re-scheduled appointment with each invitee that responds to the modified appointment invitation in response to the invitees that have accepted the modified appointment invitation and submitted common re-scheduling requests satisfying the quorum constraint. In one embodiment, the scheduling module <b>350</b> is further configured to reserve a re-scheduled appointment for the invitees that sent common re-scheduling requests, the re-scheduled appointment corresponding to the common re-scheduling requests.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this manner, the invitees that constitute the quorum (i.e. satisfy the quorum constraint) are also able to manage the keeping or canceling or re-scheduling of the appointment.</p>

The re-scheduling request module <b>390</b> may provide access to the fact that re-scheduling requests have been made by one or more invitees through a variety of messaging mechanisms. In addition, the feedback facilitates re-scheduling requests that are in common. For example, in one embodiment, the invitation module <b>310</b> may send each invitee a notice when a re-scheduling request is received.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a method for quorum management of appointment scheduling. The operations may be implemented by the executed operations of a computer program product. The method <b>400</b> begins and an operator of the appointment scheduler <b>120</b> defines the appointment and designates the invitees. Next, the operator defines a quorum using the appointment scheduler <b>200</b>. In particular embodiments, the operator may define <b>420</b> a quorum constraint that quorum constraint module <b>240</b> references. Alternatively, or in addition, an appointment request from an operator to set up an appointment is associated with an appointment policy. The appointment policy may define the quorum constraint for each appointment associated with the appointment policy. In this manner, a company or other large organization can predefine a plurality of appointment policies, each with a variety of different predefined quorum constraints. Consequently, the operator may not define the quorum constraint and may instead simply set up the appointment and the appointment policy is associated with the set up appointment by default. In addition, or alternatively, quorum constraints defined by appointment policies may be editable by certain users depending on user permissions. In this manner, the use of quorum constraints in defining appointments can be automatic and yet flexibly handle the needs of different organizations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The invitation module <b>210</b> sends <b>430</b> the invitations. The receiving module <b>220</b> in cooperation with the acceptance module <b>230</b> and quorum constraint module <b>240</b> receives <b>440</b> responses such as acceptances, cancellation notices, and appointment management requests from the invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The quorum constraint module <b>240</b> determines <b>450</b> whether a subset of the appointment management requests that include a common request. If a subset of common requests is determined, the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> determines <b>460</b> whether invitees <b>110</b> that sent the common request satisfy a quorum constraint for the appointment. If a subset of common requests is not determined, the appointment scheduler <b>200</b> may record the appointment management request for future reference and the receiving module <b>220</b> may await a next appointment management request.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If the quorum constraint module <b>240</b> determines <b>460</b> that invitees <b>110</b> that sent the common request satisfy a quorum constraint for the appointment, the invitation module <b>210</b>, receiving module <b>220</b>, acceptance module <b>230</b>, quorum module <b>240</b> and scheduling module <b>250</b> cooperate as explained above to implement <b>470</b> the common request and the method <b>400</b> ends.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a method for defining a quorum constraint for use in a method for quorum management of appointment scheduling. The operations may be implemented by the executed operations of a computer program product. The method <b>500</b> begins and the appointment scheduler <b>200</b> presents the user with a series of conditions to be answered in defining the quorum constraint that will define how invitees will manage the appointment associated with this quorum constraint. In certain embodiments, only one of the conditions presented to the user as determinations in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be used to define the quorum constraint. Alternatively, or in addition, a combination of criteria may be used to define the quorum constraint.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the user determines <b>510</b> if the quorum constraint is to be defined by a minimum number of attendees. If so, the user supplies <b>515</b> the minimum number of attendees. If not, the user determines <b>520</b> if the quorum constraint is to be defined by a minimum percentage of attendees.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">If so, the user supplies <b>525</b> the minimum percentage of attendees. If not, the user determines <b>530</b> if the quorum constraint is to be defined by a required specific attendee. If so, the user supplies <b>535</b> the required specific attendee. If not, the user determines <b>540</b> if the quorum constraint is to be defined by an invitee agreeing to take a designated attendee role (i.e. moderator or chairperson).</p>

The method <b>600</b> begins and the receiving module <b>320</b> receives <b>610</b> one or more appointment management requests including invitation acceptances, cancellation notices, re-scheduling requests, and cancellation requests from the invitees. Next, the cancellation notice module <b>360</b> determines <b>620</b> whether one or more appointment management requests received by the receiving module <b>320</b> are cancellation notices from appointment invitees that have previously accepted the appointment invitation. If so, the cancellation module <b>380</b> cancels <b>630</b> a previous acceptance of the appointment for each invitee <b>110</b> that has sent a cancellation notice. In addition, the quorum constraint module <b>340</b> determines whether the invitees that have accepted the appointment still satisfy the quorum constraint after implementing the appointment cancellations. If so, no appointment change is made. If not, the cancellation module <b>380</b> cancels the appointment to each invitee <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the appointment management requests are not cancellation notices, the re-scheduling module <b>390</b> determines <b>640</b> whether one or more appointment management requests received by the receiving module <b>320</b> are re-scheduling requests from appointment invitees that previously accepted the appointment invitation. If so, the quorum constraint module <b>340</b> determines whether the invitees that have submitted re-scheduling requests for re-scheduling the appointment have submitted a common re-scheduling request and that the invitees submitting common re-scheduling requests satisfy the quorum constraint.
