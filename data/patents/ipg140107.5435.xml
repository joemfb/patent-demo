<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates generally to the field of computer technology, and in a specific example embodiment, a method and system for providing an insurance policy.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Websites provide a number of publishing, listing, and price-setting mechanisms whereby a publisher (e.g., a seller) may list or publish information concerning items for sale. The process of creating a listing may be a time-consuming and tedious process. The seller may not have a good idea of what the selling price should be, how much to charge for shipping, or what should go in a description for their item.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, the provision of shipping insurance for items transacted (e.g., by an ecommerce retailer or marketplace) presents a number of challenges. Particularly, in the event that a shipped item is received by a buyer in a damaged condition, or this shipment is lost, it may be difficult for the seller to recover the expense of the damage or a lost item. While the shipping carriers such as USPS (UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE)), UPS (United Parcel Service), FedEx (Federal Express) do offer insurance, the seller typically needs to provide evidence of the damaged delivery or loss to the shipping carrier. This requires that the buyer needs to ship the damaged item back to the seller, as the shipping carrier will only deal with the party (i.e. the seller) that purchased the insurance policy. This presents a number of challenges to sellers. Other companies enable a seller to buy insurance. However, the claim process for the insurance provided by these services is complicated and challenging. Furthermore, most of the shipping carriers (E.g., USPS) offer only a flat insurance rate that is only based on the value of the merchandise being shipped for all sellers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although the present invention has been described with reference to specific example embodiments, it will be evident that various modifications and changes may be made to these embodiments without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the specification and drawings are to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In various embodiments, a method and a system computes a shipping insurance rate for a seller of an electronic marketplace with an insurance provider. A shipping insurance service application has an electronic marketplace platform interface, a shipping insurance module, and an insurance provider module. The shipping insurance module is thus capable of interfacing with different electronic marketplace platforms and with different insurance providers to provide the shipping insurance policy for the seller. In other words, the shipping insurance module is platform neutral and carrier neutral. The electronic marketplace platform interface communicates with at least one electronic marketplace application. The shipping insurance module provides a shipping insurance policy to a seller of the corresponding electronic marketplace application and processes a claim from the seller of the corresponding electronic marketplace application based on the shipping insurance policy. The carrier module obtains the shipping insurance policy from an insurance provider among a plurality of insurance providers.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a network diagram depicting a network system <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment, having a client-server architecture configured for exchanging data over a network. For example, the network system <b>100</b> may be a publication/publisher system <b>102</b> where clients may communicate and exchange data within the network system <b>100</b>. The data may pertain to various functions (e.g., online item purchases) and aspects (e.g., managing content and user reputation values) associated with the network system <b>100</b> and its users. Although illustrated herein as a client-server architecture as an example, other embodiments may include other network architectures, such as a peer-to-peer or distributed network environment.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A data exchange platform, in an example form of a network-based publisher <b>102</b>, may provide server-side functionality, via a network <b>104</b> (e.g., the Internet) to one or more clients. The one or more clients may include users that utilize the network system <b>100</b> and more specifically, the network-based publisher <b>102</b>, to exchange data over the network <b>104</b>. These transactions may include transmitting, receiving (communicating) and processing data to, from, and regarding content and users of the network system <b>100</b>. The data may include, but are not limited to, content and user data such as feedback data; user reputation values; user profiles; user attributes; product and service reviews and information, such as pricing and descriptive information; product, service, manufacture, and vendor recommendations and identifiers; product and service listings associated with buyers and sellers; auction bids; and transaction data, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In various embodiments, the data exchanges within the network system <b>100</b> may be dependent upon user-selected functions available through one or more client or user interfaces (UIs). The UIs may be associated with a client machine, such as a client machine <b>106</b> using a web client <b>110</b>. The web client <b>110</b> may be in communication with the network-based publisher <b>102</b> via a web server <b>120</b>. The UIs may also be associated with a client machine <b>108</b> using a programmatic client <b>112</b>, such as a client application, or a mobile device <b>132</b> with a third party application <b>116</b>. It can be appreciated in various embodiments the client machine <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, or mobile device <b>132</b> may be associated with a buyer, a seller, a third party electronic commerce platform, a payment service provider, or a shipping service provider, each in communication with the network-based publisher <b>102</b> and optionally each other. The buyers and sellers may be any one of individuals, merchants, or service providers, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A mobile device <b>132</b> may also be in communication with the network-based publisher <b>102</b> via a web server <b>120</b>. The mobile device <b>132</b> may include a portable electronic device providing at least some of the functionalities of the client machines <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. The mobile device <b>132</b> may include the third party application <b>116</b> (or a web client) configured communicate with application server <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning specifically to the network-based publisher <b>102</b>, an application program interface (API) server <b>118</b> and a web server <b>120</b> are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers <b>122</b>. The application servers <b>122</b> host a shipping insurance application <b>130</b> and optionally a publication application <b>124</b>. The application servers <b>122</b> are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database server(s) <b>126</b> that facilitate access to one or more database(s) <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the web server <b>120</b> and the API server <b>118</b> communicate and receive data pertaining to listings, transactions, and feedback, among other things, via various user input tools. For example, the web server <b>120</b> may send and receive data to and from a toolbar or webpage on a browser application (e.g., web client <b>110</b>) operating on a client machine (e.g., client machine <b>106</b>). The API server <b>118</b> may send and receive data to and from an application (e.g., client application <b>112</b> or third party application <b>116</b>) running on another client machine (e.g., client machine <b>108</b> or mobile device <b>132</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the network-based publisher <b>102</b> provides a multitude of feedback, reputation, aggregation, and listing and price-setting mechanisms whereby a user may be a seller or buyer who lists or buys goods and/or services (e.g., for sale) published on the network-based publisher <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The publication application <b>124</b> may provide a number of publisher functions and services (e.g., listing, payment, etc.) to users that access the network-based publisher <b>102</b>. For example, the publication application(s) <b>124</b> may provide a number of services and functions to users for listing goods and/or services for sale, facilitating transactions, and reviewing and providing feedback about transactions and associated users. It should be noted that the publication application <b>124</b> optionally resides on application server <b>122</b>. The publication application <b>124</b> may also be referred to as an electronic marketplace application. Application server <b>122</b> communicates with other electronic marketplace applications <b>136</b> that reside on other electronic marketplace servers <b>134</b>. Furthermore, application server <b>122</b> communicates with other insurance server(s) <b>132</b> to obtain different insurance underwriters for the shipping insurance policy.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The shipping insurance service application <b>130</b> computes a shipping insurance rate and generates a shipping insurance to a seller of a corresponding electronic marketplace application <b>136</b>, <b>134</b> based on an insurance provider <b>132</b>. In one embodiment, the shipping insurance service application <b>130</b> determines the shipping insurance rate to a seller based on the seller's profile associated with the publication application <b>124</b>, <b>136</b> and optionally from other third party applications (e.g. commercial websites, social networking websites, credit rating websites, and so forth).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Items shipped from a seller to a buyer are thus insured against loss (the buyer does not receive the shipped goods) and/or damages (the buyer receives the shipped goods but they are damaged). Embodiments of the shipping insurance service application <b>130</b> are further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of the shipping insurance service application <b>130</b>. The shipping insurance service application <b>130</b> includes an electronic marketplace platform interface <b>202</b>, a shipping insurance module <b>210</b>, and an insurance provider module <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The electronic marketplace platform interface <b>202</b> communicates with several electronic marketplace applications via a network. In one embodiment, each electronic marketplace application may reside independently on different servers. Each electronic marketplace application has its own platform (e.g. rules, user interface, management, and so forth). As such the electronic marketplace platform interface is capable of communicating with different electronic marketplace platforms, independent from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The shipping insurance module <b>210</b> provides a shipping insurance policy to a seller of the corresponding electronic marketplace application and processes a claim from the seller of the corresponding electronic marketplace application based on the shipping insurance policy.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The insurance provider module <b>212</b> obtains the shipping insurance policy from an insurance provider among a plurality of insurance providers. In particular, the insurance provider module <b>212</b> is capable of interfacing with different insurance provider servers <b>132</b> in order to obtain a variety of insurance rates and to provide a diversity of insurance underwriters. As such, the insurance policy to be generated by the shipping insurance module <b>210</b> is not limited to one specific insurance provider.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The shipping insurance module <b>210</b> includes a dynamic pricing module <b>204</b>, a claim module <b>206</b>, and a fraud module <b>208</b>. The dynamic pricing module <b>204</b> computes the shipping insurance policy rate for the seller. The dynamic pricing module <b>204</b> is described further below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The claim module <b>206</b> processes a claim from the seller. The claim module <b>206</b> is described further below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The fraud module <b>208</b> detects a fraudulent activity associated with the claim from the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The fraud detection module <b>208</b> determines a fraudulent activity from the buyer or the seller related to the shipped item. For example, a fraudulent activity may be determined when the claim from the seller is not validated by the buyer (e.g. the buyer claims that the item was received, the seller claims that the item was received in a damaged condition). Other fraudulent activity may be determined based on a transactional history of the seller and the buyer, the address of the buyer or seller, a credit card associated with other fraudulent activities, a credit card flagged from a financial institution, the number of claims filed by the seller, the number of complaints filed by the buyer, the value of the shipped item, and so forth. If the fraud detection module <b>208</b> suspects that there is a fraudulent activity, the fraud detection module <b>208</b> may pause the claim processing pending further investigation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another embodiment, the shipping insurance service application <b>130</b> includes a shipping label module (not shown) that can generate a shipping label that incorporates the shipping insurance policy information as generated by the shipping insurance module <b>210</b>. For example, once the seller opts to participate in the shipping insurance program, the seller is offered to purchase a shipping label that includes a tracking number associated with the insurance policy number generated by shipping insurance module <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, the shipping label module offers the seller the choice of shipping rates (e.g. express, standard, value). The shipping label module may obtain information (the name and address of the seller and the buyer, dimension of the package, weight of the package, and weight of item) from the publication application <b>124</b>, the database server <b>126</b>, and the database <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of the dynamic pricing module <b>204</b>. A seller profile retriever module <b>310</b> retrieves a seller profile <b>302</b> on the corresponding marketplace application. An insurance pricing generator module <b>312</b> computes the shipping insurance policy rate for the seller based on the profile of the seller in the corresponding electronic marketplace and the insurance provider.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the seller profile <b>302</b> corresponding to an electronic marketplace may be retrieved from database <b>128</b>. In one embodiment, the seller profile <b>302</b> includes the volumes of transactions <b>304</b>, the seller's reputation <b>306</b>, the seller's insurance profile <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The volume of transactions <b>304</b> may include the total number of items sold by the seller in the corresponding electronic marketplace. The volume of transactions <b>304</b> also includes the total sales amount of items sold by the seller in the corresponding electronic marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The seller reputation <b>306</b> may include a feedback rating of the seller, a shipping rating of the seller, and a number of complaints from buyers. For example, the feedback rating includes ratings from buyers who previously purchased from the seller and provided a rating of how satisfied the buyers were with respect to the financial transaction with the seller. The shipping rating illustrates how fast the seller ships the item from the time the order was placed by the corresponding buyer. The number of complaints may include complaints filed by buyers with the electronic marketplace with respect to their financial transactions with the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, the seller profile <b>302</b> may further include other profiles retrieved from other websites such as credit rating agencies, other electronic marketplaces, and so forth. The additional information from other third party websites further enhances the computation of the shipping insurance rate tailored to the seller in particular. For example, a seller with a high credit score and at least a 99% positive feedback rating with a minimum volume of sales from another electronic marketplace will likely be offered a deep discount on the shipping insurance rate. Those of ordinary skills in the art will recognize that other types of ratings may be further provided to enhance the computation of the shipping insurance rate for the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment, the seller profile <b>302</b> includes different tiers of sellers where each tier has a corresponding discount rate. For example, a first tier of sellers includes a 50% discount rate off a base shipping insurance rate, a second tier of sellers includes a 30% discount rate off the base shipping insurance rate, and a third tier of sellers includes a 10% discount rate off the base shipping insurance rate. The first tier of sellers includes sellers meeting several conditions (e.g. a maximum of predefined number of claims previously filed within the last n years, a minimum monetary amount of goods sold and a minimum number of goods sold in the electronic marketplace within a predefined period of time). The second tier of sellers includes sellers meeting the same conditions but with different predefined numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The insurance profile <b>308</b> may include a profile of the seller associated with a corresponding insurance provider. For example, a seller may have two claims pending with one insurance provider and no other claims pending with other insurance providers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The insurance pricing generator module <b>312</b> computes the shipping insurance rate for the seller based on the seller's profile <b>302</b>, the insurance provider, and the selected coverage. In one embodiment, the insurance pricing generator module <b>312</b> computes the shipping insurance rate for the seller using different weights associated with each profile information (volume of transactions <b>304</b>, seller reputation <b>306</b>, insurance profile <b>308</b>). The insurance pricing generator module <b>312</b> may factor in the seller reputation <b>306</b> from other electronic marketplaces.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The shipping insurance policy can be identified with a unique policy number for the transaction. In another embodiment, the policy number may be a unique identifier associated with the seller for all eligible transactions from the seller. The insurance policy may be provided by the online marketplace and underwritten by a financial institution. In one embodiment, the shipping insurance policy is generated based on the value of the shipped good. The seller may have the option to choose the coverage value of the shipping insurance policy.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another embodiment, the dynamic pricing module <b>204</b> may also include a seller shipping insurance eligibility module (not shown) to determine whether a seller is eligible to purchase the shipping insurance based on at least a record of the seller, a shipping-from address, and a shipping-to address. For example, sellers with poor selling records and/or negative feedbacks from buyers may not be eligible to participate in the shipping insurance program. In another example, a destination address (shipping-to) or an origin address (shipping-from) associated with an unusually high number of complaints from buyers or prior claims from sellers may prevent a seller from qualifying to participate in the shipping insurance program. Those of ordinary skills in the art will recognize that other factors (e.g. number of transactions from the seller/buyer, type of goods being shipped, value of the goods being shipped, and so forth . . . ) may be used to determine whether the seller is eligible to participate in the shipping insurance program. Once the seller is determined to be eligible, the seller shipping insurance eligibility module <b>302</b> may present the seller with an offer/option to purchase the shipping insurance program through an online marketplace prior to the seller shipping the goods to the buyer. The seller may choose then whether to participate in the shipping insurance program. In one embodiment, the insurance policy fee to participate in the shipping insurance program may be deducted from the payment from the buyer or may be paid up front by the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of the claim module <b>206</b>. The claim module <b>206</b> may include a claim and complaint receiver module <b>402</b> and a claim processing module <b>404</b>. The claim and complaint receiver module <b>402</b> may receive a claim from the seller based on the shipping insurance policy. The claim and complaint receiver module <b>402</b> may also receives a complaint from the buyer where the complaint is for receiving the item damaged or not receiving the item. The claim processing module <b>404</b> processes the claim from the seller based on the corresponding complaint from the buyer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of the claim and complaint receiver module <b>402</b>. The claim and complaint receiver module <b>402</b> includes a seller claim module <b>502</b> and a buyer complaint module <b>504</b>. The seller claim module <b>502</b> receives the claim from the seller based on the shipping insurance policy. The buyer complaint module <b>504</b> receives the complaint from the buyer based on the shipped item.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The seller claim module <b>502</b> receives a claim from the seller based on the purchased shipping insurance policy. In one embodiment, the claim includes information such as whether the item received by the buyer but was damaged or whether the package was lost, the tracking information, and the claim amount. For example, the seller may receive a communication from the buyer that the goods received were damaged during shipping. In another example, the seller receives a communication from the buyer that the buyer did not receive the package within a predetermined amount of time. Based on the communication from the buyer, the seller may file a claim using the seller claim module <b>502</b>. In one embodiment, the seller claim module <b>502</b> presents the seller with a web page comprising retrieved information from database <b>128</b> associated with the financial transaction between the seller and the buyer. The web page requests further information from the seller such as the reason for filing the claim and the claim amount. Once the claim is filed, the seller may receive a confirmation of the claim via email.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another embodiment, the seller may file a claim only after a predetermined amount of time has elapsed from the time of shipping (e.g. 7 days for damaged item and 30 days for lost item) of the corresponding shipped goods. The seller claim module <b>502</b> may send an email to the buyer to confirm the claim from the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The buyer complaint module <b>504</b> receives the complaint from the buyer based on the item. In one embodiment, the complaint includes information such as whether the received item was damaged or whether the package was lost, and the tracking information. For example, the complaint may specify that the buyer did not receive the package within a predetermined amount of time. In one embodiment, the buyer may file a complaint after a predetermined amount of time has elapsed from the time of shipping (e.g. 30 days). The buyer complaint module <b>504</b> may send an email to both the seller and the buyer to confirm the complaint from the buyer.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example embodiment of the claim processing module <b>404</b>. The claim processing module <b>404</b> includes a claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> and a claim approval and rejection module <b>604</b>. The claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> correlates the claim from the seller with the complaint from the buyer for the shipped item. The claim approval and rejection module <b>604</b> approves or rejects the claim from the seller based on results from the claim and complaint verification module, and the fraud module <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> correlates the claim from the seller with the complaint from the buyer for the shipped item. In one embodiment, the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> determines whether a claim from a seller with respect to a purchased shipping insurance policy on a shipped item corresponds to a complaint from a buyer with respect to the same shipped item. The claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> may compare and correlate a number of information (e.g., tracking number, transaction identifier, item identifier, seller and buyer identity, shipping insurance policy number, claim and complaint reasons and so forth) available from the seller claim module <b>502</b> and the buyer complaint module <b>504</b> to verify that the information correlates and matches before approving or denying the seller's claim. For example, a buyer's complaint may indicate that the item has not been received by the buyer. The seller's claim may indicate that the item has not been received by the buyer. Because both buyer's complaint and seller's claim are consistent with each other, the seller's claim is validated and is likely to be approved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> can determine any inconsistency between the seller's claim and the buyer's claim. For example, the buyer's complaint may indicate that the item was received in a damaged condition while the seller's claim may indicate that the item was not received by the buyer. Because both buyer's complaint and seller's claim are inconsistent and do not validate each other, the seller's claim is not validated and is likely to be denied.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> correlates the claim from the seller with the complaint from the buyer for the shipped item based on the buyer validating the claim from the seller and based on the seller validating the complaint from the buyer. For example, the seller may have submitted a claim with the seller claim module <b>502</b>. If the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> does not find a corresponding complaint from the buyer, the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> contacts the buyer to verify the validity of the claim. In other words, the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> will determine whether the claim from the seller correlates with a reason provided by the buyer in response to contacting the buyer. Thus, the buyer may validate the claim from the seller by responding to the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> that the item was indeed not received or received in a damaged condition as indicated in the claim from the seller. In another embodiment, the buyer has a predetermined amount of time to validate the claim from the seller (e.g. 15 days). If the claim from the seller is not validated within the predetermined amount of time, the claim from the seller may be denied.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In another embodiment, the buyer may have not received the purchased item within a predetermined amount of time or has received the purchased item in a damaged condition; the buyer may then contact the seller directly without filing a complaint with the buyer complaint module <b>504</b>. The seller then files a claim with the seller claim module <b>502</b>. The claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> then contacts both the buyer and seller to validate the claim from the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another embodiment, the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> automatically and without human-intervention files the claim based on the seller failing to lodge the claim within a predetermined period, via an electronic marketplace on which a transaction of the item occurred. For example, a buyer has submitted a complaint to buyer complaint module <b>504</b>. Within a predetermined amount of time, if the seller fails to file a claim corresponding to the buyer's complaint, the claim and complaint verification module <b>502</b> automatically proceeds without human intervention and files a claim on behalf of the seller. In this scenario, proceeds of the pay out from the shipping insurance are kept by the electronic marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The claim approval and rejection module <b>604</b> approves or denies the claim from the seller based on results from the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> and the fraud detection module <b>208</b>. Once the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> validates the seller's claim and the fraud detection module <b>208</b> determines that no fraudulent activities exist, the claim approval and rejection module <b>604</b> proceeds with approving the pay out or refund to the seller. If the claim and complaint verification module <b>602</b> does not validate the seller's claim or the fraud detection module <b>208</b> determines that fraudulent activities exist, the claim approval and rejection module <b>604</b> may deny the claim or payout to the seller.</p>
