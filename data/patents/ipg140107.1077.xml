<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A container includes a body, a panel, and a handle assembly. The body defines a closed volume of the container and further includes at least two opposing walls having a width and longitudinally extending between a first end and a second end of the body. The panel includes an inner surface fixedly secured to the panel to the body. The handle assembly is at least partially disposed within a space created between the panel and the body, the handle assembly having a dispensing aperture, and the handle assembly being slidable within the space. A method of forming a container and a method of dispensing a container are also discussed.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention described herein relates generally to containers having a handle assembly and methods of making and using the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Countless products are packaged and shipped to end-users in this country and around the globe every day. Many materials, e.g., flux material used in welding, are packaged in containers and then shipped to customers. In some circumstances, handling the container, opening the container, controlling flow of material dispensing from the container, and resealing the container is difficult and may result in damaging the container and/or spilling some material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In view of the foregoing problems and shortcomings of handling the containers and controlling the material, the present application describes containers having a handle assembly to overcome these shortcomings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the invention only and not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, show container <b>20</b> having body <b>22</b>, panel <b>24</b> fixedly secured to body <b>22</b>, and handle assembly <b>26</b> having at least one dispensing aperture <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exploded assembly view of container <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. A container is defined to mean any size bag, sack, box, carton, or tote, for example, made from materials discussed below and configured to hold, store, and/or transport a material. In the illustrated embodiments, handle assembly <b>26</b> is partially disposed and slidable within space <b>54</b> formed between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b>. Container <b>20</b> may be used to facilitate handling, storage, and dispensation of material (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>) stored in volume <b>30</b> of body <b>22</b>, e.g., a closed volume. Handle assembly <b>26</b> facilitates handling and carrying of container <b>20</b> while the combination of body <b>22</b>, panel <b>24</b>, and handle assembly <b>26</b> facilitates adjustable dispensation of material from container <b>20</b>. Materials stored in container <b>20</b> may include, but are not limited to, powdered or granular flux material for use in submerged arc welding or other welding processes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In construction, body <b>22</b>, panel <b>24</b>, and handle assembly <b>26</b> may each be formed of at least one of the following materials, including but not limited to single layer or multi-layer paper, plastic, foil plastic laminate, and textile. Body <b>22</b>, panel <b>24</b>, and handle assembly <b>26</b> may be constructed from the same or different material depending on the requirements of the application. The selection of the materials of construction are predicated upon design criteria of the application and include non-limiting factors tear strength, tightness of wear, puncture resistance, etc., to carry and/or retain a material in container <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, one material is a heat-sealable material. A heat-sealable material is defined to mean a material which may be bonded to itself or another material by heat and pressure to form a seal or closure, for example a heat seal or closure against air, moisture, or tampering. The heat seal may be formed by a heat sealing process known in the art, wherein the heat-sealable materials are subjected to temperature and pressure sufficient to form a heat seal. In one example, the temperature may be about 140&#xb0; C. and the pressure may be about 50 pounds per square inch of seal band surface when forming a heat seal in low density polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The heat-sealable material in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> may be a thermoplastic material, but it is envisioned that body <b>22</b>, panel <b>24</b>, and handle assembly <b>26</b> may be constructed of any heat-sealable material known in the art. More specifically, the heat-sealable material may be low density polyethylene. However, it is further envisioned that body <b>22</b>, panel <b>24</b>, and handle assembly <b>26</b> may each be constructed of different heat-sealable materials, e.g., body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b> may be constructed of one heat-sealable material and handle assembly <b>26</b> may be constructed of a different heat-sealable material. Alternatively, the body may comprise a laminate of at least a heat-sealable material and a second material. For example, in an application requiring a moisture impermeable container, the body may comprise an exterior plastic layer which may be optionally heat-sealable, an intermediate metal foil layer which may be moisture impermeable, and an interior heat-sealable material. The body, the panel, and/or the handle assembly may be made of paper and plastic. For example, the handle assembly may be made of paper having ends made of plastic that are connected to the body with an adhesive or are heat sealed to the body. The body, the panel, and the handle assembly may be formed from at least one of the following: any formable plastic material known in the art, including polyethylene, any formable paper material known in the art, including cardboard and/or kraft paper, any formable textile material known in the art, including canvas, and any formable foil plastic laminate material known in the art. A formable material is defined to mean a material that can be shaped into a part or component of the containers claimed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, body <b>22</b> may be formed from at least one piece of material and may include an optional body aperture <b>31</b>. For example, body <b>22</b> may be a unitary structure or a structure made from two or more parts that are attached together by means such as an adhesive, a stitch, or a heat seal. In the illustrated embodiment, body <b>22</b> may further include first end <b>32</b>, second end <b>34</b>, and at least two opposing walls, including first wall <b>36</b> and second wall <b>38</b>, where each wall has width W<b>1</b>. First wall <b>36</b> and second wall <b>38</b> longitudinally extend between first end <b>32</b> and second end <b>34</b> and are joined, e.g., laterally, at first end <b>32</b> and second end <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, body <b>22</b> optionally includes first sidewall <b>40</b> and second sidewall <b>42</b> that longitudinally extend between first end <b>32</b> and second end <b>34</b>. Alternatively, first sidewall and second sidewall are gusseted sidewalls. In one aspect of the invention, the body may not include sidewalls, therefore, the first wall and the second wall may be longitudinally joined to each other by the longitudinal edges of each wall, e.g., joined with a heat seal or an adhesive, including but not limited to a hot melt glue or a water soluble cold glue. In another optional aspect of the invention, the body includes an inlet used to fill the container with material. When the container does not include an inlet, the body is sealed after filling the container with a material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, panel <b>24</b> follows a profile of body <b>22</b> and includes outer surface <b>44</b>, inner surface <b>46</b>, first end <b>48</b>, and second end <b>50</b>. Panel <b>24</b> preferably has a curvilinear length L<b>1</b> that extends around the profile of body <b>22</b>, including second end <b>34</b>. Panel <b>24</b> extends longitudinally toward first end <b>32</b> adjacent to first wall <b>36</b> and second wall <b>38</b>. Panel <b>24</b> has a width W<b>2</b> that spans at least a portion of width W<b>1</b>, e.g., width W<b>2</b> can be one-half, two-thirds, or three-fourths of width W<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) or equal to width W<b>1</b>. The parts of the panel that are positioned adjacent to the first wall and the second wall of the body can be equal or unequal in longitudinal length. In another embodiment, the panel does not extend adjacent to the first wall and/or the second wall, e.g., the panel may only be adjacent to one plane. Alternatively, the panel can extend to the sidewalls. For example, the panel can have the shape of a cap that is securedly attached to the sidewalls of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, panel <b>24</b> is fixedly secured to body <b>22</b> by securing means <b>52</b> in at least two locations and forms space <b>54</b> between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b>. The securing means serves a function of containing handle assembly <b>26</b> within space <b>54</b>. Securing means <b>52</b> may include at least one of the following: adhesives, stitches, snaps, heat seals, edge-bonds, and any of a variety of other suitable mechanical fastening arrangements. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, panel <b>24</b> is fixedly secured to second end <b>34</b> and walls <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> of body <b>22</b> by a hot melt glue applied at least between first end <b>48</b> and second end <b>50</b> of panel <b>24</b> and body <b>22</b>, forming space <b>54</b> that extends at least a portion of width W<b>2</b> of panel <b>24</b>. The first end and the second end of the panel may be at least partially secured to the second end and/or the first and second walls of the body. Alternatively, the panel may be fixedly secured to the body in at least two locations, wherein at least one location is not an end of the panel. In addition, the panel may be releasably connected on one or both ends, therefore, the handle assembly can be releasably inserted in the space between the body and the panel for use in one container and later removed from the container and reused in another container.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The panel may have an alternative shape or side profile, e.g., flat or planar, and is be fixedly secured to at least one part of the body, including but not limited to the first wall, the second wall, the first end, the second end, the first sidewall, and the second sidewall. For example, the panel may be flat and fixedly secured to the first wall of the body by a securing means in at least two locations, forming a space between the panel and the body where the handle assembly is at least partially disposed. Alternatively, the panel may have another shape, including but not limited to a square shape, an hour glass shape, or a combination of shapes known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, panel <b>24</b> optionally includes panel aperture <b>56</b> that may be substantially aligned with body aperture <b>31</b> when panel <b>24</b> is fixedly secured to body <b>22</b>. In other words, if the apertures are similar in size and shape, the apertures may be in a mirrored position relative to one another when the panel is secured to the body. The body aperture and the panel aperture may be at least partially aligned. Alternatively, the panel may include a perforated zone or may include printing or graphics, e.g., &#x201c;puncture here,&#x201d; that can be used by a person to facilitate forming an aperture in the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, handle assembly <b>26</b> is at least partially disposed and slidably received by space <b>54</b> between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b> and longitudinally extends adjacent to opposing sides of body <b>22</b>. Handle assembly <b>26</b> at least partially conforms to a shape of the space <b>54</b> between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b> when it is disposed and slides within space <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, handle assembly <b>26</b> includes opposing ends, and optionally first handle <b>58</b> and second handle <b>60</b>. Handles can be separately formed and attached to the handle assembly or be formed integrally as part of the handle assembly. Optionally, first handle <b>58</b> and second handle <b>60</b> include handle apertures <b>62</b> (shown in ghost lines). Handle assembly <b>26</b> is configured to support the material weight stored in body <b>22</b>, e.g., the weight of welding flux material, and to withstand forces applied to at least one of the opposing ends of handle assembly <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, handle assembly <b>26</b> further includes optional first attachment tab <b>57</b> extending from first handle <b>58</b> and optional second attachment tab <b>59</b> extending from second handle <b>60</b>. The attachment tabs span across at least a portion of the handle assembly. First attachment tab <b>57</b> and second attachment tab <b>59</b> are shown at the time of manufacture connected to body <b>22</b> or in-between use releasably connected to body <b>22</b>. When the attachment tabs and/or the handles are released from the body, a person can adjustably position handle assembly <b>26</b> to carry container <b>20</b> and to dispense material from container <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, first attachment tab <b>57</b> is heat sealed to first end <b>32</b> of body <b>22</b> and second attachment tab <b>59</b> is heat sealed to second wall <b>38</b> of body <b>22</b>. Further, first handle <b>58</b> includes first tear strip <b>64</b> and second handle <b>60</b> includes a second tear strip <b>66</b> that each span laterally across at least a portion of width W<b>3</b> of handle assembly <b>26</b>. The tear strip can take the form of a perforation, string, or strip that may be pulled to separate a handle from the attachment tabs, the body or another part of the container. Therefore, first tear strip <b>64</b> and second tear strip <b>66</b> may be pulled, torn, or cut to release first handle <b>58</b> and second handle <b>60</b>, respectively, from the heat sealed attachment tabs of handle assembly <b>26</b>. In this embodiment, the attachment tabs remain secured to the body after the tear strips release the handles from the body. Alternatively, the attachment tabs may be connected to the body with a releasable adhesive, therefore, the container may not have tear strips. At least one portion of the handle assembly may be alternatively secured to at least one part of the container by connecting means such as, but not limited to, at least one of the following: a heat seal, a perforated seam, a permanent or releasable adhesive, a tear strip, and Velcro.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, at least one of the body, the panel, and the handle assembly may include reinforcements that can provide structural support and that may facilitate maintaining a particular container shape. It will be appreciated that the container, including the body, the panel, and the handle assembly, can be provided in any of a variety of suitable shapes and sizes. The container may also include lifting members, e.g., lifting loops, attached to the body or another part of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another aspect of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the first end of first wall may join directly to the first end of second wall and/or the second end of first wall may join directly to the second end of second wall, i.e., the walls are joined by a heat seal and the container does not include the flat, laterally extending first and second ends illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, a mechanical connection like a stitch or an adhesive, including but not limited to a hot melt glue or a water soluble cold glue, may join the ends of the walls.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another optional aspect of the invention, the handle assembly may be configured as a continuous handle assembly <b>78</b>, <b>79</b> that extends adjacent a perimeter of the body. The continuous handle assembly may have a unitary construction, e.g., a continuous loop, or may be joined together in at least one location, e.g., heat sealed in at least one location to form a continuous handle assembly. The continuous handle assembly includes handles that can be separately formed and attached to the handle assembly or be formed integrally as part of the handle assembly. Optionally, the continuous handle assembly includes at least one dispensing aperture that can be preformed or formed just prior to use of the container. When assembled with the container, the continuous handle assembly extends around the perimeter of the body, including within the space between the body and the first panel (discussed above) and optionally within another space formed between the body and the optional second panel. For example, the optional second panel may be securedly attached to an opposing side of the container relative to the first panel. Further, at least one panel optionally includes a handle that facilitates keeping the container in a desired position when carrying or dispensing the container.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a cross-section view of container <b>20</b> taken along section <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> having handle assembly <b>26</b> disposed in space <b>54</b> between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b>, where first handle <b>58</b> and second handle <b>60</b> are detached from container <b>20</b> and held by a person (not shown) to facilitate transporting container <b>20</b> from one location to another. For dispensing, a user slidably moves handle assembly <b>26</b> and consequently dispensing aperture <b>28</b> to a position between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b> where the user desires material to be dispensed from container <b>20</b>. For example, opening <b>68</b> for dispensing material <b>70</b> from container <b>20</b> forms when there is at least partial alignment or overlap of dispensing aperture <b>28</b>, body aperture <b>31</b>, and panel aperture <b>56</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, apertures <b>28</b>, <b>31</b>, and <b>56</b> are substantially aligned and material <b>70</b> dispenses from container <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Dispensing aperture <b>28</b> is slidable relative to body aperture <b>31</b> and panel aperture <b>56</b>, making the opening adjustable between one or more closed positions and one or more opened positions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>). In the closed position, e.g., the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, dispensing aperture <b>28</b> does not align or overlap with the other apertures, therefore, handle assembly <b>26</b> substantially prevents dispensation of the material through body aperture <b>31</b> and panel aperture <b>56</b>. In the open position, e.g., the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, dispensing aperture <b>28</b> can facilitate dispensation of material <b>70</b> sequentially through body aperture <b>31</b>, dispensing aperture <b>28</b>, and panel aperture <b>56</b>. Slidable alignment of these apertures facilitates an infinitely variable rate of flow or dispensation of material <b>70</b> from container <b>20</b>. In other words, the greater the alignment, the greater the flow. Alternatively, the dispensing aperture can be slidable among a plurality of predetermined positions or stops, each of which corresponds to a particular flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Optionally, first handle <b>58</b> and/or second handle <b>60</b> may be substantially aligned with indicator <b>67</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) marked on container <b>20</b> so a person holding container <b>20</b> knows a characteristic of the opening. For example, indicator <b>67</b> may specify that the position of the handles create an opening that is 50%, 75%, or 100% of a specified opening size or 50%, 75%, or 100% of a specified dispensing rate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, handles <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> have a thickness T<b>1</b>, each handle thickness is configured so handle assembly <b>26</b> may be partially disposed in space <b>54</b> and slidably adjusted between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b>. A handle is defined to be any part of the handle assembly that a person can hold to facilitate movement of the handle assembly. In the illustrated embodiment, handles <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> and region <b>61</b> between the handles have thicknesses that are less than distance D<b>1</b> of space <b>54</b> between body <b>22</b> and panel <b>24</b>. For example, the thicknesses of the handles and the region between the handles can be any combination of thicknesses, including but not limited to equal or unequal thicknesses, where the thicknesses are less than the distance of the space between the body and the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, at least one handle or at least a portion of the region between the handles may have a thickness that is greater than the distance of the space between the panel and the body, therefore, movement of the handle assembly within the space may be limited. For example, the second handle may have a thickness that is slightly greater than the distance of the space, therefore, the second handle will not slidably move into the space. In addition, the thicknesses of the handles may be configured so that at least one handle may be partially disposed in the space between the body and the panel for storage purposes in-between uses of the container. The handle assembly may include a means for preventing at least one handle from passing into the space between the panel and the body, including: a spacer that limits movement of the handle assembly in the space between the body and the panel, the handle assembly may include a frictional material on at least one section that at least partially prevents movement between the handle assembly and the body and/or the panel, and at least one of the handles may include a non-planar shape, e.g., a corrugated shape that limits the handle assembly movement in the space between the body and the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>, the container discussed herein may be adjustably opened and closed by at least partially aligning dispensing aperture <b>28</b> with body aperture <b>31</b> and/or panel aperture (the panel and the panel aperture are not shown for convenience of illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, body <b>22</b> includes body aperture <b>31</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, dispensing aperture <b>28</b> is shown partially aligned with body aperture <b>31</b> and forms opening <b>68</b> (indicated by the shaded overlap) in container <b>20</b>. Further, dispensing aperture <b>28</b> and body aperture <b>31</b> are illustrated as having a greater partial alignment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, forming a larger opening <b>68</b> (relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in container <b>20</b>. Therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref> illustrate an example of how handle assembly <b>26</b> can adjustably move relative to body <b>22</b> and the panel to form opening <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Dispensing aperture <b>28</b>, body aperture <b>31</b>, and panel aperture <b>56</b> can be configured to have alternative shapes, sizes, quantities, and/or patterns in various combinations. An aperture may be formed at the time of manufacture or subsequently, such as at the time of initial dispensing, to allow passage of material therethrough. Apertures may be fully formed or partially formed regions to facilitate later forming. At least one of the apertures may have at least one of the following shapes: triangular, circular, oval, square, rectangular, and other shapes known in the art. The dispensing aperture, the body aperture, and/or the panel aperture may include more than one aperture, have apertures of another size than what is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, and/or have apertures with a pattern. For example, the handle assembly may have a group of apertures that include a pattern that ranges from a sparse pattern of apertures to a dense pattern of apertures. Optionally, the aperture(s) may further include a covering affixed about the aperture(s) by a pressure-sensitive adhesive. The pressure sensitive patch protects the aperture and may also be used to releasably secure one part of the container to another, e.g., a pressure sensitive patch protecting the dispensing aperture may be releasably secured to a perimeter of the handle assembly defining the dispensing aperture and the body to prevent movement therebetween.</p>
