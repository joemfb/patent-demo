<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to integrated circuits and, more particularly, to integrated circuits for detecting and communicating a speed of rotation and direction of rotation of a ferromagnetic object.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Proximity detectors for detecting ferromagnetic objects are known. In proximity detectors, the magnetic field associated with the ferromagnetic is detected by a magnetic field-to-voltage transducer (also referred to herein as a magnetic field sensing element), such as a Hall effect element or a magnetoresistance element, which provides a signal (i.e., a magnetic field signal) proportional to a detected magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some proximity detectors merely provide an output signal representative of the proximity of the ferromagnetic object. However, other proximity detectors, i.e., rotation detectors, provide an output signal representative of the approach and retreat of each tooth of a rotating ferromagnetic gear or of each segment of a segmented ring magnet having segments with alternating polarity. The proximity detector (rotation detector) processes the magnetic field signal to generate an output signal that changes state each time the magnetic field signal either reaches a peak (positive or negative peak) or crosses a threshold level. Therefore, the output signal, which has an edge rate or period, is indicative of a rotation and a speed of rotation of the ferromagnetic gear or of the ring magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one type of proximity detector (rotation detector), sometimes referred to as a peak-to-peak percentage detector (or threshold detector), a threshold level is equal to a percentage of the peak-to-peak magnetic field signal. For this type of proximity detector (rotation detector), the output signal changes state when the magnetic field signal crosses the threshold level. One such peak-to-peak percentage detector is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,917,320 entitled &#x201c;Detection of Passing Magnetic Articles While Periodically Adapting Detection Threshold&#x201d; assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another type of proximity detector (rotation detector), sometimes referred to as a slope-activated detector or as a peak-referenced detector (or peak detector), threshold levels differ from the positive and negative peaks (i.e., the peaks and valleys) of the magnetic field signal by a predetermined amount. Thus, in this type of proximity detector (rotation detector), the output signal changes state when the magnetic field signal departs from a peak and/or valley by the predetermined amount. One such slope-activated detector is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,091,239 entitled &#x201c;Detection Of Passing Magnetic Articles With a Peak Referenced Threshold Detector.&#x201d; which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. Another such peak-referenced proximity detector is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,693,419, entitled &#x201c;Proximity Detector,&#x201d; which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. Another such peak-referenced proximity detector is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,199,579, entitled &#x201c;Proximity Detector,&#x201d; which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It should be understood that, because the above-described peak-to-peak percentage detector (threshold detector) and the above-described peak-referenced detector (peak detector) both have circuitry that can identify the positive and negative peaks of a magnetic field signal, the peak-to-peak percentage detector and the peak-referenced detector both include a peak detector circuit adapted to detect a positive peak and a negative peak of the magnetic field signal. Each, however, uses the detected peaks in different ways.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to accurately detect the positive and negative peaks of a magnetic field signal, some proximity detectors, i.e., rotation detectors, are capable of tracking at least part of the magnetic field signal. To this end, typically, one or more digital-to-analog converters (DACs) can be used to generate a tracking signal, which tracks the magnetic field signal. For example, in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,917,320 and 6,091,239, two DACs are used, one (PDAC) to detect the positive peaks of the magnetic field signal and the other (NDAC) to detect the negative peaks of the magnetic field signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some proximity detectors are configured to be able to identify a vibration, for example, either a rotational vibration or a linear vibration of a gear or ring magnet, which vibration can generate signals from a magnetic field sensing element (magnetic field signals) that might appear similar to signals that would be generated during a rotation of the gear or ring magnet in normal operation. Proximity detectors having vibration processors that can detect a vibration are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/942,577, filed Sep. 16, 2004, entitled &#x201c;Methods and Apparatus for Vibration Detection,&#x201d; and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/085,648, filed Mar. 21, 2005, entitled &#x201c;Proximity Detector Having a Sequential Flow State Machine,&#x201d; both of which are assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, an output signal generated by a conventional proximity detector used to detect a rotation of a ferromagnetic object (e.g., a ring magnet or a ferromagnetic gear) can have a format indicative of the rotation and of the speed of rotation of the ferromagnetic object or ring magnet. Namely, the conventional proximity detector can generate the output signal as a two-state binary signal having a frequency indicative of the speed of rotation. When the ferromagnetic object is not rotating, the conventional proximity detector can generate an inactive output signal. However the output signal generated by most conventional proximity detectors is not indicative of a direction of rotation of the ferromagnetic object.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Before describing the present invention, some introductory concepts and terminology are explained. As used herein, the term &#x201c;rotation detector&#x201d; is used to describe a circuit that includes a &#x201c;magnetic field sensing element,&#x201d; which detects a magnetic field. The rotation detector can sense movement, i.e., rotation, of a ferromagnetic object, for example, advance and retreat of magnetic domains of a ring magnet or advance and retreat of gear teeth of a ferromagnetic gear. The term &#x201c;proximity detector&#x201d; is used more broadly herein, to include rotation detectors, and also to include other circuits that merely detect proximity of a magnetic object.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">While magnetic field sensing elements are shown and described below to be Hall effect elements, in other arrangements, the magnetic field sensing elements can be, but are not limited to, Hall effect elements, magnetoresistance elements, magnetotransistors, or magnetoinductive devices. As is known, there are different types of Hall effect elements, for example, a planar Hall element, and a vertical Hall element. As is also known, there are different types of magnetoresistance elements, for example, a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) element, an anisotropic magnetoresistance element (AMR), a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) element, and a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary rotation detector <b>10</b> can be used, for example, to detect passing gear teeth, for example, gear teeth <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>c </i>of a ferromagnetic gear <b>12</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a permanent magnet (not shown) can be placed at a variety of positions proximate to the gear <b>12</b>, resulting in fluctuations of a magnetic field proximate to the gear <b>12</b> as the gear <b>12</b> having the gear teeth <b>12</b><i>a</i>-<b>12</b><i>c </i>rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rotation detector <b>10</b> can have a first port <b>14</b> coupled to a power supply denoted as Vcc. The rotation detector <b>10</b> can also have a second port <b>16</b> coupled to a fixed voltage source, for example, a ground voltage source, denoted as GND. Thus, is some arrangements, the rotation detector <b>10</b> is a two port device, for which an output signal appears as a signal current at the first port <b>14</b>, superimposed upon the power supply voltage, Vcc. However, in other arrangements, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a rotation detector similar to the rotation detector <b>10</b> can have a third port (not shown) at which an output signal can appear as a voltage rather than a current.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rotation detector <b>10</b> can include first, second, and third magnetic field sensing elements <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, respectively, here shown to be Hall effect elements. The first Hall effect element <b>18</b> generates a first differential voltage signal <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, the second Hall effect element generates a second differential voltage signal <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, and the third Hall effect element <b>22</b> generates a third differential voltage signal <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, each having an AC signal component in response to the rotating gear <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While each one of the Hall effect elements <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is shown to be a two port device, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that each one of the Hall effect elements <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is actually a four port device and the other two ports of the Hall effect elements can be coupled to receive and pass respective currents as might be provided, for example, by respective current sources or a voltage source (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first differential voltage signal <b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b </i>is received by a first differential preamplifier <b>30</b><i>a</i>, the second differential voltage signal <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>is received by a second differential preamplifier <b>30</b><i>b</i>, and the third differential voltage signal <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>is received by a third differential preamplifier <b>30</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First and second output signals <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>generated by the first and second differential preamplifiers <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are received by a &#x201c;right&#x201d; channel amplifier <b>34</b><i>a </i>and the second output signal <b>32</b><i>b </i>and a third output signals <b>32</b><i>c </i>generated by the second and third differential preamplifiers <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, respectively, are received by a &#x201c;left&#x201d; channel amplifier <b>34</b><i>b</i>. Designations of &#x201c;right&#x201d; and &#x201c;left&#x201d; are arbitrary but are generally indicative of rotation of the gear <b>12</b> in first and second directions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A signal <b>38</b><i>a </i>generated by the right channel amplifier <b>34</b><i>a </i>is received by a right channel detector circuit <b>36</b><i>a </i>and a signal <b>38</b><i>b </i>generated by the left channel amplifier <b>34</b><i>b </i>is received by a left channel detector circuit <b>36</b><i>b</i>. The signals <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>can be analog signals, generally sinusoidal in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Taking the right channel detector circuit <b>36</b><i>a </i>as representative of both of the detector circuits <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, the right channel detector circuit <b>36</b><i>a </i>includes a peak detector circuit <b>40</b><i>a </i>coupled to receive the signal <b>38</b><i>a</i>. The peak detector circuit <b>40</b><i>a </i>is configured to detect positive and negative peaks of the signal <b>38</b><i>a </i>and to generate the threshold signal <b>42</b><i>a </i>that, for example, takes on a first static threshold value just below a positive peak of the signal <b>38</b><i>a </i>or a second static threshold value just above a negative peak of the signal <b>38</b><i>a</i>, depending upon a direction of transition of the signal <b>38</b><i>a</i>. A comparator <b>44</b><i>a </i>is coupled to receive the threshold signal <b>42</b><i>a </i>and is also coupled to receive the signal <b>38</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the comparator <b>44</b><i>a </i>generates a binary signal <b>46</b><i>a </i>that has transitions when the signal <b>38</b><i>a </i>crosses both the first and second static thresholds, near to a time when the signal <b>38</b><i>a </i>achieves positive and negative peaks.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A signal <b>46</b><i>b </i>generated by the left channel detector circuit <b>36</b><i>b </i>is generated in the same way as the signal <b>46</b><i>a</i>. However, since the magnetic field sensing elements <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> contribute to the signal <b>46</b><i>a</i>, while the magnetic field sensing elements <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> contribute to the signal <b>46</b><i>b</i>, it should be appreciated that the signals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>have edges that differ in time (which is equivalent to phase for a particular signal frequency, i.e., particular rotation speed). Furthermore, it should be appreciated that a direction of rotation of the gear <b>12</b> may be determined from a relative phase or relative time difference (e.g., lag or lead) of a particular edge transition in the signal <b>46</b><i>a </i>compared with a particular corresponding edge transition in the signal <b>46</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, a relative lag or a lead of edges of the signals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>can be used to identify a direction of rotation of the gear <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The rotation detector <b>10</b> can include an output protocol circuit <b>48</b> coupled to receive and process the signals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>and configured to generate an output signal <b>52</b> as a current signal, which is indicative of the speed of rotation and the direction of rotation of the gear <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the rotation detector <b>10</b> is shown to include the detector circuits <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>, each having a particular topology, it should be understood that any form of peak-referenced detectors or peak-to-peak percentage detectors, including, but not limited to, the above-described peak-referenced detectors and peak-to-peak percentage detectors, can be used in place of or in addition to the detector circuits <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a graph has a horizontal axis in units of time in arbitrary units. A curve <b>60</b> is representative of one of the signals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>received by the output protocol circuit <b>48</b>. The curve <b>60</b> represents a binary (two-state) signal, having positive transitions <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<b>62</b><i>c </i>at times trise<b>1</b>, trise<b>2</b>, and trise<b>3</b>, respectively, and negative transitions <b>64</b><i>a</i>-<b>64</b><i>c </i>at times tfall<b>1</b>, tfall<b>2</b>, and tfall<b>3</b>, respectively, when the gear <b>12</b> is rotating at a rotational speed proportional to a frequency of the signal <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The signal <b>60</b> encounters reversals of direction of rotation of the gear <b>12</b> at times trev<b>1</b> and trev<b>2</b>. Prior to the time trev<b>1</b>, the gear <b>12</b> is rotating in a first direction. Between times trev<b>1</b> and trev<b>2</b>, the gear <b>12</b> is rotating in a second different direction. After the time trev<b>2</b>, the gear is again rotating in the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A curve <b>66</b>, representative of the other one of the signals <b>46</b><i>a</i>, <b>46</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, has generally the same shape and transitions as the signal <b>60</b> but has a phase either leading or lagging the phase of the signal <b>60</b> according to the direction of rotation of the gear <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, transitions of the signal <b>66</b> lead the signal <b>60</b> prior to the time trev<b>1</b>, transitions of the signal <b>66</b> lag the signal <b>60</b> between the times trev<b>1</b> and trev<b>2</b>, and transitions of the signal <b>66</b> again lead transitions of the signal <b>60</b> after the time trev<b>2</b>. The curve <b>66</b> is shown with a small vertical offset from the signal <b>60</b> for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A curve <b>70</b> is representative of the output signal <b>52</b> generated by a first embodiment of the output protocol circuit <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which embodiment is further described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The output signal <b>70</b> has pulses <b>72</b><i>a</i>-<b>72</b><i>c </i>and <b>76</b>. The pulses <b>72</b><i>a</i>-<b>72</b><i>c </i>have rising leading edges <b>74</b><i>a</i>-<b>74</b><i>c</i>. The pulse <b>76</b> has a falling leading edge <b>78</b>. It will be understood that the output signal <b>70</b> has a plurality of pulses, each one of the plurality of pulses having a leading edge with a transition direction indicative of the direction of rotation. Thus, between times trev<b>1</b> and trev<b>2</b>, the leading edge of the pulse <b>76</b> is a falling leading edge and at other times, the leading edges of the pulses <b>72</b><i>a</i>-<b>72</b><i>c </i>are rising leading edges. However, pulses with the opposite leading edge directions are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pulse&#x201d; is used to describe a portion of a binary signal, wherein a width of the pulse is less than about fifty percent of a period of the binary signal. Therefore, it will be understood that a pulse is a brief excursion of a signal from one signal value to another signal value.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At a time trise<b>2</b>, during a time period between times trev<b>1</b> and trev<b>2</b> when the direction has changed to reverse, the pulse width of the high state changes from the width of the pulses <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>72</b><i>b </i>to be longer, having a length depending on speed of rotation. As a result, the output protocol circuit <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can identify that the direction of rotation has changed. The rising edge at the time trise<b>2</b> still conveys the edge information, but the expected high state time duration changed because the direction changed. Also, at time trise<b>3</b>, the falling edge of the signal <b>70</b> conveys the edge position, but the expected low state time duration changed, indicating that the direction of rotation changed again.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the signal <b>70</b>, the pulses are inverted in the reverse direction of rotation. For example, if the pulses, e.g., <b>72</b><i>a</i>, <b>72</b><i>b</i>, have forty-five millisecond high states (pulse widths) when the direction of rotation is forward, when the direction of rotation is in reverse, the pulses, e.g., the pulse <b>78</b>, have forty-five millisecond low states (pulse widths). As speed varies in the forward direction, the high state of the pulses (pulse width) remains forty-five milliseconds, and as speed varies in the reverse direction, the low state (pulse width) of the pulses remains forty-five milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A curve <b>80</b> is representative of the output signal <b>52</b> generated by a second embodiment of the output protocol circuit <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which embodiment is further described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The output signal <b>80</b> has pulses <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<b>82</b><i>d</i>, each of which is referred to herein as an &#x201c;instance&#x201d; having one pulse. The output signal <b>80</b> also has pulses <b>86</b><i>aa</i>, <b>86</b><i>ab</i>, <b>86</b><i>ba</i>, <b>86</b><i>bb</i>, which appear in double pulse groups <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>b</i>, and each double pulse group <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>b </i>is referred to here as an instance having two pulses. All of the pulses <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<b>82</b><i>d</i>, <b>86</b><i>aa</i>, <b>86</b><i>ab</i>, <b>86</b><i>ba</i>, <b>86</b><i>bb </i>have rising leading edges <b>84</b><i>a</i>-<b>84</b><i>d</i>, <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<b>88</b><i>d</i>, respectively. It will be understood that the output signal <b>80</b> has a first number of pulses (i.e. one pulse, e.g., the pulse <b>82</b><i>a</i>) occurring in instances (e.g., <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>) of the first number of pulses when the ferromagnetic object (e.g., gear <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is rotating in a first direction, and a second different number of pulses (i.e., two pulses, e.g., the pulses <b>86</b><i>aa</i>, <b>86</b><i>ab</i>) occurring in instances (e.g., <b>86</b><i>a</i>, <b>86</b><i>b</i>) of the second number of pulses when the ferromagnetic object (e.g., gear <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is rotating in a second different direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While one pulse (e.g., <b>82</b><i>a</i>) is shown to be representative of a first direction of rotation, and two pulses (e.g., <b>86</b><i>aa</i>, <b>86</b><i>ab</i>) are shown to be representative of a second different direction of rotation, other numbers of pulses can also be used, so long as there are different numbers of pulses representative of each respective direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Also, while the single pulses (e.g., <b>82</b><i>a</i>) and the multiple pulses (e.g., <b>86</b><i>aa</i>, <b>86</b><i>ab</i>) are shown to have leading edge transitions in the same positive direction, in other arrangements, the leading edge transitions of the single pulses <b>82</b><i>a</i>-<b>82</b><i>d </i>can be in a direction opposite from the leading edge transitions of the multiple pulses <b>88</b><i>aa</i>-<b>88</b><i>ab </i>and <b>86</b><i>ba</i>-<b>8</b><i>bb. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A curve <b>90</b> is representative of the output signal <b>52</b> generated by a third embodiment of the output protocol circuit <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which embodiment is further described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The curve <b>90</b> is shown in conjunction with a vertical amplitude scale of signal currents represented by lines <b>92</b><i>a</i>, <b>92</b><i>b</i>, <b>92</b><i>c</i>. The line <b>92</b><i>a </i>is indicative of a signal current of about four to eight milliamps, the line <b>92</b><i>b </i>is indicative of a signal current of about twelve to sixteen milliamps, and the line <b>92</b><i>c </i>is indicative of a signal current of about twenty to twenty-six milliamps. It should be appreciated that the indicated current ranges are illustrative only and that other current ranges can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The output signal <b>90</b> has pulses <b>94</b><i>a</i>-<b>94</b><i>d </i>with a first amplitude between currents represented by the lines <b>92</b><i>b </i>and <b>92</b><i>c</i>. The output signal <b>90</b> also has pulses <b>98</b><i>a</i>, <b>98</b><i>b </i>with a second different amplitude above a current represented by the line <b>92</b><i>c</i>. All of the pulses <b>94</b><i>a</i>-<b>94</b><i>d</i>, <b>98</b><i>a</i>, <b>98</b><i>b </i>have rising leading edges <b>96</b><i>a</i>-<b>96</b><i>d</i>, <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In some embodiments, at times when pulses are not present, for example, at a baseline signal level <b>98</b>, the signal <b>90</b> can take on a third different amplitude above a current represented by the line <b>92</b><i>a</i>, but below a current represented by the line <b>92</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be understood that the output signal <b>90</b> has a plurality of pulses <b>94</b><i>a</i>-<b>94</b><i>d</i>, <b>98</b><i>a</i>, <b>98</b><i>b</i>, each one of the plurality of pulses having a respective pulse amplitude selected from among a first pulse amplitude (e.g., the pulse <b>94</b><i>a</i>) and a second different pulse amplitude (e.g., the pulse <b>98</b><i>a</i>), wherein the first and second pulse amplitudes are indicative of respective directions of rotation of the ferromagnetic object (e.g., gear <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A curve <b>110</b> is representative of the output signal <b>52</b> generated by a fourth embodiment of the output protocol circuit <b>48</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which embodiment is further described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The output signal <b>110</b> has pulses <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>and <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>b</i>. The pulses <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>d </i>have rising leading edges <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>d</i>, respectively. The pulses <b>116</b><i>a</i>-<b>116</b><i>b </i>have falling leading edges <b>118</b><i>a</i>-<b>118</b><i>b</i>, respectively.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">An exclusive OR gate <b>362</b> is coupled to receive the pulse signal <b>360</b> and to receive the direction signal <b>172</b> and configured to generate an output signal <b>364</b>. In operation, the output signal <b>364</b> generated by the exclusive OR gate <b>362</b>, which is a voltage signal, appears similar to the signal <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is described above to be a current signal.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The voltage signal <b>364</b> is converted to a current signal <b>366</b><i>b </i>by a switch <b>372</b> in combination with a current source <b>368</b>. The switch <b>372</b> has an input node <b>374</b>, a control node <b>376</b>, and an output node <b>380</b>. The current source <b>368</b> has an input node <b>367</b> coupled to the node <b>352</b> and an output node <b>370</b> coupled to the input node <b>374</b> of the switch <b>372</b>. A current signal <b>371</b> (and <b>366</b><i>b</i>) having a positive current value passes from the output node <b>370</b> of the current source <b>368</b> to the input node <b>374</b> of the switch <b>372</b> only when the switch <b>372</b> is closed, otherwise the current signal <b>371</b> (and <b>366</b><i>b</i>) has a current value of zero. The switch <b>372</b> is coupled to receive the voltage signal <b>364</b> at the control node <b>376</b>, and therefore, the switch <b>372</b> is configured to open and close in accordance with states of the signal <b>364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In operation, when the direction signal <b>172</b> is in a low state indicative of a first direction of rotation, pulses in the pulse signal <b>360</b> pass through the exclusive OR gate <b>362</b> and appear in the current signals <b>371</b>, <b>366</b><i>a</i>, and <b>366</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, when the direction signal <b>172</b> is in a high state indicative of a second different direction of rotation, pulses in the pulse signal <b>360</b> are inverted by the exclusive OR gate <b>362</b> and appear inverted in the current signals <b>371</b>, <b>366</b><i>a</i>, and <b>366</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the current signals, <b>366</b><i>a</i>, <b>366</b><i>b </i>are the same as or similar to the signal <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It will be apparent that the current signal <b>366</b><i>a </i>can include an Icc current component as shown, which can result in the current signal <b>366</b><i>a </i>being offset from the current signal <b>366</b><i>b</i>. The Icc current component can be a current signal corresponding to a DC current used to power other portions of the circuit <b>350</b>. However, in other embodiments, the current signal <b>366</b><i>a </i>can be further offset in a positive or in a negative direction by use of another current source or current sink in parallel with the Icc current signal.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">While the circuits shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> show particular circuit topologies that can generate the output signals shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which are indicative of a speed of rotation and a direction of rotation of a ferromagnetic object capable of rotating, it should be appreciated that other circuits can be used to generate any of the output signals of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, any of the voltage signal portions (e.g., the circuit <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but without the current source <b>196</b> and the switch <b>204</b>) of the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> can be replaced with a programmable microprocessor or the like.</p>
