<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Compositions and processed for their use as additives for reducing the sulfur content of FCC gasoline employ a support material having deposited on its surface (a) a first metal component from Group IIB of the Periodic Table and (b) a second metal component from Group III or Group IV of the Periodic Table. The additive composition is preferably made of a montmorillonite clay support containing zinc and gallium, zinc and zirconium. Alternatively, the additive composition includes support material having deposited on its surface a metal component from Group III of the Periodic Table, preferably a montmorillonite clay support containing gallium. The clay is impregnated with the metal(s) using the known incipient wetness method and the dried powdered additive composition is preferably formed into shapes suitable for use in the FCC unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to the reduction of sulfur in gasoline produced in a fluid catalytic cracking process and, more particularly, to a method and composition for use in the fluid catalytic cracking process using a sulfur reduction additive composition.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is the largest refining process used for gasoline production with global capacity of more than 14.2 million barrels per day. The process converts heavy feedstocks such as vacuum distillates, residues, and deasphalted oil into lighter products, which are rich in olefins and aromatics. FCC catalysts are typically solid acids of fine-particles especially zeolites (synthetic Y-faujasite), aluminum silicate, treated clay (kaolin), bauxite, and silica-alumina. The zeolite content in commercial FCC catalysts is generally in the range of 5-40 weight %, or greater, while the balance is silica-alumina amorphous matrix. Additives to the FCC process usually amount to no more than 10% of the catalyst, and they are basically used to enhance octane, as metal passivators, SO<sub>x </sub>reducing agents, CO oxidation and, recently, for gasoline sulfur reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Stringent environmental regulations that target the reduction of the sulfur content of automobile gasoline and tailpipe emissions are being enforced worldwide. Sulfur in gasoline increases SO<sub>x </sub>emissions in combustion gases, reduces the activity of vehicle catalytic converters, and promotes corrosion of engine parts. The upper limit of sulfur in gasoline in the United States and the European Union has been set at 10 parts per million (ppm) as a refinery average, and many other countries have also decreased the permitted sulfur specifications in transportation fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A number of options are available for the reduction of sulfur in gasoline. The main options are hydrotreating the FCC feed, hydrotreating product naphtha, lowering the end boiling point of FCC gasoline, and the use of sulfur-reducing additives in FCC catalysts. The first two options are highly capital intensive. A disadvantage regarding the third option is that the lowering of end boiling point will also reduce the octane number, in addition to reducing the yield of gasoline. From an economic point of view, the last option is the most desirable since this will selectively desulfurize the gasoline fraction without the need for additional treatment. It has been reported that sulfur reduction by FCC additives or catalysts offers economic advantages over the standard solution-selective gasoline hydrotreating or hydrodesulfurization methods.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various catalytic materials for effecting a sulfur reduction have been developed for use during the FCC process. The sulfur reduction component may be a separate additive to the FCC catalyst or part of an FCC sulfur reduction catalyst. However, the levels of sulfur in gasoline are still not low enough to meet current and proposed regulatory requirements and, accordingly, are unacceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Catalyst additives for the reduction of sulfur in FCC gasoline products were proposed by Wormbecher in U.S. Pat. No. 5,376,608 and Kim in U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,210, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference, using a cracking catalyst additive of an alumina-supported Lewis acid for the production of reduced-sulfur gasoline. It was also disclosed that the Lewis acid may comprise components and compounds including Zn, Cu, Ni, Ag, Cd and Ga deposited on aluminum oxide. However, this system has not achieved significant commercial success.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another composition is that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,036,847 to Ziebarth et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, used 10 weight % of a mixture including particles of Zn supported on alumina and titania particles as an additive in the cracking of 2.7 weight % sulfur vacuum gas oil (VGO) feed. The results indicated that the combination of alumina-supported Lewis acid component and titania-containing component resulted in greater sulfur reduction than the use of either component alone.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Myrstad et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,497,811, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, disclosed a composition of a hydrotalcite material impregnated with a Lewis acid, and optionally an FCC-catalyst, as a sulfur-reducing additive. The Lewis acid included transition metals elements and compounds, including Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe and Mn.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another additive disclosed by Roberie et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,315, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a composition comprising vanadium supported on a refractory inorganic oxide. When using 2 weight % vanadium-containing additive, a 33% reduction in gasoline sulfur was reported.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various papers, published by Andersson, P. et al., Catalysis Today 53:565 (1991), Beltran F. et al, <i>Applied Catalysis Environmental </i>34:137 (2001) and 42: 145 (2003), relate in only a very general manner to the concept of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Notwithstanding the reported sulfur-reducing catalysts, there remains a need for effective and economical catalysts for reducing sulfur from gasoline in a commercially sustainable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sulfur-reducing composition and a method for the use of same which provides a gasoline with a significantly lower sulfur level, when compared to the sulfur reduction activity of a conventionally used FCC catalyst in the FCC process.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention provides additive compositions for reducing the sulfur content of FCC gasoline and processes using the compositions. In one aspect of the present invention, the sulfur reduction additive composition comprises a support material having deposited on its surface (a) a first metal component from Group IIB of the Periodic Table and (b) a second metal component from Group III or Group IV of the Periodic Table. The composition is most preferably made of a montmorillonite clay support on which zinc and gallium or zinc and zirconium are impregnated.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, the composition comprises a support material having deposited on its surface a metal component from Group III of the Periodic Table. The composition is most preferably made of a montmorillonite clay support on which only gallium is impregnated.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the support material is an amorphous or inorganic oxide such as, for example, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, clays, or mixtures thereof. In certain preferred embodiments, the support material is montmorillonite clay.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The metal or metals are impregnated or dispersed on the surface of the clay particles by any suitable conventional process, e.g., the incipient wetness method.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sulfur reduction additive composition is used as a separate additive in combination with the conventional fluid catalytic cracking catalyst, which is normally a faujasite, such as zeolite Y, to crack hydrocarbon feeds in the FCC unit to produce low-sulfur gasoline and other liquid cracking products.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with the present invention, the sulfur content of an FCC gasoline is reduced to lower levels by the use of the additive composition of the invention mixed with a conventional FCC catalyst. The FCC catalyst is preferably made of powder and generally possesses an average particle size in the range of 50-100 microns and a bulk density in the range of 0.5-1.0 kg/L. It is preferred that the particle size, density, shape and mechanical strength of the catalyst additive composition of the present invention is the same as a conventional FCC catalyst in which the composition is to be physically mixed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The support material of the additive compositions of the present invention is preferably a montmorillonite clay possessing a surface area in the range of 150-350 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Clay material itself possesses considerable capacity to reduce sulfur in gasoline fraction. However, the reduction in the benzothiophene fraction is typically minimal. It was observed that the impregnation of only a Lewis acid component onto the clay did not significantly increase either overall sulfur reduction capacity or the reduction of benzothiophene.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It was also observed that use of an additive composition of the clay material that was impregnated with zinc and a metal from Group III of the Periodic Table, such as Ga, or Group IV, such as Zr, did further reduce the sulfur content of the gasoline fraction which was catalytically cracked in the FCC unit. The clay material undergoes a drying step to produce shaped bodies suitable for use in the reduction of sulfur from gasoline and it can also be used alone as the gasoline sulfur reduction additive composition.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It was further that use of an additive composition of the clay material that was impregnated with a metal from Group III of the Periodic Table, such as Ga, reduced the sulfur content of the gasoline fraction that was catalytically cracked in an FCC unit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to further illustrate the present invention and the advantages thereof, the following specific examples are presented. The examples are presented as specific embodiments of the claimed invention. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not limited to the specific details set forth in the examples. The examples illustrate the preparation and evaluation of the catalytic activity specific additive compositions for reducing sulfur content of a catalytically cracked gasoline fraction in a typical FCC unit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conventional cracking catalyst particles preferably contain at least one cracking catalyst component which is catalytically active for the cracking of hydrocarbons in the absence of added hydrogen. The cracking catalyst component can comprise a zeolite, a non-zeolite molecular sieve, a catalytically active amorphous silica alumina species, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the cracking catalyst component is a Y-type zeolite selected from the group consisting of Y, USY, (described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,293,192, which is incorporated herein by reference), REY and RE-USY (described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,867,307 and 3,676,368, both of which are incorporated herein by reference) and mixtures thereof. The cracking catalyst particles can also contain one or more matrix components such as clays, modified clays, alumina, and the like. The cracking catalyst particles can also contain a binder such as an inorganic oxide sol or gel. The cracking catalyst particles generally contain at least 5 weight %, and in certain embodiments about 5 weight % to about 50 weight %, of the cracking catalyst component.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Micro activity test (MAT) evaluations of FCC catalyst/additive mixtures were carried out according to ASTM method D-3907, at a reaction temperature of 510&#xb0; C. and a injection time of 30 seconds for a catalyst-to-oil ratio between 3 to 5, to obtain a conversion to gasoline of 55 to 75% of the original feed. The feed used was a vacuum gas oil of Arabian light crude origin. The sulfur content of this feed was 2.5 weight percent. Other properties of this feed are shown in Table 1. The sulfur content of the gasoline fraction was measured by GC-SCD. For comparison purposes, the sulfur content of the gasoline fraction was calculated at 71% conversion level. The montmorillonite clay was calcined in air at 550&#xb0; C. to remove physically adsorbed water. Calcinations at 550&#xb0; C. did not result in a significant increase in the surface area.</p>

The sulfur content of the gasoline fraction in this Example 2 is compared to the reference sulfur content in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At a conversion to gasoline of 71%, the overall sulfur reduction achieved, including benzothiophene, was 16%.
