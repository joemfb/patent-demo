<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a test specimen having a chemical substance fixed at plural positions on a substrate and to a screening method employing the test specimen.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of film formation techniques in recent years, various materials and devices are becoming constructed mainly of thin films of 1 &#x3bc;m or thinner. Lately, high-speed film-formation techniques have been developed, which enable formation of a thin film structure by holding plural functional films on a substrate as a fine part of high functionality, such as electronic devices and bio-chips. Further, thin film structures having a sensor function, which detect a micro quantity of a chemical reaction product by utilizing plural components in the thin film, have become important.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With such improvements of the function of thin film parts, methods are being developed for more precise and finer analysis and evaluation of the thin films. The examples of the methods are:</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">(1) Direct measurement of electroconductivity, hardness, optical properties, X-ray reactivity, and ionic reactivity for measurement of functions of a thin film;</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">(2) Indirect analysis of the components of a thin film by fractionation of a thin film component by gas chromatography, high-speed liquid chromatography, ICP-MS analysis, or a like method;</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(3) Marker insertion to an objective substance in the thin film, such as addition of a fluorescent functional substance, or substitution by an isotopic element;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, precise and accurate analysis of the film components is indispensable, because the functions of the thin film are affected delicately by the component ratios. The extremely small thickness of the thin film tends to cause a problem of dependence of the functions of the thin film on the state of the substrate for the thin film and a problem of an adverse effect of contamination with foreign matter or a change of the quality or quantity of the thin film by pretreatment. The dependence of the function of the thin film on the film component ratio is investigated frequently by formation of thin film samples constituted of various component concentration ratios, direct measurement of the function as mentioned in the above method (1), and preparation of a calibration curve regarding the dependency of the obtained signal intensity on the component concentration ratio. For preparation of a more accurate calibration curve, the components should be uniformly distributed in the thin film sample and there must be precise control of the component concentration ratio in the samples.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">P. Lazzeri et al. (Surface and Interface Analysis, Vol. 29, 798 (2000)) describes formation of a thin film by spin coating and analysis thereof with a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;TOF-SIMS&#x201d;). In this method, the size of one thin film is several millimeters square. This size is about ten thousand times the size of thin films used currently in devices in which the size of the one thin film is being decreased to tens of micrometers square. Such a large difference in the size causes a difference between the practical thin films and the thin films for calibration samples due to local flocculation and mixing state of the respective components, and other conditions. Therefore, ideally, the entire thin film is to be measured and analyzed at one time. However, one measurement region of the TOF-SIMS is as small as several hundreds of micrometers square, which cannot cover the entire thin film at once. Therefore, the measurement sectional regions are introduced successively into a measurement chamber for the measurement. In such a measurement process, during the waiting time for the measurement, the component ratio is liable to vary by adhesion of moisture or an impurity from the environmental atmosphere to the measurement regions or evaporation of the sample component from the measurement regions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">(1) Direct measurement of electrical conductivity, hardness, optical properties, X-ray reactivity, and ion reactivity as the thin film functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Energy dispersive fluorescent X-ray analysis is capable of a simultaneous measurement of Na and heavier elements by use of a fluorescent X-ray. The fluorescent X-ray intensities are proportional in first approximation to the concentrations of the respective elements, but are affected greatly by ratio of coexisting component elements by absorption and secondary excitation effect thereof. Therefore, in the fluorescent X-ray analysis, the standard specimens for the calibration should also be prepared by strictly controlling the component mixing ratio for the quantitative determination of the film components and evaluating the functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,563 evaluates the influence of the component mixing ratio in the thin film by a calculation in a quantitative determination by fluorescent X-ray measurement. In this method, however, precise calculation is difficult, because the fluorescent X-ray intensity is not necessarily in a linear relationship with the component ratio. Further, in this method, the samples should be prepared in a number corresponding to the number of the film components, which requires finally tested specimens of high accuracy for the quantitative determination.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Due to the above reasons, precise quantitative determination is not practicable in any of the conventional methods. Therefore, in many analysis methods including ionic analysis and fluorescent X-ray analysis, standard specimens should be prepared with accurate and precise control of the component concentration ratio.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the test specimen of the present invention, one or more chemical substances are immobilized or fixed on each of prescribed positions on a substrate. The quantity of the chemical substance is separated by a quantity unit. The quantity unit by which represents the quantity of the chemical substance existing in the respective position is called an &#x201c;existence quantity unit.&#x201d; Thereby, the quantity of each of the chemical substances at a prescribed position is indicated by an integer multiple of the existence quantity unit. For example, in the case where the existence quantity units of five chemical substances &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;, &#x3b4;, and &#x3b5; are denoted respectively by a, b, c, d, and e, and four chemical substances &#x3b1;, &#x3b2;, &#x3b3;, &#x3b4;, and &#x3b5; exist at a certain prescribed position, the sum of the quantities of the existing chemical substances is c<sub>1</sub>a+c<sub>2</sub>b+c<sub>3</sub>c+c<sub>4</sub>d+c<sub>5</sub>e=c<sub>1</sub>a+c<sub>2</sub>b+c<sub>3</sub>c+0&#xd7;d+c<sub>5</sub>e, where c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>4</sub>, and c<sub>5 </sub>are respectively an integer, and the coefficient c<sub>4 </sub>for d is zero because of the absence of the substance &#x3b4;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">When the chemical substance is fixed without volatilization or diffusion at the prescribed positions, the existence quantity unit is occasionally called a &#x201c;fixation quantity unit.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The application and fixation of the chemical substance to a substrate is conducted suitably by an inkjet system typified by a bubble jet system. A region containing at least one kind of chemical substance can be formed by applying and fixing the chemical substance onto a substrate by an inkjet system (hereinafter the region is occasionally called a &#x201c;fixation region&#x201d;). Incidentally, a solution of chemical substance &#x3b3;, for instance, is referred to a &#x201c;&#x3b3; solution.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For precise control of the fixation quantity of chemical substances, the respective chemical substances are preferably applied separately and independently onto a substrate by an inkjet system. The inkjet system enables application of a necessary number of fine liquid droplets containing the chemical substance onto an intended spot. The application of plural liquid droplets of a chemical substance solution to mix the plural liquid droplets is called &#x201c;superposed dotting&#x201d; or &#x201c;dotting in superposition&#x201d; in this Specification. The volume of one liquid droplet applied by the inkjet system is preferably not more than 50 pL. Here the existence quantity unit is preferably defined by the quantity of the chemical substance contained in the one liquid droplet of the inkjet or an integer multiple thereof. Otherwise, the existence quantity unit may be defined to bring the integer multiple of the existence quantity unit within a suitable range in the calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The test specimen of the present invention is constituted by controlled application of the chemical substance by an inkjet system. Therefore a precise calibration curve for quantitative analysis can be obtained by use of this test specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For quantitative analysis by use of the test specimen of the present invention as a standard sample, the plural positions of the chemical substance fixation are preferably arranged in a matrix. The matrix arrangement is suitable for changing the fixation quantity of the chemical substance for the quantitative analysis. The fixation positions of the chemical substance are arranged in a matrix of X lines and Y columns. The matrix may be divided into submatrix elements. One submatrix is called a &#x201c;block.&#x201d; The prescribed position constituting the matrix of the present invention is called an &#x201c;element position.&#x201d; Of course, one block may consists of one element position. The composition having been applied to the element position and containing the chemical substance is called a &#x201c;spot.&#x201d; The operation of registering the ejection head to the element position and applying the liquid droplets onto the element position by ejection is called &#x201c;spotting.&#x201d; The spot formed by one liquid droplet is called a &#x201c;dot.&#x201d; One liquid droplet traveling in the air for formation of a spot is also called a &#x201c;dot&#x201d; occasionally. The dot of a &#x3b3; solution is called a &#x201c;&#x3b3; dot.&#x201d; Two or more dots may be put in superposition to form one spot. The operation of ejection or non-ejection of a droplet of a solution from an ejection head onto an element position is called an &#x201c;application operation.&#x201d; The application operation includes stop of the head at an element position not to conduct spotting to the element position on the basis of the determination of applying no dot to the element position. One scanning cycle is completed by application operation of all the solution ejection heads respectively on every element position of the XY matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The chemical substance in the present invention includes metals, metal compounds, semiconductor materials, organic compounds of a number-average molecular weight of not more than 10,000, biological substances, metal ions, metal complexes, halogen ions, and substances having solubility of 1 ppb or more in water or an organic solvent at an ordinary temperature and pressure. A metal, metal compound, or semiconductor material, on application onto a substrate, is preferably in state of a fine particles of not larger than 1 &#x3bc;m in diameter on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The test specimen of the present invention is useful suitably as a standard specimen in quantitative analysis by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). A primary use of the test specimen is a standard specimen for quantitative analysis by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and like analysis methods. The analysis methods by use of the test specimen of the present invention as a standard specimen include fluorescent X-ray analysis, optical response analysis, and electrical conductivity analysis in addition to the TOF-SIMS.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In quantitative analysis by TOF-SIMS, the dose quantity of primary ions is kept constant at a level of not higher than 1&#xd7;10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, and the integrated intensity (count number) of specified secondary ions emitted from a prescribed area is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A secondary use of the test specimen of the present invention is use for various screening. In the screening, a third chemical substance is applied by an inkjet system onto the chemical substance fixed on plural points on the test specimen and the resulting chemical reaction is used for the screening. The third chemical substance is preferably a biological substance or a medical substance. The test is preferably conducted by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the objective chemical substance is a water-soluble metal complex, a material disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2000-251665, for instance, can be used as it is. Such a material is preferably applied by a bubble jet system. The test specimen of the present invention prepared by applying a chemical substance solution onto a substrate by an inkjet system may be heat-treated, if necessary, after the application. The dotting in superposition by the inkjet system may be conducted with a driving system described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H04-361055.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Before application of the test chemical substance onto the substrate, the substrate surface may be treated for fixation of the chemical substance. This treatment may be conducted, for instance, by the method described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H11-187900. This method is preferably employed when the chemical substance to be applied is an organic compound having an SH group.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the present invention, a test specimen can be prepared for precise evaluation of the dependency of the performance of a thin film on a slight difference in the components ratio in the film, the film thickness, and the kind of the substrate. This is one of the features of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For instance, the intensity of signals according to ionization is affected greatly by the state of a specimen. Therefore, dependence of a noticed function on the state of the specimen can be evaluated by using signals obtained from the ionization. For this evaluation, the test specimen of the present invention and preparation method thereof will be effective.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A generalized embodiment of the present invention is explained below. For simplicity of explanation, two kinds of chemical substances, &#x3b1; and &#x3b2;, are used to prepare a test specimen.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Solutions of the respective chemical substances are prepared, and are stored respectively in printer head tanks.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment, the element positions are arranged in a matrix having X lines and Y columns. This XY matrix is divided into submatrixes having respectively m lines and n columns, where m&#x3c;n. One submatrix is called a &#x201c;block.&#x201d; The block on the i-th line on the j-th column of the XY matrix is represented by B<sub>ij</sub>. For simplicity of explanation, all the blocks are assumed to be constituted of elements in x lines and y columns. Therefore, x&#xb7;m=X and y&#xb7;n=Y.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">All the spots fixed at element positions in one block are made to have the same composition within that block.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One droplet of an &#x3b1; solution ejected from a printer head is assumed to contain a chemical substance a in an amount of &#x201c;a,&#x201d; and one droplet of a &#x3b2; solution ejected from a printer head is assumed to contain a chemical substance &#x3b2; in an amount of &#x201c;b.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one scanning cycle of the spotting operation, the spots may be formed on all the element positions in one block, and thereafter sequentially in the next blocks (this process being called a &#x201c;sequence process.&#x201d; Otherwise, the spots may be formed on a specific element position in all of the blocks and then this application operation is repeated by changing the specific positions at all of the positions on all of the blocks (this process being called a &#x201c;correspondence process&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Naturally, the heads may be provided in a number corresponding to the number of the lines or columns of the blocks to conduct the spotting operation on the respective lines or columns simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the first scanning cycle, a dots are put at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks on the first line, and &#x3b2; dots are put at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks on the first column.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the second scanning cycle, a dots are put in superposition at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks on the first and second lines, and &#x3b2; dots are put in superposition at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks of the first and second columns.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Similarly, in the i-th scanning cycle, &#x3b1; dots are put in superposition at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks of the first to i-th lines, and &#x3b2; dots are put in superposition at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks of the first to i-th columns.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the m-th scanning cycle, since there is no (m+1)th line, the dotting of the &#x3b1; solution is not conducted, and &#x3b2; dots are put in superposition at all the element positions in all of the blocks except the blocks of the first to m-th columns. Thus, in the m-th scanning cycle and later scanning cycles, the &#x3b1; solution is not applied.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the (n&#x2212;1)th scanning cycle, the &#x3b1; solution is not put, and &#x3b2; dots are put in superposition at all the element positions in the blocks except the 1 to (n&#x2212;1)th columns, namely in the n-th column.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the n-th scanning cycle, since there is no columns except the 1 to n columns, the &#x3b2; solution is not applied, and the scanning is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the above scanning cycles, no &#x3b1; dot is formed in the blocks on the first line, and no &#x3b2; dot is formed in the blocks on the first column: there is no spot in the block B<sub>11</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the block B<sub>ij</sub>, the spot at one element position is formed by (i&#x2212;1) a dots, and (j&#x2212;1) &#x3b2; dots. Therefore, the quantity of the chemical substance &#x3b1; in that spot is a(i&#x2212;1), and the quantity of the chemical substance &#x3b2; is b(j&#x2212;1). Since each of the blocks has element positions in x lines and y columns, the block B<sub>ij </sub>contains totally the chemical substance a in a quantity of a(i&#x2212;1)xy and the chemical substance &#x3b2; in a quantity of b(j&#x2212;1)xy. For instance, in the block B<sub>45</sub>, the number of the &#x3b1; dots is 4&#x2212;1=3, and the number of the &#x3b2; dots is 5&#x2212;1=4 for formation of the one spot on the respective element positions: the spot contains the chemical substance &#x3b1; in a quantity of 3a and the chemical substance &#x3b2; in a quantity of 4b. In the entire block B<sub>45</sub>, the chemical substance &#x3b1; is contained in a quantity of 3axy, and the chemical substance &#x3b2; is contained in a quantity of 4bxy.

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In analysis of components of a biological material by SIMS or fluorescent X-ray analysis, a trace amount of sodium (Na) or potassium (K) as a contaminant may affect the intensity of the signals. In this Example, a calibration curve was obtained for quantitative determination of phosphorus (P) by TOF-SIMS by using a standard sample of ammonium phosphate (NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, ammonium dihydrogenphosphate) containing Na and K as an example of quantitative determination of a biological material by using the method of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(1) Substrate Cleaning</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A silicon substrate (high-resistance p-type, commercial product) having a size of 10 mm&#xd7;12 mm&#xd7;1 mm was subjected to supersonic cleaning in high-purity acetone, ethanol, and ultrapure water respectively for 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(2) Preparation of Aqueous Solutions of Component Mixtures</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Aqueous standard solutions for IPC-MS (SPEX Co.) containing respectively P (10.1%), Na (10.1%), or K (5.0%) were diluted respectively with pure water to 100 &#x3bc;M to prepare aqueous solutions for standard sample preparation (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;P solution,&#x201d; an &#x201c;Na solution, and a &#x201c;K solution&#x201d; respectively). Two standard specimens were prepared: a matrix having elements composed of mixtures of the P solution and the Na solution as the elements, and a matrix having elements composed of mixtures of the P solution and the K solution (hereinafter the former is referred to as an &#x201c;Na matrix,&#x201d; and the latter is referred to as a &#x201c;K matrix&#x201d;). The spot formation procedure in this Example is shown below specifically for formation of the Na matrix from the P dots and the Na dots. For formation of the K matrix, the Na solution is replaced by the K solution in the Na matrix formation procedure.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(3) Application of Solutions for Preparation of Quantitative Determination Specimen by Inkjet System</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The printer employed was a bubble jet printer (BJF-950: Canon K.K.), which is a kind of a thermal jet printer. The above-prepared aqueous standard solutions were placed respectively in a several hundred microliter portion in the three tanks of the printer head of the printer. The volume of the one liquid droplet of the respective solutions ejected from the printer heads was 4 pL/droplet. The dot formed by one liquid droplet on the element position had a diameter of about 50 &#x3bc;m. The spots were formed by dotting in superposition. The content of P in one ejected droplet is 2.4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>atoms and the content of Na therein is 2.4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>atoms. The content of K in one ejected droplet regarding K matrix is also 2.4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>atoms. The Na matrix and the K matrix were formed respectively of 157 lines and 236 columns at a density of 200 dpi, namely 127 &#x3bc;m pitch, in a range of 20 mm&#xd7;30 mm on the surface of the silicon wafer having been cleaned in Step (1) above. The two matrixes were placed side by side as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The Na matrix was divided into blocks in 10 lines and 10 columns. The reminders of the divisions were ignored.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the first scanning cycle, P dots were applied on all lines except the first line, and Na dots were applied on all columns except the first column.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the later scanning cycles, the P dots and the Na dots were put in superposition by decreasing one line and one column of the application in each scanning cycle. That is, in the i-th scanning cycle, P dots were put in superposition on all the spots in all of the lines except the first to i-th lines, and Na dots were put in superposition on all the spots in all of the columns except the first to i-th columns.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the ninth scanning cycle, the P dots were put only on the tenth lines, and the Na dots were put only on the tenth columns.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The pattern was completed by the above nine scanning cycles. In the block B<sub>ij </sub>on the i-th line on the j-th column, the spot at one element position is formed from (i&#x2212;1) dots of P, and (j&#x2212;1) dots of Na. Therefore, in that spot, the quantity of P is a(i&#x2212;1), and the quantity of Na is b(j&#x2212;1). When the number of the element position in the block B<sub>ij </sub>is n<sub>ij</sub>, the total quantity of P in the block B<sub>ij </sub>is a(i&#x2212;1)n<sub>ij</sub>, and the total quantity of Na in this block is b(j&#x2212;1)n<sub>ij</sub>.</p>
