<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor packages can include more than one die. The multiple dies of a single package may be arranged in any one of a number of configurations. In some packages, for example, the dies may be stacked. When one of the dies is wire-bonded to a substrate with an additional die stacked over the wire-bonded die, the additional die must avoid contacting the wires of the wire-bonded die to avoid damage.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure also provides a method of fabricating a semiconductor package, the method comprising mounting a first chip onto a substrate, wherein an active surface of the first chip faces away from the substrate, and wherein the first chip includes a plurality of bump pads located on the active surface of the first chip. A wire may be bonded from a first bump pad of the plurality of bump pads to the substrate. The method may further comprise forming an intermediate layer on at least a portion of the active surface of the first chip, and forming a via in the intermediate layer, wherein the via extends to a second bump pad of the plurality of bump pads. A second chip may be placed on the intermediate layer, wherein an active surface of the second chip faces towards the substrate, and wherein the second chip includes a third bump pad (i) located on the active surface of the second chip and (ii) aligned with the via formed in the intermediate layer. A corresponding bump may be formed on one or more of (i) the second bump pad located on the active surface of the first chip and (ii) the third bump pad located on the active surface of the second chip, and the corresponding bump may be heated to melt the corresponding bump within the via and thereby form an electrical connection between the second bump pad and the third bump pad.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention provide a flip-chip stacked on top of a wire-bonded chip. The terms chip, die, integrated circuit, monolithic device, semiconductor device, and microelectronic device are often used interchangeably in the microelectronics field. The present invention is applicable to all of the above as they are generally understood in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> schematically illustrate a semiconductor package <b>100</b> subsequent to various process operations for stacking a second chip <b>102</b> (e.g., a flip-chip) onto a first chip <b>104</b> (e.g., a wire-bonded chip). In one implementation, an active surface <b>106</b> of the second chip <b>102</b> faces an active surface <b>108</b> of the first chip <b>104</b>. The term &#x201c;active surface&#x201d; refers to the surface of a chip having the active regions/areas, as is known to those having skill in the art. The active surface of a chip may include any one or more of various circuitry components, such as transistors, memory cells, passive components, and the like. An intermediate layer <b>110</b> is disposed between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b>. The intermediate layer <b>110</b> includes one or more vias <b>112</b> filled with an interconnect material <b>113</b> contacting and electrically coupling one or more portions of the active surface <b>106</b> of the second chip <b>102</b> and one or more portions of the active surface <b>108</b> of the first chip <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To construct the semiconductor package <b>100</b>, a first chip <b>104</b> may be mounted to a substrate <b>114</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The active surface <b>108</b> of the first chip <b>104</b> is mounted to face away from the substrate <b>114</b>. The substrate <b>114</b> may comprise any suitable substrate for carrying the stacked chips <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, for example, the substrate <b>114</b> comprises a carrier substrate or a leadframe. A carrier substrate may include one or more metallization layers <b>120</b> for carrying electrical signals, and may include one or more solder bumps <b>122</b> to provide an electrical connection between the semiconductor package <b>100</b> and an electronic device such as, for example, a motherboard or other circuit board, that is external to the semiconductor package <b>100</b>. The one or more solder bumps <b>122</b> may be used to route the electrical signals, such as the I/O and/or power/ground signals for the wire-bonded chip <b>104</b> and/or the second chip <b>102</b>, to or from the semiconductor package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first chip <b>104</b> includes one or more bumps <b>124</b> coupled to corresponding bump pads <b>118</b> located on the active surface <b>108</b>. The bumps <b>124</b> may be formed on the bump pads <b>118</b> prior to the first chip <b>104</b> being mounted to the substrate <b>114</b>. In these embodiments, the bumps <b>124</b> are formed on the bump pads <b>118</b> prior to or after the first chip <b>104</b> is singulated from a wafer (i.e., at wafer-level or die-level). In other embodiments, the bumps <b>124</b> are formed on the bump pads <b>118</b> after the first chip <b>104</b> is mounted to the substrate <b>114</b>. Although five bumps <b>124</b> are depicted, more or fewer bumps can be used in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The bumps <b>124</b> comprise structures formed of an electrically conductive material such as metal, solder, or alloy, and can include a variety of shapes and configurations. For example, the bumps <b>124</b> may be spherical or semi-spherical, as depicted, or include other shapes such as polygons, cylinders, or the like. The bumps <b>124</b> may be formed using a bumping process, such as, for example, a controlled collapse chip connect (C4) process, stud-bumping, or other suitable bumping process. The bumps <b>124</b> may provide an electrical connection or part of an electrical connection between the first chip <b>104</b> and the second <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first chip <b>104</b> is wire-bonded to the substrate <b>114</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Wires <b>116</b> are bonded to one or more bump pads <b>118</b> of the first chip <b>104</b> and then coupled to the substrate <b>114</b>. The wires <b>116</b> may comprise an electrically conductive material, such as a metal, to route electrical signals such as, for example, input/output (I/O) or power/ground signals to or from the first chip <b>104</b>. The wires <b>116</b> may be formed using, for example, a ball-bonding or wedge-bonding process.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The intermediate layer <b>110</b> is formed on the first chip <b>104</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In one embodiment, the intermediate layer <b>110</b> is configured to provide a predetermined offset (distance) between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b> so as to keep the second chip <b>102</b> from touching the wires <b>116</b>. This predetermined offset can prevent direct coupling of the second chip <b>102</b> to the first chip <b>104</b> via the wires <b>116</b> in cases in which the second chip <b>102</b> has a size that is substantially equal to (or greater than) a size of the first chip <b>104</b>. For example, when the second chip <b>102</b> has a width that is similar to or larger than a width of the first chip <b>104</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the wires <b>116</b> may potentially be damaged if the second chip <b>102</b> were to be mounted to the first chip <b>104</b> without a predetermined offset being between the two chips.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition to providing a predetermined offset between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b>, the intermediate layer <b>110</b> may provide one or more of protection of the wire-bonds, heat dissipation, or increased bonding strength between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b> (as compared to using only bumps to mount the second chip <b>102</b> onto the first chip <b>104</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The intermediate layer <b>110</b> comprises any material suitable for the described purpose(s). The intermediate layer <b>110</b> may comprise, for example, a paste, a glue, an adhesive, or the like, and may be applied in accordance with the properties of the selected material. For instance, in embodiments in which the intermediate layer <b>110</b> is a paste, the intermediate layer may be molded or poured onto the active surface <b>108</b> of the wire-bonded chip <b>104</b>. In various other embodiments, the intermediate layer <b>110</b> comprises silicon, glass, or an organic substrate, as described more fully below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The intermediate layer <b>110</b> is configured to cover one or more of the bump pads <b>118</b> having the wires <b>116</b> bonded thereto, as illustrated. This configuration may be particularly suitable for embodiments in which protection of the wire-bonds is desired. In other embodiments, the intermediate layer <b>110</b> may instead be formed such that the intermediate layer <b>110</b> does not contact the wire-bonds at the bump pads <b>118</b>. In other words, the intermediate layer <b>110</b> may have a width that is smaller than the distance between bump pads <b>118</b> on opposing sides of the first chip <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The vias <b>112</b> are formed in the intermediate layer <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The vias <b>112</b> may be configured to extend to the bumps <b>124</b> of the first chip <b>104</b> so as to expose the bumps <b>124</b>. In various embodiments, the vias <b>112</b> may be formed by laser-drilling or etching or any other suitable method. In some embodiments, the vias <b>112</b> may be formed in the intermediate layer <b>110</b> prior to providing the intermediate layer <b>110</b> on the active surface <b>108</b> of the first chip <b>104</b>. In one embodiment in which bumps <b>124</b> are not formed on the bump pads <b>118</b> (as discussed in greater detail below), the vias <b>112</b> are formed to extend to one or more bump pads <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second chip <b>102</b> is placed onto the intermediate layer <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. In one embodiment, the second chip <b>102</b> includes one or more bumps <b>126</b> coupled to corresponding bump pads <b>128</b> on the active surface <b>106</b> of the second chip <b>102</b>. The second chip <b>102</b> may be placed onto the intermediate layer <b>110</b> such that the bumps <b>126</b> (or bump pads <b>128</b>) align with the vias <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As with the bumps <b>124</b> on the first chip <b>104</b>, the bumps <b>126</b> comprise structures formed of an electrically conductive material such as metal, solder, or alloy, and can include a variety of shapes and configurations. For example, the bumps <b>126</b> may be spherical or semi-spherical, as depicted, or include other shapes such as polygons, cylinders, or the like. The bumps <b>126</b> may be formed using a bumping process, such as, for example, a controlled collapse chip connect (C4) process, stud-bumping, or other suitable bumping process. In one embodiment, the bumps <b>126</b> provide an electrical connection (or part of an electrical connection) between the first chip <b>104</b> and the second chip <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The bumps <b>126</b> of the second chip <b>102</b> and the bumps <b>124</b> of the first chip <b>104</b> may be coupled by heating the bumps <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> to cause the bumps <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> to reflow (or melt), thereby forming an electrical connection between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b>, and the semiconductor package <b>100</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various embodiments, rather than including bumps <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> on both the first chip <b>104</b> and the second chip <b>102</b>, respectively, bumps may instead be provided only on one of the first chip <b>104</b> or the second chip <b>102</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, bumps <b>126</b> may be provided only on the second chip <b>102</b>, or as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, bumps <b>124</b> may be provided only on the second chip <b>104</b>. Whether the bumps are provided on the second chip <b>102</b> or the first chip <b>104</b>, the bumps may need to be formed of a size to provide sufficient interconnect material to fill the vias <b>112</b> with few or no voids. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for example, the bumps <b>124</b> have a height that is greater than a height of the intermediate layer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As noted herein, the intermediate layer <b>110</b> may comprise silicon, glass, or an organic substrate. The silicon, glass, or an organic substrate may be a preformed structure, or may be formed in situ on the first chip <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-15</figref> schematically illustrate a semiconductor package <b>200</b> subsequent to various process operations for stacking a second chip <b>102</b> (e.g., a flip-chip) onto a first chip <b>102</b> (e.g., a wire-bonded chip), wherein the intermediate layer <b>210</b> comprises silicon, glass, or an organic substrate. For clarity and to avoid redundancy, elements that are similar to the elements discussed herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref> are noted using the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">To construct the semiconductor package <b>200</b>, the first chip <b>104</b> is mounted to a substrate <b>114</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and then wire-bonded to the substrate <b>114</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The intermediate layer <b>210</b> is then formed on the first chip <b>104</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In some embodiments, the intermediate layer <b>210</b> may instead be formed on the first chip <b>104</b> prior to the wire-bonding. As with the intermediate layer <b>110</b> discussed earlier, in one implementation, the intermediate layer <b>210</b> is configured to provide a predetermined offset between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b> so as to keep the second chip <b>102</b> from touching the wires <b>116</b>. The predetermined offset may be particularly important when the second chip <b>102</b> is wide enough to prevent direct coupling of the second chip <b>102</b> to the first chip <b>104</b> due the coupling of the wires <b>116</b> to the first chip <b>102</b>. For example, when the second chip <b>102</b> has a width that is similar to or larger than a width of the first chip <b>104</b>, the wires <b>116</b> may potentially be damaged if the second chip <b>102</b> were to be mounted to the first chip <b>104</b> without the predetermined offset.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition to providing a predetermined offset between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b>, the intermediate layer <b>210</b> may provide heat dissipation and/or increased bonding strength between the second chip <b>102</b> and the first chip <b>104</b> (as compared to mounting the second chip <b>102</b> onto the first chip <b>104</b> using the bumps <b>124</b> alone).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The intermediate layer <b>210</b> includes one or more vias <b>212</b>. The vias <b>212</b> may be configured to provide openings for filling with an interconnect material for coupling the active surface <b>106</b> of the second chip <b>102</b> to the active surface <b>108</b> of the first chip <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, although not illustrated, the vias <b>212</b> may be configured to extend to bumps (similar to bumps <b>124</b> discussed earlier) on the first chip <b>104</b>. In various embodiments, the vias <b>212</b> may be formed by laser-drilling or etching or any other suitable method. In some embodiments, the vias <b>212</b> may be formed in the intermediate layer <b>210</b> prior to providing the intermediate layer <b>210</b> on the active surface <b>108</b> of the first chip <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second chip <b>102</b> is then placed onto the intermediate layer <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>.
