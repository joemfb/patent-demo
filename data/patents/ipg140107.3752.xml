<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to power reduction for driving display panels and, more particularly, to apparatuses and methods related to energy sharing for signals that drive display panels.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Level shifters are often required for a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panel to control the voltage and charge on control lines for the LCD panel. Drivers may reverse the voltage on the control lines, which include a distributed capacitive load. In general, each control line is driven from a high power supply to a low power supply, through a switch. Since these control lines are operated at high frequency the resulting power dissipation is inconveniently large, which may result in self-heating and high power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, since the control lines are switched in pairs, each switching to the voltage of the other control line in the pair, there is a possibility to save some of the energy by connecting the two distributed capacitances together. High voltage level shifters for LCD panels sometimes employ a technique known as &#x201c;charge sharing&#x201d; to reduce the amount of power required to exchange the voltages applied to the large distributed capacitances. When the capacitive load is charged, for example to a positive state, a voltage equal to the sum of a high side and a low side voltage is applied to the load capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When it is desired to reverse the polarity of the applied voltage, switches operate to connect the positive voltage to the low side and the negative voltage to the high side. This makes the load voltage reverse and requires, from a power supply, all the energy to charge the capacitance to twice the sum of the high and low voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">If, during a short interval, the capacitive load is disconnected from the power supplies the two ends of the capacitor may be connected together and the charge and energy made approximately zero. As a result, this &#x201c;charge sharing&#x201d; operation may reduce by half the energy required from the supplies when the voltages on the capacitors are reversed because the charge sharing brings the voltages part of the way toward their new voltage in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a conventional charge sharing circuit. A high supply voltage (Vhigh) is coupled to a first position of a switch S<b>1</b> and a third position of a switch S<b>2</b>. A low supply voltage (Vlow) is coupled to a third position of switch S<b>1</b> and a first position of switch S<b>2</b>. Second positions of switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are positions wherein the switches are open and not connected to either the high supply voltage or the low supply voltage. Resistor R<b>1</b> represents parasitic resistance that may exist in the system. Switch S<b>1</b> connects to a first capacitor C<b>1</b> representing the distributed load on one control line of the LCD panel and switch S<b>2</b> connects to a second capacitor C<b>2</b> representing the distributed load on another control line of the LCD panel. In many systems, the other sides of capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are connected together to a common signal (Vcommon) that may be driven to a midpoint voltage, a ground, or other suitable voltage. Switch S<b>3</b> is coupled in series with resistor R<b>1</b> and between the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In operation, if the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are in position <b>1</b>, the two series capacitors, having a net value of C/2, will be charged to Vhigh&#x2212;Vlow and the stored energy can be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(1/2)(C/2)(Vhigh&#x2212;Vlow)<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are toggled to position <b>3</b>, the voltage across the capacitors will be reversed. One way to think about the result is to note that all the energy stored in capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> must be removed just to get the voltages to zero. Then the energy in capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> must be replaced with a like amount to build up the same voltage in the reverse direction. This total change in energy can be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(C/2)(&#x2212;Vhigh+Vlow)<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This energy is provided by the voltage supplies Vhigh and Vlow and the power required over time can be represented as approximately:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(Reversals per second)( C/2)(&#x2212;Vhigh+Vlow)<sup>2</sup>.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, if there is a time period between when the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are in position <b>1</b> and position <b>3</b>, the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> can be placed in position <b>2</b> where they are both open. Switch S<b>3</b> can then be closed to connect the first capacitor C<b>1</b> to the second capacitor C<b>2</b> and they will &#x201c;share&#x201d; their charge such that they reach about a mid-point (minus any energy dissipated in resistor R<b>1</b>) between \Thigh and Vlow.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The stored energy will be switched between the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> and will not need to come from the power supplies. Switch S<b>3</b> can then be opened and the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> can be placed in either position <b>1</b> or position <b>2</b> to charge capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> the rest of the way to their respective voltage levels. As a result, the system ends up with a net loss of only about half the energy required if the capacitor ends are not shorted through the resistor R<b>1</b>. The result of this &#x201c;charge sharing&#x201d; through the resistor R<b>1</b> is that the energy from the supplies per reversal is cut about in half, thereby cutting the operating power by about a half.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, energy consumption can still be high and the inventors have appreciated that there is a need to further reduce the energy required to drive LCD panels.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments discussed herein include apparatuses and methods for new energy sharing circuits that reduce power more than conventional charge sharing circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An embodiment of the present invention is an energy sharing circuit including a first source line, a second source line, and an inductive coupler. The inductive coupler is configured for performing a first selective coupling of the first source line to the second source line through a first forward biased diode and an inductor connected in series. The inductive coupler is configured for performing a second selective coupling of the second source line to the first source line through a second forward biased diode and the inductor connected in series.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the present invention is an energy sharing circuit including a first high switch for selectively coupling a high voltage to a first source line and a first low switch for selectively coupling a low voltage to the first source line. A second high switch selectively couples the high voltage to a second source line and a second low switch selectively couples the low voltage to the second source line. A first diode includes an anode operably coupled to the first source line and a second diode includes an anode operably coupled to the second source line. An inductor has a first side operably coupled to a cathode of the first diode and a second side operably coupled to a cathode of the second diode. A first coupling switch is configured for selectively coupling the first source line to the first side of the inductor and a second coupling switch is configured for selectively coupling the second source line to the second side of the inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another embodiment of the present invention is a method for energy sharing, which includes selectively coupling a high voltage to a first source line and selectively coupling a low voltage to a second source line. A first coupling switch is activated to inductively couple the first source line to the second source line and diode block the second source line from the first source line. The low voltage is selectively coupled to the first source line and the high voltage is selectively coupled to the second source line. A second coupling switch is activated to inductively couple the second source line to the first source line and diode block the first source line from the second source line.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a method for energy sharing. During a first time period, a first source line is charged to a high voltage and a second source line is charged to a low voltage. During a second time period subsequent to the first time period; energy is inductively moved from the second source line to the first source line to move the second source line to an intermediate high voltage and the first source line to an intermediate low voltage, and the second source line is blocked from returning energy to the first source line. During a third time period subsequent to the second time period, the second source line is charged to the high voltage and the first source line is charged to the low voltage. During a fourth time period subsequent to the third time period; energy is inductively moved from the first source line to the second source line to move the first source line to the intermediate high voltage and the second source line to the intermediate low voltage, and the first source line is blocked from returning charge to the second source line.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following description, elements, circuits, and functions may be shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail. Conversely, specific implementations shown and described are exemplary only and should not be construed as the only way to implement the present invention unless specified otherwise herein. Additionally, block definitions and partitioning of logic between various blocks is exemplary of a specific implementation. It will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced by numerous other partitioning solutions. For the most part, details concerning timing considerations and the like have been omitted where such details are not necessary to obtain a complete understanding of the present invention and are within the abilities of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, in this description of embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. The embodiments are intended to describe aspects of the invention in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Those of ordinary skill in the art would understand that information and signals may be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof. Some drawings may illustrate signals as a single signal for clarity of presentation and description. It will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the signal may represent a bus of signals, wherein the bus may have a variety of bit widths and the present invention may be implemented on any number of data signals including a single data signal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The terms &#x201c;assert&#x201d; and &#x201c;negate&#x201d; may be respectively used when referring to the rendering of a signal, status bit, or similar apparatus into its logically true or logically false state. If the logically true state is a logic level one, the logically false state will be a logic level zero. Conversely, if the logically true state is a logic level zero, the logically false state will be a logic level one.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be understood that any reference to an element herein using a designation such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and so forth does not limit the quantity or order of those elements, unless such limitation is explicitly stated. Rather, these designations may be used herein as a convenient method of distinguishing between two or more elements or instances of an element. Thus, a reference to first and second elements does not mean that only two elements may be employed there or that the first element must precede the second element in some manner. In addition, unless stated otherwise a set of elements may comprise one or more elements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Elements described herein may include multiple instances of the same element. These elements may be generically indicated by a numerical designator (e.g. <b>110</b>) and specifically indicated by the numerical indicator followed by an alphabetic designator (e.g., <b>110</b>A) or a numeric indicator preceded by a &#x201c;dash&#x201d; (e.g., <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>). For ease of following the description, for the most part element number indicators begin with the number of the drawing on which the elements are introduced or most fully discussed. Thus, for example, element identifiers on a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be mostly in the numerical format 1xx and elements on a <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> will be mostly in the numerical format 4xx.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When describing circuit elements, such as, for example, resistors, capacitors, and transistors, designators for the circuit elements begin with an element type designator (e.g., R, C, M) followed by a numeric indicator. Circuit element numbers may be repeated on different drawings and are not to be considered the same element unless expressly indicated as such. In other words, a capacitor C<b>1</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a different element from a capacitor C<b>1</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Power sources such as, for example VDD and VCC as well as ground voltages may be generically indicated. When appropriate, these power signals may be described in detail. In other cases, the power signals may not be described, as it would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art which power signal should be used. As a non-limiting example, it may be appropriate to maintain separate analog and digital grounds and a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand which is the appropriate ground for a specific circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments discussed herein include apparatuses and methods for new energy sharing circuits that reduce power more than conventional charge sharing circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an LCD panel <b>200</b> including a pixel array <b>250</b>, and controls therefor. The pixel array <b>250</b> may be controlled by a gate controller <b>230</b>, a voltage controller <b>210</b>, and an energy sharing circuit <b>300</b>. The LCD panel <b>200</b> may include additional circuits and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is very simplified to show the circuits and functions that may be associated with embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pixel array <b>250</b> includes pixels <b>255</b> arranged in rows and columns. In other words, a first row includes pixels <b>255</b>-<b>11</b>, <b>255</b>-<b>21</b>, etc. up to &#x201c;m&#x201d; columns ending with pixel <b>255</b>-<i>m</i><b>1</b>. Similarly, a first column includes pixels <b>255</b>-<b>11</b>, <b>255</b>-<b>12</b>, etc. up to &#x201c;n&#x201d; rows ending with pixel <b>255</b>-<i>n</i><b>1</b>. Each pixel may include a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) transistor for enabling the pixel and a capacitance associated with the pixel. Further details will be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art and need not be explained herein to describe embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The gate controller <b>230</b> may be configured to control gate signals <b>235</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>235</b>-<b>2</b> through <b>235</b>-<i>n </i>to turn on the MOS transistors of various rows of the pixel array <b>250</b> at appropriate times. The energy sharing circuit <b>300</b> may be configured to place various voltages on column signals <b>225</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>225</b>-<b>2</b> through <b>225</b>-<i>m </i>at appropriate times as explained below. A voltage controller <b>210</b> may be included to supply any needed voltage levels to the energy sharing circuit <b>300</b>. The column signals <b>225</b> couple to sources nodes of the MOS transistors in the pixel array <b>250</b> and may also be referred to herein as source lines <b>225</b>. The source lines <b>225</b> may be quite long and, as a result, a considerable distributed capacitance may need to be driven by the energy sharing circuit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">While referred to as rows and columns for ease of descriptions, the orientation of the pixel array <b>250</b> may be rotated such that the source lines <b>225</b> are configured as rows and the gate signals are configured as columns.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of an energy sharing circuit <b>300</b> for driving source lines of a pixel array <b>250</b> according to one or more embodiments of the invention. Capacitor C<b>1</b> represents the distributed capacitance of a first source line <b>350</b> and capacitor C<b>2</b> represents the distributed capacitance of a second source line <b>360</b>. In some LCD panels, the other sides of capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> may be connected together to a common signal (Vcommon) that may be driven to a midpoint voltage, a ground, or other suitable voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A high supply voltage <b>310</b> (Vhigh) is coupled to a first position of a first switch S<b>1</b> and a third position of a second switch S<b>2</b>. A low supply voltage <b>320</b> (Vlow) is coupled to a third position of the first switch S<b>1</b> and a first position of the second switch S<b>2</b>. Second positions of switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are positions in which the switches are open and not connected to either the high supply voltage <b>310</b> or the low supply voltage <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A timing controller <b>300</b> may be configured to control the first switch S<b>1</b> via a first switch control signal <b>312</b>, the second switch S<b>2</b> via a second switch control signal <b>322</b>, and an inductive coupler <b>400</b> via a first share signal <b>332</b> and a second share signal <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In operation, if the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in position <b>1</b>, the two series capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, having a net value of C/2, will be charged to Vhigh-Vlow and the stored energy can be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(1/2)(C/2)(Vhigh&#x2212;Vlow)<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">If the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are toggled to position <b>3</b>, the voltage across the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> will be reversed. One way to think about the result is to note that all the energy stored in capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> must be removed just to get the voltages to zero. Then the energy in capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> must be replaced with a like amount to build up the same voltage in the reverse direction. This total change in energy can be represented as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(C/2)(&#x2212;Vhigh+Vlow)<sup>2 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">However, if there is a time period between when the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are in position <b>1</b> and position <b>3</b>, the switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> can be placed in position <b>2</b> where they are both open. At time periods when switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are open (i.e., in position <b>2</b>) the inductive coupler <b>400</b> can be activated to share energy between the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simplified schematic diagram of an inductive coupler <b>400</b> according to one or more embodiments of the invention. The inductive coupler <b>400</b> may be configured to selectively couple the first source line <b>350</b> and the second source line <b>360</b> to provide improved energy sharing relative to conventional charge sharing circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one direction, the first source line <b>350</b> is selectively coupled to the second source line <b>360</b> through a first diode D<b>1</b>, an inductor L<b>1</b>, and a second coupling switch S<b>4</b>. In another direction, the second source line <b>360</b> is selectively coupled to the first source line <b>350</b> through a second diode D<b>2</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and a first coupling switch S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Diode D<b>1</b> is connected with its cathode to a first side <b>450</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b> and diode D<b>2</b> is connected with its cathode on a second side <b>460</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b>. The first share signal <b>332</b> controls the first coupling switch S<b>3</b> and the second share signal <b>334</b> controls the second coupling switch S<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As an alternate configuration, the diodes may be biased in the opposite directions. In this alternate configuration, first diode D<b>1</b>A would replace first diode D<b>1</b> and second diode D<b>2</b>A would replace second diode D<b>2</b>. The dashed lines indicate connections for diodes D<b>1</b>A and D<b>2</b>A in the alternate configuration. Each of the two configurations will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first switch S<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the second switch S<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the first coupling switch S<b>3</b>, and the second coupling switch S<b>4</b> may be configured as appropriate switching circuitry for carrying the voltages connected thereto. As non-limiting examples, the switches may be configured of MOS transistors such as p-channel transistors, n-channel transistors, and transmission gates. In some embodiments, the MOS transistor may be configured as high voltage transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a timing diagram showing control signals for various switches of the timing controller <b>300</b> and inductive coupler <b>400</b>. In describing the waveforms, reference will be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>. Waveform C<sub>S1,S2 </sub>shows the switch positions for the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b>. Waveform C<sub>S3 </sub>shows the first share signal <b>332</b> controlling the first coupling switch S<b>3</b>. Waveform C<sub>S4 </sub>shows the second share signal <b>334</b> controlling the second coupling switch S<b>4</b>. Waveform C<sub>S3A </sub>shows the first share signal <b>332</b> controlling the first coupling switch S<b>3</b> for the alternate configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Waveform C<sub>S4A </sub>shows the second share signal <b>334</b> controlling the second coupling switch S<b>4</b>. For the alternate configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In waveforms C<sub>S3</sub>, C<sub>S4</sub>, C<sub>S3A</sub>, and C<sub>S4A </sub>a low indicates that the switch is open and a high indicates that the switch is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Waveform C<sub>S3A </sub>and waveform C<sub>S4A </sub>are shown with the dashed lines to indicate the alternate configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that includes the first and second diodes biased in the configuration illustrated as D<b>1</b>A and D<b>2</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, operation of the first configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that includes the first and second diodes biased in the configuration illustrated as D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> will be discussed first.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">During a first time period (may also be referred to as a first display time), the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in the first position as indicated by the 1 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. The inductive coupler <b>400</b> is inactive with first coupling switch S<b>3</b> open and second coupling switch S<b>4</b> open. As a result, the first capacitor C<b>1</b> will charge to the high supply voltage <b>310</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> will charge to the low supply voltage <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">During a second time period (may also be referred to as a first gap time), after the first time period, the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in the second position as indicated by the 2 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. For at least a portion of this first gap time, the second coupling switch S<b>4</b> is closed as indicated by waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. As a result, the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> are coupled together through diode D<b>1</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and the second coupling switch S<b>4</b>. Therefore, the stored energy will be moved between the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> and will not need to come from the power supplies.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, the inductor L<b>1</b> connected across the capacitors by the second coupling switch S<b>4</b> will discharge the voltage across the capacitors to a midpoint voltage (which may be zero in some embodiments) therebetween, but it will do it in an almost lossless fashion and store the energy magnetically in the inductor L<b>1</b>. Past the midpoint, the inductor L<b>1</b> will then drive the voltages on the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> in the same direction they were going to reverse the voltages thereon past the midpoint. Of course, there may be some losses in the inductor, switches, and any distributed resistance, which will dissipate some of the stored energy, but most of the energy stored in the inductor L<b>1</b> will be used to reverse the voltage. Then, only a small voltage drive from the high supply voltage <b>310</b> and the low supply voltage <b>320</b> will be needed to restore the losses not recoverable by the inductive coupler <b>400</b>. As a result, the power consumed in alternating the capacitor charge voltages will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">By preserving the energy used to switch the voltages, the power input from the power supply (i.e., the high voltage source line <b>310</b> and the low voltage source line <b>320</b>) may be reduced by more than an additional 60% relative to conventional charge sharing circuits. The energy lost in switch resistance may be reduced by using larger switches so that the power input may be made to approach zero.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The on time for the first coupling switch S<b>3</b>, during the first gap time, only needs to be long enough for the voltages to swing to their new values. The first diode D<b>1</b> is in series with the inductor L<b>1</b> and is forward biased during the energy sharing. As a result, if the first coupling switch S<b>3</b> remains on for a longer portion of the first gap time, the first diode D<b>1</b> will prevent reverse energy sharing from the second source line <b>360</b> to the first source line <b>350</b> because the first diode D<b>1</b> would become reverse biased.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">During a third time period (may also be referred to as a second display time), after the second gap time, the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in the third position as indicated by the 3 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. The inductive coupler <b>400</b> is inactive with first coupling switch S<b>3</b> open and second coupling switch S<b>4</b> open. As a result, the second capacitor C<b>2</b> will charge to the high supply voltage <b>310</b> and the first capacitor C<b>1</b> will charge to the low supply voltage <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">During a fourth time period (may also be referred to as a second gap time), after the third time period, the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in the second position as indicated by the 2 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. For at least a portion of this second gap time, the first coupling switch S<b>3</b> is closed as indicated by waveform C<sub>S3</sub>. As a result, the second capacitor C<b>2</b> and the first capacitor C<b>1</b> are coupled together through diode D<b>2</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and the first coupling switch S<b>3</b>. Therefore, the stored energy will be moved between the capacitors C<b>2</b> and C<b>1</b> and will not need to come from the power supplies. Operation of the inductive coupling during the second gap time is the same as explained above for the first gap time except current flows in the opposite direction through diode D<b>2</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and the first coupling switch S<b>3</b> rather than through diode D<b>1</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and the second coupling switch S<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After the second gap time, the timing process may repeat as long as needed with the first display time, the first gap time, the second display time, and the second gap time. During the first display time and the second display time, once the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> are fully charged to their respective voltages, the first switch S<b>1</b> and second switch S<b>2</b> may remain in their appropriate positions for an indefinite period determined by the needs of the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, operation of the alternate configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that includes the first and second diodes biased in the configuration illustrated as D<b>1</b>A and D<b>2</b>A is now considered.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first time periods (e.g., first display times) and control of the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are the same as in the first configuration as indicated by the 1 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. Similarly, the third time periods (e.g., second display times) and control of the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are the same as in the first configuration as indicated by the 3 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the alternate configuration, during the second time period (i.e., first gap time), after the first time period, the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in the second position as indicated by the 2 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. For at least a portion of this first gap time, the first coupling switch S<b>3</b> is closed as indicated by waveform C<sub>S3A</sub>. As a result, the first capacitor C<b>1</b> and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> are coupled together through the first coupling switch S<b>3</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and second diode D<b>2</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the alternate configuration, during the fourth time period (i.e., second gap time), after the third time period, the first switch S<b>1</b> and the second switch S<b>2</b> are in the second position as indicated by the 2 in waveform C<sub>S4</sub>. For at least a portion of this second gap time, the second coupling switch S<b>4</b> is closed as indicated by waveform C<sub>S4A</sub>. As a result, the second capacitor C<b>2</b> and the first capacitor C<b>1</b> are coupled together through the second coupling switch S<b>4</b>, the inductor L<b>1</b>, and first diode D<b>1</b>A.</p>

In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, control signal D is similar to C<sub>S3 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and control signal C is similar to C<sub>S4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first display time <b>710</b>, the first gap time <b>720</b>, the second display time <b>730</b>, and the second gap time <b>740</b> are also shown.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a timing diagram showing output waveforms (<b>850</b> and <b>860</b>) and control signals (A, B, C, and D) for various switches of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> except the voltages for node N<b>1</b> are included and shown as waveform <b>850</b> and the voltages for node N<b>2</b> are included and shown as waveform <b>860</b>. In addition, the first display time and second display time are shortened (indicated by wavy disconnect lines) and the first gap time and second gap time are expanded. Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates that the control signals C and D encompass the entire first gap time and entire second gap time, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Operation of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>. When signal A is asserted (i.e., A is high and A&#x2dc; is low) during the first display time <b>710</b>, the first high switch M<b>1</b> will conduct to pull node N<b>1</b> to the high supply voltage <b>310</b> and the second low switch M<b>4</b> will conduct to pull node N<b>2</b> to the low supply voltage <b>320</b>. Waveform segment <b>850</b>-<b>1</b> shows node N<b>1</b> charging to the high voltage and waveform segment <b>860</b>-<b>1</b> shows node N<b>2</b> charging to the low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">During the first gap time <b>720</b>, transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, and M<b>4</b> are all off because signal A is negated and signal B is negated. When signal C is asserted, the second coupling switch M<b>6</b> conducts causing the total voltage of the two supplies (Vhigh and Vlow), minus a diode drop across diode D<b>1</b>, loss in the inductor L<b>1</b>, and any switch resistance effect in transistor M<b>6</b>, to appear across the inductor L<b>1</b>. The resulting current will pull node N<b>1</b> low while pulling node N<b>2</b> high. Waveform segment <b>850</b>-<b>2</b> shows node N<b>1</b> discharging to an intermediate low voltage and waveform segment <b>860</b>-<b>2</b> shows node N<b>2</b> charging to an intermediate high voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Ideally, with no resistive losses or diode losses, the voltages at nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> would reverse exactly as the current in inductor L<b>1</b> falls to zero and the voltage across it is allowed to go to zero by reversing the voltage across the diode D<b>1</b>. Although the ideal is a complete exchange of voltages between nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b>, the losses of switch and inductor resistance, and the diode drop will prevent complete reversal. However, the intermediate high voltage and intermediate low voltage reached in embodiments of the present invention are still a significant improvement over conventional charge sharing techniques wherein nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> would only reach a midpoint between the high voltage and the low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For a complete energy reversal, an asserted time for node C should be at least as long as the time the inductor L<b>1</b> takes to reverse the voltages. Once node C is negated, signal B can be asserted for the second display time <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When signal B is asserted (i.e., B is high and B&#x2dc; is low) during the second display time <b>730</b>, the second high switch M<b>2</b> will conduct to pull node N<b>2</b> the rest of the way from the intermediate high voltage to the high voltage as indicated by waveform segment <b>860</b>-<b>3</b>. In addition, with signal B asserted, the first low switch M<b>3</b> will conduct to pull node N<b>1</b> the rest of the way from the intermediate low voltage to the low voltage as indicated by waveform segment <b>850</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the voltages need to reverse again, signal B can be negated to enter the second gap time <b>740</b>. During the second gap time <b>740</b>, transistors M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, and M<b>4</b> are all off because signal A is negated and signal B is negated. When signal D is asserted, the first coupling switch M<b>5</b> conducts causing the total voltage of the two supplies (Vhigh and Vlow), minus a diode drop across diode D<b>2</b>, loss in the inductor L<b>1</b>, and any switch resistance effect in transistor M<b>5</b>, to appear across the inductor L<b>1</b>. The resulting current will pull node N<b>2</b> low while pulling node N<b>1</b> high. Waveform segment <b>850</b>-<b>4</b> shows node N<b>1</b> charging to the intermediate high voltage and waveform segment <b>860</b>-<b>4</b> shows node N<b>2</b> discharging to the intermediate high voltage. After allowing sufficient time for the current in the inductor L<b>1</b> to again fall to zero, signal D can be negated, and signal A can be asserted to begin the process again with another first display time <b>710</b>. The voltages on nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> can be reversed in alternation for an entire LCD row (or column depending on the pixel array <b>250</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) configuration) with each voltage reversal powered in part by energy stored and released from the inductor L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In practice, there are losses associated with switching the inductor into place, and from losses in the inductor, so that not all the stored energy can be recovered. These losses may be compensated by driving the capacitors to the correct voltages using switches to a power supply voltage. Losses may be reduced, for example, by using low resistance switches and inductors, which enable the required external drive power to approach a theoretical limit near zero.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a graph showing energy saving improvements for embodiments of the invention relative to the conventional circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there may be distributed resistance (not shown) due to routing, such as, for example, between the first coupling switch M<b>5</b> and the capacitor C<b>1</b> (which may be a distributed capacitance). Similarly, there may be distributed resistance (not shown) due to routing, such as, for example, between the second coupling switch M<b>6</b> and the capacitor C<b>2</b> (which may be a distributed capacitance). The values for resistance used in the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may include, for example, values from routing resistance, diode resistance, inductor resistance, and switch resistance. The graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrate simulations of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with the capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> each having a capacitance of 5 nanoFarads and various values for resistance relative to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the same values for resistance and capacitance. In other words, the graphs show a percentage improvement for energy sharing in an embodiment of the invention relative to charge sharing in the conventional circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Line <b>910</b> shows a percentage improvement for a resistance of 10 ohms. Line <b>920</b> shows a percentage improvement for a resistance of 20 ohms. Line <b>930</b> shows a percentage improvement for a resistance of 40 ohms. Line <b>940</b> shows a percentage improvement for a resistance of 80 ohms. Line <b>950</b> shows a percentage improvement for a resistance of 160 ohms. Line <b>960</b> shows a percentage improvement for a resistance of 320 ohms. As can be seen, even with a high resistance of 320 ohms, there is about a 20% improvement and with a relatively low resistance of 10 ohms, there is over a 70% improvement.</p>
