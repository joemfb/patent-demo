<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to a transluminal device with an adjustable variable stiffness flexible shaft. In particular, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to endoscopes, catheters and other transluminal devices that are inserted into a body. Embodiments of the present invention also cover methods of using such devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A transluminal device is a flexible instrument introduced into the body for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. These devices are inserted into the body through a natural or an artificially created opening, and are delivered to a work site inside the body through a body channel, such as, for example, the esophagus, a blood vessel, etc. Examples of transluminal devices include endoscopes, catheters, etc. Although the invention may be broadly applied to any transluminal device, for the sake of brevity and as an exemplary embodiment, the invention will be described as being applied to an endoscope in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Endoscopes are widely used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes inside a body. There are many different uses for endoscopes, and typically, endoscope designs may be varied to optimize their performance for an intended application. For example, there are upper endoscopes for examination of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum, urethroscopes for examining the urethra and bladder, colonoscopes for examining the colon, angioscopes for examining the blood vessels and heart, bronchoscopes for examining the bronchi, laparoscopes for examining the peritoneal cavity, arthroscopes for examining joint spaces, etc. Each of these devices may include features to optimize their performance for the intended application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In typical applications, a distal end of an endoscope is inserted into the body through a natural anatomic opening, such as, for example, the mouth, anus, vagina, etc. Endoscopes may also be inserted into the body through an incision created for the purpose. The distal end of the endoscope then proceeds from the point of insertion to a region of interest (work site) within the body by traversing a body channel. The endoscope may also include one or more lumens configured to deliver various diagnostic or treatment devices to the work site within the body. These diagnostic or treatment devices may include, among others, a light source, a viewing device, an irrigation lumen, an aspiration lumen, a temperature sensor, a heating probe, an ultrasonic sensor, a laser catheter or the like. These and other devices that may be used with an endoscope are broadly referred to as therapeutic or diagnostic tools in this application. Therapeutic tools configured for specific therapeutic tasks (such as, for example, incision, grasping, stitching, etc.) may also be delivered to the work site through the lumens of the endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To minimize patient discomfort, the diameter of an endoscope may be maintained at a size below the size of the body channel through which the endoscope passes. This size restriction may limit the number and size of the lumens in the endoscope. To minimize patient discomfort, endoscopes must also be sufficiently flexible to permit the distal end of the endoscope to follow the body cavity as the distal end progresses toward the work site. For example, as the endoscope traverses the hepatic flexure region of the digestive track, increased flexibility may be desirable. While greater endoscope flexibility may enable the endoscope to traverse tortuous body channels, it may be desirable to increase the stiffness of selected regions of the endoscope for improved maneuverability. For instance, when traversing the transverse colon region of the digestive track, increasing the stiffness of selected regions of the endoscope may be advantageous. Varying the stiffness of selected regions of the endoscope may also prevent kinking of the lumens passing therethrough.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of the invention may include a transluminal device. The transluminal device may include an elongate section extending between a proximal end and a distal end of the device. The elongate section may be configured to be inserted into a body cavity. The device may include a balloon within the elongate section between the proximal end and the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following aspects: a flexibility of the elongate section may be configured to decrease when the balloon is inflated, and the flexibility may be configured to increase when the balloon is deflated; the balloon may extend substantially from the proximal end to the distal end of the elongate section; a length of the balloon may be substantially smaller than a length of the elongate section; the balloon may include multiple independently inflatable segments; some segments of the multiple segments may be configured to inflate and deflate independently of other segments; the balloon may be fixed in the device; the device may include a lumen extending within the elongate section from the proximal end to the distal end, and the balloon may be positioned within the lumen and configured to be axially movable between the proximal end and the distal end; the device may be an endoscope; the balloon may have a semicircular cross-sectional shape.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment of the invention may include a method of using a transluminal device. The method may include inserting a distal end of the device into a body cavity. The device may include a lumen extending from a proximal end of the device to the distal end. The method may also include positioning a balloon at a first location within the lumen, the first location being a location between the proximal end and the distal end, and moving the balloon from the first location to a second location in the lumen between the proximal end and the distal end. The method may also include inflating the balloon by admitting a fluid therein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Various embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following aspects: the method may further include inserting the balloon into the lumen; the step of inflating the balloon may be performed after positioning the balloon at the first location; the step of inflating the balloon may be performed before positioning the balloon at the first location; the method may further include deflating the balloon by removing the fluid therefrom; deflating the balloon may increase a flexibility of the device; inflating the balloon may include inflating a first section of the balloon independent of a second section of the balloon by admitting fluid into the first section while not admitting fluid into the second section, the first section and the second sections being different sections of the balloon; and inflating the balloon decreases a flexibility of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment of the invention may include a transluminal device. The device may include an elongate section extending between a proximal end and a distal end of the device. The elongate section may include a first region and a second region between the proximal end and the distal end. The device may also include a balloon. The balloon may be configured to increase a flexibility of the first region. The inflatable balloon may also be configured to increase the flexibility of the second region independently of increasing the flexibility of the first region.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the following aspects: the balloon may be configured to radially expand from a deflated configuration to an inflated configuration by admitting a fluid therein; the flexibility of the first region may be configured to increase from a first value corresponding to the deflated condition of the balloon to a second value corresponding to the inflated condition of the balloon; the device may also include a lumen extending within the elongate section from the proximal end to the distal end; the balloon may be disposed within the lumen; the balloon may be movable from the first region to the second region; the balloon may extend substantially from the proximal end to the distal end of the elongate section; a length of the balloon may be substantially smaller than a length of the elongate section; the balloon may include multiple segments that are configured to inflate and deflate separated by sections that do not substantially inflate and deflate when the fluid is admitted into or removed from the balloon; some segments of the multiple segments may be configured to inflate and deflate independently of other segments; the balloon may be fixed in the device; and the device may further include a wire configured to move the balloon between the first region and the second region.</p>

The flexibility of elongate member <b>12</b> may enable endoscope <b>10</b> to bend and pass through tortuous body passages as distal end <b>30</b> advances to work site <b>28</b>. The endoscope <b>10</b> may be constructed of a plurality of materials some or all of which may be biocompatible. Typically, a part of the endoscope <b>10</b> that contacts the internal surfaces of a body may be made substantially of a biocompatible material.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The endoscope <b>10</b> may include a plurality of lumens <b>14</b> running longitudinally therethrough. Each lumen <b>14</b> may extend between the proximal end <b>20</b> external to the body and the distal end <b>30</b> internal to the body. In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the lumens may be substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis <b>26</b> of the endoscope <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, lumens <b>14</b> may be formed integrally with endoscope <b>10</b>, while in other embodiments lumens <b>14</b> may resemble small hollow tubes (or catheters) through a longitudinal cavity of endoscope <b>10</b>. The lumens <b>14</b> may have any size and shape. In some embodiments, different lumens included in endoscope <b>10</b> may have different sizes and/or shapes. In some embodiments, some of lumens <b>14</b> may be dedicated for a particular task while other lumens may be hollow cavities, or working lumens, through which a desired therapeutic or diagnostic tool <b>50</b> may be delivered to work site <b>28</b>. Some of lumens <b>14</b> dedicated for a particular task may include an irrigation lumen, an aspiration lumen, an illumination lumen, and a viewing lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The irrigation lumen may be configured to deliver a fluid (such as, for example, a cleaning fluid) to work site <b>28</b>. Irrigation lumen, therefore, may be configured to facilitate fluid flow therethrough. In some embodiments, proximal end <b>20</b> of the irrigation lumen may be configured to be attached to a source of fluid. In some embodiments, distal end <b>30</b> of the irrigation lumen may have devices (such as nozzles) configured to alter the flow of fluid exiting the lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aspiration lumen may be configured to remove fluid from work site <b>28</b>. Aspiration lumen may, therefore, be configured to facilitate suction and/or fluid flow. In some embodiments, the flow of fluid through the aspiration lumen and the irrigation lumen may be in substantially opposite directions. For example, fluid may flow through an irrigation lumen towards the distal end <b>30</b>, while fluid flow through the aspiration lumen may be towards the proximal end <b>20</b>. Fluid flow through an irrigation lumen and an aspiration lumen may be independently operated, or their operation may be coordinated to perform a function, such as the extraction of a tissue sample from work site <b>28</b>. In these embodiments, fluid may be delivered to work site <b>28</b> through the irrigation lumen, and a tissue sample may be removed from work site <b>28</b> through the aspiration lumen along with the fluid. The proximal end <b>20</b> of the aspiration channel may also be configured to be attached to a source of suction and/or a container configured, for example, to collect the tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The viewing lumen may include devices configured to display a visual image of work site <b>28</b> external to the body. These devices may include imaging means (such as lens for a CCD, CMOS, or other camera) at distal end <b>30</b> and cables (electrical and/or optical cables) configured to transmit a recorded image to a display device external to the body. The illumination lumen may include devices configured to illuminate work site <b>28</b>. These devices may include illumination devices (such as bulbs and/or other solid state light emitting devices) at distal end <b>30</b> and cables (such as fiber optic cables and/or light guides) configured to deliver power and other signals (such as, instructions) to these illumination devices. In some embodiments, viewing and illumination lumens may include a lens and/or other devices that facilitate illumination and viewing of work site <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The working lumens may include a hollow cavity that extend from proximal end <b>20</b> to distal end <b>30</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>. These lumens <b>14</b> may be configured to deliver a therapeutic tool or diagnostic <b>50</b> to work site <b>28</b>. A distal end of the therapeutic tool <b>50</b> may be inserted into a lumen <b>14</b> and pushed down the length of elongate section <b>12</b> to extend an end effector <b>22</b> at work site <b>28</b>. One or more therapeutic or diagnostic tools <b>50</b> may be delivered to work site <b>28</b> through lumen <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some or all of these lumens <b>14</b> may have a substantially circular cross-section. However, it is also contemplated that they may have any suitable shape, size, and/or configuration. For instance, in some embodiments, the shape of the lumen <b>14</b> may be specially tailored to pass an end effector <b>22</b> without a corresponding increase in diameter of endoscope <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therapeutic tool <b>50</b> may include a shaft <b>24</b> that connects the end effector <b>22</b> to an actuation device (not shown) external to the body. The actuation device may be configured to operate the end effector <b>22</b>. Operation of the end effector <b>22</b> may include performing a desired therapeutic task at work site <b>28</b>. The end effector <b>22</b> may include any medical instrument configured to perform the desired therapeutic task at the work site <b>28</b>. Non-limiting examples of end effectors <b>32</b> may include biopsy forceps, baskets, graspers, snares, surgical knifes, needles, suturing instruments, heating elements for cauterizing instruments, a laser lithotripter, etc. In some embodiments, the actuation device may also be configured to move (that is, translate, rotate, etc.) the end effector <b>22</b> at work site <b>28</b>. The actuation device may be attached to proximal end <b>20</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> and may be part of a larger control mechanism or it may be a separate control mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Endoscope <b>10</b> may also include an inflatable balloon <b>40</b> passing therethrough. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be any device that may radially expand (inflate) when filled with a fluid, and radially contract when the fluid is removed. In addition to radial expansion, inflation of some embodiments of inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may also include longitudinal expansion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an illustration of an embodiment of distal end <b>30</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>. It should be emphasized that the structure of the endoscope illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is exemplary only, and in general, the inventive concepts of the current application may be applied to any endoscope known in the art. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, some external parts of endoscope <b>10</b> have been removed to illustrate parts within. As described earlier, multiple lumens <b>14</b> may extend from proximal end <b>20</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> to distal end <b>30</b>. Some of these lumens <b>14</b> may be dedicated for a particular task while other lumens may be hollow cavities, or working lumens, through which a desired therapeutic tool <b>50</b> may be delivered to work site <b>28</b>. An inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may also extend to distal end <b>30</b> alongside lumens <b>14</b>. Although inflatable balloon <b>40</b> is depicted as a relatively large semicircular segment in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may possess any shape and size. In some embodiments, the shape and size of inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be tailored to optimize the use of available space within endoscope <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may include a taper at one or both of its proximal and distal ends. The tapered end of the balloon <b>40</b> may help in moving the balloon through the lumen. In some embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may include reinforcing features such as webbing in the walls or the surface to increase a stiffness and/or the strength of the balloon <b>40</b> in selected regions. In some embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may include internal stylets, support catheters or the like to assist in advancing the balloon <b>40</b> through a lumen. In some embodiments, the wall thickness of the material may be selected based on a desired strength or rigidity of the balloon <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may include filament loops or other connectors to assist in retracting the balloon <b>40</b> or to move the balloon <b>40</b> from one location to another.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may extend through a lumen <b>14</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> while in other embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be embedded in endoscope <b>10</b>. In embedded embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be built-in anywhere in endoscope <b>10</b>. In embodiments where inflatable balloon <b>40</b> extends through lumen <b>14</b>, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may extend through any lumen <b>14</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>. The balloon <b>40</b> may also have a shape to match the shape of the lumen. In these embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be an accessory that an operator may insert into lumen <b>14</b> and inflate as desired. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may also be pre-fixed in a lumen. In such an embodiment, an operator may insert a lumen with an inflatable balloon <b>40</b> pre-attached to it, into endoscope <b>10</b>. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may include an expandable sheath <b>42</b> enclosing a cavity. Sheath <b>42</b> may be constructed from any biocompatible material, including elastomeric, rubber, or other materials which permits inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to be radially flexible. Non-limiting examples of balloon <b>40</b> materials may include materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Nylon. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be configured to inflate and deflate as desired to selectively vary the flexibility of endoscope <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the sheath <b>42</b> of balloon <b>40</b> may have a low compliance to support the endoscope without overexpansion. In general, the balloon <b>40</b> may have any cross-sectional shape and length. For example, in some embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may have a cross-sectional shape that is circular, semi-circular, oval, elliptical, or another curved shape. In some embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of balloon <b>40</b> may resemble the segment of a circle. It is also contemplated that, in some embodiments, the shape of balloon <b>40</b> may resemble an annular ring or a segment of an annular ring.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Inflation of inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be accomplished by filling the sheath <b>42</b> with a fluid. Any fluid, such as air, water or a liquid, may be used to fill inflatable balloon <b>40</b>. Deflating inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be accomplished by draining the fluid from sheath <b>42</b>. In the deflated configuration, endoscope <b>10</b> may be highly flexible. That is, elongate member <b>12</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> may flex or bend relatively easily. This flexibility of elongate member <b>12</b> may assist endoscope <b>10</b> to navigate around curved or winding body cavities as it advances towards work site <b>28</b>. In the inflated configuration, the flexural rigidity (&#x201c;rigidity&#x201d;) of the portion of endoscope <b>10</b> that include inflatable balloon <b>40</b> increases. That is, the flexibility of elongate member <b>12</b> decreases. Controlling the amount of fluid in inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may vary the flexibility of endoscope <b>10</b> between low flexibility (that is, high rigidity) in a fully inflated configuration to high flexibility (that is, low rigidity) in a fully deflated configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be fluidly coupled to a fluid (air, water, liquid, etc.) source at proximal end <b>20</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>. The fluid source may include any reservoir of the fluid such as, for example, a tank of air, a needle or other reservoir of fluid, etc. Proximal end of endoscope <b>10</b> may also include a control mechanism (or other activation means) that may be used to inflate and deflate inflatable balloon <b>40</b>. The control mechanism may include, but not limited to, pumps (manual, electric, etc.), storage reservoirs (tanks, etc.), valves (mechanical, electric, electronic, etc.), computer controls, etc. In some embodiments, the control mechanism may include programmable logic that enables the inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to be inflated to suit a particular region of the body. The control mechanism may be included along with other controls of endoscope <b>10</b>, or it may be a stand alone control mechanism. In one embodiment, the control mechanism may be operated to pump fluid from the fluid source to inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to increase the rigidity of endoscope <b>10</b>. The control mechanism may also be operated to drain fluid from inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to deflate inflatable balloon <b>40</b>, and thereby, increase the flexibility of endoscope <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may provide the ability to control the flexibility of endoscope <b>10</b> during a therapeutic procedure. In some instances it may be desirable to change the flexibility of an endoscope during a procedure. For example, as endoscope <b>10</b> is inserted into the human body, a sufficiently stiff distal end <b>30</b> may permit endoscope <b>10</b> to be pushed into the body cavity. During insertion, a stiff distal end <b>30</b> may prevent endoscope <b>10</b> from bending on itself or kinking when being pushed into a tight body cavity or lumen. When distal end <b>30</b> traverses through a bend in body cavity to reach work site <b>28</b>, it may be desirable to sufficiently decrease the stiffness of endoscope <b>10</b> to allow distal end <b>30</b> to navigate the bend without damaging body tissue. Once distal end <b>30</b> reaches work site <b>28</b>, for some therapeutic tasks, it may be desirable to make the distal end <b>30</b> more rigid or more flexible to perform the medical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Endoscope <b>10</b>, which encloses lumens <b>14</b> and inflatable balloon <b>40</b>, may be constructed by any means known in the art. In some embodiments, multiple lumens <b>14</b> and inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be enclosed by a winding <b>44</b>. Winding <b>44</b> may be made of any material, such as a metal, an elastomeric, a plastic, a fabric, or a rubber material. Winding <b>44</b> may have the form of a thin strip of material wrapped around lumens <b>14</b> and inflatable balloon <b>40</b>. This structure of the winding <b>44</b> may enable endoscope <b>10</b> to be flexible. Winding <b>44</b> may be covered by an inner cover <b>46</b> and an outer cover <b>46</b>. Inner cover <b>46</b> and/or outer cover <b>48</b> may comprise water proof material that prevents biological fluids from seeping into endoscope <b>10</b>. Inner cover <b>46</b> and/or outer cover <b>48</b> may also be made of flexible biocompatible materials. The external surface of outer cover <b>48</b> may be sufficiently lubricious so that endoscope <b>10</b> may traverse body cavities without patient discomfort. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an embodiment of endoscope <b>10</b> with winding <b>44</b> wrapped by inner cover <b>46</b> and outer cover <b>48</b>, it should be emphasized that this illustration is exemplary only, and endoscope <b>10</b> may have any structure known in the art. For instance, in some embodiments, endoscope <b>10</b> may only include a cover which encloses lumens <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, it may desirable to reduce the radial expansion of endoscope <b>10</b> as inflatable balloon <b>40</b> is inflated. In these embodiments, the number and/or the material of these covers may be chosen to prevent the radial expansion of endoscope <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Balloon <b>40</b> may have any length. In some embodiments, the length of the balloon <b>40</b> may be selected to match the length of a body tract. For instance, in some embodiments, the length of balloon <b>40</b> may approximately match a length of flexible section of a body tract. In some embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may be a continuous length balloon that extends substantially the entire length (from proximal end <b>20</b> to distal end <b>30</b>) of endoscope <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, balloon <b>40</b> may have a length smaller than the length of endoscope <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> illustrate three embodiments of inflatable balloons that may be used with endoscope <b>10</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, inflatable balloon <b>40</b>A extends substantially the entire length of endoscope <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, inflation of inflatable balloon may increase the rigidity of the entire length of endoscope <b>10</b>. Such an embodiment of inflatable balloon <b>40</b>A may be desirable for some therapeutic procedures where increasing the stiffness of the entire endoscope may make the procedure easier.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Inflatable balloon <b>40</b>A may be embedded or fixed in endoscope <b>10</b> or it may extend through a lumen <b>14</b>. In an embodiment where inflatable balloon <b>40</b>A may be embedded, it may be built-in anywhere on endoscope, such as, for example, between winding <b>44</b> and inner cover <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment where inflatable balloon <b>40</b>A extends through a lumen <b>14</b>, inflatable balloon <b>40</b>A may be removed and inserted into lumen <b>14</b> as desired. For embodiments where inflatable balloon <b>40</b> is a continuous length balloon, selectively reducing the stiffness of a region of endoscope <b>10</b> may include removing the inflatable balloon <b>40</b> from that section of endoscope <b>10</b>. Removing inflatable balloon <b>40</b> from a section of endoscope <b>10</b> may include pulling (or pushing) inflatable balloon <b>40</b> away from that section of endoscope <b>10</b>. For instance, to reduce the stiffness of distal end <b>30</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be removed from the distal end <b>30</b> by pulling a section of inflatable balloon <b>40</b> out of lumen <b>14</b> from proximal end <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates an embodiment where the length of inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be smaller than the length of endoscope <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, the location of inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B along the length of endoscope <b>10</b> may be fixed or it may be movable along the length of endoscope <b>10</b>. In embodiments where the location of inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be fixed, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be fixed at a location where it may be desirable to vary endoscope flexibility. In such an embodiment inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be embedded in endoscope <b>10</b> or it may be fixed within lumen <b>14</b>. In an embodiment where the location of inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be varied, inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may travel within lumen <b>14</b>. In such an embodiment, wires, links or other mechanisms attached to inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may extend to proximal end <b>20</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>. Pulling or pushing these wires or links may move inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B along the length of lumen <b>14</b>. These wires, links, or other mechanisms may allow inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B to be pulled into position at a location where a change in endoscope flexibility is desired. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may have any length up to the length of endoscope <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be small and extend only a small length of endoscope <b>10</b>, while in other embodiments inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be longer.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B may be used for therapeutic or diagnostic procedures where it may be desirable to vary the stiffness of selected lengths of endoscope <b>10</b>. For instance, in a colonoscopic procedure, when the tip of the endoscope is advanced halfway up the cecum, it may be helpful for the portion of the endoscope at the anal verge to be relatively rigid and inflexible, while the portion beyond the anal verge may need to be relatively flexible. In such an application, selected regions of the endoscope may be made flexible or rigid by positioning and inflating inflatable balloon <b>40</b>B at the desired location, as the endoscope is advanced through the colon.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates another embodiment of inflatable balloon which may be used to vary the flexibility of endoscope <b>10</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, inflatable balloon <b>40</b>C may include a series of segmented balloons extending from proximal end <b>20</b> to distal end <b>30</b>. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b>C of this embodiment may include multiple balloon segments of length <b>52</b>C separated by a non-inflatable section <b>54</b>. The length of each segment may be the same or it may be different. In an inflated configuration, the non-inflatable sections <b>54</b> may be regions of reduced stiffness that may allow endoscope <b>10</b> to flex about these regions. In some embodiments of inflatable balloon <b>40</b>C, the balloon may extend substantially the entire length of endoscope <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b>C may have a smaller length. In some embodiments, ducts or access ports passing through non-inflatable sections may connect individual balloon segments so that fluid may pass between these segments. In other embodiments, individual balloon segments of the inflatable balloon <b>40</b>C may be inflated individually. In such an embodiment, selected balloon segments may be inflated and selected balloon segments deflated to vary the stiffness of different regions of endoscope <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Inflatable balloon <b>40</b>C may be embedded in endoscope <b>10</b> or it may be pulled to a desired position as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a method of using endoscope <b>10</b> with an adjustable variable stiffness flexible shaft. Endoscope <b>10</b> first may be prepared to be inserted into a body cavity (step <b>110</b>). In some embodiments, this step may include cleaning the endoscope and/or inserting desired devices (such as, for example, illumination and viewing devices) into lumens <b>14</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, this step may include inserting an inflatable balloon <b>40</b> into a lumen <b>14</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> and fluidly coupling inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to a fluid reservoir. As indicated earlier, in some embodiments, inserting an inflatable balloon into lumen <b>14</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> may include inserting a lumen with a pre-attached inflatable balloon into endoscope <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may also be coupled to a link of sufficient length that will extend out of the proximal end of lumen <b>14</b> when inflatable balloon <b>40</b> is inserted into the lumen. In an embodiment where inflatable balloon <b>40</b> is embedded in the endoscope, step <b>110</b> may include coupling inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to the fluid reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The inflatable balloon <b>40</b> at the distal end of endoscope <b>10</b> may be inflated in step <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, this step may also include positioning inflatable balloon <b>40</b> at a desired location (such as, for instance at the distal end <b>30</b> of endoscope <b>10</b>). Positioning inflatable balloon <b>40</b> at a desired location may be accomplished by pushing/pulling a link coupled to inflatable balloon <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, a lumen with an inflatable balloon <b>40</b> disposed within it is pulled/pushed to position inflatable balloon <b>40</b> at a desired location. Inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be positioned at a desired location before or after it is inflated. That is, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be positioned at a desired location before being inflated, or the inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be inflated first before being positioned a desired location. Inflating inflatable balloon <b>40</b> at a desired location may increase the stiffness of that location of endoscope <b>10</b>. In some applications, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be inflated at distal end <b>30</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> to selectively increase the stiffness of the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The distal end <b>30</b> of the endoscope <b>10</b> may be inserted into a body cavity through an anatomic opening in step <b>130</b>. The increased stiffness of the distal end of endoscope <b>10</b> may assist insertion of endoscope <b>10</b> into the body cavity. For example, in an application of inflatable balloon <b>40</b> to a colonoscope (a type of endoscope used for therapeutic procedures on the colon), increased rigidity of the distal end may allow the colonoscope to be inserted into the anal cavity through the anus. The increased rigidity of the distal end may also allow the colonoscope to advance through a constricted anal cavity without compressing or kinking. In some embodiments, the endoscope may be inserted in to the body cavity (step <b>130</b>) before the inflatable balloon is inflated (step <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As distal end <b>30</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> advances through the body cavity, it may be desirable to reduce the stiffness of distal end <b>30</b> to reduce the possibility of trauma to body tissue. The stiffness of distal end <b>30</b> may be reduced by deflating the inflatable balloon slightly. In some embodiments, an operator may deflate and inflate inflatable balloon <b>40</b> multiple times to obtain a desired stiffness of the endoscope distal end <b>30</b>. The desired stiffness of distal end <b>30</b> may be based on experience of the operator and may be a level of inflation that allows endoscope <b>10</b> to advance along the body cavity easily without causing undue trauma to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once distal end <b>30</b> advances into a region of the body cavity which is not constricted, it may be desirable to reduce the rigidity of the region of endoscope <b>10</b> in the unconstricted body cavity further, while maintaining the stiffness of the region of endoscope <b>10</b> in the constricted body cavity (step <b>140</b>). For example, in the application of the colonoscope advancing through the anal canal described earlier, once the colonoscope is past the anal verge (distal end of the anal canal), it may be desirable to keep the region of the colonoscope past the anal verge relatively flexible while maintaining the region of the colonoscope in the anal canal relatively rigid and inflexible. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to increase the stiffness of one region of endoscope while decreasing the stiffness of another region. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to deflate the endoscope shaft to make the shaft soft and/or flexible for easy and non-traumatic removal of the endoscope from the body cavity. In other embodiments it may be desirable to increase the stiffness to a desired level for removal and/or insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To reduce the stiffness of the distal most region of endoscope <b>10</b> while maintaining the stiffness of a region ahead of the distal most end (that is, towards the proximal end), the inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be pulled out of the distal most end using the links coupled to the inflatable balloon <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, inflatable balloon <b>40</b> may be pulled out at about the same rate as endoscope <b>10</b> is pushed into the body cavity to keep the region of the endoscope <b>10</b> in the unconstricted body cavity flexible. In an embodiment of inflatable balloon in the form of a segmented balloon (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), balloon segments proximate the distal most end may be deflated while balloon segments proximal to the distal most end inflated to move the region of increased stiffness towards the proximal end <b>20</b> of endoscope <b>10</b> as the endoscope is inserted into the body cavity.</p>
