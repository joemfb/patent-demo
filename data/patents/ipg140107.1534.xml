<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to, and claims the benefit of priority from, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/001,176, filed Oct. 31, 2007.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to oil pumps, and in particular, a high-performance external involute gear-style oil pump that eliminates or greatly reduces cavitation in the oil pump, thereby increasing the efficiency and performance of the oil pump.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cavitation is an undesirable condition that often occurs in external involute gear-style oil pumps that are commonly used on internal combustion engines. Cavitation occurs when the static pressure at any point in the fluid flow of the fluid being pumped becomes less than the fluid's vapor pressure, thereby creating vapor bubbles in the inlet fluid stream. When this situation arises in an oil pump, vapor bubbles in the inlet oil stream reach the high-pressure side or outlet side of the oil pump and implode, thereby causing noise, vibration, and damage to any surface of the oil pump in which the imploding bubbles touch. The effects of cavitation can range from a loss of oil pump efficiency, a reduction in the oil pumps' output, or more serious effects, such as noise, vibration, and damage to the oil pump's components.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The onset of cavitation is determined by the oil pump's speed, capacity, and inlet design. In addition, external involute gear-style oil pumps tend to cavitate at relatively low operating speeds as compared to other pump designs. Cavitation has caused lubrication issues with many high-performance engines, since many of those engines utilize an external involute gear-style oil pump. Because of this condition, many high-performance engines utilize a dry sump oiling system; however, such dry sump oiling systems are more expensive and complex, thereby increasing the cost and maintenance of such systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a high-performance oil pump for pumping engine oil in an internal combustion engine in order to reduce or eliminate cavitation of the oil in the oil pump. The present invention provides a housing having an inlet for receiving oil and an outlet for discharging oil. At least two gears are rotatably and matingly disposed within a pumping chamber of the housing for pumping oil from the inlet to the outlet. An inlet passageway extends from the inlet to the inlet side of the pumping chamber, and an outlet passageway extends from an outlet side of the pumping chamber to the outlet. A pressure regulating circuit disposed within the housing redirects oil from the outlet side of the pumping chamber to the inlet passageway when the pressure differential between the outlet side of the pumping chamber and the inlet side of the pumping chamber exceeds a predetermined level in order to reduce or eliminate cavitation of oil in the oil pump.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pressure regulation circuit of the present invention provides a pressure relief valve having a spool valve structure disposed within the bore of the housing. A redirect outlet passageway communicates with the outlet side of the pumping chamber and the pressure relief valve. A redirect inlet passageway communicates with the pressure relief valve and the inlet passageway. The pressure relief valve is moveable between a normally closed position, wherein oil is prevented from passing from the redirect outlet passageway to the redirect inlet passageway, and an open position, wherein oil is allowed to pass from the redirect outlet passageway to the redirect inlet passageway. The relief valve is biased in the closed position and moves from the closed position to the open position when the pressure differential between the redirect outlet passageway and the redirect inlet passageway exceeds a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inlet of the housing provides an opening that is communicatable with a supply of oil, and the opening of the inlet has a larger diameter than the inlet passageway. A strainer is removably connected to and extends across the inlet for filtering oil and minimizing a pressure drop of oil prior to entering the inlet passageway. The inlet passageway has a longitudinal axis that extends directly from the inlet to the inlet side of the pumping chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A venting passageway extends from the inlet to the bore in the housing for receiving the relief valve in order to maintain atmospheric pressure on both sides of the relief valve.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to the drawings, the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref> illustrate a high-performance oil pump <b>10</b> of the present invention for reducing or eliminating cavitation of oil in the oil pump <b>10</b>. The oil pump <b>10</b> provides a housing <b>12</b> having an oil pump body <b>14</b> and an oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The oil pump cover <b>16</b> has an inlet <b>18</b> formed therein for receiving oil (not shown) from an oil supply reservoir (not shown), such as an oil pan from an internal combustion engine (not shown). The inlet <b>18</b> is in communication with a hollow pumping chamber <b>20</b> formed in the oil pump body <b>14</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. An outlet <b>22</b> is also formed in the oil pump body <b>14</b> and is in communication with the pumping chamber <b>20</b>. A pair of gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are rotatably disposed within the pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b> and are driven by the engine. The gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> pump oil from the inlet <b>18</b> to the outlet <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b>, and the outlet <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b> is connected to and communicates with an engine block of the engine so as to provide oil to the engine block. A pressure regulation circuit <b>28</b> disposed within the housing <b>12</b> balances oil flow pressure between the inlet <b>18</b> and the outlet <b>22</b> by redirecting a portion of the oil from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b> when the oil flow pressure differential between the outlet <b>22</b> and the inlet <b>18</b> reaches a predetermined level. By allowing oil to flow from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b>, especially under high speed engine conditions, an appropriate amount of oil is supplied to the inlet <b>18</b>, thereby ensuring a proper supply of oil to the pumping chamber <b>20</b> and reducing or avoiding cavitation of the oil in the oil pump <b>10</b>. By reducing or eliminating cavitation, the efficiency and performance of the oil pump <b>10</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to provide the housing <b>12</b> of the present invention with the appropriate structural strength and weight, the oil pump body <b>14</b> and the oil pump cover <b>16</b> of the housing <b>12</b> may be fabricated from billet 6061-T6 aluminum, which is hard-coated and anodized for durability. Although the noted aluminum is an ideal material for the housing <b>12</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b>, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to such material, but rather, various other materials having similar strength and weight properties can be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The oil pump cover <b>16</b> has a substantially cylindrical configuration with the inlet <b>18</b> formed at an open end <b>30</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The initial opening <b>32</b> of the inlet <b>18</b> extends across almost the entire width of the end <b>30</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The intial opening <b>32</b> of the inlet <b>18</b> is relatively large and sized accordingly in order to reduce flow restriction of the oil. A steel mesh strainer <b>34</b> is seated within an annular recess <b>36</b> in the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>, and a removable retaining ring <b>38</b> is also seated in an annular recess <b>40</b> in the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b> so as to secure the strainer <b>34</b> in the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. Since an oil filter (not shown) is typically downstream from the oil pump <b>10</b>, the oil being supplied from the oil pan to the oil pump <b>10</b> is not filtered. Thus, the strainer <b>34</b> filters any contaminates in the oil and prevents such contaminates from entering the oil pump <b>10</b> of the present invention while minimizing the amount of pressure drop across the strainer <b>34</b>. The retaining ring <b>38</b> can be easily removed from the oil pump cover <b>16</b>, thereby allowing regular maintenance to be performed on the strainer <b>34</b>. For example, the strainer <b>34</b> can be removed, cleaned, and replaced in the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. Since the strainer <b>34</b> can provide restriction of the oil flow into the inlet <b>18</b>, the initial opening <b>32</b> of the inlet <b>18</b> from the oil pump cover <b>16</b> is relatively large, as previously mentioned, to ensure for the proper flow of oil into the inlet <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For oil to be pumped from the oil supply to the pumping chamber <b>20</b>, the inlet <b>18</b> in the oil pump cover <b>16</b> provides an inlet passageway <b>42</b> extending from and in communication with the initial opening <b>32</b> of the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. Although the inlet passageway <b>42</b> is smaller in diameter than the initial inlet opening <b>32</b>, the inlet passageway <b>42</b> is still larger than most conventional designs in order to reduce flow restriction of the oil. The length of the inlet passageway <b>42</b> is also designed to be as short a distance as possible to the pumping chamber <b>20</b> in order to reduce the restriction of flow to the incoming oil. Again, the initial opening <b>32</b> is larger than the inlet passageway <b>42</b> to ensure that there is no flow resistance caused by the strainer <b>34</b>. The inlet passageway <b>42</b> has a longitudinal axis that is laterally offset from the longitudinal axis of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>, and the inlet passageway <b>42</b> extends substantially straight through the oil pump cover <b>16</b> to communicate with an inlet side <b>43</b> of the hollow pumping chamber <b>20</b> provided in the oil pump body <b>14</b>. Thus, the inlet <b>18</b> provides communication between the oil supply and the pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In order to pump oil from the oil supply through the inlet <b>18</b> and out through the outlet <b>22</b>, the oil pump cover <b>16</b> has a substantially rectangular stepped configuration, wherein a substantially flat mating surface <b>44</b> on the oil pump cover <b>16</b> abuts a substantially flat mating surface <b>46</b> on the oil pump body <b>14</b>. Four apertures <b>48</b> extend through the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b> and are correspondingly aligned with four threaded apertures <b>50</b> in the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b>. Four conventional threaded fasteners <b>51</b> extend through the apertures <b>48</b> and thread into apertures <b>50</b> to secure the oil pump cover <b>16</b> to the oil pump body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b> are disposed within the hollow pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b> wherein the pumping chamber <b>20</b> is open to the mating surfaces <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b> and the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The pair of gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are external involute gears that are substantially similar and are designed to mesh together in a complementary manner. The first gear <b>24</b> has a throughbore extending along its longitudinal axis for receiving an idler shaft <b>52</b> wherein the first gear <b>24</b> is press fit onto the idler shaft <b>52</b>. The idler shaft <b>52</b> has one of its ends <b>54</b> received within a blind bore <b>56</b> provided in the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. A small trough <b>55</b> provided on the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b> directs oil from the pumping chamber <b>20</b> to the blind bore <b>56</b> to lubricate the end <b>54</b> of the idler shaft <b>52</b>. The other end <b>58</b> of the idler shaft <b>52</b> extends through a throughbore <b>60</b> in the oil pump body <b>14</b>. The throughbore <b>60</b> has a stepped-diameter to secure the idler shaft <b>52</b> in the housing <b>12</b>. The first gear <b>24</b> is then free to rotate with the idler shaft <b>52</b> within the pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second gear <b>26</b> also has a throughbore extending along the longitudinal axis of the second gear <b>26</b>. A drive shaft <b>62</b> is inserted through the throughbore of the second gear <b>26</b> wherein the second gear <b>26</b> is press-fit to the drive shaft <b>62</b>. One end <b>64</b> is seated within a blind bore <b>66</b> extending from the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. A small trough <b>57</b> is provided on the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b> to direct oil from the pumping chamber <b>20</b> to the blind bore <b>66</b> to lubricate the end <b>64</b> of the drive shaft <b>62</b>. A throughbore <b>68</b> extending through the oil pump body <b>14</b> receives the drive shaft <b>62</b>. A free end <b>70</b> of the drive shaft <b>62</b> extends outward beyond the oil pump body <b>14</b> and is coupled to a portion of the engine, such as a crankshaft or a camshaft. The second gear <b>26</b> is disposed within the pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b> and rotates with the drive shaft <b>62</b>. The first and second gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are situated such that when the second gear <b>26</b> is driven by the drive shaft <b>62</b>, the second gear <b>26</b> rotates in a meshing and complementary fashion with the first gear <b>24</b>. Since the drive shaft <b>62</b> is connected to the camshaft or crankshaft of the engine, the speed at which the gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> rotate is in direct relation to the speed of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To pump the oil from the inlet <b>18</b> through to the outlet <b>22</b>, an outlet passageway <b>72</b> extends from an outlet side <b>73</b> of the pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b> to an outlet opening <b>78</b> which extends to an outside landing <b>74</b> on the oil pump body <b>14</b>. The outlet opening <b>78</b> is larger in diameter than the outlet passageway <b>72</b> and is relatively large and sized accordingly in order to reduce the restriction of oil flow. A through-hole <b>76</b> extending from the opposite side of the oil pump body <b>14</b> extends into the outlet opening <b>78</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b>. The through-hole <b>76</b> allows for a fastener (not shown) to extend up through the through-hole <b>76</b>, thereby connecting the landing <b>74</b> of the oil pump body <b>14</b> directly to the engine block of an engine. This allows the oil pump <b>10</b> of the present invention to pump the oil from the inlet <b>18</b> to the outlet <b>22</b> and into the engine block of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to regulate and balance oil flow pressure between the outlet <b>22</b> and the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump, the pressure regulation circuit <b>28</b> provides a relief valve <b>80</b> slidably disposed within the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The relief valve <b>80</b> is movable between a normally closed position, wherein oil is prohibited from flowing from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b>, and an open position, wherein oil is allowed to flow from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b> to ensure a proper supply of oil to the pumping chamber <b>20</b>, thereby reducing or avoiding cavitation of the oil in the oil pump <b>10</b>. The relief valve <b>80</b> is disposed within the oil pump cover <b>16</b> in a blind bore <b>82</b> extending through an integral boss <b>84</b> formed on the outside of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The relief valve <b>80</b> provides a spool valve <b>86</b> slidably disposed within the blind bore <b>82</b> for movement between the closed position and the open position. The spool valve <b>86</b> has a larger diameter portion <b>88</b>, which is slightly smaller than the diameter of the blind bore <b>82</b>, and a smaller diameter portion <b>90</b> that is integral with and extends from the larger diameter portion <b>88</b> of the spool valve <b>86</b>. The smaller diameter portion <b>90</b> of the spool valve <b>86</b> may abut the end of the blind bore <b>82</b> in order to prohibit further movement of the spool valve <b>86</b> at that end of the bore <b>82</b>. The larger diameter portion <b>88</b> of the spool valve <b>86</b> has a blind bore <b>92</b> extending from the end of the spool valve <b>86</b>. A helical compression spring <b>94</b> is inserted into the bore <b>92</b> of the spool valve <b>86</b>, wherein a portion of the helical compression spring <b>94</b> extends outward from the spool valve <b>86</b> and is housed within the blind bore <b>82</b> in the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. A plug <b>96</b> is threaded into corresponding threads provided in the opening of the blind bore <b>82</b> in the boss <b>84</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. The plug <b>96</b> secures the spool valve <b>86</b> and the gear <b>24</b> within the blind bore <b>82</b> in the oil pump cover <b>16</b> and acts as an abutment to one end of the compression spring <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order for the relief valve <b>80</b> to redirect oil from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b> when the flow pressure differential between the outlet <b>22</b> and the inlet <b>18</b> reaches a predetermined level, a redirected outlet passageway <b>98</b> is formed on the mating surface <b>44</b> of the oil pump cover <b>16</b> and is in communication with the outlet side <b>73</b> of the pumping chamber <b>20</b>. This redirected outlet passageway <b>98</b> extends from the pumping chamber <b>20</b> to the end of the blind bore <b>82</b> in the oil pump cover <b>16</b> that houses the relief valve <b>80</b>. This provides communication between the outlet <b>22</b> and the blind bore <b>82</b> housing the relief valve <b>80</b>. Thus, the outlet pressure of the oil is constantly in communication with the relief valve <b>80</b>, and when the outlet pressure becomes great enough to overcome the force of the compression spring <b>94</b> on the spool valve <b>86</b>, the spool valve <b>86</b> will begin to move against the force of the compression spring <b>94</b>. The compression spring <b>94</b> has a predetermined spring force that corresponds to a desired outlet pressure wherein oil from the outlet <b>22</b> is redirected to the inlet <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the outlet pressure becomes too great, the spool valve <b>86</b> moves to the open position, and oil is allowed to flow from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b>. To redirect such flow of oil, a redirected inlet passageway <b>95</b> is provided by a pair of blind bores <b>100</b> that extends between the inlet passageway <b>42</b> and the blind bore <b>82</b> that houses the relief valve <b>80</b>. The blind bores <b>100</b> have longitudinal axes that are substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the inlet passageway <b>42</b>. Thus, the redirected inlet passageway <b>95</b> provides communication from the blind bore <b>82</b> housing the relief valve <b>80</b> to the inlet passageway <b>42</b>. At the end of the pair of blind bores <b>100</b> that extends outward from the oil pump cover <b>16</b>, a plug <b>101</b> is threaded into the oil pump cover <b>16</b> to maintain the oil within the oil pump <b>10</b>. Thus, when the outlet pressure becomes too great and the spool valve <b>86</b> moves to the open position, the oil from the redirected outlet passageway <b>98</b> travels into the blind bore <b>82</b> housing the relief valve <b>80</b> and into the redirected inlet passageway, which allow for oil to travel back to the inlet passageway <b>42</b>. This supply of oil is added to the normal supply of oil in the inlet <b>18</b>, thereby providing an additional supply of oil to the gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> within the pumping chamber <b>20</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. This additional supply of oil ensures a sufficient supply of oil so as to reduce or eliminate the onset of cavitation within the oil pump <b>10</b>. The redirected outlet passageway and the redirected inlet passageway are substantially straight and direct so as to reduce the length and turns within the redirected passageways. This assists in avoiding any flow restriction of the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should also be noted that a small venting passageway <b>102</b> extends from the inlet <b>18</b> to the backside of the spool valve <b>86</b>. This allows atmospheric pressure to be provided on the backside of the spool valve <b>86</b> so that the spool valve <b>86</b> can move freely between the open and closed positions, thereby avoiding vacuum within the blind bore housing the spool valve <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In operation, the initial opening <b>32</b> of the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b> of the present invention may be located within an oil pan of an engine, and the outlet <b>22</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b> may be connected to the engine block of an engine. Once the engine begins operating, the drive shaft <b>62</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b> is driven by the crankshaft or camshaft of the engine. The drive shaft <b>62</b> drives the second gear <b>26</b>, which, in turn, drives the first gear <b>24</b>. As the gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> rotate, the un-meshing of the gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> create a local drop in pressure, which draws the oil into the inlet <b>18</b> of the oil pump <b>10</b> from the oil pan. The incoming oil flows into the pumping chamber <b>20</b> due to the un-meshing of the gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. As the oil pump <b>10</b> speed increases with the engine speed, so does the speed of the gears <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and, as a result, the fill time of the oil into the pumping chamber <b>20</b> is reduced to the point at which the incoming oil does not have enough time to fill the pumping chamber <b>20</b>. This is when cavitation may start to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In order to reduce or eliminate the onset of cavitation, the outlet pressure of the oil begins to reach a level wherein the spool valve <b>86</b> begins to move from the first or closed position, wherein oil is prohibited from flowing from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b>, to the second or open position, wherein a portion of the oil from the outlet <b>22</b> is allowed to flow to the inlet <b>18</b>. As the outlet pressure forces the spool valve <b>86</b> against the compression spring <b>94</b>, the spool valve <b>86</b> continues to move toward the open position until the larger diameter portion <b>88</b> of the spool valve <b>86</b> moves beyond the pair of blind bores <b>100</b> provided in the oil pump cover <b>16</b>. When this occurs, the spool valve <b>86</b> is in the open position, and a portion of the oil travels from the outlet side <b>73</b> of the pumping chamber <b>20</b>, through the redirect outlet passageway <b>98</b>, through the redirect inlet passageway <b>95</b>, through the inlet passageway <b>42</b>, and into the inlet side <b>43</b> of the pumping chamber <b>20</b>. This provides a sufficient amount of oil to the pumping chamber <b>20</b> so that the oil pump <b>10</b> does not begin to cavitate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the oil pressure at the outlet <b>22</b> is reduced, such as by the slowing of the engine, the outlet pressure delivered to the spool valve <b>86</b> begins to drop. When this occurs, the compression spring <b>94</b> forces the spool valve <b>86</b> back toward the closed position, thereby closing the redirect inlet passageway to the inlet passageway <b>42</b>. This prohibits the flow of oil from the outlet <b>22</b> to the inlet <b>18</b>, as there is now a sufficient supply of oil to the pumping chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that various engine configurations may require various oil pump <b>10</b> configurations of the present invention. For instance, the oil inlet <b>18</b> and strainer <b>34</b> may have to be a further distance laterally to communicate with the oil pan. In addition, height limitations may require a reduction in the number or a rerouting of the oil flow passageways. Lastly, various engine sizes may require various size oil pumps <b>10</b> of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but to the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications or equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The scope is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures as is permitted under the law.</p>
