The pointed members each include a plurality of raised grip protuberances thereon, which are oriented inwardly and thus face one another. The pointed members are adapted for use in insertion into a crab leg in order for the raised grip protuberances to be squeezed on opposing sides for gripping of meat contained therein, and which is pulled therefrom via a handle member. The elongated tongs are further defined with an outer surface that is adorned with a non-slip member thereon for use in manually gripping the tool. The elongated tongs connect to form an acute angle being named a juncture from which the handle member extends rearwardly therefrom.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the described embodiments of the application and uses of the described embodiments. As used herein, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; or &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; means &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; or &#x201c;illustrative&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. All of the implementations described below are exemplary implementations provided to enable persons skilled in the art to practice the disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Detailed reference will now be made to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>. A seafood meat extraction tool <b>100</b> (hereinafter invention) includes a pair of elongated tongs <b>101</b> that are of equal size and shape, and which are generally parallel with one another. The elongated tongs <b>101</b> are further defined with a distal end <b>102</b> at which a pointed member <b>103</b> extends inwardly at an angle <b>104</b>. The pointed member <b>103</b> includes at least one sharpened point <b>105</b> that is ideal for skewering meat <b>200</b> thereon. The pointed member <b>103</b> is further defined with an inner surface <b>106</b> that is adorned with at least one raised protuberance <b>107</b>. The raised protuberances <b>107</b> of the pointed members <b>103</b> face one another such that when in use, the raised protuberances <b>107</b> add gripping value to the invention <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The elongated tongs <b>101</b> have a tong length <b>108</b>, and connect at a juncture <b>109</b>. The juncture <b>109</b> forms a biasing force between the elongated tongs <b>101</b> such that the elongated tongs <b>101</b> may be bent towards one another in order for the pointed members <b>103</b> to either touch one another or grip or skewer meat <b>200</b> thereon. The elongated tongs <b>101</b> are further defined with an outer surface <b>110</b> that is provided with a non-slip member <b>111</b> that provides a means with which to grab and manipulate the invention <b>100</b> manually.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The invention <b>100</b> includes a handle member <b>112</b> that extends rearwardly from the juncture <b>109</b> such that the elongated tongs <b>101</b> extend forwardly. The juncture <b>109</b> forms a &#x201c;Y&#x201d; shape between the elongated tongs <b>101</b> and the handle member <b>112</b>. The juncture <b>109</b> forms an acute juncture angle <b>120</b> with respect to the elongated tongs <b>101</b> and the handle member <b>112</b>. The handle member <b>112</b> is of an undefined length <b>113</b>, and has the same width as the elongated tongs <b>101</b>. The handle member <b>112</b> includes a pry member <b>114</b> that is opposite of the juncture <b>109</b>. The pry member <b>114</b> forms a pry angle <b>115</b> with respect to the handle member <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The pry member <b>114</b> is included in order for the invention <b>100</b> to be used to pry open a closed crustacean <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>). The pry member <b>114</b> is ideally used to open the closed crustacean <b>300</b>, and upon which the pointed members <b>103</b> are manipulated in order to skewer and/or grab the meat <b>200</b> contained therein. Moreover, the pry member <b>114</b> is spoon-shaped such that the pry member <b>114</b> may be alternatively used to scoop out meat <b>200</b>. Moreover, the pry member <b>114</b> may be used to serve meat <b>200</b> to the end user. Alternatively, it shall be noted that the pry member <b>114</b> may be used to pry out meat <b>200</b> that is unsuccessfully removed via the elongated tongs <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the invention <b>100</b> may be used to remove meat <b>200</b> from a crab leg <b>400</b>. The elongated tongs <b>101</b> are generally slim in profile, and enable the pointed members <b>103</b> to slide in between the meat <b>200</b> and the shell <b>401</b> of the crab leg <b>400</b>.</p>

<claim-text>1. A seafood meat extraction tool comprising:
<claim-text>a pair of elongated members that are generally parallel with one another, and connect at a juncture, which imposes a biasing force such that the elongated tongs may be squeezed towards one another;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein a handle member extends in an opposing direction with respect to the elongated tongs;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the elongated tongs each include a pointed member that is configured to grab and/or skewer meat;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the pair of elongated tongs are of equal in size and shape, and which are generally parallel with one another; wherein the elongated tongs are further defined with a distal end at which the pointed member extends inwardly at an angle;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the pointed member includes at least one sharpened point that is ideal for skewering meat thereon; wherein the pointed member is further defined with an inner surface that is adorned with at least one raised protuberance; wherein the raised protuberances of the pointed members face one another such that when in use, the raised protuberances add gripping value;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the elongated tongs have a tong length, and connect at a juncture; wherein the elongated tongs are further defined with an outer surface that is provided with a non-slip member that provides a means with which to grab and manipulate the seafood meat extraction tool;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the handle member that extends rearwardly from the juncture such that the elongated tongs extend forwardly; wherein the juncture forms a &#x201c;Y&#x201d; shape between the elongated tongs and the handle member; wherein the juncture forms an acute juncture angle with respect to the elongated tongs and the handle member; wherein the handle member is of an undefined length, and has the same width as the elongated tongs;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the handle member includes a pry member that is opposite of the juncture; wherein the pry member forms a pry angle with respect to the handle member;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the pry member is included in order for the seafood meat extraction tool to be used to pry open a closed crustacean; wherein the pry member is ideally used to open the closed crustacean, and upon which the pointed members are manipulated in order to skewer and/or grab the meat contained therein;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the pry member is spoon-shaped;</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the meat extraction tool is used to remove meat from a crab leg; wherein the elongated tongs are generally slim in profile, and enable the pointed members to slide in between the meat and the shell of the crab leg.</claim-text>
