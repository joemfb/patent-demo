<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure generally relates to automated test equipment and more particularly to determining the integrity of wired communication links by testing for excessive signal loss at various frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous services are being offered over enhanced telephone networks, including broadband Internet access and high definition television services, as well as conventional telephone services. Telephony providers enable these services typically through use of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology, including High Speed DSL (HDSL), Very High Speed DSL (VDSL) and Asymmetric DSL (ADSL) services.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a telephony provider branches into other markets, it is efficient to incorporate existing infrastructure to the extent possible when provisioning new services. For example, a VDSL provider that supports broadband Internet or high definition television services connects to a customer's location through conventional public switched telephone network (PSTN) infrastructure that supports VDSL, including central offices and twisted wire pairs extending to a customer location. Once on premises, though, the VDSL provider may elect to use coaxial cable previously deployed in the customer's home or office (e.g., to support cable television services) to distribute data and video signals to various receivers. However, the VDSL provider must assure that the existing infrastructure adequately supports the requirements of all aspects of the VDSL service, especially across the wire link from the network interface device (NID), which interfaces the customer network and the PSTN, to the customer premises equipment (e.g., a router or residential gateway) that interfaces with the various customer devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">DSL signal loss currently is measured over wired links, such as coaxial cables, with DSL signals present on the line, indicating only an average loss over the entire frequency range and requiring the presence of DSL signals (e.g., from previously provisioned DSL services). Further, automated testers presently exist that enable technicians to determine electrical resistance across coaxial cables when there is signal from the transmit site present on the line, for example. However, testing resistance does not provide the information necessary to determine whether a wired link supports a frequency spectrum sufficient to enable proper functionality of a particular service, such as VDSL.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure relates to a testing apparatus and method for validating the integrity of wiring to ensure that it is capable of supporting broadband telephony services, such as VDSL, before actually connecting the DSL signal to the line. Generally, a transmitter is attached to one end of a portion of wiring to be tested and a receiver is attached to the other end. The transmitter sends signals at multiple frequencies across the section of wiring, which the receiver receives and measures the associated radio frequency (RF) power loss. Excessive loss (e.g., in excess of 3 decibels) at any of the multiple frequencies indicates faulty or potentially inadequate wiring across the tested portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An embodiment of the disclosure provides a low cost, portable electronic testing device that can be utilized by a technician installing, maintaining or servicing high speed data and voice services, for example, on a customer's premises. The tester may also be used in the same manner to test passive devices, such as diplexers and splitter/baluns used for VDSL installation, to identify defective equipment. Further, the transmitter and/or the receiver may include conventional resistance testing capability, enabling the technician to perform line loss as well as resistance testing across the same sections of wiring using a single testing tool.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the foregoing, the present disclosure, through one or more of its various aspects, embodiments and/or specific features or sub-components, is thus intended to bring out one or more of the advantages as specifically noted below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An aspect of the present disclosure provides an apparatus for testing integrity of a wired communication link, such as a coaxial cable and/or a digital subscriber line (DSL) service link. The apparatus includes multiple receivers that receive corresponding signals sent by at least one transmitter over the wired communications link, where the signals have corresponding frequencies within a frequency range of the wired communication link, which frequencies are representative of the frequency range. The apparatus also includes a measurer that measures a signal loss corresponding to each of the frequencies, and an indicator that provides an indication of whether each measured signal loss is within an acceptable range. In an embodiment, the apparatus may further include a resistance tester that tests an electrical resistance on the wired communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The indication of whether each measured signal loss is within an acceptable range may include multiple green indicators corresponding to the frequencies when each measured signal loss is within the acceptable range, and/or at least one red indicator corresponding to at least one of the frequencies when at least one of the frequencies is not within the acceptable range. The indication may include a visual display that displays information regarding whether each measured signal loss is within the acceptable range.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The multiple signals sent by the transmitter may include noise generated across the predetermined frequency range. Each of the receivers may be pre-tuned or adjustably tuned to the multiple frequencies. Alternatively, the multiple signals sent by the transmitter may include pre-tuned or adjustably tuned frequencies, and the receivers may be configured to receive these frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another aspect of the present disclosure provides an apparatus for testing integrity of a wired communication link, configured to enable installation of a DSL service, such as a coaxial cable, by receiving at least one signal transmitted through the wired communications link. The apparatus includes multiple receivers tuned to multiple frequencies to receive the at least one signal transmitted through the wired communications link. The apparatus also includes a determiner that measures signal losses corresponding to the multiple frequencies, and determines whether any of the signal losses exceeds a predetermined threshold. The apparatus further includes an indicator that indicates whether any of the signal losses exceeds the predetermined threshold, as determined by the determiner. The indicator may provide a negative indication when any of the signal losses exceeds the predetermined threshold, such as illuminating a light corresponding to each of the signal losses that exceeds the predetermined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The multiple receivers may be agile receivers that are tunable to the multiple frequencies. Also, the at least one signal transmitted through the communications link may be noise generated across a predetermined frequency range, or the at least one signal may include multiple signals corresponding to the multiple frequencies to which the receivers are tuned.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for testing integrity of a wired communication link. The method includes receiving multiple signals transmitted through the wired communication link at multiple frequencies; measuring multiple signal losses corresponding to the multiple frequencies; determining an amount of signal loss for each of the multiple frequencies; and indicating when the determined amount of signal loss for any of the signal losses exceeds a predetermined threshold. The method may also include indicating when each amount of signal loss for all of the signal losses does not exceed the predetermined threshold. The at least one signal transmitted through the communications link may be noise generated across a predetermined frequency range, and the multiple frequencies are representative of the predetermined frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The various aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure are described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified block diagram of an illustrative environment in which the disclosed apparatus and method may be utilized. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a customer's premises configured for VDSL or other broadband access integration. The services are provided to the customers premises over a telephony network <b>100</b>, such as a public switched telephone network (PSTN), including integrated services digital networks (ISDN), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, and the like. A network interface device (NID) <b>101</b> connects the customer's system to the local loop of the network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The dashed lines <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicate preexisting wiring in the customer's premises, which the service provider typically wants to use, to the extent possible, in order to minimize alterations or additions to the existing customer communications network. Line <b>131</b> shows a preexisting phone line leading to an exemplary telephone <b>110</b>. Lines <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> show preexisting coaxial cable, for example, used for connecting televisions or other video receivers <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> to a cable services provider. The coaxial cable may likewise have been used to provide high speed Internet access to the personal computer (PC) <b>112</b>, depending on the customer's particular configuration. Note that, prior to implementation of VDSL or similar broadband telephony service, the coaxial cables <b>131</b> would not have terminated at the NID <b>101</b>, but rather would have interfaced with a cable network (not pictured). The splitter <b>103</b> indicates an example of how coaxial cable is typically installed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to integrate the broadband telephony service with the various communications media, a router or residential gateway <b>105</b> is added to the customer's network. The residential gateway <b>105</b> provides the interfaces necessary to support each type of technology used by the customer, converting to and from the associated formats. For example, the residential gateway <b>105</b> may include a VDSL modem for interfacing with the network <b>100</b>. Also, as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the residential gateway <b>105</b> may include a wireless access point, such as Bluetooth or 802.11g technology, enabling a wireless local area network on the customer's premises, which would include, for example, the PC <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is typically desirable for the residential gateway <b>105</b> to be installed on a preexisting coaxial cable, such as line <b>132</b>, since the residential gateway <b>105</b> should be centrally located within the premises and may replace, for example, an existing cable modem or router. Also, a new line <b>130</b> is usually run from the NID <b>100</b> to the existing cable network, which was not previously connected to the NID <b>101</b>. The new line <b>130</b> may also be coaxial cable compatible with the existing lines <b>132</b> and <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Because line <b>132</b> provides the critical link between the residential gateway <b>105</b> and the NID <b>101</b> (via the new line <b>130</b>), its integrity must be properly verified prior to installation of the broadband service. This is particularly important to verify when the line <b>132</b> has been previously installed by another service provider and, unlike the new line <b>130</b>, is of an unknown age, condition and quality. The line loss tester of the present disclosure serves this purpose, and can be used to determine the integrity of the line <b>132</b>, for example, between points &#x201c;A&#x201d; and &#x201c;B&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">More particularly, the line loss tester includes a transmitter <b>200</b> and a corresponding receiver <b>300</b>, exemplary embodiments of which are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, respectively. The transmitter <b>200</b> may be attached at point &#x201c;A&#x201d; and the receiver <b>300</b> may be attached at point &#x201c;B,&#x201d; so that the integrity of line <b>132</b> between these points may be quickly and efficiently evaluated by measuring RF loss, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the transmitter <b>200</b> includes a power supply <b>202</b>, which may be a nine volt battery, for example, and a 3-way switch <b>204</b>. The transmitter <b>200</b> is powered down by switching the switch <b>204</b> to the OFF position <b>208</b>. The other positions of switch <b>204</b> depicted in the exemplary embodiment activate a signal generator <b>210</b> and a resistance measurement circuit <b>220</b>. When the switch <b>204</b> is in the OFF position <b>208</b>, a power indicator light <b>206</b> is off, and when the switch <b>204</b> is in any other position, the power indicator light <b>206</b> illuminates a green light, such as a green light emitting diode (LED).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the signal generator <b>210</b> includes a noise generator that generates and transmits noise across a spectrum of frequencies, including the frequency range needed to support the telephony service. For example, standardized VDSL requires a frequency spectrum of 25 kHz through 8.5 MHz, which may be accommodated by coaxial cable, such as the line <b>132</b>. Generating noise across the entire frequency spectrum is particularly efficient, in that the receiver <b>300</b> can receive signals having any frequencies within the entire range and be able to determine the integrity of the wired link, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The signal generator <b>210</b> sends signals through an adapter, such as the coaxial output connector <b>216</b>, which is connected, for example, to line <b>132</b> at point &#x201c;A&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Different embodiments of the transmitter <b>200</b> may include various additional connections, such as, for example, an RJ11 connector to plug into phone jacks, a set of universal clips capable of penetrating the jacketing on twisted pair wiring or connecting to terminals such as on the back of jacks or at the protector, and a female <b>75</b> ohm connector for connecting to a coaxial network, discussed below with respect to the resistance measurement circuit <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In alternative embodiments, the signal generator <b>210</b> transmits carrier signals at different specific frequencies, which may require the signal generator <b>210</b> to include multiple transmitters tuned to different carrier frequencies. Typically, at least three carrier signals are used, e.g., having low, medium and high frequencies within the desired frequency range needed to support the service. However, any number of multiple frequencies may be incorporated in the tester without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. The carrier signals may be preset to particular frequencies, such as 25 kHz, 4.0 MHz and 8.5 MHz, or the carrier signals may be adjustable for added versatility.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transmitter <b>200</b> may also include an optional, conventional resistance measurement circuit <b>220</b>, selectable by operation of the switch <b>204</b>. This enables additional testing functionality to measure electrical resistance on a line. For example, a low resistance, such as 50 ohms or less, indicates an unusable line, while normal resistance, such as 75 ohms, indicates a usable line. When a line is unusable, the indicator light <b>222</b> illuminates a red LED, and when the line is usable, the indicator light <b>222</b> illuminates a green LED. Also, the resistance measurement circuit <b>220</b> enables identification of multiple lines on the customer premises by attaching resistors in various areas and then connecting the transmitter <b>200</b> to a central wiring point. As each line is connected to the transmitter <b>200</b>, a green indication by the indicator light <b>222</b> identifies specific lines having resistors connected at the other end. This further enables the technician to test numerous lines from outside the customer premises using a single testing device. The receiver <b>300</b> need not be attached to the other end of a wired link in order to enable the electrical resistance testing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts the exemplary receiver <b>300</b> which is connected, for example, to line <b>132</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at point &#x201c;B.&#x201d; The receiver <b>300</b> includes features complementary to those of the transmitter <b>200</b>. The receiver <b>300</b> also includes a power supply <b>302</b> and a 4-way switch <b>304</b>, as well as a power indicator light <b>306</b> that illuminates a green LED when the switch <b>304</b> is not in the OFF position <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A receiver section <b>309</b> of the exemplary receiver <b>300</b> includes three receivers tuned to different frequencies selected to adequately sample the range of frequencies needed to determine the integrity of the wired link. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first receiver <b>310</b> is tuned to a low frequency, such as 25 kHz, a second receiver <b>312</b> is tuned to a medium frequency, such as 4.0 MHz, and a third receiver <b>314</b> is tuned to a high frequency, such as 8.5 MHz, to adequately cover the entire frequency spectrum for VDSL services. However, any number and value of multiple frequencies may be incorporated without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure, so long as the frequencies adequately represent the required range to make an accurate determination of line integrity. The receiving section <b>309</b> receives signals transmitted by the signal generator <b>210</b> of the transmitter <b>200</b> through an adaptor compatible with the line being tested, such as a coaxial output connector <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In alternative embodiments, the receivers <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> may be pre-tuned receivers configured to receive specific, predetermined frequencies, or they may be agile receivers capable of being tuned dynamically to receive any frequencies within the desired range. The frequencies are dependant on the configuration of the transmitter <b>200</b>. For example, the embodiment in which the signal generator <b>210</b> sends generated noise across a frequency spectrum, which is the simplest to implement, the frequencies of the receivers <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> do not need to match any particular frequency of the transmitter <b>200</b>. The frequencies need only be within the frequency spectrum and adequately representative of the range required to determine line integrity. However, when the signal generator <b>201</b> sends signals on specific different frequencies, either pre-tuned or variable, each of the receivers <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> must likewise be tuned to receive carriers on these same frequencies for the tester to function properly.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In each embodiment, the receiver section <b>309</b> measures the power of the signals received by each of the receivers <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> and determines whether the RF level is below a predetermined threshold, such as 3 decibels. Indicators corresponding to each of the receivers may be provided to indicate whether the received signals are within acceptable limits. For example, a loss level indicator light <b>311</b> illuminates a red LED when the signal received by the first receiver <b>310</b> is below the threshold, and illuminates a green LED when the signal received by the first receiver <b>310</b> is acceptable. Likewise, loss level indicator lights <b>313</b> and <b>315</b> provide visual indications corresponding to the signals received by the second receiver <b>312</b> and the third receiver <b>314</b>, respectively. Any indication of acceptable and unacceptable signal levels, such as displayed symbols or audible tones, may be incorporated into the tester without departing from the scope and spirit of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The exemplary receiver <b>300</b> also includes a calibration mode <b>307</b>, which is selected by operation of the switch <b>304</b>. The calibration mode <b>307</b> enables the receiver <b>300</b> to be calibrated with the transmitter <b>200</b> prior to testing, in order to assure that the receiver section <b>309</b> knows the power and, when necessary, the frequencies at which signals are sent by the signal generator <b>210</b>. The calibration may be accomplished, for example, by directly connecting the transmitter <b>200</b> and the receiver <b>300</b> through a short piece of coaxial cable.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the exemplary receiver <b>300</b> includes an optional resistance measurement circuit <b>320</b> and corresponding indicator light <b>322</b>. The resistance measurement circuit <b>320</b> is independent of the resistance measurement circuit <b>220</b> of the transmitter <b>200</b>, and is provided as a convenience to the technician. In other words, electrical resistance of various lines may be tested in conjunction with line loss using either the receiver <b>300</b> or the transmitter <b>200</b>, depending on user preference. The functionality of the resistance measurement circuit <b>320</b> is the same as that described above with respect to the resistance measurement circuit <b>220</b>. Also, like the transmitter <b>200</b>, different embodiments of the receiver <b>300</b> may include various connections, such as, for example, an RJ11 connector to plug into phone jacks, a set of universal clips capable of penetrating the jacketing on twisted pair wiring or connecting to terminals such as on the back of jacks or at the protector, and a female 75 ohm connector for connecting to a coaxial network, discussed above with respect to the resistance measurement circuit <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As previously disclosed, the transmitter <b>200</b> and the receiver <b>300</b> are used together to efficiently test the integrity of a wired link, a method of which is depicted in the exemplary flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At step s<b>402</b>, the transmitter <b>200</b> and the receiver <b>300</b> are connected at opposite ends of the link to be tested. For example, the transmitter <b>200</b> is connected at point &#x201c;A&#x201d; and the receiver <b>300</b> is connected at point &#x201c;B&#x201d; of line <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in order to test the level of line loss across that portion of line <b>132</b>. At step s<b>404</b>, the transmitter <b>200</b> generates noise to be transmitted across a range of frequencies, or at least one carrier at a specific frequency, which is then transmitted across the wire link at step s<b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The receiver <b>300</b> receives the generated signals at step s<b>408</b>, and determines whether the RF loss across the line being tested is acceptable to enable support of the desired services. The receiver section <b>309</b> includes multiple receivers, such as the first receiver <b>310</b>, the second receiver <b>312</b> and the third receiver <b>314</b>, each of which are tuned for different frequencies. At step s<b>410</b>, it is determined whether the signal level corresponding to the frequency received by the first receiver <b>310</b> is within limits. If YES, a green LED is illuminated at step s<b>412</b>; if NO, a red LED is illuminated at step s<b>414</b>. At step s<b>420</b>, it is determined whether the signal level corresponding to the frequency received by the second receiver <b>312</b> is within limits. If YES, a green LED is illuminated at step s<b>422</b>; if NO, a red LED is illuminated at step s<b>424</b>. At step s<b>430</b>, it is determined whether the signal level corresponding to the frequency received by the third receiver <b>314</b> is within limits. If YES, a green LED is illuminated at step s<b>432</b>; if NO, a red LED is illuminated at step s<b>434</b>. When the three green indicators are illuminated, the wire link is acceptable.</p>

For example, in alternative embodiments, the order of the steps may differ, the various steps may occur simultaneously, or the number of frequencies being tested may vary without affecting the scope and spirit of the disclosure.
