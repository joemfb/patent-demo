<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to transistor networks and associated methods and, more particularly, to transistor bias networks and associated methods which can, for example, be used in amplifier circuits associated with broadband communication technologies.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">During the past years, the interest in using mobile and landline/wireline computing devices in day-to-day communications has increased. Desktop computers, workstations, and other wireline computers currently allow users to communicate, for example, via e-mail, video conferencing, and instant messaging (IM). Mobile devices, for example, mobile telephones, handheld computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), etc. also allow the users to communicate via e-mail, video conferencing, IM, etc. Mobile telephones have conventionally served as voice communication devices, but through technological advancements they have recently proved to be effective devices for communicating data, graphics, etc. Wireless and landline technologies continue to merge into a more unified communication system, as user demand for seamless communications across different platforms increases.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As these technologies have advanced, applications which use them have likewise advanced to provide users with video streaming and other multimedia services. Such services require higher bandwidth channels between the network and the end user devices to avoid unacceptable latency, among other things. Thus, for example, each successive generation of wireless communication technology which is promulgated by the various standards bodies has typically enabled an end user device to acquire greater bandwidth channels for communication. Such systems are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;wideband&#x201d; or &#x201c;broadband&#x201d; systems to emphasize the increased bandwidth availability which they provide.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Devices employed in such systems use transceivers to transmit and receive broadband signals. The transmit portions of such devices typically employ an amplifier to amplify the signals prior to coupling the signals to one or more antennas for transmission. Such broadband amplification circuits include transistors. Transistors operating in an AC coupled environment typically include a bias network that decouples the power supply circuit from the signals that are being amplified by the transistor amplifier. Bias networks for relatively narrowband signals typically include a parallel inductor and capacitor arrangement so that they resonate at a frequency that is within the band of frequencies corresponding to the signal being amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of a conventional amplifying circuit <b>100</b> is provided as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therein, the matching circuit <b>102</b> is designed such that the impedance z<b>4</b> seen by the matching circuit <b>102</b> at point <b>104</b> is Z<sub>load </sub>and the impedance z<b>3</b> seen looking into the matching circuit at point <b>106</b> is the conjugate of Z<sub>SPC </sub>(i.e., Z*<sub>SPC</sub>), where Z<sub>SPC </sub>is the operating impedance of the transistor <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The signal to be amplified is injected into the amplifying circuit <b>100</b> at point <b>110</b>. The transistor <b>108</b> amplifies the signal by transferring substantially all of the energy (minus losses) from node <b>112</b> to the node <b>104</b>. The energy from the power supply (not shown) which is delivered to node <b>112</b> is in a different form than the amplified signal energy which is delivered to node <b>104</b>, which energy conversion process is intrinsic to the transistor <b>108</b>'s amplification capability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also connected to the drain of the transistor <b>108</b> is a bias network <b>114</b>. The drain bias network <b>114</b> includes at least one inductor <b>116</b> and at least one capacitor <b>118</b> connected to one another in parallel, and is used to prevent the signal amplified by the transistor <b>108</b> from leaking into the power supply circuits at node <b>112</b> and to allow energy to pass from power supply <b>112</b> to transistor amplifier <b>106</b>. When the inductor <b>116</b> and the capacitor <b>118</b> are at resonance, then together they form a high impedance at the resonant frequency. If this resonant frequency corresponds to the frequency of the signal being amplified, then the amplified signal at node <b>106</b> will be substantially blocked from travelling to node <b>112</b>, and thus onward into the power supply circuitry (not shown) which is connected to node <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A problem with the bias network <b>114</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that when the signal applied to node <b>110</b> for amplification contains a wide range of frequencies, then the high impedance associated with resonance of the LC circuit <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> cannot be maintained over the entire range of frequencies associated with the amplified signal. Degradation of the signal at node <b>106</b> occurs and there may also be problems caused by signal leakage through node <b>112</b> to the power supply circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide amplifying circuits having bias networks and associated methods which avoid the afore-described problems and drawbacks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following exemplary embodiments provide advantages and benefits relative to existing bias networks including, for example, the possibility to reduce the amount of signal degradation and/or leakage associated with transistor-based amplification circuits operating on broadband signals. This can be accomplished by, for example, employing a filter as the bias network instead of a parallel connected LC arrangement. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, that the claims are not limited to those embodiments which produce any or all of these advantages or benefits and that other advantages and benefits may be realized depending upon the particular implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an exemplary embodiment, a broadband multiple frequency RF amplifier configured to amplify multiple frequency RF input signals over an operating bandwidth to drive a load includes a transistor configured to amplify the RF input signals to drive the load, a power supply configured to provide power usable by the transistor to amplify the RF input signals, a bias filter, connected to the transistor and to the power supply, which is configured to couple the power supply to the transistor to supply DC energy from the power supply to the transistor, and which is further configured to block the amplified RF input signals over substantially the entire operating bandwidth from reaching the power supply, and a matching circuit configured to couple the transistor to the load, wherein a first impedance, seen by looking into the matching circuit from the load, is substantially equal to the conjugate impedance of the load, wherein a second impedance, seen looking into the matching circuit from the transistor, is a conjugate of an operating impedance of the transistor, wherein a load impedance, seen by the bias filter, is substantially equal to the operating impedance of the transistor, and wherein a termination impedance of the bias filter on the power supply connection is one of a short circuit and an open circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another exemplary embodiment, a method for manufacturing a broadband, multiple frequency RF amplifier which is configured to amplify multiple frequency RF input signals over an operating bandwidth to drive a load includes the steps of determining a load impedance for the amplifier, determining an operating impedance of a transistor, which transistor is configured to amplify the RF input signals to drive the load, using the operating impedance of the transistor and the load impedance to determine first impedance values for elements of a matching circuit, using the operating impedance to determine second impedance values associated with elements of a bias filter, which bias filter is configured to couple a power supply to the transistor to supply DC energy from the power supply to the transistor, and which is further configured to block the amplified RF input signals over substantially the entire operating bandwidth from reaching the power supply, connecting the matching circuit to the transistor and to the load, and connecting the bias filter to the power supply, the transistor and the matching circuit, wherein a first impedance, seen by the matching circuit from the load, is substantially equal to a conjugate of the impedance of the load, wherein a second impedance, seen looking into the matching circuit from the transistor, is a conjugate of the operating impedance of the transistor, wherein a load impedance, seen by the bias filter, is substantially equal to the operating impedance of the transistor, and wherein a termination impedance of the bias filter on the power supply connection is one of a short circuit and an open circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference throughout the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Further, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment, the parallel connected LC bias network <b>114</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is replaced with a bias filter which is designed to operate over an arbitrarily wide signal bandwidth, i.e., a bandwidth associated with the particular broadband signal to be amplified. The bias filter is thus designed so as to block amplified signals from entering the power supply while passing the DC energy from the power supply to the transistor. The bias filter is also designed so as to not affect the characteristics of the matching circuitry over the operating bandwidth of the match. This means that, in practice, because the bias filter is designed to have a stopband at the operating frequencies associated with the RF input signals and the matching circuit also operates over those same frequencies, then the bandwidth of the stopband of the bias filter can be made at least equal to the operating frequencies to avoid the consequence that the bias filter would adversely impact the operation of the matching circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An amplifying circuit <b>200</b> according to an embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Therein, the matching circuit <b>102</b>, transistor <b>108</b>, and other elements having the same reference numbers used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to identify similar elements will be understood to be designed in the same manner, and operate in the same way, as correspondingly numbered elements in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bias filter <b>202</b> can, for example, be designed as a singly terminated filter wherein the load impedance z<b>2</b> seen by the filter <b>202</b> is Z<sub>SPC</sub>, i.e., the operating impedance of the transistor <b>108</b>. The specific design of, and components associated with, the bias filter <b>202</b> will vary based on the specifics of the rest of the amplifying circuit <b>200</b> for different implementations and signals to be amplified as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For more information on filter design which can be used to create bias filters according to these exemplary embodiments, the interested reader is directed to the book entitled &#x201c;Active and Passive Analog Filter Design&#x201d; by Huelsman, McGraw-Hill, 1993, the disclosure of which is incorporated here by reference. Additional details regarding methods of manufacturing amplifying circuits according to embodiments are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Returning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the source termination impedance z<b>1</b> of the singly terminated bias filter <b>202</b> is either a short or open circuit depending upon the nature of the power supply circuit <b>204</b> to which it is connected. For example, if the power supply circuit <b>204</b> is a voltage source, then the source termination of bias filter <b>202</b> will be a short circuit. Alternatively, if the power supply <b>204</b> is a current source, then the source termination of bias filter <b>202</b> will be an open circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bias filter <b>202</b> can, for example, be implemented as either a lowpass filter or a bandstop filter which will reject the frequencies associated with the RF input signals (and amplified RF input signals), but which will pass DC signals, i.e., power from the power supply circuit <b>204</b>. Thus, a highpass or bandpass filter would generally not be a suitable choice for use as bias filter <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As mentioned above, embodiments also consider a method for manufacturing a transistor amplifier using a bias filter, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Initially, at step <b>300</b>, a load impedance Z<sub>load </sub><b>206</b> of the amplifying circuit is specified or determined for a given implementation. Similarly, the transistor <b>108</b>'s operating impedance is also determined or characterized at step <b>302</b>. The inputs <b>300</b> and <b>302</b> may be obtained by, for example, either taking impedance measurements of the circuit elements or from the technical specifications of the vendors which sell the transistor elements <b>108</b> and load elements <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Given these inputs, the process continues to design the matching circuit <b>102</b> and bias filter <b>202</b>, in steps <b>304</b>, <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, respectively. More specifically, the matching circuit or network <b>102</b> is synthesized using the transistor operating impedance Z<sub>SPC </sub>and the load impedance Z<sub>load </sub>at step <b>304</b>. Then, the resulting matching network parameters, i.e., capacitance, inductance and/or resistance values, can be modified at step <b>306</b> to account for circuit parasitics, i.e., unintended capacitance, inductance and/or resistance generated by the placement of various circuit elements, connecting traces, board dielectric, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the right hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the design of the bias filter <b>202</b> includes the step <b>308</b> of synthesizing the bandstop or lowpass filter using the transistor's operating impedance Z<sub>SPC </sub>which was determined at step <b>302</b>, and either an open or short source termination as described above and using, for example, the principles discussed in the above-incorporated by reference filter design book (and/or filter synthesis software which operates based upon such principles) to determine impedance values for elements of the bias filter <b>202</b>. Again, parasitics can be accounted for at step <b>310</b> to enhance performance of the bias filter <b>202</b>. Although illustrated as parallel processes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the matching circuit <b>102</b> and bias network <b>202</b> can be performed serially, and in any desired order. Once the design is completed, the electrical components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistor, connecting traces, etc.) may be mounted on a circuit board and connected together, as indicated generally by step <b>312</b>, in order to complete the manufacture of the amplifying circuit <b>200</b>. More specifically, and for example, the matching circuit <b>102</b> can be connected to the transistor <b>108</b> and to the load <b>206</b>, and the bias filter <b>202</b> can be connected to the power supply <b>204</b>, the transistor <b>108</b> and the matching circuit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, compensation for the parasitics associated with the power supply <b>204</b> (essentially those parts of the power supply that make it not an ideal voltage or current source) can be incorporated into the bias filter design portion of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as well.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Based on the foregoing discussion, it will be appreciated that, according to an embodiment, a broadband multiple frequency RF amplifier configured to amplify multiple frequency RF input signals over an operating bandwidth to drive a load includes a transistor <b>108</b> configured to amplify the RF input signals to drive the load <b>206</b>, a power supply <b>204</b> configured to provide power usable by the transistor <b>108</b> to amplify the RF input signals, a bias filter <b>202</b>, connected to the transistor <b>108</b> and to the power supply <b>204</b>, which is configured to couple the power supply <b>204</b> to the transistor <b>108</b> to supply DC energy from the power supply <b>204</b> to the transistor <b>108</b>, and which is further configured to block the amplified RF input signals over substantially the entire operating bandwidth from reaching the power supply <b>204</b>, and a matching circuit <b>102</b> configured to couple the transistor <b>108</b> to the load <b>206</b>, wherein a first impedance, seen by the matching circuit <b>102</b> from the load <b>206</b>, is substantially equal to the conjugate impedance of the load <b>206</b>, wherein a second impedance, seen looking into the matching circuit <b>102</b> from the transistor <b>108</b>, is a conjugate of an operating impedance of the transistor <b>108</b>, wherein a load impedance, seen by the bias filter <b>202</b>, is substantially equal to the operating impedance of the transistor <b>108</b>, and wherein a termination impedance of the bias filter <b>202</b> on the power supply connection is one of a short circuit and an open circuit. Note in this regard that the conjugate impedance of the load <b>206</b> may be a complex conjugate if capacitance and or inductive impedances are included as load elements.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As mentioned earlier, although transistor <b>108</b> is depicted in the Figures as a MOSFET transistor, amplifying circuits according to these exemplary embodiments may employ any desired type of transistors. Such transistors include, but are not limited to MOSFET, JFET, FET, HBT, MESFET and bipolar transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the bias filter <b>202</b> according to exemplary embodiments may be designed as any desired filter or combination of filters which operate in accordance with the afore-described principles, some more specific (yet purely illustrative) examples of such bias filters <b>202</b> will now be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. Starting with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bias filter <b>202</b> is implemented in this embodiment as a diplexer filter <b>400</b> which includes a parallel connected lowpass filter <b>402</b> and highpass or bandpass filter <b>404</b> disposed between the power supply circuit <b>204</b> and the transistor <b>108</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the lowpass filter <b>402</b> operates to pass DC energy from the power supply circuit <b>204</b> to the transistor <b>108</b>, while the highpass or bandpass filter <b>404</b> operates to block frequencies within the operating bandwidth from reaching the power supply <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts another exemplary embodiment of a multiplexer filter design for bias filter <b>202</b>. Therein, the multiplexer filter <b>500</b> includes a lowpass filter <b>502</b>, one or more parallel bandpass and/or bandstop filters <b>504</b> and an optional highpass filter <b>506</b>, all connected to one another in parallel between the power supply <b>204</b> circuit and the transistor <b>108</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the lowpass filter <b>502</b> operates to pass DC energy from the power supply <b>204</b> to the transistor <b>108</b>, while the other ones of the multiple filters <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> operate to selectively block signals having other frequencies. For example, if multiple stopbands are desirable to block signals (e.g., at the frequency band of the RF input signals and at lower (video) frequencies) this embodiment can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although the features and elements of the embodiments are described in those embodiments in particular combinations, each feature or element can be used alone without the other features and elements of the embodiments or in various combinations with or without other features and elements disclosed herein.
