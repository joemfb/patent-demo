No. 12/895,355 filed on Sep. 30, 2010, titled &#x201c;Wheelchair Legrest Assembly.&#x201d; United States Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 12/895,355 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to wheelchairs, and, more particularly, to legrest assemblies for wheelchairs.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Power wheelchairs are used by disabled individuals in order to move around in comfort and relative ease. Indeed, these wheelchairs have improved throughout the years to provide numerous features that provide additional comfort to individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A power wheelchair typically includes a base having wheels. The base supports a seat assembly. The individual controls operation of the wheelchair through a control interface, such as a joystick, typically positioned on an armrest of the seat assembly. The control interface is in electrical communication with a processing system that is also connected to motors that drive the wheels, a steering mechanism, and the like. The processing system generally controls overall operation of all powered aspects of the wheelchair.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wheelchair also includes legrests in which an individual positions his/her legs. Many legrests are adjustable such that they may be moved through various positions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate isometric side and front views, respectively, of a conventional power wheelchair <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the wheelchair <b>10</b> includes a seat assembly <b>12</b> and a legrest assembly <b>14</b> connected to the seat assembly <b>12</b>. The legrest assembly <b>14</b> includes a central column <b>16</b> extending from and proximate to a front edge of the seat assembly <b>12</b>. Calf supports <b>18</b> are positioned on either side of the central column <b>16</b> below the seat assembly <b>12</b>. Footrests <b>20</b> extend from an end of the column <b>16</b> that is distal from the seat assembly <b>12</b>. As shown, in the normal position, the footrests <b>20</b> are generally parallel with the seating area of the seat assembly <b>12</b>, while the calf supports <b>18</b> and central column <b>16</b> are generally perpendicular to the seating area.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The legrest assembly <b>14</b> may be adjusted so that it may rotate upward about an area where it connects to the seat assembly <b>12</b>. That is, a proximal end of the central column <b>16</b> is pivotally connected to the seat assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to adjust the legrest assembly <b>14</b>, an actuator <b>22</b> may be engaged to move the legrest assembly <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the actuator <b>22</b> is positioned behind the legrest assembly <b>14</b>. The actuator <b>22</b> is typically secured to the central column <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The position of the actuator <b>22</b> behind and on the legrest assembly <b>14</b> provides a bulky assembly. The actuator <b>22</b> adds weight to the legrest assembly <b>14</b>. As such, when moving the legrest assembly <b>14</b>, the actuator <b>22</b> uses energy sufficient to move both the legrest assembly <b>14</b> and the actuator <b>22</b> itself. The added weight and bulk, as well as the center of gravity, may cause adjustment of the legrest assembly to be uneven and halting.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an isometric side view of the conventional power wheelchair <b>10</b> in which the legrest assembly <b>14</b> is outwardly adjusted. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the actuator <b>22</b>, which is attached to the legrest assembly <b>14</b>, moves the legrest assembly <b>14</b> and the actuator <b>22</b> in the direction of arc A. The legrest assembly <b>14</b> pivotally moves in the direction of arc A about a hinged interface that connects the legrest assembly <b>14</b> to the seat assembly <b>12</b>. An individual may adjust the legrest assembly <b>14</b> through various positions, such as through a control interface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the central column <b>16</b> of the legrest assembly <b>14</b> is straight. When the legrest assembly <b>14</b> is adjusted upwardly in the direction of arc A, the straight central column <b>16</b> typically causes the force of the weight of the individual legs to concentrate onto the heels that are supported by the footrests <b>20</b>. As the legrest assembly <b>14</b> continues to move upward in the direction of arc A, the concentration of the weight on the heels typically increases, which may cause the individual seated in the wheelchair to experience discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, conventional wheelchair assemblies such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> provide a limited range of adjustability. Also, in order to adjust the length of the individual legrests of the legrest assembly <b>14</b>, a separate and distinct mechanism, such as a hinge mechanism <b>24</b> positioned behind each legrest is used. However, the hinge mechanism <b>24</b> on each legrest adds even more weight and bulk to the legrest assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Certain embodiments of the present invention provide a wheelchair that includes a seat assembly configured to support an individual, a curved legrest assembly pivotally connected to the seat assembly, and an adjustment assembly configured to adjust the curved legrest assembly through a range of motion.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Before the embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a front view of a power wheelchair <b>40</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The wheelchair <b>40</b> includes a support base <b>42</b> having wheels <b>44</b>. The support base <b>42</b> supports a seat assembly <b>46</b>. A legrest assembly <b>48</b> pivotally connects to the seat assembly <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a side view of the power wheelchair <b>40</b>. The legrest assembly <b>48</b> includes a central column <b>50</b> having a proximal end <b>52</b> that secures to a pivot bracket <b>54</b> that connects to the seat assembly <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The central column <b>50</b> is secured to legrest beams <b>56</b> through an extension bracket <b>58</b>. Distal ends of the legrest beams <b>56</b> are connected to footrests <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Unlike the conventional wheelchair, the central column <b>50</b> and the legrest beams <b>56</b> are curved. The central column <b>50</b> and the legrest beams <b>56</b> generally bow out from proximal ends (closest to the seat assembly <b>46</b>) and arc back from the bowed out area toward distal ends (closest to the footrests). Thus, the centers of the central column <b>50</b> and the legrest beams <b>56</b> may bow out to a greater extent than the ends of the respective central column <b>50</b> and the legrest beams <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Because the legrest assembly <b>48</b> is curved, as described above, the legrest assembly <b>48</b> moves along an arc as it rotates about the seat assembly <b>46</b>. It has been found that the curved nature of the legrest assembly <b>48</b> adjusts the position of the footrests <b>60</b> during movement, which relieves pressure on an individual's heels as the legrest assembly <b>48</b> pivots outwardly from the seat assembly <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a side view of the power wheelchair <b>40</b> in which the legrest assembly <b>48</b> is outwardly adjusted. An individual may operate the wheelchair <b>40</b> to adjust the legrest assembly <b>48</b> through a range of motion such as along arc B. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example, the curve of the central column <b>50</b> may be evenly and consistently aligned and in conformity with the curve of each legrest beam <b>56</b>. That is, the legrest beams <b>56</b> connect to the central column such that an even and contiguous curve ranges over the entire length from the central column <b>50</b> to the ends of the legrest beams <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a side view of the legrest assembly <b>48</b> connected to the seat assembly <b>46</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The proximal end <b>52</b> of the central column <b>50</b> pivotally connects to the seat assembly <b>46</b> through the pivot bracket <b>54</b>. The pivot bracket <b>54</b>, in turn, connects to an axle (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), which, in turn, connects to a link <b>62</b>. The link <b>62</b> connects to a distal end of a piston <b>64</b> that is slidably secured within a sleeve <b>66</b>. The piston <b>64</b> is configured to slide into and out of the sleeve <b>66</b> by way of an actuator <b>68</b>. Movement of the piston <b>64</b> may be controlled through hydraulics, pneumatics, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the actuator <b>68</b> is secured underneath the seat assembly <b>46</b>, instead of behind and on the legrest assembly <b>48</b>. Thus, the legrest assembly <b>48</b> is lighter and less bulky than that of the conventional wheelchair <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an isometric bottom view of the legrest assembly <b>48</b> connected to the seat assembly <b>46</b>. The central column <b>50</b> may include a male beam <b>70</b> that may be adjusted with respect to a female beam <b>72</b>. That is, the male beam <b>70</b> may fit within a channel within the female beam <b>72</b>, and the female beam <b>72</b> may be adjusted for length with respect to the male beam <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A clamp <b>74</b> configured for receiving a web belt (not shown) that operatively connects to a rolling bracket <b>86</b> allows the female beam <b>72</b> to slide outwardly from the male beam <b>70</b>. Optionally, the central column <b>50</b> may be a single unitary beam.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In any event, the proximal end <b>52</b> of the central column <b>50</b> secures to an axle <b>76</b> that is rotatably secured by opposing brackets <b>78</b> underneath the seat assembly <b>46</b>. Optionally, the central column <b>50</b> may be integrally formed with the axle <b>76</b>. The link <b>62</b> secures to the pivot bracket <b>54</b>, which is secured to the central column <b>50</b> and/or the axle <b>76</b>. Thus, when the actuator <b>68</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) moves the piston <b>64</b>, the axle <b>76</b> and the central column <b>50</b> move in response to adjust the position of legrest assembly <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A stud <b>80</b> extends beneath the central column <b>50</b> proximate the union with the axle <b>76</b>. The stud <b>80</b> includes a spring <b>82</b> secured around a pin <b>86</b> that connects the stud <b>80</b> to a rolling bracket <b>88</b>. The rolling bracket <b>88</b> includes wheels or rollers <b>90</b> at an end that is distally located from the pin <b>86</b>. The rollers <b>90</b> are positioned within a curved track <b>92</b> of a bracing bracket <b>94</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the wheelchair <b>40</b> may not include the stud <b>80</b>, the rolling bracket <b>88</b> and the bracing bracket <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As the legrest assembly <b>48</b> moves outwardly from the seat assembly <b>46</b>, the piston <b>64</b> pivots the central column <b>50</b> about the axle <b>76</b>. As such, the rolling bracket <b>88</b> moves through the curved track <b>92</b> toward the axle <b>76</b>. The spring <b>82</b>, which is operatively connected to the rolling bracket <b>88</b>, responsively resists and keeps the rollers <b>90</b> within the curved track <b>92</b> at all positions along the curved track <b>92</b>. Consequently, the rolling bracket <b>88</b> pivots with respect to the stud <b>80</b> about the pin <b>86</b>. Accordingly, the rolling bracket <b>88</b> provides bracing support to the legrest assembly <b>48</b> as the legrest assembly <b>48</b> moves. When the legrest assembly <b>48</b> moves back to its original position, the spring <b>82</b> ensures that the rollers <b>90</b> remain in the curved track <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A web belt (not shown), which may be formed of plastic, an elastomeric material, flexible metal, or the like, may be secured to the rolling bracket <b>88</b>. The web belt may pass around the axle of the rollers <b>90</b>. The web belt may also connect to the clamp <b>74</b>. For example, the web belt may pass through the two aligned slots <b>89</b> formed through the clamp <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the rollers <b>90</b> move, the rollers <b>90</b> adjust the tension in the web belt, allowing the female beam <b>72</b> to extend from the male beam <b>70</b> as tension is released, or pulling the female beam <b>72</b> onto the male beam <b>70</b> as tension is increased. In this manner, the web belt may allow for variable length of the female beam <b>72</b> with respect to the male beam <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an isometric front view of the legrest assembly <b>48</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The central column <b>50</b> securely connects to legrest beams <b>56</b> through the extension bracket <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an isometric front view of the extension bracket <b>58</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The extension bracket <b>58</b> includes a main body <b>89</b> having a central channel <b>91</b> and lateral channels <b>93</b> formed therethrough. A plurality of threaded bores <b>96</b> are formed through the main body <b>89</b> and connect to the channels <b>91</b> and <b>93</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, outer bores <b>96</b> connect to the lateral channels <b>93</b> while inboard bores <b>96</b> connect to the central channel <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The threaded bores <b>96</b> are configured to receive and threadably retain set screws (not shown). The set screws are used to adjust the central column <b>50</b> and the legrest beams <b>56</b> within the central and lateral channels <b>91</b> and <b>93</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the central column <b>50</b> passes through the central channel <b>91</b>, while the legrest beams <b>56</b> pass through the lateral channels <b>93</b>. To secure the central column <b>50</b> and the legrest beams <b>56</b> in position, set screws within the threaded bores <b>96</b> are engaged and abut into the central column <b>50</b> and legrest beams <b>56</b>, thereby securing them in position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The extension bracket <b>58</b> allows for individual adjustment of legrest beams <b>56</b> with respect to the central column <b>50</b>. Additionally, the extension bracket <b>58</b> may be adjusted with respect to the central column <b>50</b>. That is, the set screws that engage the central column <b>50</b> may be loosened so that the extension bracket <b>58</b> may be slid up or down the central column <b>50</b> to a desired position, at which point the set screws may be tightened to secure the extension bracket <b>58</b> in place. Similarly, each legrest beam <b>56</b> may be individually adjusted with respect to the extension bracket <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, the extension bracket <b>58</b> allows for separate and independent adjustment of the legrest beams <b>56</b> and the central column <b>50</b>. Moreover, the extension bracket <b>58</b> provides a simple and light system for adjustment that does not significantly add weight and bulk to the legrest assembly <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an isometric front view of the legrest assembly <b>48</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a removable cover <b>98</b> may be positioned on the extension bracket <b>58</b>. The cover <b>98</b> is positioned over a cavity in which the threaded bores <b>96</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>) are located. The cover <b>98</b> may be secured to the extension bracket <b>58</b> through separate fasteners, or the cover <b>98</b> may snapably secure to the extension bracket <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a side view of the legrest assembly <b>48</b> adjusted outwardly with legrest beams <b>56</b> extended, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this position, the legrest beams <b>56</b> have been slidably extended with respect to the extension bracket <b>58</b>. As noted above, the legrest beams <b>56</b> may be adjusted with respect to the extension bracket <b>58</b>, and the extension bracket <b>58</b> may be slidably adjusted over the length of the central column <b>50</b> to accommodate a wide range of lengths. Additionally, as noted above, the curved nature of the legrest assembly <b>48</b> reduces the concentration of the weight of an individual's heels into the footrests <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide a legrest assembly for a wheelchair. Unlike the conventional wheelchair shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the actuator is positioned underneath the seat assembly. Accordingly, the legrest assembly is less bulky.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the curved nature of the legrest assembly provides for increased comfort, as compared to the straight legrests of conventional wheelchairs.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Additionally, the simple, efficient, and light extension bracket allows for length adjustment of the legrest assembly. The extension bracket provides a lighter and less bulky legrest assembly as compared to the conventional wheelchair shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Overall, it has been found that embodiments of the present invention provide a legrest assembly for a powered wheelchair that slides more smoothly and over a greater range than conventional wheelchairs, due to the curved nature of the legrest assembly and the actuator underneath the seat assembly. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention provide a lighter legrest assembly as compared to conventional wheelchairs. Moreover, it has been found that embodiments of the present invention provide a stronger and more stable legrest assembly. As noted above, embodiments of the present invention also provide a legrest assembly that reduces pressure on an individual's feet, as compared to prior wheelchairs.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also, embodiments of the present invention provide a fully-adjustable legrest assembly that is simpler than previous legrest assemblies. That is, embodiments of the present invention provide a legrest assembly with less parts and simpler operation as compared to prior wheelchairs.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While various spatial and directional terms, such as top, bottom, lower, mid, lateral, horizontal, vertical, front and the like, may used to describe embodiments of the present invention, it is understood that such terms are merely used with respect to the orientations shown in the drawings.
