<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present teachings relate to a detection method useful in a flow cytometry system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Well-known examples of biopolymer analysis using DNA sequencing are taught, for example, in F. Sanger et al., <i>DNA Sequencing with Chain Terminating Inhibitors, </i>74 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 5463 (1977); Lloyd M. Smith et al., <i>Florescence detection in automated DNA sequence analysis, </i>321 Nature 674 (1986); and Lloyd M. Smith, <i>The Future of DNA Sequencing, </i>262 Science 530 (1993). These and all other publications and patents cited herein are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of sources of irradiation other than lasers for the excitation of marker compounds provides many advantages. Although the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for generating fluorescence in dye molecules is taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,005,663 and 5,710,628, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference, the use of LEDs in such electrophoretic methods typically results in low signal strengths and marginal detection sensitivity. The low signal strength can impair adequate detection of marker compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electrophoretic and/or other separation apparatus and method that includes a cost-effective and convenient source of irradiation and that does not compromise sensitivity or resolution would be desirable, especially in a multiple-channel electrophoretic or flow cytometry system.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are intended to provide a further explanation of the various embodiments of the present teachings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The analytes of interest can be detected on the basis of an intrinsically detectable signal, or may be derivatized with a label which confers a desired type of detectability. Various methods for labeling analytes with detectable moieties are well known in the art, such as excitable reporters, radioactive isotopes, fluorescent dyes, spin labels, chemiluminescent compounds and the like to stimulate detectable emission indicative of the nature of the analyte. When the analyte is a polynucleotide, labeling by hybridization with a labeled probe can also be used. The analyte can be labeled with a dye marker, a fluorescing dye, a free-floating dye, a reporter dye, a probe dye, an intercalating dye, a quantum dot, a molecular beacon, a linear probe, a quantum dot media, a quantum dot bead, a dye-labeled bead, a dye attached to an analyte associated with a bead, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the present teachings are related more generally to separation devices including a time-delay integration detection capability or method, the teachings can be exemplified with reference to the electrophoretic separation system described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref><i>b</i>. Although the detectable components described herein are referred to as analytes or analyte bands, it should be noted that such analytes can include whole cells, whole blood cells, nucleic acid sequences, and other biological samples.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Exemplary analytes can include nucleic acids, both single and double stranded, proteins, carbohydrates, viruses, cells, whole cells, organelles, organic polymers, other biological samples, particles, labeled media, labeled beads, and the like. The analytes can include biomolecules, for example, cells, proteins, DNA, RNA, polynucleotides, polypeptides, polysaccharides, and small molecule analytes. According to various embodiments, the analyte can be a selected-sequence polynucleotide, and an analyte-specific reagent including a sequence-selective reagent for detecting the polynucleotide can be associated with the polynucleotide. Polynucleotide analytes can be detected by any suitable method, for example, polymerase chain reaction, ligase chain reaction, oligonucleotide ligation assay, hybridization assay, antibody assay, affinity assay, or streptavidin/biotin assay.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of an electrophoresis device. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the arrangement can include a channel-defining member <b>10</b> defining a channel <b>12</b> therein for the migration of an analyte sample. The channel-defining member <b>10</b> can include a cover plate with or without grooves, an etched plate defining one or more capillary sized grooves therein, or one or more capillary tubes. According to various embodiments, the channel-defining member can be an etched plate having a plurality of channels or grooves, or the channel-defining member can include a plurality of capillary tubes. The use of a plurality of channels can allow a large number of analyte samples to be measured simultaneously in order to increase throughput. As is well known, for electrophoresis to occur, opposing ends of channel-defining member <b>10</b>, such as an electrophoretic plate or capillary tube, can be placed in contact with corresponding electrodes connected to a power supply for generating an electric field across the plate or tube. This field can cause the analyte to migrate from a loading site (not shown) for the plate or tube arrangement of the channel-defining member <b>10</b>, toward a detection site or detection zone <b>14</b>. The detection zone can encompass that zone on the channel that is irradiated by an irradiation source to excite markers, such as dye markers, used to label analytes in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An example of a marker compound can be to dye marker. Any suitable marker, such as, for example, a fluorophore, can be used. Fluorophores useful according to various embodiments can include those that can be coupled to organic molecules, particularly proteins and nucleic acids, and that can emit a detectable amount of radiation or light signal in response to excitation by an available excitation source. Suitable markers can encompass materials having fluorescent, phosphorescent, and/or other electromagnetic radiation emissions. Irradiation of the markers can cause them to emit light at varying frequencies depending on the type of marker used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One class of markers provides signals for the detection of labeled extension and amplification products by fluorescence, chemiluminescence, or electrochemical luminescence (Kricka, L. in <i>Nonisotopic DNA Probe Techniques</i>, Academic Press, San Diego, pp. 3-28 (1992)). Chemiluminescent labels can include 1,2-dioxetane compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,223; and Bronstein, Anal. Biochemistry 219:169-81 (1994)). Fluorescent dyes useful for labeling probes, primers, and nucleotide 5&#x2032;-triphosphates include fluoresceins, rhodamines (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,366,860; 5,936,087; and 6,051,719), cyanines (Kubista, WO 97/45539), and metal porphyrin complexes (Stanton, WO 88/04777). Fluorescent reporter dyes include xanthene compounds such as fluoresceins I and rhodamines II:</p>

The substituents can include covalent attachments to the primers, probes, or nucleotides. Examples of formulae I and II include wherein X can be phenyl substituted with carboxyl, chloro, and other groups, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,847,162; 6,025,505; 5,674,442; 5,188,934; 5,885,778; 6,008,379; 6,020,481; and 5,936,087, which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference, and wherein X can be hydrogen, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,719, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to various embodiments, an optical instrument can be provided that includes a light source arranged to emit an excitation wavelength or wavelength range toward a region capable of retaining a sample, such that a fluorescent dye, if present in the region, can be caused to fluoresce. The light source can provide excitation wavelength ranges that correspond to respective excitation wavelength ranges of a plurality of fluorescent dyes. A detector capable of detecting an emission wavelength emitted from a fluorescing dye can be used to determine the absence or presence of a component associated with the dye. For example, the dyes can include intercalating dyes, reporter dyes, free-floating dyes, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to various embodiments, PCR dyes can be used that only fluoresce when bound to a target molecule. Nucleic acid sequence amplification dyes can also be attached to probes that also are connected to quenchers, and the action of nucleic acid sequence amplification enzymes will disassemble the dye-probe-quencher molecule causing the dye to increase its fluorescence. According to various embodiments, nucleic acid sequence amplification can be performed using a variety of methods, for example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), isothermal amplification reaction, well known in the art. When a PCR procedure is used, for example, the number of unquenched dye molecules doubles with every thermal cycle. Fluorescing dyes are well known in the art, and any of a plurality of fluorescent dyes having various excitation wavelengths can be used. Examples of such dyes include, but are not limited to, Rhodamine, Fluoroscein, dye derivatives of Rhodamine, dye derivatives of Fluoroscein, 5-FAM&#x2122;, 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM&#x2122;), VIC&#x2122;, hexachloro-fluorescein (HEX&#x2122;), tetrachloro-fluorescein (TET&#x2122;), ROX&#x2122;, and TAMRA&#x2122;. Dyes or other identifiers that can be used include, but are not limited to, fluorophores and phosphorescent dyes. Dyes can be used in combinations of two, three, four, or more dyes per sample. According to various embodiments, the family of 5-FAM&#x2122;, 6-FAM&#x2122;, VIC&#x2122;, TET&#x2122;, and/or ROX&#x2122; dyes can be used to indicate the presence of sample components.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to various embodiments, various detectable markers can be used, in addition or in alternate, to dyes. Markers can include, for example, fluorescing dyes, free-floating dyes, reporter dyes, probe dyes, intercalating dyes, and molecular beacons. Dyes that fluoresce when integrated into DNA can be intercalating dyes. Other dyes known as &#x201c;reporter&#x201d; dyes can attached to the ends of &#x201c;probes&#x201d; that have &#x201c;quenchers&#x201d; on the other end. A nucleic acid sequence amplification reaction, for example, PCR, can result in the disassembly of the Dye-Probe-Quencher molecule, so the reporter dye can emit an increased amount of fluorescence. Reporter dyes are not attached in any way to the sample. Free floating dyes can be floating freely in solution. Other fluorescing markers well know in the art can be utilized. According to various embodiments, molecular beacons can be single-stranded molecules with hairpins that preferentially hybridize with an amplified target to unfold. According to various embodiments, quantum dots can be used as markers also.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an irradiation source is provided that emits light in a given frequency range, such as, for example, a light emitting diode (LED) <b>16</b>. It can be to be noted that, in the instant description, the source of light can be any of a variety of light sources. According to various embodiments, the light can have a frequency of about 660 nm or lower. The irradiation source can be, for example, an LED, an organic LED, a non-coherent light source as known to those skilled in the art, a solid state laser, a microwire laser, or a combination thereof. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;irradiation source,&#x201d; &#x201c;light source,&#x201d; &#x201c;excitation source,&#x201d; &#x201c;LED,&#x201d; or the like can include single or multiple sources of irradiation, including LED flood light arrays. As used herein, &#x201c;LED&#x201d; can refer to an LED an OLED, or multiplicities thereof. Further, according to various embodiments, the &#x201c;LED&#x201d; can include coherent irradiation sources, for example, a solid state laser source or a micro-wire laser source.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to various embodiments, the light from the LED can be modulated by an excitation modulating optics system before reaching the detector zone <b>14</b>. The excitation modulating optics system can include, as shown, a conditioning filter <b>18</b>, the role of which can be to substantially block predetermined ranges of wavelengths of light emitted by the LED. The predetermined ranges can correspond to wavelengths of light that can overlap with the emission spectra of the markers being used. According to various embodiments, the conditioning filter can let through only light in the wavelength range of the excitation light of one or more of the markers. Any given LED can emit excitation light in a spectral range. The range of wavelengths of the excitation light in turn can excite markers to emit light signals within a given spectral range in the detection zone. For the detection of light signals from the detection zone, that portion of the excitation light that would be in the same wavelength range as some or all of the light signals emitted from the detection zone can be blocked. The light passing through the conditioning filter <b>18</b> is conditioned light <b>20</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The excitation modulating optics system can further include a focusing optical system <b>19</b>. The conditioned light <b>20</b> can be focused by focusing optical system <b>19</b> to irradiate the analyte sample and corresponding markers in the detection zone <b>14</b>. The thus irradiated marker or markers can turn emit light signals, such as through fluorescence, at frequencies specific to the irradiated marker, so as to present a peak intensity. For example, a dye excited by yellow light can have a fluorescence emission peak intensity at 610 nm corresponding to the orange portion of the spectrum. A peak intensity of about 460 nm can be associated with the blue portion of the spectrum, and a peak intensity of about 660 nm can be associated with the red portion of the spectrum. By way of example, ROX, a known dye marker, can be best excited at 590 nm. ROX can be excited by an LED emitting radiation at 590 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can include a collection modulating optics system that can include a collimating optical system <b>24</b>, a wide bandpass filter <b>26</b>, a transmission grating <b>28</b>, and a re-imaging optical system <b>30</b>. Emitted light <b>22</b> from the detection zone <b>14</b>, and, in addition, conditioned light <b>20</b> passing through the detection zone <b>14</b>, can be collimated by a first optical component or system <b>24</b>. The light from the detection zone can include the emitted light <b>22</b> and a portion of the conditioned light <b>20</b> passing through the detection zone. Alternatively, the excitation light can be brought in at an angle with respect to the detection zone such that most of the conditioned light passing through the detection zone is not collected by the collimating optical system <b>24</b>. This reduces the excitation light that might be rejected. However, such an alternative arrangement also decreases the level of excitation light that hits the detection zone <b>14</b>. It can be, nevertheless, possible to establish a compromise between irradiation angle and level of excitation light, as readily recognizable by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The light <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> from the detection zone <b>14</b> can be collimated by collimating optical system <b>24</b>. What is meant in the context of various embodiments by collimation is any reduction in the propagation angle of the light being collimated. According to various embodiments, the reduction in the propagation angle of the light being collimated can result in a propagation angle between about 20 degrees and about 0 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to various embodiments, a long pass filter, or, in the alternative, a wide bandpass filter <b>26</b>, can be used for letting through, substantially exclusively, predetermined wavelengths of light from the detection zone corresponding to a portion of wavelengths of the light signals emitted by an associated marker. The portion of the wavelengths of the light signals can include, for example, all of the light signals, or it can include, for each marker, a range of wavelengths of the light signals, such as a range of wavelengths about the peak intensity of the light signals. As an example, a wide bandpass filter can block wavelengths of light outside of the range of from about 500 nm to about 700 nm, thereby letting through only light that corresponds very specifically to the light emitted by the markers, that is, corresponding to emitted light <b>22</b>. Thereafter, emitted light <b>22</b> can be spectrally distributed by a transmission grating <b>28</b> and refocused by re-imaging optical system <b>30</b> onto an array <b>34</b> of solid-state detectors, or detector array <b>34</b>. The excitation modulating optics system and the collection modulating optics system are hereinafter collectively referred to as &#x201c;the modulating optics system&#x201d; or &#x201c;modulating optics.&#x201d; According to various embodiments, the array of solid-state detectors can include the photo-detecting surface of the parallel register of a charge-coupled device (CCD) <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image produced by refocusing emitted light <b>22</b> can be projected onto the detector array <b>34</b> of the CCD, producing a pattern of charge in proportion to the total integrated flux incident on each pixel of the parallel register, as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to various embodiments, at least one of the excitation beam pathway and the emission beam pathway can pass through a lens system, for example, a ball lens. The modulating optics system can include the lens system. For example, the excitation beam pathway and/or the emission bean pathway can pass through a lens system as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/805,096, filed Mar. 19, 2004, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The modulating optics system can include or be separate from a lens system as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/805,096.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring additionally now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an image produced by moving analytes or analyte bands can be recorded by the photo-detecting surface of CCD <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at times t (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and t+&#x394;t (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Although the term analyte band is used herein, it is to be understood that an analyte band can include a single analyte, such as a single cell. The photo-detecting surface <b>36</b> can be part of the two dimensional detector array <b>34</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Photo-detecting surface <b>36</b> can include a spectral axis as indicated by arrow &#x3bb; on the figure, and a spatial axis along which the analyte bands move, as indicated by arrow M, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. As further seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an image created by the light signals emitted by excited markers can produce, for example, two bands <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> on photo-detecting surface <b>36</b>, for example, substantially in the red and blue regions of the spectrum, respectively. Each band can correspond to a marker used to label, for example, a predetermined type of analyte. The bands can be spectrally distributed along the spectral axis by transmission grating <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At time t, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the charges produced on surface <b>36</b> can present two respective peaks <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> on intensity profile <b>45</b>. These peaks can correspond to bands <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>, respectively. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at time t+&#x394;t, both bands <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> can have moved downward along the direction of migration M on the photo-detecting surface <b>36</b>. Serial register <b>42</b> of the CCD <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) collects the charges accumulated for each analyte band during its integration time. All signals received from the detector can be converted from analog to digital, and conveyed to a serial port for transmission to a multipurpose computer for storage and/or for further processing and analysis. The analog output can alternatively or additionally be sent directly to an output device for display or printing, or used for other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to various embodiments, for example, as shown in the embodiment above, collection of the image can be performed using time delay integration (TDI). In the CCD, the photogenerated charge in the photoactive elements or pixels can be transferred toward the serial register <b>42</b> one row at a time. The charge information in the serial row can be read by using a corresponding single on-chip amplifier or readout register <b>44</b> of the CCD. By way of example, for a 256&#xd7;256 element CCD, each time a single imaging area (one row) is transferred to the serial register <b>42</b>, 256 readouts of the thus transferred area are performed, each readout corresponding to a different spectral element or pixel in the row. The above process continues until all 256 pixels in all 256 rows have been read.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Under a normal read-out approach, the motion of the images on the detector array <b>34</b> produces a blur. In TDI, according to various embodiments, the shutter can be eliminated. The shifting of rows of the CCD can be synchronized to the migration of the band of analyte in the channel. Thus, as an analyte band enters the excitation zone of the LED (detection zone <b>14</b>), the light signals emitted therefrom can be collected and can illuminate the first row of the CCD, and the corresponding charge information can be read using the amplifier or readout register <b>44</b> of the CCD. The band takes a period of time, &#x394;tp, to migrate in the channel so that its corresponding image migrates to the next row of the CCD, one row closer to the serial register. After this time period, the charge on the CCD can be shifted one row closer to the serial register, such that the fluorescence from the analyte corresponds to the same charge information on the CCD. Therefore, distinct from the physical rows of the CCD, there exists in TDI according to various embodiments a continuously moving row of accumulating photogenerated charge. An example of TDI in a capillary electrophoresis system using laser-induced fluorescence is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,609 to Sweedler et al., and in J. F. Sweedler et al., <i>Fluorescence Defection in Capillary Zone Electrophoresis Using a Charge</i>-<i>Coupled Device with Time Delayed Integration</i>, Anal. Chem. 63, 496-502 (1991), the contents of both of which are incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to various embodiments, the effective integration time for a given analyte band can vary from application to application. The effective integration time of a given analyte band can correspond to a time where the portion of the wavelengths of the light signals in the analyte band being integrated moves across two pixels on the detector array, or to the entire time the portion of the wavelengths of the light signals in the analyte band being integrated is in the detection zone, or to any time therebetween. In addition, the portion of the wavelengths of the light signals in the analyte band being integrated can, according to various embodiments, include (1) a range of wavelengths about a peak intensity of the light signals; (2) a range of wavelengths including all wavelengths of the light signals; or (3) a range of wavelengths anywhere between (1) and (2) above. By way of example, the integration time can include a time it would take for the detector to integrate a range of wavelengths of the analyte band corresponding to a full width of an intensity curve of the light signals in the analyte band at half of the peak or maximum intensity of the intensity curve, or &#x201c;full width at half max&#x201d; of the intensity curve. The portion of the wavelengths of the light signals in the analyte band being integrated can depend on the number of different colors being integrated, and on how well the colors are separated from one another in the emission spectra. As a general rule, the better separated the colors in the emission spectra, the wider the portion of the wavelengths of the light signals, and, hence, the longer the effective integration time.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to various embodiments, the use of TDI in collecting data points addresses the problem of lowered irradiance when using irradiation sources emitting non-coherent light, such as LEDs. The irradiance, that is, photons emitted per millimeters squared, can be typically about a thousand times lower in LEDs when compared with the irradiance of lasers. According to various embodiments, TDI addresses the problem of lowered irradiance by allowing a longer period of time for the integration of signals from excited markers. According to various embodiments, a broad detection zone can be used for TDI. In a non-TDI detection system, the detection zone can be typically about one tenth of a millimeter squared. When using TDI according to various embodiments, the detection zone for one channel can be one hundred times larger, that is, about one millimeter squared, allowing a relatively larger number of markers to be excited and a larger number of data points to be integrated into a detector. The various embodiments described herein can be equally applicable in instances where a plurality of channels are present, the detection zones of each of the respective channels being adapted to be irradiated by one or more irradiation sources emitting light.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For the purpose of accumulating charges to effect instead of shifting the charges on the CCD as a function of the migration of the analyte bands, according to various embodiments, the CCD itself and/or the image itself, that is, the light signals from the detection zone, can be moved as a function of migration of the analyte bands. The result of such movement of the CCD and/or image can be the tracking of each analyte band by a continuously moving row of accumulating photogenerated charge on the CCD during the effective integration time of the analyte hand. By way of example, to accomplish the desired result mentioned above, appropriate motors, gearing, belt drives, control units and power supplies can be used. For example, a linear actuator can be used to translate the re-imaging optical system <b>30</b> and/or the CCD itself to minimize blurring. This can make the image stationary on the CCD throughout the integration time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to various embodiments, the CCD can be a frame transfer CCD. A frame transfer CCD has a parallel register that can include two CCD registers arranged in tandem. The CCD register, or storage array adjacent to the serial register, can be covered with an opaque mask and can provide temporary storage for charges during readout. The other CCD register, or image array, identical in capacity to the storage array, can be used for imaging. After the image array is exposed to light, the resulting charges can be rapidly shifted in the parallel register up to the storage array for subsequent readout. This shift operation typically takes a millisecond. While the masked storage array is being read, the image array can integrate charge from the next image. <i>See Charge</i>-<i>Coupled Devices for Quantitative Electronic Imaging</i>, Photometrics Ltd.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">To effect TDI, according to various embodiments, the modulating optics as defined herein can be moved relative to a channel-defining member. For example, over a given detection zone, the modulating optics can be moved along the detection zone at substantially the same speed as the analyte for detection moves along the detection zone in the channel-defining member. In this manner, the marker of a component of the analyte band can be repeatedly imaged on the same portion of the detector, for example, a CCD, over the integration time. Alternately, the channel-defining member can be moved at the same speed but in an opposite direction from the movement of the analyte along the channel-defining member. Movement of the channel-defining member opposite the movement of the analyte to be detected can give the appearance of the analyte remaining stationary. Movement of the channel-defining member opposite the direction of movement of the analyte, in combination with movement of the modulating optics opposite the direction of movement of the analyte to be detected, can be used in combination in order to accumulate data on all analytes in the channel-defining member.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b>, and according to various embodiments, instead of one irradiation source, a plurality of irradiation sources can be provided to excite marker compounds in a sample. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the irradiation sources can include four LEDs <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. The LEDs can be positioned so as to irradiate channel defining member <b>58</b>, which can define two channels in the form of for example, two capillary tubes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>. Each LED can emit non-coherent light in a predetermined range of wavelengths. For example, LED <b>50</b> and LED <b>52</b> can emit substantially blue light, LED <b>54</b> can emit substantially green light, and LED <b>56</b> can emit substantially yellow light. As the above example shows, multiple LEDs can be used to increase the available light. For example, if LEDs <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> emit blue light, they can be used simultaneously, either continuously or in a pulsed fashion, in this way increasing the amount of available blue light to obtain a proportional response in the associated markers. Although each type of marker used can ideally be excited by a different wavelength, LEDs of the optimum wavelength and power level for excitation of a given marker may not be available for each given application. Thus, different markers can be excited by the same LED, according to various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to various embodiments, the modulating optics according depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, can be comparable to the modulating optics in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with like components having been labeled with like reference numerals. Thus, for each irradiation source, a conditioning filter <b>18</b> and a focusing optical system <b>19</b> are provided, it being understood that the respective conditioning filters and focusing system for the respective irradiation sources are not, however, necessarily identical merely by virtue of the fact that they have been labeled with like reference numerals. As previously noted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the function of each conditioning filter <b>18</b> can be to let through only light in the wavelength range of excitation light for one or more of the markers. The conditioning filters <b>18</b> each can substantially block predetermined ranges of wavelengths of light emitted by the corresponding LED. The predetermined ranges correspond to wavelengths of light that can overlap with the emission spectra of the markers being excited by the corresponding LED. Each focusing optical system <b>19</b> can focus the conditioned light from the conditioning filter onto the detection zone <b>14</b>. As shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the detection zone <b>14</b> can correspond to a respective detection zone for each of the shown capillary tubes. Excited markers in detection zone <b>14</b> can emit light signals in the form of emitted light <b>22</b>. The light from the detection zone can include the emitted light <b>22</b>, and, in addition, a portion of the conditioned light <b>20</b> passing through the detection zone.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to various embodiments, the light <b>20</b>/<b>22</b> from the detection zone can be collimated by collimating optical system <b>24</b>, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. The collimated light can be passed through a corresponding bandpass filter <b>51</b> on filter wheel <b>60</b> as shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. It can be noted that the bandpass filters <b>51</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>57</b>, and FD, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>have been shown in broken lines because, in those figures, the depiction of the filter wheel <b>60</b> is not cross-sectional, but rather represents plan views thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the filter wheel <b>60</b> is shown in more detail, and includes a plurality of bandpass filters <b>51</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>57</b>, and FD. Each of the bandpass filters can be adapted to let through, substantially exclusively, predetermined wavelengths of light from the detection zone corresponding to a portion of the wavelengths of the light signals emitted by an associated marker. According to various embodiments, there can be a bandpass filter provided for each associated marker. The portion of the wavelengths of the light signals allowed through a respective bandpass filter can include all of the light signals emitted by an associated marker, or it can include a range of wavelengths about the peak intensity of the light signals emitted by the associated marker. For example, the range of wavelengths about the peak intensity of emitted light signals can be between about 5% and about 20% of wavelengths on each side of the peak intensity for a given marker, or it can include the range of wavelengths at about half of the peak intensity, full width at half max. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, bandpass filter <b>51</b> can be adapted to filter therethrough light signals emitted by given markers responsive to LED <b>50</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the apparatus can be depicted in a mode where LED <b>50</b> can irradiate the detection zone <b>14</b>. However, any of the shown LEDs <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>, can be selectively used to irradiate the detection zone <b>14</b>, or the detection zone <b>14</b> can be irradiated by more than one LED. The filter wheel <b>60</b> can be actuated by a filter wheel mechanism <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. The filter wheel mechanism <b>62</b> can control the filter wheel to selectively position, in the path of the collimated light, the bandpass filter corresponding to the marker excited by active LED, that is by the LED being used to irradiate the detection zone. Filter wheel mechanism <b>62</b> can be controlled by a microprocessor or other similar device (not shown) as known to those skilled in the art. The filtered light can be focused by a re-imaging optical system <b>30</b> onto an array <b>34</b> of solid-state detectors, or detector array <b>34</b>, for example, the photo-detecting surface of the parallel register of a charge-coupled device, for example, CCD <b>32</b>. According to various embodiments, a single LED can be used to excite all markers, or multiple LEDs can be used with one LED exciting each respective marker, or multiple LEDs can be used to excite a marker, or combinations thereof. The selection and number of bandpass filters for use can be a function of the markers themselves, the number of LEDs, or other factors as knows to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to various embodiments, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the filter wheel can include a filter FD thereon, adapted to let through only light signals generated by a fifth marker. Four markers can be used to label the moving analytes where the analytes are DNA fragments, each marker corresponding to a given one of the bases in a DNA chain, that is, purines A (adenine) and G (guanine), and pyrimidines C (cytosine) and T (thymine). According to various embodiments, a fifth marker can, for example, be used for fragment analysis of the analytes. The fifth marker can be any marker, such as a dye marker, for doing fragment analysis as known to those skilled in the art. It is to be noted that, according to various embodiments, the number of markers that can be used are not limited to four or five as stated in the above example, but are rather limited only by the number of dyes available on the market and responsive to the irradiation source or sources being used based on application needs. Fragment analysis can be accomplished using, for example, the GENESCAN&#xae; Analysis software produced by Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, Calif. The GENESCAN&#xae; Analysis software calculates the size of the unknown analytes by generating a calibration or sizing curve based upon the migration times of the analytes in a standard that have been labeled with a marker. The unknown analytes can be mapped onto the curve and converted from migration times to sizes. In the case of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fifth marker filter FD on filter wheel <b>60</b> can let through light signals corresponding to markers used to label analytes in the standard. These markers can be excitable by at least one of the irradiation sources <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>, appropriately mounted to allow fragment analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>through <b>6</b><i>e </i>depict images on the detector array <b>34</b> of CCD <b>32</b> shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, wherein the images can be produced by moving analyte bands. Exemplary images are shown for exemplary markers that can be used to label the analytes, and that can be responsive to excitation by a given one of the irradiation sources <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>. Each frame of photo-detecting surface <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>through <b>6</b><i>e </i>depicts two lanes of analyte bands, each lane corresponding to one of the two capillaries of channel-defining member <b>58</b>. The bands move along the direction of migration M. The bands are shown in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>through <b>6</b><i>e </i>as being limited in the spectral direction because the light recovered from the markers has been filtered through a corresponding bandpass filter <b>51</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>57</b>, or FD. At the right of each frame is an intensity profile <b>45</b> corresponding to charges on the right lane of photo-detecting surface <b>36</b>, which corresponds to a capillary of channel-defining member <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to various embodiments, the intensity profiles can be aligned and combined according to known methods. The intensity profiles can be multicomponented in order to account for any spectral overlap. As described with regard to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the serial register of the CCD <b>32</b> in the embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, collects the charges accumulated for each analyte band during its integration time. All signals received from the detector can be converted from analog to digital and conveyed to a serial port for transmission to a multipurpose computer for storage, further processing, and analysis. Alternatively or additionally, the analog output can be sent directly to an output device for display or printing. By way of example, a multipurpose computer can be used to perform the multicomponenting process. Multicomponenting is a process that is known to those skilled in the art, and can involve a spectral calibration within a multicomponenting software program. The spectral calibration can be obtained through a predetermined signature matrix corresponding to each marker. Each signature matrix can provide a signature snapshot of the intensity of light signals from a given marker as a function of the wavelengths of those light signals. By virtue of the signature matrices, a combination of intensity curves for a given wavelength band emitted from the detection zone can be broken down into its components corresponding to light signals emitted by individual ones of the markers. In this way, a relatively accurate assessment of the light signals corresponding to respective ones of the markers can be made for the detection process.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to various embodiments, the apparatus as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, can irradiate detection zone <b>14</b> by irradiating each respective one of the irradiation sources <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>, in sequence. The filter wheel can be adjusted to dispose a bandpass filter <b>51</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>57</b>, or FD, corresponding to the marker being used before collimating optical system <b>24</b>. The detection zone can be irradiated for the duration of the integration time, during which the analyte bands move across the detection zone. During the integration time, the charges generated by the light signals from the markers to be detected can be moved along a parallel register in the direction of migration. The charges can be accumulated in the detector or CCD <b>32</b> before they are read. Thereafter, the process can be repeated until all of the irradiation sources have irradiated the detection zone, and until all filters, including filter FD, have been positioned before the collimating lens to filter the light therefrom. Detector <b>32</b> can be a frame transfer CCD, wherein each frame of the CCD upon which charges have been accumulated can be transferred to a storage array, making the image array available for the next series of charge accumulations produced by the next respective one of the irradiation sources being used.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The above process can be repeated in cycles as many times as necessary in order to obtain sufficient data regarding each analyte being detected. Fewer cycles can result in an increase in signal, because fewer cycles mean longer integration times, and therefore increased readout signals over the noise typically associated with a CCD. On the other hand, increasing the number of cycles can improve the dynamic range of the system. The dynamic range of the system is defined as the largest peak signal that can be read by a given CCD (or &#x201c;full well capacity&#x201d;) over the smallest peak that can be read by the CCD just above the noise level. A CCD typically has a given full well capacity. If a peak signal is above the full well capacity of a CCD, it will be off the scale of the CCD. Short integration times allow peak signals to be generally attenuated so as to reduce the possibility of saturating the CCD with off-scale signals, that is, with signals that go beyond the CCDs full well capacity. By using more cycles, analyte concentrations can be increased while still allowing the CCD to reliably detect signal levels without saturation. According to various embodiments, there is a trade-off between using fewer cycles at a longer integration time such as, for example, 5 seconds, and using more cycles at a shorter integration time such as, for example, 1 second. Longer integration times are useful where the noise level is relatively high and the sensitivity of the system needs to be increased because of the noise level. In systems where the noise level is relatively low, shorter integration times allow multiple reads of signals from the same marker, and the read signals can be multicomponented, allowing the detection of brighter peaks without going off the scale of the CCD.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">By way of example, a frame transfer CCD can collect light signals corresponding to a blue marker during integration time t while an LED exciting primarily the blue marker irradiates the detection zone. Thereafter, the entire CCD is read out. A filter wheel can be moved to position a bandpass filter associated with a green marker before a collimating optical system, and an LED exciting primarily the green marker can irradiate the detection zone. The CCD can collect the light signals corresponding to the green marker during integration time t. The entire CCD is then read out. The filter wheel can be moved to position a bandpass filter associated with a yellow marker before a collimating optical system, and an LED exciting primarily the yellow marker can irradiate the detection zone. The CCD then collects the light signals corresponding to the yellow marker during integration time t, and the entire CCD is thereafter read out. The above process can be repeated for all five markers, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. The process can be repeated a number of times equal to the number of markers. According to various embodiments, one or both of the LED and bandpass filter can be changed between CCD readouts. As suggested in the above example, the image of the analyte band can take about five times the integration time to travel from the top of the frame transfer CCD to the bottom thereof, that is, to the readout register. Each readout of the CCD can correspond to one marker. All of the readouts can be aligned and combined in a known manner for multicomponenting.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">An example of multicomponenting is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>f </i>through <b>6</b><i>h</i>. For purposes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>f </i>through <b>6</b><i>h</i>, the filters <b>51</b>, <b>53</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>57</b>, and FD, are presumed to pass wavelengths of light in the blue, green, yellow, red and &#x201c;fifth&#x201d; portions of the spectrum, respectively. The &#x201c;fifth&#x201d; portion can, for example, be in the orange range of the spectrum. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>f </i>is a schematic representation of an electropherogram showing fluorescence intensity curves during three readings of the signals by detector <b>32</b>, wherein each curve corresponds to light passed through a respective filter of the filter wheel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The intensity curves correspond to a reading of light signals emitted from an analyte labeled with a marker, for example, FAM, a dye marker that emits light signals mostly in blue. The first portion of each curve, drawn in solid lines, corresponds to a reading from the respective blue filter, green filter, yellow filter, red filter, or fifth filter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> during a first integration time t. The second portion of each curve, drawn in broken lines, corresponds to a reading from the respective filter during a second integration time t. The third portion of each curve, drawn in solid lines, corresponds to a reading from the respective filter during a third integration time t. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>f</i>, the horizontal axis corresponds to distance traveled by the analyte, and the vertical axis corresponds, for each filter, to the fluorescence intensity of light emerging from that filter. Thus, the first set of curves in solid lines represents intensity curves for light passing through each filter during a first cycle of the filter wheel <b>60</b>. The second set of curves in broken lines represents intensity curves for light passing through each filter during a second cycle of the filter wheel <b>60</b>. The third set of curves in solid lines represents intensity curves for light passing through each filter during a third cycle of the filter wheel <b>60</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>f</i>, the light from the blue filter exhibits the most intensity during each cycle, the intensity decreasing as light is collected from the green filter, the yellow filter, the red filter and the fifth filter, respectively. As seen in the instant example, therefore, spectral overlap causes FAM to emit mostly in blue, some in green, less in yellow, etc. As filter wheel <b>60</b> is rotated within each cycle, to place a subsequent filter in the path of fluorescence from the detection zone <b>14</b>, the analyte moves a distance x as marked on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>f. </i></p>

These dye markers are exemplary of those that can be used in various embodiments where a plurality of dye markers are to be used, such as with systems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>i</i>, the x-axis corresponds to wavelengths, expressed in nanometers (nm), emitted by an irradiation source. The y-axis corresponds to the percentage of excitation efficiency. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>i, </i>5-FAM has a maximum absorbance, corresponding to its peak percent excitation efficiency, at about 490 nm. When maximum absorbance of a dye marker occurs at a given wavelength, it indicates that the dye marker fluoresces at its peak fluorescence intensity when it is irradiated at that given wavelength As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>i</i>, JOE has a maximum absorbance at about 526 nm, TAMRA has a maximum absorbance at about 560 nm, and ROX has a maximum absorbance at about 588 nm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>i </i>also shows that, when a dye marker, such as 5-FAM, is irradiated at its maximum absorbance wavelength, other dye markers, such as, for example, JOE, TAMRA, and ROX, do exhibit some absorbance, although to a lesser extent than 5-FAM. Any irradiation source, for example, an LED, can be used to emit the wavelengths indicated on the x-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>j</i>, the x-axis corresponds to wavelengths of fluorescent light, expressed in nm, emitted by excited dye markers. The y-axis corresponds to the percentage of fluorescence intensity.

The wavelengths on the x-axis are those that can be emitted by the four mentioned dye markers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>j </i>shows that where a dye marker, such as TAMRA, fluoresces at its peak fluorescence intensity, other dye makers, such as 5-FAM, JOE, and ROX, also fluoresce, although at lesser fluorescence intensities than TAMRA.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When different light wavelength sources are used, each dye marker in the detection zone can be excited efficiently, and in a way that allows detection by its unique spectral signature. When two dye markers exhibit fluorescence intensity peaks that are close together, for example, when the difference between the fluorescence intensity peaks of the two dye markers is less than about 30 nm, there can be a high level of overlap of the light emitted by the two dye markers. A high level of overlap can make it difficult to distinguish between the light emitted by the two dye markers, and therefore can make it difficult to determine the relative amounts of the two dye markers. Typically, there is overlap present in the excitation and emission wavelengths of the different dye markers, as suggested, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>i </i>and <b>6</b><i>j</i>. However, the overlap can be minimized by selecting dye markers that present easily distinguishable fluorescence intensity peaks, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>j</i>. According to various embodiments, it is possible to first start with an irradiation source emitting radiation within a given range of wavelengths, and to investigate each such irradiation source to see how well it excites available dye markers. Graphs such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>i </i>and <b>6</b><i>j </i>can be used in this context. For example, where excitation efficiency curves of various dye markers are plotted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>i</i>, an irradiation source, such as an LED emitting light in a given range of wavelengths, can be predicted to excite given ones of the dye markers based on their excitation efficiencies. Using a fluorescence intensity graph as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>j</i>, the amount of overlap between intensity peaks of the different markers can be determined. Using this information, a set of dye markers best suited for a particular application can be chosen. Once the dye makers are chosen, the filters corresponding thereto can be chosen, for example, the filters shown on the filter wheel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> described above, and on the filter wheel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> described below. The best set of markers can exhibit the desired minimum amount of overlap at the emitted wavelengths that are to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Because each marker can have a different excitation curve, the fluorescence output of a marker can be dramatically increased by the use of an LED that is well matched to the excitation wavelength of the marker. Matching the light source and marker can increase emission from the marker of interest, while minimizing undesired light, for example, background light from the system and emissions from other markers, resulting in better quality data. For example, if a blue/green LED having an emission wavelength of about 503 nm is used for the marker designated FAM, the excitation of FAM can be high, about 80%, and the excitation for another marker, for example, ROX, can be low, for example, about 6%. Similarly, a yellow LED with ark emission wavelength of about 592 nm will not excite FAM, but can excite ROX in an amount of about 90%.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Another embodiment of an apparatus is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, a number of irradiation sources can be used to sequentially irradiate a detection zone. The generated light signals having wavelengths in differing frequency ranges can correspond to charges spatially offset on the same array of the detector, wherein the offset is a function of the bandpass filter used in connection with the markers emitting the light signals. Reading of the accumulated charges on the detector array during time delay integration (TDI) can be continuous rather than a frame-by-frame reading.</p>

According to various embodiments, the two wheels <b>61</b> and <b>61</b>&#x2032; can be coupled to one another and to the filter wheel drive <b>62</b> by way of a rotatable shaft <b>63</b>. According to various embodiments, a plurality of irradiation sources can be provided that are not on an irradiation wheel. According to various embodiments, the two wheels <b>61</b> and <b>61</b>&#x2032; can be actuated independently by their own respective wheel drives, and are not coupled to one another by a shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the apparatus can be provided with an offset system <b>64</b>. Offset system <b>64</b> can either be disposed on the filter wheel <b>61</b>&#x2032; in association with a corresponding bandpass filter, or can be coupled to at least one of a detector <b>32</b>, one or more components of the modulating optics system, and the detection zone <b>14</b>. The offset system <b>64</b> can spatially offset the light signals impinging upon the array <b>34</b> of the detector <b>32</b> by a predetermined amount as a function of the bandpass filter being used. The offset can be accomplished by an offset system <b>64</b> including a plurality of offset mechanisms <b>66</b> disposed on filter wheel <b>61</b>&#x2032;, wherein the offset mechanism <b>66</b> is shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Each offset mechanism <b>66</b> can be associated with a respective one of the bandpass filters to offset the filtered light therefrom. The offset mechanisms <b>66</b> can include one or more grating, mirror, prism, or any other device for offsetting light as known to those skilled in the art, or a combination thereof. One or more offset mechanism <b>66</b> can be distributed about the circumference of filter wheel <b>61</b>&#x2032; adjacent the corresponding bandpass filter, and between the bandpass filter and the detector <b>32</b>, otherwise being identical to wheel <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the alternative, the offset can be accomplished by providing an offset system <b>64</b> including an offset control device <b>67</b>, also shown in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to various embodiments, the offset system can move at least one of the detection zone <b>14</b>, collimating optical system <b>24</b>, re-imaging optical system <b>30</b>, or detector array <b>34</b>, by a predetermined amount in order to offset the light signals impinging upon the detector array <b>34</b>.

Such devices can include, for example, solenoids, or motor driven linear actuators, for example, lead screws, rack-and pinion systems, cams, and the like. For example, a cam can be attached to drive shaft <b>63</b> to cause a predetermined translation of the re-imaging optical system <b>30</b> in a number of ways recognizable by those skilled in the art. The predetermined amount of translation can correspond in a one to one ratio with the amount by which the light signals impinging upon the detector array are sought to be offset. The range of wavelengths offset by the predetermined amount can be a function of the irradiation source, the markers, or other factors known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The predetermined amount by which a given set of light signals corresponding to an irradiation source and its respective bandpass filter is to be offset can be readily determined by determining where on the detector array the charges produced by the given set of light signals corresponding to a specific bandpass filter should be situated with respect to the detector array itself, and with respect to sets of light signals in different wavelength frequency ranges corresponding to the other bandpass filters. Thus, where individual mechanisms <b>66</b> are used in conjunction with a corresponding bandpass filter to offset the light emerging therefrom, each mechanism <b>66</b> can be chosen according to the frequency range of wavelengths that the bandpass filter lets through. In the alternative, where offset control device <b>67</b> is used, the offset control can be programmed to offset at least one of the detection zone <b>14</b>, one or more components of the modulating optics system, and the detector array <b>34</b>, with respect to one another by the predetermined amount. The offsetting could, by way of example, be accomplished by moving the detection zone <b>14</b>, the modulating optics, or the detector array <b>34</b>, in a translational motion by the predetermined amount, causing the image created by the light signals to be correspondingly spatially offset. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can involve the use of a plurality of LEDs similar to those used in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to various embodiments, any suitable number of bandpass filters can be used, the number being determined at least in part by the markers being used. Any number of different irradiation sources, for example, LEDs, that can emit light in any number of wavelength ranges, can be used.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In operation, the detection zone <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is irradiated by a first one of the irradiation sources, for example, by LED <b>50</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The light signals emitted by the markers excitable by the light from LED <b>50</b> can be, as previously described, filtered through a corresponding bandpass filter <b>51</b>, and thereafter focused onto detector array <b>34</b> by a re-imaging optical system. Where offset system <b>64</b> includes mechanism <b>66</b>, the filtered light from bandpass filter <b>51</b> is offset by a respective mechanism <b>66</b> by the predetermined amount corresponding to the range of wavelengths that the bandpass filter lets through, as described above. Each subsequent irradiation source and corresponding bandpass filter can be positioned to irradiate the detection zone and to filter the light therefrom through a rotation of the wheels <b>61</b> and <b>61</b>&#x2032; in conjunction with one another. As previously suggested, any suitable number of markers, bandpass filters, and LEDs can be used in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, charges can be accumulated for each respective irradiation source during the integration time of the analyte bands excitable by light from the respective irradiation source. The accumulation of charges can be effected, as previously described, by shifting the charges on the detector array, by moving relative to one another the detector array and light signals from the detection zone, by moving the modulating optics relative to the channel-defining member, or a combination thereof. After each integration time, the wheels <b>61</b> and <b>61</b>&#x2032; can be rotated to position the next irradiation source and corresponding bandpass filter in a functional position, that is, in a position for the irradiation source to irradiate the detection zone and for the bandpass filter to filter the light from the detection zone. The process can be repeated until one cycle is completed, that is, until all of the irradiation sources and filters have been used once. The cycle can be repeated as many times as necessary and/or desired on an application-by-application basis. To the extent that the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an offset system for spatially offsetting light signals in differing frequency ranges, the exemplary embodiment can allow a continuous reading of accumulated charges by the detector, thereby making possible a continuous time delay integration of the light signals from the analytes into the detector army <b>34</b>. Alternately, as shown in the exemplary embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b><i>a</i>, and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the accumulated charges corresponding to each range of wavelengths of light signals can be read and discarded by the detector before charges for the next range of wavelengths are read.</p>

The array depicts charges generated by light signals across the color axis &#x3bb;, offset with respect to one another by offset system <b>64</b> in the manner previously described. According to various embodiments, the number of wavelength ranges used can be dependent on the particular application, and can range from one to as many as the system supports. The &#x3bb; axis is referred to here as the &#x201c;color axis&#x201d; rather than the &#x201c;spectral axis,&#x201d; because the colors, one for each bandpass filter, do not need to be arranged from shorter to longer wavelengths. According to various embodiments and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to the extent that charges from light signals of differing wavelengths can be produced on the same array of light signals so as to be spatially offset with respect to one another, those charges can be accumulated during the integration time and read by the detector on a continuous basis. This can eliminate the need to shut off the detector in order to allow a reading of charges in a given range of wavelengths on a frame-by-frame basis, and/or can eliminate the need for a frame transfer CCD. Further, a longer integration time and simpler data output can be achieved, and a cheaper CCD can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to various embodiments, the detection zone, including one or more channels, or a slab gel, can be irradiated with multiple color irradiation sources, for example, multiple color LEDs. The use of multiple color LEDs can greatly improve the absorption efficiency of some of the markers.

A bandpass filter can be used to substantially block all of the unwanted excitation light from the irradiation source. As used herein, &#x201c;irradiation source&#x201d; can include one or more sources of irradiation. An example of the results, in the form of graphs demonstrating the effects of a conditioned irradiation source in combination with a bandpass filter, are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>through <b>9</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to various embodiments and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>through <b>9</b><i>d</i>, a detection zone of an apparatus can be irradiated by two irradiation sources simultaneously, although any number of irradiation sources can be used simultaneously according to various embodiments. A system such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used, replacing the single LED in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with a set of two or more LEDs. The associated optics can be altered according to the number of irradiation sources used.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">According to various embodiments, a conditioning filter can be used for each set of LEDs. The conditioning filter can substantially block predetermined ranges of wavelengths of light emitted by the set of LEDs as previously described, each predetermined range corresponding to a respective LED, as demonstrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a </i>shows a graph of relative excitation intensity for each of two LEDs of a set of LEDs, versus wavelength expressed in nanometers.

It is to be understood that various embodiments are not limited to the above two types of LEDs, but encompasses any number of LEDs emitting light in any range of frequencies according to application needs. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, each predetermined range of wavelengths that passes through the conditioning filter corresponds to a subset of the wavelengths emitted by each respective LED depicted in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>. The wavelengths that pass through the conditioning filter can be capable of exciting the markers responsive to each respective LED. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b </i>is a graph of percent transmission of light through the conditioning filter versus wavelength. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, the conditioning filter can substantially block all excitation light except for wavelengths around the respective LED emission maximum. For example, the conditioned light ranges can correspond to a wavelength range of from about 450 nm to about 490 nm, and to a second wavelength range of from about 580 nm to about 605 nm, corresponding to the first and second irradiation sources, respectively. The conditioning filter, and the predetermined ranges capable of passing therethrough, can be functions of the LED set being used.</p>

The conditioned light can be focused onto the detection zone of an electrophoretic detection system, as previously described above. The light emitted by markers in the detection zone can be passed through a bandpass filter. The bandpass filter can allow, substantially exclusively, predetermined wavelengths of light from the detection zone to pass through, wherein the predetermined wavelengths of light correspond to a portion of the wavelengths of the light signals emitted by an associated set of markers. The light that passes through the bandpass filter can be filtered light. The bandpass filter can substantially block the excitation light from the LEDs which passes the detection zone. The portion of the wavelengths of the light signals that can pass through the bandpass filter can include all of the light signals, or a range of wavelengths about the peak intensity of light signals of each respective marker. For example, the range of wavelengths about the peak intensity of light signals can be between about 5% and about 20% of wavelengths on each side of the peak wavelength of a given marker, or it can include full width at half max. The collection of the predetermined wavelengths can be by dispersion, tier example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or by use of additional bandpass filters, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>

The beam emitted by the light source is also known as an excitation beam that can be filtered by an excitation filter at an excitation wavelength range. Comparably, a conditioning filter can be used between the detection zone holding the sample solution and a detector. The fluorescence or luminance emitted by the sample upon excitation is also known as an emission beam that can be filtered by an emission filter at an emission wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to various embodiments, a light source can be used to provide excitation beams to irradiate a sample solution containing one or more dyes. For example, two or more excitation beams having the same or different wavelength emissions can be used such that each excitation beam excites a different respective dye in the sample. The excitation beam can be aimed from the light source directly at the sample, through a wall of a sample container containing the sample, or can be conveyed by various optical systems to the sample. An optical system can include one or more of, for example, a mirror, a beam splitter, a fiber optic, a light guide, or combinations thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">According to various embodiments, filter can be used that is a single bandpass filter or a multiple bandpass filter. As used herein, a bandpass filter and a passband filter are used interchangeably. A multiple passband filter can be, for example, a multiple-notch Filter or a multi-Rugate filter. A multiple passband filter can be used with an incoherent light source, for example, a halogen lamp, a white light source, and/or one or more LEDs or OLEDs emitting light at different wavelengths. A multiple passband filter can be used with a multiple laser-based light source emitting light at different wavelengths. Examples of manufacturing and use of Rugate filters and Rugate beam splitters can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat.

A multiple beam splitter can be coated at an angle, causing a variance in a thickness across a filter substrate, to compensate for wavelength shift with an angle. A beam splitter can be disposed at a low angle along a light or beam path to sharpen edges of the filtered light and can ease fabrication. A beam splitter can be disposed at a 45&#xb0; angle of incidence along a light beam path. A low angle can include an angle of incidence less than 45&#xb0;, less than 30&#xb0;, or less than 15&#xb0;. A multiple passband filter can be formed by coating different light interference materials over respective areas of a substrate used in a multiple passband filter manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A Rugate filter is an example of an interference coating based on the refractive index that varies continuously in a direction, for example, perpendicular or 45 degrees to the film plane. When the refractive index varies periodically within two extreme values, a minus filter with high transmittance on either side of the rejection band can be made. Periodic Rugate filters can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Rugate notch filters can use refractory metal oxides to achieve coatings with exceptional thermal and environmental stability. These filters can be used in place of other types of notch filters, particularly where durability and reliability are desired. Rugate notch filters are available from Barr Associates (Westford, Mass.). The Rugate notch filter can be used as edge filters and beam splitters. Filter sizes or shapes are not limitations for the Rugate notch filter. The Rugate notch filter can provide environmental and thermal stability, a broad operating temperature range, narrow rejection bands, variety of shapes &#x26; sizes, high throughput, low ripple, and/or a broad spectral range. More information is available from, for example, www.barr-associates-uk.com, www.barrassociates.com/opticalfilters.php.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Multiple-notch filters can be made, for example, with a measured blocking of O.D. 6 or better. Notch filters with this type of deep blocking level at the light wavelength can also afford high transmission close to the light line.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to various embodiments, excitation levels can increase when multiple dyes spaced apart spectrally are irradiated with excitation beams. This can lead to less spectral crosstalk. The dye matrix, condition number, and/or deconvolution in a system can be improved. The increased excitation levels can provide higher signal levels. Higher signal levels can be seen during the utilization of dyes that emit in the &#x201c;red&#x201d; spectrum. The dynamic range of the system can be improved. The system can reduce the compensation for variation in the emission beam intensity for various dyes.</p>

Before focusing the light signals thus filtered onto the detector array of a CCD, a dispersion element can be used, such as grating <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The resulting image on the CCD can be similar to that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, with the addition of one or more dark zones corresponding to the blocked excitation light wavelengths. The existence of one or more dark zones, however, does not prevent the performance of multicomponenting to determine the intrinsic dye concentrations of each band in an electropherogram.

The sorting mechanism can be located a suitable distance from the detection zone to allow sufficient time for determination of the composition of a component of the sample based on the detected charges received corresponding to the light signals associated with the at least one component of the sample. Based on the identification of the component, the component can be directed into one of two or more channels. All components of a certain composition, charge, or other identifying factor, can be directed into the same respective channel.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The sorting mechanism can include, for example, use of an electrostatic force, mechanical movement of respective channels, use of an acoustic pulse to divert the detected component to a respective channel, manipulation of electric field gradients, vacuum, or other means as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Various examples of such methods of sorting are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a </i>depicts a channel <b>12</b> including a detection zone <b>14</b> through which radiation <b>20</b> passes.

The LED can be, for example, an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) an inorganic Light Emitted Diode, that can be polymer-based or small-molecule-based (organic or inorganic), an edge emitting diode (ELED), a Thin Film Electroluminescent Device (TFELD), or a Quantum dot based inorganic &#x201c;organic LED.&#x201d; The LED can include a phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED). As used herein, the terms &#x201c;excitation source,&#x201d; &#x201c;irradiation source,&#x201d; and &#x201c;light source&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">According to various embodiments, excitation beams emitted from the light source can diverge from the light source at an angle of divergence. The angle of divergence can be, for example, from about 5&#xb0; to about 75&#xb0; or more. The angle of divergence can be substantially wide, for example, greater than 45&#xb0;, yet can be efficiently focused by use of a lens, such as a focusing lens.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">According to various embodiments, the light source can include one Light Emitting Diode (LED) or an array of LEDs. According to various embodiments, each LED can be a high power LED that can emit greater than or equal to about 1 mW of excitation energy. In various embodiments, a high power LED can emit at least about 5 mW of excitation energy. In various embodiments, the LED or array of LEDs can emit, for example, at least about 50 mW, at least about 500 mW, or at least about 1 W or more of excitation energy. A cooling device such as, but not limited to, a heat sink or fan, can be used with the LED. An array of high-powered LEDs can be used that draws, for example, upto about 10 watts of energy or more, upto about 100 watts of energy or more, or upto about 1000 watts of energy or more. The total power draw can depend on the power of each LED and the number of LEDs in the array. The use of an LED array can result in a significant reduction in power requirement over other light sources, such as, for example, a 75 watt halogen light source or a 150 watt halogen light source. Exemplary LED array sources are available, for example, from Stocker Yale of Salem, N.H. under the trade name LED AREALIGHTS, or from Lumileds Lighting, LLC of San Jose, Calif. under the trade name LUXEON, for example, a LUXEON STAR. Examples of LEDs can be found at http://www.lumileds.com/products/family.cfm?familyId=1. According to various embodiments, LED light sources can use about 1 milliwatt (mW) or more of power, for example, about 25 mW or more, about 50 mW or more, about 1 W or more, about 5 W or more, about 50 W or more, or about 100 W or more, individually or when in used in an array.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">According to various embodiments, a quantum dot can be used as a source for luminescence and as a fluorescent marker. Quantum dots can be used for both. The quantum dot based LED can be tuned to emit light in a tighter emission bandpass, for example, an emission bandpass including a full-width of half-max of about 10 nm or less, about 20 nm or less, or about 50 nm or less. The quantum dot based LED can increase the efficiency of the fluorescent system. The efficiency of a quantum dot based LED can theoretically be higher than that of conventional LEDs, potentially over 90% when sandwiched directly between two conductive films with each film directly touching each quantum dot as opposed to the present 20% efficiency for standard LEDs. Quantum dot based LEDs can be made utilizing a slurry of quantum dots, where current flows through an average of several quantum dots before being emitted as a photon. This conduction through several quantum dots can cause resistive losses in efficiency. Quantum dots can provide many more colors than conventional LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Quantum dots can be molecular-scale optical beacons. The quantum dot nanocrystals can behave like molecular LEDs (light emitting diodes) by &#x201c;lighting up&#x201d; biological binding events with a broad palette of applied colors. Quantum dots can provide many more colors than conventional fluorophores. Quantum dots can possess many other very desirable optical properties. Nanocrystal quantum dots can be covalently linked to biomolecules using standard conjugation chemistry. The quantum dot conjugate can then be used to detect a binding partner in a wide range of assays. According to various embodiments, streptavidin can be attached to quantum dots to detect biotinylated molecules in a variety of assays. Quantum dots can also be attached to antibodies and oligonucleotides. Any assay that currently uses, for example, fluorescent-tagged molecules, colorimetric enzymes, or colloidal gold, can be improved with quantum dot nanocrystal-tagged conjugates.

<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Quantum dots can provide a versatile probe that can be used in, for example, in multiplex assays. Fluorescent techniques using quantum dot nanocrystals can be much faster than conventional enzymatic and chemiluminescent techniques, can reduce instrument tie-up, and can improve assay throughput. Colorimetric or detected reflectance techniques can be inferior to fluorescence and difficulties ensue when multiplex assays are developed based on these materials. Quantum dots can absorb all wavelengths &#x201c;bluer&#x201d; (i.e., shorter) than the emission wavelength. This capability can simplify the instrumentation required for multiplexed assays, since all different label colors can be excited with a single excitation source.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A Quantum dot based LED can emit light in an emission band that is narrower than an emission band of a normal LED, for example, about 50% narrower or about 25% narrower. The emission band of the quantum dots can be a function of the size distribution of the quantum dots, and thus can theoretically be extremely narrow. The Quantum dot based LED can also emit light at an electrical energy conversion efficiency of about, 90% or more, for example, approaching 100%. OLED films, including Quantum dot, based LEDs, can be applied to a thermal block, used for heating and cooling samples, in a fluorescence system without interfering with the operation of the thermal block.</p>

The OLED film can include one or more of a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an emissive layer, and an electron-transport layer. The OLED can include a film that is about one micrometer in thickness, or less. When an appropriate voltage is applied to the film, the injected positive and negative charges can recombine in the emissive layer to produce light by means of electroluminescence. The amount of light emitted by the OLED can be related to the voltage applied through the electrodes to the thin film of the OLED.

Multiple OLEDs can be combined on a substrate, wherein the multiple OLEDs can emit light at different wavelengths. Multiple OLEDs on a single substrate or multiple adjacent substrates can form an interlaced or a non-interlaced pattern of light of various wavelengths. The pattern can correspond to, for example, a sample reservoir arrangement. One or more OLEDs can form a shape surrounding, for example, a sample reservoir, a series of sample reservoirs, an array of a plurality of sample reservoirs, or a sample flow path. The sample path can be, for example, a channel, a capillary, or a micro-capillary. One or more OLEDs can be formed to follow the sample flow path.

For example, the OLED can be curved, circular, oval, rectangular, square, triangular, annular, or any other geometrically regular shape. The OLED can be formed as an irregular geometric shape. The OLED can illuminate one or more sample reservoirs, for example, an OLED can illuminate one, two, three, four, or more sample reservoirs simultaneously, or in sequence. The OLED can be designed, for example, to illuminate all the wells of a corresponding multi-well array.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">According to various embodiments, one or more excitation filters can be incorporated into the OLED substrate, thus eliminating additional equipment and reducing the amount of space needed for an optical system. For example, one or more filters can be formed in a layer of a substrate including one or more OLEDs and a layer including a sample flow path. The wavelength emitted by the OLED can be tuned by printing a fluorescent dye in the OLED substrate, as taught, for example, by Hebner et al. in &#x201c;Local Tuning of Organic Light-Emitting Diode Color by Dye Droplet Application,&#x201d; APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS, Vol. 73, No. 13 (Sep. 28, 1998), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
