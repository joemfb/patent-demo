<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pickup/replay device of a moving image, and, more particularly, to an image pickup device, a replay device, an image pickup/replay device, a processing method of these devices, and a program for causing a computer to carry out the processing method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An image pickup device for picking up a moving image has become widespread and many users can pick up a moving image casually. Since a user can pick up moving images by a simple operation, the user picks up images of streets and landscapes as his or her fancy dictates. As a result, a large amount of picked up image data is accumulated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a large amount of moving image data is accumulated as described above, it is difficult for a user to memorize all the positions where images are picked up even if they are picked up by oneself. Accordingly, it is necessary to correlate the data of picked up moving images to the positions where they were picked up by some sort of method. For example, there is proposed a recording system for recording image data picked up by a camera portion and position data obtained by GPS (Global Positioning System) by associating them to each other (refer to, for example, Patent Document 1).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the conventional art described above, when image data is replayed, positions are displayed based on position data by recording the image data and position data. However, in the conventional art, it is not apparent when the position data is recorded. If all the position data are recorded at every predetermined intervals while moving images are picked up, there is a possibility that a large amount of data region is used depending on the intervals. In contrast, when position data is recorded in a unit of a moving image file, there is a possibility that accurate image pickup positions cannot be recorded when images are picked up while moving to different positions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, when images are packed up while moving to different positions, it is preferable to easily grasp the geographical distribution of image pickup positions, which are used as candidates where moving images are replayed, and image pickup positions while moving images are being replayed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to effectively record position information corresponding to moving image data and to clearly display the position information when the moving image data is relayed.</p>

With this arrangement, there can be achieved an advantage in that the position at which a moving image being replayed was picked up can be more clearly shown.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the first aspect, the map drawing means may show an attribute as to the reliability of the position information to the marks of the plurality of positions. With this arrangement, there can be achieved an advantage in that a degree of correctness of the respective positions can be clearly shown.</p>

With this arrangement, there can be achieved an advantage in that the image picked-up order of the moving image data can be clearly shown.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, in the first aspect, the moving image replay device may be further composed of a replay position information obtaining means for obtaining position information corresponding to a replay time of the moving image data replayed by the moving image replay means as replay position information, a previous replay position information holding means for holding position information before the replay time as previous replay position information, and a replay position information comparing means for comparing the replay position information with the previous replay position information and detecting disagreement therebetween, wherein when the disagreement is detected, the map drawing means may apply a special effect to the marks corresponding to the replay position information among the marks of the plurality of positions, and when the disagreement is detected, the previous replay position information holding means may hold the replay position information as new previous replay position information. With this arrangement, there can be achieved an advantage in that each time a position changes as a replay proceeds, the position can be more clearly shown. Further, at the time, the moving image replay device may be further composed of a display update timer for measuring an obtaining interval at which the replay position information is obtained, wherein, each time the display update timer measures the obtaining interval, the replay position information obtaining means may obtain the replay position information.

<p id="p-0045" num="0079">Next, an embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to the drawings in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing an arrangement example of an image pickup device <b>100</b> in the embodiment of the present invention. The image pickup device <b>100</b> has an operating portion <b>110</b>, a camera portion <b>120</b>, a memory <b>130</b>, a display portion <b>140</b>, a recording portion <b>150</b>, and a control portion <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0081">The operating portion <b>110</b> receives an operation input from a user. The operating portion <b>110</b> can be realized as an operation button disposed to the image pickup device or a touch panel integrated with the display portion <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0082">The camera portion <b>120</b> picks up a subject and is composed of an optical block such as a lens and the like and a signal converting portion such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) and the like. The memory <b>130</b> is a working region for temporarily storing moving image data picked up by the camera portion <b>120</b>, and a volatile memory is ordinarily used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0083">The display portion <b>140</b> displays moving images, which are being picked up, replayed moving images, and the like on a display such as an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and the like. Note that the display portion <b>140</b> may be arranged integrally with the operating portion <b>110</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0084">The recording portion <b>150</b> records picked up moving image data and information accompanying with the picked up moving image data, and a non-volatile recording medium is ordinarily used. The control portion <b>160</b> controls the respective portions of the image pickup device <b>100</b> and is realized by, for example, a microcomputer and the like controlled by a program.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0085">Further, the image pickup device <b>100</b> may contain a GPS receiving portion <b>170</b> and a speed/acceleration speed sensor <b>180</b> or may be externally connected thereto. The GPS receiving portion <b>170</b> receives information (position information) as to the position of the image pickup device <b>100</b> from a GPS satellite. The speed/acceleration speed sensor <b>180</b> is a sensor for sensing a speed and an acceleration speed of the image pickup device <b>100</b>, and a gyro sensor for sensing an angular speed and an acceleration speed sensor for sensing an acceleration speed, for example, can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing an example of a functional arrangement for recording a moving image by the image pickup device <b>100</b> in the embodiment of the present invention. Assumed here are a position measuring portion <b>210</b>, an image pickup position information obtaining portion <b>220</b>, a previous image pickup position information holding portion <b>230</b>, a point of change detecting portion <b>240</b>, a position measuring timer <b>250</b>, a system timer <b>260</b>, a thumbnail creating portion <b>210</b>, and a speed/acceleration speed measuring portion <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0087">The position measuring portion <b>210</b> measures a position where the image pickup device <b>100</b> is located, and, for example, GPS disposed outside of the image pickup device <b>100</b> is utilized. The image pickup position information obtaining portion <b>220</b> obtains the position information of an image pickup position from the position measuring portion <b>210</b> while a moving image is being picked up and corresponds to the GPS receiving portion <b>170</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The previous image pickup position information holding portion <b>230</b> holds the position information of the image pickup position obtained by the image pickup position information obtaining portion <b>220</b> as previous image pickup position information. Here, the position information may be, for example, information as to a latitude and a longitude obtained from the GPS receiving portion <b>170</b> and further may be information as to a place-name such as a country name, a city name, an area name, and the like obtained making use of a place-name information database <b>700</b> which will be explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0088">The point of change detecting portion <b>240</b> compares the image pickup position information obtained by the image pickup position information obtaining portion <b>220</b> with the previous image pickup position information held by the previous image pickup position information holding portion <b>230</b>, and when a position shown by the image pickup position information changes from a position shown by the previous image pickup position information, the point of change detecting portion <b>240</b> detects it as a &#x201c;point of change&#x201d;. For example, when the point of change detecting portion <b>240</b> compares the information as to a latitude and a longitude held by the previous image pickup position information holding portion <b>230</b> with the information as to a latitude and a longitude shown by the image pickup position information and detects that the former latitude and longitude are spaced apart from the latter ones by predetermined distances, the portion <b>240</b> may detect it as the &#x201c;point of change&#x201d;. Further, when the point of change detecting portion <b>240</b> compares a place-name held by the previous image pickup position information holding portion <b>230</b> with a place-name shown by the image pickup position information and the former place-name is different from the latter one, the portion <b>240</b> may detect it as the &#x201c;point of change&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0117" num="0151">The overlapping portion <b>980</b> creates display data for one screen by overlapping a map drawn by the map drawing portion <b>960</b> with a moving image replayed by the moving image replay portion <b>910</b>. The display portion <b>990</b> displays the display data created by the overlapping portion <b>980</b> on a display such as an LCD and the like. The operation receiving portion <b>1010</b> receives an operation instruction input from the user, and, for example, an operation button disposed to the image pickup device, a touch panel integrated with the display portion <b>990</b> and the like can be assumed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a view showing a third display example of the screen before the moving image is replayed in the embodiment of the present invention. When the operation receiving portion <b>1010</b> receives an instruction for selecting a moving image file, a map display screen <b>1091</b> is displayed on the display portion <b>990</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0153">The image pickup positions (in the example, three positions) of a moving image included in a moving image file selected by the operation receiving portion <b>1010</b> are display and marked on the map display screen <b>1091</b>. These image pickup positions are obtained from the position of point of change information <b>531</b> of the metadata <b>530</b> by the position information obtaining portion <b>1120</b>. The map is obtained from the map information database <b>800</b> by the map information obtaining portion <b>952</b>.

<p id="p-0120" num="0154">Attribute information can be displayed to the marks of the image pickup position according to the image pickup positions by a color, a pattern, and the like. When, for example, the GPS receiver state <b>627</b> of the position information shows that positioning is failed, red color is applied to the image pickup positions to display that image pickup positions are determined by assumption. Further, it is also possible to display a degree of correctness (probability) of the image pickup positions by changing their color from blue to red according to the positioning reliability <b>628</b> of the position information. Note that although a circular shape is employed as a shape of the mark of the image pickup position here, the shape of the mark is not limited to the circular shape and a polygonal shape and a star shape may be employed</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0155">Thumb nails (in the example, three positions of thumbnails A (<b>1092</b>), B (<b>393</b>), and C (<b>1094</b>)) in the respective positions of the moving image included in the moving image file selected by the operation receiving portion <b>1010</b> are displayed on the map display screen <b>1091</b>.

Since the operation receiving portion <b>1010</b> instructs to select the thumbnail A (<b>1092</b>) here, a moving image corresponding to the thumbnail A (<b>1092</b>) is displayed on a replay/display screen <b>1095</b>. The replay/display screen <b>1095</b> is overlapped by the overlapping portion <b>980</b> such that the position A is located at a center. More specifically, when it is instructed to select the thumbnail B (<b>1093</b>), a moving image corresponding to the thumbnail B (<b>393</b>) is displayed at the center of the position B, and further when it is instructed to select the thumbnail C (<b>1094</b>), a moving image corresponding to the thumbnail C (<b>1094</b>) is displayed at the center of the position C.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0158">On the completion of the replay of the moving image corresponding to the thumbnail A (<b>1092</b>), the screen returns to the screen exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> again and waits for an operation instruction from the user. Otherwise, the replay/display screen <b>1095</b> of a moving image corresponding to the thumbnail B (<b>1093</b>) may be displayed at the center of the position B according to the recording order of a moving image file, and then the replay/display screen <b>1095</b> of the moving image corresponding to the thumbnail C (<b>1094</b>) may be displayed at the center of the position C.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a second flowchart showing an example of processing steps until a moving image is displayed in the embodiment of the present invention. When a moving image file is designated, the position of point of change information <b>531</b> of the metadata <b>530</b> of the moving image file is read out by the position information obtaining portion <b>1120</b>, and all the position information of the moving image file is obtained (step S<b>1111</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0161">Map information that covers all the positions included in the obtained position information is obtained by the map information obtaining portion <b>952</b> (step S<b>1112</b>) as well as the place-name information of the respective positions is obtained by the place-name information obtaining portion <b>351</b> (step S<b>1113</b>). Further, thumbnails corresponding to the respective positions are obtained by the thumbnail obtaining portion <b>930</b> (step S<b>1114</b>). Then, a map to be displayed on the map display screen <b>1091</b> is drawn by the map drawing portion <b>960</b> based on the obtained position information, map information, place-name information, and thumbnails (step S<b>1115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0162">Thereafter, when a replay instruction of the moving image is received by the operation receiving portion <b>1010</b> (step S<b>917</b>), the moving image, the replay portion <b>910</b> begins to replay the moving image (step S<b>1120</b>). The replay/display screen <b>1095</b> of the replayed moving image is overlapped on the map display screen <b>1091</b> by the overlapping portion <b>980</b> and displayed on the display portion <b>990</b> (step S<b>1121</b>). At the time, the overlapping portion <b>980</b> overlaps the replay/display screen <b>1095</b> on the map display screen <b>1091</b> at the center of a position corresponding to the moving image being replayed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0163">As described above, according to the embodiment of the present invention, when the position information obtained by the replay position information obtaining portion <b>320</b> shows a different position as a replay proceeds, a position when a moving image is replayed can be clearly shown by lighting or flashing a mark at a corresponding position on a map.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0164">Further, according to the embodiment of the present invention, since the thumbnails obtained by the thumbnail obtaining portion are displayed at the corresponding positions on the map, when the user instructs to select any of the thumbnails, a moving image corresponding to the thumbnail is displayed on the replay/display screen, thereby an intuitively understandable user interface can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0165">Note that the processing steps explained in the embodiment of the present invention may be understood as a method having a series of the steps and further may be understood as a program for causing a computer to carry out the series of the steps or a recording medium for storing the program.</p>
