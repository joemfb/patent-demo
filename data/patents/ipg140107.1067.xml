<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modular dye meters are used to produce compounds comprising a plurality of components, such as colored compounds including enamels and paints. Modular dye meters usually comprise a plurality of tanks for storing individual components and corresponding batching and delivering devices which take specific amounts of each component from the corresponding tank and combine the components depending on desired composition of the compound. In general, there are two types of dye meters: first, dye meters with tanks in a fixed position connected through delivery ducts to a delivering head placed above a vessel for receiving the components of the compound, where delivery of individual components can occur simultaneously; and second, dye meters where the tanks are placed on platforms which rotate to place the individual tanks, or individual sub-groups of tanks, in turn, on the vessel to deliver the components of the compound. Additionally, some modular dye meters batch components based on weight of the component, and some modular dye meters batch components based on volume of the component. Modular dye meters with weight-based batching are typically more accurate but relatively slower compared with modular dye meters with volume-based batching.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">All known dye meters have several disadvantages. First, they are complex leading to reliability problems over time. In particular, since all tanks share the same dye batching and delivering devices, the malfunction of one tank or even routine maintenance can stop production of the compound for a considerable time while spare parts and specialized assistance is obtained. Second, modular dye meters are relatively costly, particularly for small scale manufacturing. Third, modular dye meters are difficult to reconfigure to change the composition of the compound being produced. Fourth, modular dye meters suffer from dripping problems at the end of the delivery ducts, and in such drops both waste components and components can solidify within the delivery ducts causing clogs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a modular dye meter and a method of preparing compounds that are not associated with these disadvantages.</p>

As can be seen, in one embodiment, the modular dye meter <b>1</b> comprises a supporting structure <b>3</b> and a plurality of seats <b>5</b> connected to the supporting structure <b>3</b>. The modular dye meter <b>1</b> further comprises one or more than one modular batching member <b>7</b>, where each modular batching member <b>7</b> is connected to one of the plurality of seats <b>5</b>, such as for example by a mechanical connector. The modular dye meter <b>1</b> further comprises a dispenser <b>9</b>, such as for example a delivering head comprising a plurality of delivering nozzles. The modular dye meter <b>1</b> further comprises one or more than one delivery duct <b>11</b>, where each delivery duct connects one modular batching member <b>7</b> to the dispenser <b>9</b>, thereby allowing fluid to flow from the modular batching member <b>7</b> to the dispenser <b>9</b>. The dispenser <b>9</b> delivers the individual components from the modular batching members <b>7</b> to a vessel to produce the compound. In a preferred embodiment, each delivery duct <b>11</b> can be quickly and easily disconnected from the modular batching member <b>7</b> to allow removal of the modular batching member <b>7</b> from the corresponding seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a preferred embodiment, the plurality of seats <b>5</b> (and corresponding modular batching members <b>7</b> when connected) and the corresponding delivery ducts <b>11</b> are arranged radially around the dispenser <b>9</b>; however, the plurality of seats <b>5</b> (and corresponding modular batching members <b>7</b> when connected) and the corresponding delivery ducts <b>11</b> can be arranged linearly or in another configuration, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each modular batching member <b>7</b> according to the present invention comprises a container <b>71</b>, and further comprises a batching and delivering device <b>75</b> for batching and delivering the component contained within the container <b>71</b> of the modular batching member <b>7</b>. In one embodiment, as shown in the Figures, the container <b>71</b> is a cylinder; however, the container <b>71</b> can be any suitable shape for the intended purpose, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure. The modular batching member <b>7</b> further comprises one or more than one blade <b>72</b> within and co-axial with each container <b>71</b>. Each modular batching member <b>7</b> further comprises an actuating motor <b>73</b> for rotating the one or more than one blade <b>72</b> within the container <b>71</b>, where rotating the component in the container <b>71</b> keeps the component in suspension. In one embodiment, the actuating motor <b>73</b> is housed in an upper cover <b>74</b> of the container <b>71</b>. As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, additional component can be easily added to the container <b>71</b> by removing the upper cover <b>74</b> thereby accessing the interior of the container <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the plurality of seats <b>5</b> is connected to a modular batching member <b>7</b>. In another embodiment, at least one of the plurality of seats <b>5</b> is not connected to a modular batching member <b>7</b>. In another one embodiment, only one seat <b>5</b> of the plurality of seats <b>5</b> is connected to a modular batching member <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The modular dye meter <b>1</b> further comprises managing means for controlling the batching and delivering device <b>75</b>. In one embodiment, the modular dye meter <b>1</b> further comprises a first electric connection connecting each one of the plurality of seats <b>5</b> to the corresponding modular batching member <b>7</b>. The first electric connections supply current from a current source to a batching and delivering device <b>75</b> of the corresponding modular batching member <b>7</b> according to instructions from the managing means to provide the correct amount of component to the dispenser <b>9</b>. The managing means can be any suitable structure or device, as will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, suitable for managing and driving dye meters, suitably modified to manage the individual modular batching members <b>7</b> to guarantee the correct batching of components to produce the compound. In one embodiment, the managing means is a personal computer. In one embodiment, the managing means controls the modular batching members <b>7</b> through the first electric connections. In another embodiment, the managing means controls the modular batching members <b>7</b> by wireless means.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The batching and delivering device <b>75</b> delivers specific amounts of the component contained in the container <b>71</b> to the dispenser <b>9</b> through the delivery duct <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, the batching and delivering device <b>75</b> comprises a second fluid connector connected to the delivery duct <b>11</b>. The modular dye meter <b>1</b> further comprises a second electric connector <b>77</b> operatively connected to the first electric connector, preferably through a quick-connection electric connector or pin <b>77</b> without using tools, to be electrically supplied and controlled by the managing means for delivering specific amounts of the component contained in the container <b>71</b> to the dispenser <b>9</b> through the delivery duct <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, as shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the batching and delivering device <b>75</b> comprises one or more than one pump <b>75</b> comprising an inlet end connected to the container <b>71</b>, and an outlet end connected to the delivery duct <b>11</b>. The pump <b>75</b> further comprises an external stator housing <b>751</b> and an internal rotor <b>753</b> within the external stator, where the internal rotor <b>753</b> is rotatingly driven by a controlling motor <b>76</b> equipped with the second electric connector <b>77</b>. The pump further comprises progressive recesses in the housing <b>751</b>. The internal rotor <b>753</b> is shaped as a worm screw comprising progressive recesses whose relative rotation with respect to the progressive recesses in the stator housing <b>751</b> moves component inside the pump toward the delivery duct <b>11</b> (and therefore toward the dispenser <b>9</b>) or away from the delivery duct <b>11</b> (and therefore toward the container <b>71</b>) depending on the rotational direction of the internal rotor <b>753</b>. The specific amount of component moved depends on the amount of rotation of the internal rotor <b>753</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the outlet end of the pump <b>75</b> comprises a quick connector <b>78</b> connecting the pump <b>75</b> to the delivery duct <b>11</b>. As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the batching and delivering device <b>75</b> can comprise any other suitable structure including any other combination of traditional pumping means and valves, both for a volumetric batching and for a weight batching.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The advantages of using a pump <b>75</b> with progressive recesses are numerous. First, when the internal rotor <b>753</b> is stopped with respect to the external stator <b>751</b>, the pump <b>75</b> with progressive recesses produces a perfect seal. Second, the pump <b>75</b> is very reliable because the only moving part needed to move component is the internal rotor <b>753</b> and wear from friction due to the relative movement between internal rotor <b>753</b> and external stator <b>751</b> is negligible. Third, contrary to pumps which utilize a piston where the pumping is cyclic due to the piston stroke, the pump <b>75</b> with progressive recesses allows a continuous movement of the component from the container <b>71</b> to the dispenser <b>9</b>. Fourth, the pump <b>75</b> with progressive recesses allows an extremely accurate volumetric delivery of a component that is proportional to the rotation of the internal rotor <b>753</b> because the rotation of the internal rotor is controlled down to the order of fractions of degree by the managing means that control the controlling motor <b>76</b>. Therefore, using the pump <b>75</b> with progressive recesses obviates the need to calibrate the modular dye meter <b>1</b> during installation reducing tooling times and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, a modular batching member <b>7</b> can be installed in the modular dye meter <b>1</b> by inserting the modular batching member <b>7</b> in one of the seats <b>5</b>. In one embodiment, the modular batching member <b>7</b> is fixed in the corresponding seat <b>5</b> with a mechanical connector. Then, the delivery duct <b>11</b> is connected to the modular batching member <b>7</b>, and the first electric connector is connected to the modular batching member <b>7</b>. Each modular batching member <b>7</b> is uninstalled from the modular dye meter <b>1</b> as needed to replace, maintain or refill the modular batching member <b>7</b> by reversing the process.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a dye metering machine comprising a modular dye meter according to the present invention. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there are shown, respectively, a lateral perspective view of a dye metering machine according to the present invention comprising the modular dye meter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); and a lateral perspective cutaway view of the dye metering machine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As can be seen, the dye metering machine <b>21</b> comprises a containing structure <b>12</b> housing a modular dye meter <b>1</b> according to the present invention. The dye metering machine <b>21</b> further comprises a plate <b>13</b> that supports and positions a vessel <b>15</b> for receiving the compound from the dispenser <b>9</b>. In one embodiment, the plate <b>13</b> is adjustable relative to the dispenser <b>9</b>, such as for example through a screw-nut screw system or a by pneumatic piston driven by a pedal <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, to optimally determine the position of the vessel <b>15</b> with respect to the dispenser <b>9</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the containing structure <b>12</b> comprises coating panels <b>19</b> to protect the modular dye meter <b>1</b> from external agents. In a preferred embodiment, at least part of the coating panels <b>19</b> are connected to the remainder of the containing structure <b>12</b> in a manner such that the coating panels <b>19</b> can be easily removed without the use of tools, to facilitate access to the modular dye meter <b>1</b> for maintenance purposes or to remove, recharge, add or replace one or more than one of the modular batching members <b>7</b>. Additionally, the containing structure <b>12</b> comprises means for electrically supplying the modular dye meter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As will be understood by those with skill in the art with reference to this disclosure, the modular dye meter <b>1</b> according to the present invention has a series of advantages with respect to known modular dye meters. These advantages that are related both to practicality of use and to optimization of costs and resources. First, the modular dye meter <b>1</b> of the present invention can be configured for use with only the minimum number of modular batching members <b>7</b> containing the types of components that are necessary for producing the compound. Second, to modify the composition of the compound being produced, the configuration of modular batching members <b>7</b> in the modular dye meter <b>1</b> can be quickly, simply and economically changed by replacing one or more than one of the modular batching members <b>7</b>, or adding additional modular batching members <b>7</b> containing the components for new composition. Third, in case of the malfunction of one or more of the modular batching members <b>7</b>, the malfunctioning modular batching member <b>7</b> can be quickly and simply replaced, even without the use of tools and generally without the need for service from the manufacturer, or if a spare modular batching member <b>7</b> is not readily available, production of compounds that do not require the component contained in the malfunctioning modular batching member <b>7</b> can continue avoiding complete cessation of production.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing compounds comprising a plurality of components. In one embodiment, the method comprises providing a modular dye meter according to the present invention, or providing a dye metering machine comprising a modular dye meter according to the present invention. The method further comprises introducing one component into one or more than one modular batching member of the modular dye meter, where the compound to be prepared comprises the components introduced. Next, the managing means activates the internal rotor of the batching and delivering devices corresponding to each of the one or more than one modular batching member causing the internal rotor to rotate in a first direction, where rotation of the internal rotor in the first direction moves component from the corresponding modular batching member through the progressive recesses of the batching and delivering device through the delivery duct through the dispenser, and thereby into a vessel for containing the compound. In one embodiment, the first direction is clockwise around the axis of the internal rotor. In another embodiment, the first direction is counter-clockwise around the axis of the internal rotor. Then, the managing means causes the rotation of the internal rotor in the first direction to cease and causes the internal rotor to rotate in a second direction, where the second direction is opposite to the first direction, thereby moving component from the dispenser back through the delivery duct preventing drips of component from exiting the dispenser. Next, the managing means causes the rotation of the internal rotor in the second direction to cease. Movement of the internal stator in the second direction advantageously obviates component waste, and prevents solidifying of excess component within the delivery ducts. In one embodiment, the second direction is clockwise around the axis of the internal rotor. In another embodiment, the second direction is counter-clockwise around the axis of the internal rotor.</p>
