No. 61/166,417, filed Apr. 3, 2009, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, including any figures, tables, or drawings.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting comes the availability of bandwidth for new generations of wireless devices. After the transition, many channels become available, especially the upper ranges of the TV bands such as channels 14-83, also known as ultrahigh frequency or UHF. These available channels are vacant frequencies. The FCC is considering freeing up this so-called &#x201c;white space&#x201d; spectrum to unlicensed devices (a.k.a. white space devices or WSD) in order to promote a more effective use of the public airwaves. The envisioned WSDs include but are not limited to high-speed wireless network connections and cable-less home entertainment systems. These WSDs present new opportunities for consumers to efficiently use currently unused spectrum. With the growing use of Wi-Fi and other unlicensed devices in everything from laptops to next-generation PDAs and cell phones, WSDs provide much-needed additional capacity for broadband connectivity and home and community networking.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">WSDs are expected to operate in a cognitive manner by sensing and detecting over-the-air digital TV (DTV) signals and avoiding these occupied frequency bands. However, cable TV (CATV) also shares part of this &#x201c;white space&#x201d; spectrum. Hence WSDs avoiding over-the-air DTV band may still cause interference to television receivers connected to CATV service. Such interference was confirmed in tests and reported by the FCC in &#x201c;Direct-pickup interference tests of three consumer digital cable television receivers available in 2005,&#x201d; by S. R. Martin (OET Report FCC/OET 07-TR-1005, Jul. 31, 2007) and &#x201c;Evaluation of the performance of prototype TV-band white space devices phase II,&#x201d; by S. K. Jones et al. (OET Report FCC/OET 08-TR-1005, Oct. 15, 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Oct. 15, 2008 report discussed the capability of prototype TV-band WSDs to detect over-the-air DTV signals. The tested prototype devices described in this report were provided by Adaptrum, the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Motorola Inc., and Philips Electronics North America Corp (Philips). According to this report, the detection threshold sensitivity of the devices varied from &#x2212;106 dBm to &#x2212;128 dBm for the over-the-air DTV signals. The sensing times are 0.1 second/channel for the Motorola device, 37-185 seconds/channel for the Adaptrum device, and 8-50 seconds/channel for the Philips device. The other device sensing times are not specified in the FCC report.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among these tested prototype devices, none has reported the ability to identify CATV usage information. The current white space identification is performed based on spectrum sensing, which is not effective for CATV.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the interference from these devices to CATV have been tested and proved to be non-negligible. In addition, both reports indicate that the interference effect is significant even for low power devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">From the reported signal detection performance for over-the-air DTV signals, it can be inferred that it is essentially impossible for the prototype devices to sense and avoid CATV active channel since the signal leakage from the CATV (if any) is significantly weaker than over-the-air DTV signals, while the number of CATV channels is large.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result, obtaining knowledge on the active channel usage of CATV is critical for the identification of usable TV-band white space which complies with the FCC's regulation of &#x201c;zero interference tolerance.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a white space identifier directed for use with active cable TV channels.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention relate to identification of usable TV-band white space spectrum for white space device applications.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a white space identifier is provided that can decode a received channel-changing-command of an infrared-emitting remote control of a TV set to determine the active channel number of a user's cable TV. The decoded active channel number can then be broadcast via a wireless transmitter to all white space devices (WSDs) in the interference range. The infrared receiver parameters of the subject identifier can be set according to the model and make of the TV set at an initialization step.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the wireless transmitter of implementations of the subject identifier only needs to send the number of the active cable TV channel. In total, there are 166 channels for the CATV broadcasting in North America, each having a specific and unique channel number and specific and unique frequency band. In such embodiments, the WSDs can then determine the frequency band of the active channel using a look-up table. Since the wireless transmitter only requires very low data rate when transmitting information regarding the number of the active cable TV channel, a very narrow fixed bandwidth can be assigned via the controller for the wireless transmitter for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The subject identifier can be implemented using a stand-alone device having an infrared sensor and wireless controller. In another embodiment, the subject identifier can be incorporated as a component of a TV set, or a smaller stand-alone device (such as a set-top box, VCR/DVR, etc.) connected to the TV set via wired or wireless means. In yet another embodiment, the wireless transmitter can be integrated in the TV remote control or a global remote control. In such an embodiment, the channel changing operation of the remote control can directly trigger the wireless transmitter. In a further embodiment, multiple TV sets can be accommodated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention provide white space identification for white space device applications. A smart white space identifier is provided that can locally address cable TV (CATV) usage information.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unlike over-the-air DTV broadcast signals, the active CATV channel is a user-specified parameter that is readily available on a local basis. Presently, the active channel of a TV set is almost exclusively set via a remote control which emits infrared signals. To ensure convenient remote controlling operation, the infrared beam usually has a broad beamwidth. Because a relatively broad beamwidth is emitted from a remote control, devices within the vicinity of the TV can also sense the infrared beam. Therefore, in an application of the present invention, the subject white space identifier can be located near enough to the TV set to receive the infrared beam. The information in the infrared beam containing the channel changing command can be decoded by the subject white space identifier. The decoded signal can provide the active channel number of the TV. This can be accomplished, in part, because the center frequency and bandwidth of the active CATV are well defined. For example, in total, there are 166 channels for the CATV broadcasting in North America, each having a specific and unique channel number and specific and unique frequency band. Once obtained, the active channel number can then be broadcast via a wireless transmitter to all WSDs in the interference range. In such embodiments, the WSDs can then determine the frequency band of the active channel using a look-up table.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, a stand-alone white space identifier <b>10</b> can include an infrared controller <b>11</b>, an infrared sensor <b>15</b>, a wireless transmitter controller <b>21</b>, and a wireless transmitter <b>25</b>. The infrared controller <b>11</b> and the wireless transmitter controller <b>21</b> can be separate components, integrated with their respective devices, or integrated in a single processor connected to the infrared sensor <b>15</b> and the wireless transmitter <b>25</b>. By being located within the range of an infrared signal from a remote control <b>30</b> for the TV (or related TV equipment), the infrared sensor <b>15</b> can sense the infrared signal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The white space identifier <b>10</b> can be initialized by setting the infrared sensor/receiver parameters according to the model and make of the TV. In an embodiment, the infrared sensor controller <b>11</b> can be used to adapt and/or configure the white space identifier to a particular model and make of the TV. A processor (not shown) and memory components (not shown) can be used to perform the decoding of the signal received by the infrared sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment, when the channel changing signal is transmitted from the remote control <b>30</b> of the TV (or related TV equipment), the infrared sensor <b>15</b> will sense the infrared signal. By pre-setting with the information of TV model and maker in the infrared sensor controller <b>11</b>, the infrared sensor can decode the received infrared signal and determine the active CATV channel in use.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After determining the active CATV channel, the processor can send the number of the active CATV channel to wireless transmitter <b>25</b> that is controlled by the wireless controller <b>21</b>. The wireless transmitter can be used to transmit the number of the active CATV channel. Any kind of modulation schemes can be adopted, for example, BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When transmitting only the number of the active CATV channel, a very low data rate can be used. For example, the channel number can be sufficiently encoded by 8 bits (2<sup>8</sup>=256&#x3e;166). In addition, the active channel information does not change very often, so one does not need to continuously transmit the number of the active CATV channel. Suppose the total time for transmitting is 1 second, then the required data rate (i.e. bandwidth) will be only 8 bit per second. Even taking into account of some extra overhead bits (such as error control coding etc.), the data rate will be within tens of bits per second. This low data rate transmission only requires tens of Hertz bandwidth even with low bandwidth efficiency modulation schemes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, a very narrow fixed bandwidth can be assigned via the wireless transmitter controller <b>21</b>. The WSDs <b>40</b> can easily determine the bandwidth of the active channel using a look-up table.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an alternative embodiment, the white space identifier can include look-up tables and determine the corresponding bandwidth of the active channel. Then this information can be transmitted wirelessly to the WSDs <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a white space identifier <b>50</b> according to another implementation can be integrated with the TV set, TV equipment, or TV accessories, which include, but are not limited to, a set top box, VCR, DVD player, and digital video recorder. In such an embodiment, the infrared sensor <b>15</b> and controller <b>11</b> of the embodiments described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be replaced by the TV set (equipment or accessories). Thus, the wireless controller and transmitter (<b>21</b>,<b>25</b>) can either be an integrated component of the TV set or a smaller standalone device connected to the TV set via wired or wireless means. That is, the active channel information can be received directly from the TV (or indirectly if received through a set top box or recorder) and then transmitted to WSDs <b>40</b> through a wireless transmitter <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In yet another implementation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the white space identifier <b>60</b> can be integrated with the TV remote control or a global remote control. That is, a wireless transmitter (<b>21</b>,<b>25</b>) can be integrated into a remote control such that the channel changing operation of the remote directly triggers the wireless transmitter <b>25</b> to send the channel changing information to the WSDs <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, the electronic circuit in the remote control that detects a channel changing operation by a user and controls an infrared light emitting device based the user input can also provide a channel identifier signal to the wireless transmitter. The channel identification can be accomplished as part of the operations of the electronic circuit or by a separate processing module connected to the electronic circuit that receives the signal sent to the infrared light emitting device and determines the active channel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a further embodiment, multiple TV sets can be accommodated. To accommodate multiple TV sets, for the stand-alone option as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each TV set has a white space identifier. By accommodating each TV set with a white space identifier, interference from a neighboring television (such as located in another room of a dwelling or in a neighbor's condo or apartment) that is within the range of a WSD can be avoided. The active channel information of the multiple TV sets can be transmitted separately for each TV set. Where multiple TV sets are positioned closely together, such that a signal from a remote control directed to one TV set can also be read by another of the TV sets, the infrared sensor <b>15</b> of a white space identifier is made to accommodate all kinds of infrared signals by multiple TV models and makers. The active channel information of multiple TV sets can be transmitted together whenever one of them changes. According to certain embodiments, a memory storing the information of active channels can be included for the white space identifier <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment using a white space identifier for each TV, whenever transmitting the active channel information, the white space identifier <b>10</b> can further include an identifier for the TV using the channel. The WSDs <b>40</b> can take care of the multiple active channel information transmitted by the white space identifier <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the wireless transmission coverage for each identifier can be set according to the interference range of the WSDs. For example, if a WSD is out of the range of an identifier, then it will not interfere into the TV associated with this identifier. In such embodiments, the WSDs can avoid a need for noting the TV locations because no TV ID information is utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the TV-integrated option shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when transmitting the active channel information, the white space identifier <b>50</b> integrated in each TV can include a unique identifier for its own TV set. In other embodiments, the unique identifier can be omitted. The WSDs <b>40</b> can simply remove the multiple active channel frequency bands from the usable list. A similar procedure can be adopted for the implementation of remote controller-integrated white space identifier <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to certain embodiments, when implemented as a stand-alone device, the subject white space identifier can be powered by plugging into a power outlet. In addition, when integrated with a TV or remote control, the subject white space identifier can be implemented to draw very little power from the TV or remote control by being configured to require infrequent wireless transmission at extremely low data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a further embodiment, a database of cable channels available in a geographic region and/or regional cable television packages can be included in the white space identifier. In certain embodiments, initialization of the white space identifier can include programming the white space identifier to acknowledge the particular cable package purchased by a user and provide information regarding always-available channels based on known available channels not purchased by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A purpose of TV-band white space identification is to avoid WSD interference to designated, licensed channels. In this case, a purpose is to avoid both over-the-air DTV and active CATV channels. Existing white space identifiers are currently based on spectrum sensing. Their capability of detecting DTV signals have been confirmed in recent FCC tests and reports. However, existing technology in WSDs cannot determine the active CATV channel and thus cannot avoid interference to the active CATV channel. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention can be utilized in applications where WSDs may interfere with CATV.</p>
