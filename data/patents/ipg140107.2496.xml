<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase, a peptide thereof, a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding the same, an enzyme agent for the synthesis of a glycosaminoglycan, which comprises the above-described enzyme or polypeptide, and a process for producing a glycosaminoglycan, which uses the enzyme agent.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unless otherwise indicated, all of the saccharides and saccharide residues in this description are the D-form optical isomer, excluding iduronic acid. Also, D-glucosamine (which sometimes includes an N-substituted compound) is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;GlcN&#x201d;, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;GlcNAc&#x201d;, D-glucuronic acid is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;GlcA&#x201d;, L-iduronic acid is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;IdoA&#x201d;, and hexuronic acid representing a uronic acid having 6 carbon atoms, including GlcA and IdoA, is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;HexA&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heparin and heparan sulfate are kinds of glycosaminoglycan having a repeating structure of a disaccharide (4GlcA&#x3b2;1/IdoA&#x3b1;1&#x2192;4GlcNAc&#x3b1;1) of HexA residue (GlcA residue or IdoA residue) and GlcNAc residue as the basal skeleton (this basal skeleton may be also referred to as &#x201c;heparin skeleton&#x201d; hereinafter), wherein one or more of the 2-position hydroxyl group of its HexA residue and the 2-position amino group, the 3-position hydroxyl group and the 6-position hydroxyl group of its GlcN residue are sulfated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been known so far that the sulfated group of &#x201c;heparin&#x201d; or &#x201c;heparan sulfate&#x201d; is bound to one or more of the positions shown by R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>in the following formula (2). However, it has not been known about a glycosaminoglycan in which all of the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are the sulfate group (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and a production method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="26.08mm" wi="63.58mm" file="US08623625-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand it is generally known that a glycosaminoglycan having the heparin skeleton has various physiological activities. For example, it is known for a long time that heparin shows anticoagulation activity upon blood (<i>Thronb. Res., </i>75, 1-32 (1994)), and it is known also that it has affinity for various growth factors and carries out a role in stabilizing or activating these growth factors (<i>Glycobiology, </i>4, 451 (1994)). It is known that heparan sulfate also has affinity for various growth factors and accelerates wound healing by stabilizing or activating these growth factors (<i>J. Phthol, </i>183, 251-252 (1997)). In addition, it is known that a 6-O-desulfated heparin which can be obtained by specifically desulfating only the sulfate group bound to the 6-position of GlcN as a constituting saccharide of heparin is deprived of the anticoagulation activity upon blood but has an action to accelerate wound healing (International Publication WO00/06608), and it is known that a periodic acid oxidation-reduction 2-O-desulfated heparin (mainly keeps the heparin skeleton) which can be obtained by a combination of a periodic acid oxidation-reduction treatment and specific desulfation of the 2-position HexA takes a role in stabilizing various growth factors and accelerating nerve growth (JP-A-11-310602).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Based on these facts, it is considered that the glycosaminoglycan having a heparin skeleton has various physiological activities, and it is considered that derivatives of heparin have markedly large possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, since the gene encoding a glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase has been cloned, it is considered that information on the substrate specificity of the enzyme for glycosaminoglycan as the sulfate group acceptor can be obtained by preparing the enzyme in a large amount, which will provide a useful approach in studying relationship between the structure and the function of glycosaminoglycan. It is known that there are many sulfation processes in the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan, particularly in the synthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate (<i>Glycotechnology</i>, (5), 57 (1994), published by Kodansha Scientific), and it is considered that various types of glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases are concerned in this sulfation. Regarding the glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase which transfers a sulfate group to heparin/heparan sulfate, heparan sulfate N-deacetyl/N-sulfotransferase (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;NDST&#x201d;), heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;HS2ST&#x201d;), heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;HS3OST&#x201d;), heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;HS6ST&#x201d;) and the like have been isolated from various organisms, particularly from human, and their cDNA molecules have been cloned.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A cDNA of human HS3OST has been disclosed in <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>272, 28008-28019 (1997), and the cDNA described in the reference has been registered at GenBank as accession number AF019386.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Although an enzyme which can transfer a sulfate group to a glycosaminoglycan having a heparin skeleton is markedly useful because of its high possibility to be used in the enzymatic synthesis of heparin and heparan sulfate, such an enzyme has high substrate specificity so that it is necessary to carry out the synthesis efficiently by using various types of the enzyme for the purpose of industrially synthesizing various types of heparin and heparan sulfate. However, it cannot be said yet that there are sufficient variations of the enzyme capable of transferring a sulfate group to the heparin skeleton.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, in the case where production of a glycosaminoglycan having a new structure becomes possible by using an enzyme, it becomes possible to search for a physiological activity possessed by such a glycosaminoglycan.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the invention is to provide a novel sulfotransferase and also provide a means for obtaining the enzyme in a large amount by a convenient method through cloning of a cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide to thereby increase variations of glycosaminoglycan which can be synthesized by enzyme chemistry and also contribute to the elucidation of structure-function relationship of glycosaminoglycan having heparin skeleton.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0040">The present inventors have conducted intensive search on a DNA comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase capable of sulfating heparan sulfate and found a novel DNA having a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the enzyme, and have confirmed that the glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase can be obtained by expressing the DNA and that glycosaminoglycan having a new structure can be produced by using the glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase. Thus, the invention has been accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0041">The embodiments of the invention are described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">(1) Enzyme of the Invention/Polypeptide of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0042">The enzyme of the invention is a glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase (SFT-1) which comprises a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence consisting of at least amino acid numbers 37 to 346 in the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 and also has activity of transferring a sulfate group from a sulfate group donor to a glycosaminoglycan which is a sulfate group acceptor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0043">Examples of the polypeptide according to the enzyme of the invention (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;polypeptide of the invention&#x201d;) include a polypeptide consisting of amino acid numbers 1 to 346 represented by SEQ ID NO:2 and a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence consisting of amino acid numbers 37 to 346 in the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2. It is preferred that the polypeptides are derived from a mammal, particularly desirably from human. Among the polypeptides, a polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence consisting of amino acid numbers 37 to 346 which excludes the presumed transmembrane region from the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 (a region consisting of amino acid numbers 1 to 36 in SEQ ID NO:2) is particularly preferred since it becomes a so-called solubilized form which facilitates its preparation and application.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0044">In general, it is known that the enzyme activity is maintained when one or plural (generally from 2 to 34) constituting amino acids in an amino acid sequence of an enzyme protein are substituted, deleted, inserted, added and/or transpositioned, so that it can regarded as a variant of the same enzyme, and in the case where partial mutations such as substitution, deletion, insertion, addition and/or transposition of one or plural (generally from 2 to 34) constituting amino acids are also generated in the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 of the polypeptide of the invention, this can be regarded as a substance which is substantially identical to the polypeptide of the invention, so long as it keeps the sulfate group transferring activity which is described later (such a polypeptide having partial mutations in the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 is described as &#x201c;a modified polypeptide&#x201d; for the sake of convenience). It is preferred that the amino acid sequence of the modified polypeptide has a homology of 90% or more, preferably 95% or more, more preferably 97% or more, with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2. The homology of the amino acid sequence can be easily calculated by using conventionally known computer software such as FASTA, and the software can also be provided by internet.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0045">Also, in the above-described polypeptide of the invention, a saccharide chain can be linked to a constituting amino acid of the polypeptide, so long as its amino acid sequence is the same as described above and it has the above-described enzyme activity. That is, an embodiment of glycoprotein is included in the polypeptide of the invention as a matter of course.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0046">The sulfate group donor used in the reaction of the enzyme of the invention is not particularly limited, so long as it is a substance capable of transferring the sulfate group to a glycosaminoglycan which is a sulfate group acceptor, but 3&#x2032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x2032;-phosphosulfate (active sulfate: hereinafter referred also to as &#x201c;PAPS&#x201d;) which is generally known to function as a sulfate group donor in the living body is preferred due to a high possibility that it is a sulfate group donor for the enzyme of the invention in the living body.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0047">Examples of the glycosaminoglycan as the sulfate group acceptor for the enzyme of the invention include hyaluronic acid, chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and the like, glycosaminoglycan having the so-called heparin skeleton such as heparan sulfate or heparin is particularly preferred, and heparan sulfate is most particularly preferred. Also, as is also apparent from the following Examples, the enzyme of the invention does not substantially have activity of transferring a sulfate group to shark cartilage-derived chondroitin sulfate, chondroitin obtained by desulfating bovine bronchus-derived chondroitin sulfate, swine skin derived dermatan sulfate and desulfated dermatan sulfate prepared by removing sulfate group from cockscomb-derived dermatan sulfate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0048">It is possible to easily confirm the sulfate group transferring activity of the enzyme of the invention, for example, by carrying out the enzyme reaction in a buffer at a temperature of 20 to 40&#xb0; C. by using PAPS labeled with a label such as a radioisotope (<sup>35</sup>S, <sup>3</sup>H (tritium) or the like) or a fluorescent material (a radioisotope is preferred since it does not generate steric hindrance in the substrate) and also by using a glycosaminoglycan which is a sulfate group acceptor, and then examining whether or not the acceptor is labeled with the label, for example, by checking the reaction solution after the reaction through the combination of a separation means such as gel filtration or high performance liquid chromatography (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;HPLC&#x201d;) with a label-detecting means (radioactivity detecting means such as a scintillation counter or autoradiography when a radioisotope is used as the label, or detection by a fluorescence detector when a fluorescent material is used as the label).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0049">Since the enzyme of the invention obtained in this manner has activity of specifically transferring the sulfate group to a glycosaminoglycan, particularly to heparin and heparan sulfate, it is possible to use this as the enzyme agent of the invention which is described later.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">(2) Nucleic Acid of the Invention, Expression Vector of the Invention and Recombinant of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0050">The nucleic acid of the invention is a nucleic acid which encodes the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0051">The nucleic acid of the invention is not limited to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), so long as it encodes the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention, and it may be either single-stranded or double-stranded. However, since the above-described enzyme of the invention and polypeptide of the invention are human-derived amino acid sequences, it is preferable that it is a DNA capable of encoding a polypeptide in many organisms including human.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0052">The term &#x201c;nucleic acid encoding&#x201d; as used herein means both of a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to the nucleotide sequence of a template chain to be used as the template for mRNA synthesis and a nucleic acid consisting of a nucleotide sequence of the template chain, generally in the transcription in protein (polypeptide) synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0053">Examples of the nucleotide sequence of such a nucleic acid include the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1, a nucleotide sequence consisting of nucleotide numbers 109 to 1041 (a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the coding region of the amino acid numbers 37 to 346) in the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1, and nucleotide sequences complementary to these nucleotide sequences, and nucleic acids consisting of such nucleotide sequences are included in the nucleic acid of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0054">In addition, it is known that a single-stranded nucleic acid hybridizes with a nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence complementary thereto under certain conditions, and the nucleic acid of the invention includes nucleotide chains consisting of the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1, a nucleotide sequence consisting of nucleotide numbers 109 to 1041 in the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1, and nucleotide sequences complementary to these nucleotide sequences under stringent conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0055">Examples of the stringent conditions include conditions of 42&#xb0; C. in the presence of 50% formamide, 5&#xd7;SSPE (sodium chloride/sodium phosphate/EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) buffer), 5&#xd7;Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and 100 &#x3bc;g/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA, and under conditions substantially identical thereto. That is, the stringent conditions are conditions employed in the general hybridization of genes and included in the term &#x201c;under stringent conditions&#x201d; as used herein, so long as they are conditions used in the screening and the like which use Northern blotting, Southern blotting or hybridization.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0056">The DNA which consists of the nucleotide sequence consisting of nucleotide numbers 109 to 1041 in the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1, which is one of the preferred illustrative embodiments of the nucleic acid of the invention, can be prepared by the method described in the following Examples, or since the complete nucleotide sequence thereof has been found by the invention, it can also be prepared by carrying out a polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;PCR&#x201d;) in the usual way, for example, by using a human-derived CDNA library as the template and using a 5&#x2032; primer (SEQ ID NO:3) and 3&#x2032; primer (SEQ ID NO:4). In the same manner, a DNA consisting of the nucleotide sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1 can also be prepared by carrying out PCR using a primer represented by SEQ ID NO:5 as the 5&#x2032; primer and a primer represented by SEQ ID NO:4 as the 3&#x2032; primer.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0057">The expression vector of the invention contains the above-described nucleic acid of the invention, which is generally constituted by the nucleic acid of the invention as a DNA and a conventionally known basal vector (a plasmid, phage, virus or the like) into which the enzyme of the invention is introduced, and is constructed in such a manner that the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention can be expressed in a host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0058">The basal vector to be used as the above-described expression vector of the invention can be optionally selected by those skilled in the art according to the host cell used, and the expression vector of the invention can be constructed by ligating the above-described nucleic acid of the invention to the thus selected basal vector in the usual way.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0059">In addition, in order to facilitate its secretion, isolation, purification and analysis in preparing the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention by expressing the expression vector of the invention, the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention may be constructed in such a manner that it can be expressed as a fusion protein with a marker peptide. In the arrangement of the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention and the marker peptide in this case, the marker peptide may be bound to the C-terminal side of the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention or to the N-terminal side thereof. In addition, such a binding when made via a spacer consisting of an amino acid sequence having no physiological activity (a peptide consisting of about 2 to 10 amino acids) is not limited, so long as the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention has activity of transferring a sulfate group from a sulfate group donor to a glycosaminoglycan which is the sulfate group acceptor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0060">The marker peptide means any peptide, for example, selected from the group consisting of a signal peptide (a peptide consisting of 15 to 30 amino acid residues, which is present in the N-terminus of many proteins and functioning intracellularly for the selection of a protein: e.g., OmpA, OmpT, Dsb or the like), protein kinase A, protein A (a protein of about 42,000 in molecular weight, which is a constituting component of <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>cell wall), glutathione S transferase, His tag (a sequence of 6 to 10 histidine residues), myc tag (a sequence of 13 amino acid residues, derived from cMyc protein), FLAG peptide (a marker for analysis consisting of a sequence of 8 amino acid residues), T7 tag (a sequence of the first 11 amino acid residues of gene 10 protein), S tag (a sequence of 15 amino acid residues, derived from pancreatic RNase A), HSV tag, pel B (a sequence of 22 amino acid residues of <i>Escherichia coli </i>outer membrane protein pel B), HA tag (a sequence of 10 amino acid residues, derived from hemagglutinin), Trx tag (thioredoxin sequence), CBP tag (a calmodulin binding peptide), CBD tag (a cellulose binding domain), CBR tag (a collagen binding domain), &#x3b2;-lac/blu (&#x3b2;-lactamase), &#x3b2;-gal (&#x3b2;-galactosidase), luc (luciferase), HP-Thio (His-patch thioredoxin), HSP (heat shock protein), Ln&#x3b3; (laminin &#x3b3; peptide), Fn (fibronectin partial peptide), GFP (green fluorescent peptide), YFP (yellow fluorescent peptide), CFP (cyan fluorescent peptide), BFP (blue fluorescent peptide), DsRed, DsRed2 (red fluorescent peptide), MBP (maltose binding peptide), LacZ (lactose operator), IgG (immunoglobulin G), avidin and protein G, and any one of these marker peptides can be used. Among these, signal peptide, protein kinase A, protein A, glutathione S transferase, His tag, myc tag, FLAG tag, T7 tag, S tag, HSV tag, pelB and HA tag are particularly preferred since expression of the enzyme of the invention and polypeptide of the invention by genetic engineering techniques and their secretion, isolation, purification and analysis become more easy.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0061">As the host cell into which the expression vector of the invention is to be introduced, it is possible to use either a procaryotic cell (e.g., <i>Escherichia coli </i>or the like) or a eucaryotic cell (e.g., yeast, insect cell, mammalian cell or the like). Particularly, in the case where a procaryotic cell is used as the host cell, saccharide chain addition and the like do not occur when the nucleic acid of the invention is expressed, so that the peptide of the invention to which saccharide chains are not added can be obtained. However, since the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention is an enzyme or polypeptide generally expressed in eucaryote, a eucaryotic cell is preferred as the host cell, and its preferred examples include insect cells (they are superior in terms of the large scale synthesis of the enzyme of the invention or polypeptide of the invention) or mammalian cells (they are superior in terms that they are cells in which the enzyme of the invention is originally expressed).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0062">The recombinant of the invention is a cell in which the vector of the invention constructed using a suitable basal vector into such a host cell in the usual way.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">(3) Enzyme Production Method of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0063">The enzyme production method of the invention is a method for producing the polypeptide of the invention or enzyme of the invention, wherein the recombinant of the invention is allowed to grow, and the polypeptide of the invention or enzyme of the invention is recovered from the thus obtained grown material.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0064">The method for growing the recombinant of the invention can be carried out by those skilled in the art by optionally selecting a method suitable for the host cell used in the recombinant. Also, the term &#x201c;grow&#x201d; is a general idea of not only culturing the recombinant in outside of a living body, for example, by using a culturing apparatus or a culturing tool, but also propagating it in the living body by administering the host cell to the living body.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0065">The grown material in the production method of the invention includes a medium obtained by culturing the cell in the outside of the living body and the cultured recombinant itself, as well as excrements, secretions, body fluids, tissues and the like of the living body obtained when the recombinant is grown in the living body.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0066">As the recovery of the polypeptide of the invention from a grown material, it is possible to separate the polypeptide of the invention, for example, by a separation means such as gel filtration or HPLC which is based on the difference in molecular weight and a separation means such as an affinity column in which a sulfate group donor (PAPS or the like) in the enzyme reaction of the polypeptide of the invention is made into a solid phase, or in the case where the polypeptide of the invention is expressed as a fusion protein with a marker peptide, by a means for specifically adsorbing the marker peptide. For example, in the case where FLAG peptide is used as the marker peptide, it is possible to obtain the polypeptide of the invention easily as its fusion protein with the FLAG peptide by using an affinity column in which an anti-FLAG antibody is made into a solid phase.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Search of Gene Data Base and Determination of Nucleotide Sequence of the Nucleic Acid of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0081">Using a conventionally known human-derived heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase (HS3OST) gene, analogous genes from a gene data base were searched. The sequence used was SEQ ID NO:AFO19836 of the HS3OST gene. In this case, Blast [Altschul et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>215, 402-410 (1990)] was used in the search.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0082">As a result, an analogous sequence was found in a genomic sequence GeneBank Accession No. AL 355498, and a novel gene having homology with the HS3OST gene was identified. It was estimated by a gene analyzing program (GENSCAN: manufactured by Stanford University) that this novel gene is encoded by two exons.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">(1) Confirmation of Coding Region of the Polypeptide of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0083">Using Human Kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA (manufactured by CLONTECH), PCR (35 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 5 seconds and 68&#xb0; C. for 4 minutes) was carried out with the attached AP1 primer (AP1 and AP2 adapters are attached to both ends of a cDNA fragment) and a primer set up to a sequence moiety around the 5&#x2032;-terminus of the second exon (GP-226: SEQ ID NO:6). Subsequently, nested PCR (40 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 5 seconds and 68&#xb0; C. for 4 minutes) was carried out with the AP2 primer attached to the Marathon cDNA and a primer set up to the sequence moiety (GP-224: SEQ ID NO:7). The PCR product obtained as the result was subjected to an agarose gel electrophoresis, and a band of about 450 b was recovered by using Gel Extraction Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN). As a result of the analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the thus obtained DNA fragment by a conventional method, a sequence of the second exon was confirmed in succession to a sequence of the first exon (N-terminal 36 amino acids were encoded). The sequence was the same as that predicted by the gene analysis program. Accordingly, it was confirmed that the coding region for the polypeptide of the invention is the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1 in which the first exon and the second exon are bound to each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">(2) Cloning of Second Exon</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0084">Based on the above results, those which are encoded by the first exon are only the N-terminal 36 amino acids. Since the second exon encodes the majority of the polypeptide of the invention, it was considered that the principal part of the enzyme including the active region is contained in the second exon (the polypeptide of the invention encoded by the second exon is called SFT-1 for the sake of convenience). Accordingly, cloning of the second exon moiety was carried out by using a genomic DNA as the template.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0085">Using Human Genomic DNA (manufactured by CLONTECH) as the template, PCR (35 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 15 seconds, 50&#xb0; C. for 30 seconds and 68&#xb0; C. for 1 minute) of a region containing the second exon was carried out. The primers used were set to the genomic sequences of an upstream moiety of the second exon (SFTex2F: SEQ ID NO:8) and a downstream moiety of the termination codon (SFTex2R: SEQ ID NO:9). The thus obtained fragment of about 1 kb was purified in the usual way, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed to confirm that the sequence of the second exon was obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Introduction of SFT-1 Gene into Expression Vector</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0086">In order to prepare a gene expression system, the second exon DNA obtained above was firstly introduced into an expression vector pDONR201 of the Gateway system manufactured by Invitrogen, and Bacmid was further prepared by the Bac-to-Bac system manufactured by Invitrogen. The details are explained below.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">(1) Preparation of Entry Clone for the Novel Sulfotransferase</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0087">Using the PCR product obtained above by amplifying the second exon as the template, PCT (30 cycles of 94&#xb0; C. for 15 seconds and 68&#xb0; C. for 3 minutes) was again carried out to obtain a DNA fragment for used in the Gateway system. The primers used were a 5&#x2032; primer (SFTgateF2: SEQ ID NO:10) and a 3&#x2032; primer (SFTgateRstop: SEQ ID NO:11), prepared by adding a sequence for Gateway system to a sequence close to the 5&#x2032;-terminus of the second exon and a sequence close to the termination codon. The DNA fragment was purified in the usual way and introduced into pDONR201 by a BP clonase reaction to prepare an entry clone. The reaction was carried out by incubating 1 &#x3bc;l of the DNA fragment of interest, 1 &#x3bc;l (150 ng) of pDONR201, 2 &#x3bc;l of a reaction buffer, 4 &#x3bc;l of Tris-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer (hereinafter sometimes referred to as &#x201c;TE&#x201d;) and 2 &#x3bc;l of BP clonase mix, at 25&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 &#x3bc;l of proteinase K and keeping at 37&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0088">Thereafter, 5 &#x3bc;l of the above-described reaction solution was mixed with 100 &#x3bc;l of competent cells (<i>Escherichia coli </i>DH5&#x3b1;) to carry out transformation by a heat shock method, and then the cells were spread on the LB medium containing kanamycin. A colony was picked up on the next day and cultured in 3 ml of LB medium containing kanamycin, and then plasmid was extracted and purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN). Using a part of the thus obtained plasmid, its nucleotide sequence was analyzed by a conventional method to confirm that the DNA of interest has been introduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">(2) Preparation of Expressing Clone</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0089">The above-described entry clone has attL which is a recombination region when &#x3bb; phage is cut out from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, on both sides of its insertion site, and the insertion site is transferred to a destination vector by mixing LR clonase (a mixture of recombinases Int, IHF and Xis) with the destination vector so that a expressing clone is prepared. The specific steps are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0090">Firstly, 1 &#x3bc;l of the entry clone, 0.5 &#x3bc;l (75 ng) of pFBIF, 2 &#x3bc;l of LR reaction buffer, 4.5 &#x3bc;l of TE and 2 &#x3bc;l of LR clonase mix were allowed to react at 25&#xb0; C. for 1 hour, and the reaction was terminated by adding 1 &#x3bc;l of proteinase K and incubating at 37&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes (pFBIF-SFT-1 is purified by this recombination reaction). The pFBIF is prepared by inserting Ig&#x3ba; signal sequence (SEQ ID NO:12) and FLAG peptide (SEQ ID NO:13) into pFastBac1, and in order to insert Gateway sequence by inserting a DNA fragment obtained by primers OT20 (SEQ ID NO:15) and OT21 (SEQ ID NO:16) using OT3 (SEQ ID NO:14) as the primer into the BamHI and EcoRI sites in the same manner as described above, a conversion cassette was inserted using Gateway Vector Conversion System (manufactured by Invitrogen). The Ig&#x3ba; signal sequence was inserted to convert the expressed protein into secretion type, and the FLAG tag to facilitate its formation.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0091">Thereafter, 5 &#x3bc;l of the above-described reaction solution was mixed with 50 &#x3bc;l of competent cells (<i>Escherichia coli </i>DH5&#x3b1;), followed by transformation by a heat shock method, and then the cells were spread on the LB medium containing ampicillin. A colony was picked up on the next day and cultured in 5 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin, and then the plasmid (pFBIF-SFT-1) was extracted and purified using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (manufactured by QIAGEN). Using a part of the thus obtained plasmid, its nucleotide sequence was analyzed by a conventional method to confirm that the DNA of interest has been introduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">(3) Preparation of Bacmid by Bac-to-Bac System</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0092">Next, the sequence of SFT-1 was inserted into Bacmid capable of multiplying in insect cells, by carrying out recombination between the above-described pFBIF-SFT-1 and pFastBac using the Bac-to-Bac system (manufactured by Invitrogen). This system is a system in which a gene of interest is incorporated into Bacmid by a recombinant protein produced from a helper plasmid, by simply introducing the gene of interest-inserted pFastBac into a Bacmid-containing <i>Escherichia coli </i>strain (<i>E. coli </i>DH10BAC) by using the recombination region of Tn7. In addition, since the lacZ gene is contained in Bacmid, it is possible to carry out the classical selection based on the color of colonies (blue (no insertion)-white (insertion)).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0093">That is, the above-described purified vector (pFBIF-SFT-1) was mixed with 50 &#x3bc;l of competent cells (<i>Escherichia coli </i>DH10BAC), followed by transformation by a heat shock method, the resulting cells were spread on the LB medium containing kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, 5-bromoindolyl &#x3b2;-D-galactopyranoside (Bluo-gal) and isopropyl &#x3b2;-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and then a white single colony isolated on the next day was further cultured to recover Bacmid.</p>

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Introduction of Bacmid into Insect Cell and Recovery of SFT-1</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0094">The above-described Bacmid obtained from a white colony was introduced into an insect cell Sf21 (manufactured by Invitrogen). That is, 9&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/2 ml of the Sf21 cells were added to Sf-900IISFM (manufactured by Invitrogen) containing antibiotics in a 35 mm dish and cultured at 27&#xb0; C. for 1 hour to adhere the cells. As a solution A, 100 &#x3bc;l of Sf-900IISFM containing no antibiotics was added to 5 &#x3bc;l of Bacmid DNA. As a solution B, 100 &#x3bc;l of Sf-900IISFM containing no antibiotics was added to 6 &#x3bc;l of Cell FECTIN solution (manufactured by Invitrogen). Thereafter, the solution A and solution B were thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 to 45 minutes. After confirming that the cells were adhered, the culture medium was sucked and 2 ml of Sf-900IISFM containing no antibiotics was added. To a solution prepared by mixing the solution A and solution B (lipid-DNA complexes), 800 &#x3bc;l of Sf-900IISFM containing no antibiotics was added and thoroughly mixed.

Thereafter, the transfection mixture was removed, 2 ml of Sf-900IISFM containing antibiotics was added thereto, and then 72 hours thereafter, the cells were peeled off by pipetting to recover the cells and culture medium. This was centrifuged at 1,200&#xd7;g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was stored in another tube (which was used as a first virus solution).</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0098">Sodium azide, sodium chloride and calcium chloride were added to 10 ml of this culture supernatant to give final concentrations of 0.05% sodium azide, 150 mmol/l sodium chloride and 2 mmol/l calcium chloride. After 50 &#x3bc;l of an anti-Flag antibody gel (Anti-Flag M1 monoclonal antibody Agarose Affinity Gel, manufactured by SIGMA) was added thereto, the mixture was gently stirred for 12 hours. After removing the supernatant by carrying out centrifugation (1,000&#xd7;g, 3 minutes, 4&#xb0; C.), washing was carried out three times with Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 1 mmol/l calcium chloride. By removing excess washing solution by carrying out centrifugation (1,000&#xd7;g, 3 minutes, 4&#xb0; C.), an SFT-1-FLAG fusion protein was obtained and used as the enzyme agent of the invention for activity measuring use.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0099">Using 5 &#x3bc;l of a gel to which the fusion protein (SFT-1-FLAG) purified above was bound, Western blotting was carried out in accordance with the usual method using a peroxidase-labeled anti-FLAG antibody (Anti-FLAG M2 Peroxidase, manufactured by SIGMA) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">(2) Measurement of the Activity of the Enzyme Agent of the Invention to Transfer Sulfate Group to Heparan Sulfate and Heparin</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0100">The fusion protein (SFT-1-FLAG) purified from a culture supernatant was added to 50 mmol/l of an imidazole-hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 6.8) containing 75 &#x3bc;g/ml of protamine hydrochloride, to which were subsequently added [<sup>35</sup>S]-PAPS (5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cpm, manufactured by NEN) as the sulfate donor, and heparan sulfate (derived from bovine kidney: manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation) and heparan (derived from swine intestines: manufactured by SIGMA) (500 &#x3bc;mol/l as the amount of hexosamine) as the sulfate acceptors, and the total volume was adjusted to 50 &#x3bc;l with distilled water. This reaction solution was allowed to react at 37&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes, and then the reaction was terminated by heating at 100&#xb0; C. for 3 minutes to deactivate the enzyme. After 130 &#x3bc;l of ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate and 0.5 mmol/l EDTA were added thereto, followed by stirring, and then the precipitate obtained by centrifugation was dissolved in 50 &#x3bc;l of distilled water. By again carrying out the ethanol precipitation and dissolution in 50 &#x3bc;l of water, filtration was carried out through a microfilter of 0.22 &#x3bc;m in pore size (manufactured by Millipore), followed by separation by HPLC. The separation was carried out by using G2500PW (manufactured by Tosoh) as the column, and 0.2 mol/l sodium chloride as the mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and at a column temperature of 35&#xb0; C. The eluates from the column were recovered as fractions of every 0.3 ml, and the radioactivity of each fraction was counted by a scintillation counter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As a result, peak of the radioactivity was detected at a position of the elution time of about 12 minutes. Since this elution time coincides with the elution time of heparan sulfate or heparin as the sulfate acceptor, it was confirmed that it shows the activity of transferring a sulfate group to these two acceptors.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0101">In addition, when the sulfate transferring activity was measured under the same conditions of the above-described activity measuring method using chondroitin sulfate D (shark cartilage origin: manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation), chondroitin (prepared by carrying out complete desulfation of bovine bronchus-derived chondroitin sulfate in accordance with the method described in <i>J.

After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 3 hours, heparin was recovered by carrying out 70% ethanol precipitation twice. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature to evaporate ethanol, dissolved in 30 &#x3bc;l of a buffer for heparin degrading enzyme reaction (20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0: contains 2 mM calcium acetate)) and then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hours by adding heparin degrading enzymes (heparinase 150 mU (manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation), heparitinase I 90 mU (manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation) and heparitinase II 60 mU (manufactured by Seikagaku Corporation): these enzymes form an unsaturated disaccharide (&#x394;HexA1,4GlcN) in which unsaturated uronic acid (&#x394;HexA) and GlcN are 1,4-glycoside-bound, by hydrolyzing the &#x3b2; 1,4-glucoside binding moiety (GlcN&#x3b2;1,4HexA) of GlcN and uronic acid (HexA) in the heparin skeleton). Thereafter, the reaction mixture was heated at 100&#xb0; C. for 1 minute to terminate the reaction, filtered through a microfilter of 0.22 &#x3bc;m in pore size (manufactured by Millipore) and then separated by HPLC.

The eluate was fractioned at 0.2 ml, and 10 &#x3bc;l thereof was analyzed by a scintillation counter to confirm eluted position of the radioactivity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).
