<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Ethernet protocol is rapidly growing as a communications protocol between different service providers. The T1 standard is reliable because there is a known bit rate and if there are deviations, performance problems are easily verified using the end points and loop around functions, the T1 protocol may also use an alarm indicator signal or state that may be passed to every circuit path segment from end to end to indicate far end and near end fault detection. Because Ethernet protocol is non-synchronous, determining or communicating performance statistics and alarms for each segment of a connection or specific devices may be difficult.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more of the illustrative embodiments provide a system and method for sending an alarm indicator signal (AIS) from one maintenance entity (ME) operation administration and maintenance (OAM) group to another to communicate the location and type of a fault. In one embodiment, the illustrative embodiments may be implemented for a metro Ethernet network (MEN). The AIS is a coded signal that is sent to network devices and elements to indicate a problem state or that a failure has been detected and an alarm generated. The AIS may be passed from one ME to another using domain state stitching or associating the AIS states of two or more ME or OAM levels so that the AIS signal from one ME may be communicated to the associated ME via a coded signal. One embodiment of the coded signal is a time length value (TLV) field of the Ethernet OAM protocols. State sharing or stitching may occur across multiple ME domains whereby an AIS signal from a distant customer or provider may be communicated over multiple service provider ME domains to the far end which may be owned by the customer or provider. As a result, the originating AIS state may be passed back to the customer or provider for fault isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The location of the problem, issue, or failure may be determined based on the end-point or ME that generated the original AIS. For example, the next in a chain of MEs may be determined to be the failure point. One or more of the illustrative embodiments may provide a protocol for ensuring that the appropriate service provider is contacted to diagnose and fix a problem rather than requiring any number of functioning service providers to unnecessarily troubleshoot their individual systems. As a result, any number of customers or service providers may be able to determine a point of origination or location of performance issues and alarms in one or more networks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A user-to-network (UNI) network is the physical and electrical demarcation point between the user and the public network service provider, typically a MEN and customer premises equipment. Typically, any layer <b>2</b> maintenance entity or maintenance association includes two or more end points, generally referred to as maintenance end points (MEP). AIS are alerts that provide information regarding information, such as performance and state of ports, layer <b>2</b> paths, operational status, and network element status. For example, the AIS may indicate there is no power throughout the MEN. Illustrative embodiments provide an efficient system for passing AIS between groups of MEs or specific domains. The AIS indication itself may be augmented with other TLV data to identify the type or location of an ME triggering an alarm based on a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a pictorial representation of a communications environment in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a communications environment <b>100</b>. The communications environment <b>100</b> is the devices, equipment, and systems for enabling communications. In particular, the communications environment may be one or more MENs and systems. The communications environment <b>100</b> may include any number of devices, equipment, systems, elements, and components. In one embodiment, the communications environment <b>100</b> may include segments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b>, a MEN <b>112</b>, ME <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b>, and alarm <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The communications environment <b>100</b> and the MEN <b>112</b> may include various MEs <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b>, MEP, service network interfaces (SNI), network interface devices, Ethernet to External Network to Network Interface (E-NNI), and other elements as described in the patent application herein incorporated. Communications may occur between any number of entities, including the MEs <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, and <b>122</b> and may communicate with the MEN <b>112</b> in any number of configurations. Alternatively, the MEs <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>122</b> may be considered part of the MEN <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, an SNI may be connected to the MEN <b>112</b> and may perform conversion of transmission protocols and standards, such as from Ethernet to synchronous optical network (SONET). In another embodiment, a UNI may be connected directly to the MEN <b>112</b>. In yet another embodiment, the user may connect to the MEN <b>112</b> or to another portion of the communications environment <b>100</b> through one or more service providers, segments, or territories.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The segments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b> are portions of the communications environment <b>100</b> and may represent communications paths and routes utilized for data communications. The segments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b> may be operated by one or more communications service providers, users, entities, or other operators. Each segment <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b> may include multiple nodes, domains, entities, devices, systems, equipment, controllers, connections, and other communications elements. The segments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b> may also represent ME domains/pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the domains or entities of the communications environment <b>100</b> may include the MEN level of the service provider, an access segment outside of the ME, and a customer UNI ME. In another embodiment, the communications environment <b>100</b> may only include two segments, such as connections between the customer, a local service provider, and the access service provider. In one embodiment, each of the segments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b> may operate without knowledge of the other segments <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The illustrative embodiments may allow the MEs to send AIS or alarm <b>124</b> based on failures or problems at or between the MEs <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. In one embodiment, the ME <b>118</b> has failed. The AIS may allow one or more parties to determine which ME or segment is or has failed or is experiencing or has experienced problems. For example, the ME <b>116</b> may communicate with the applicable MEP which may be ME <b>114</b> indicating that the failure has occurred at ME <b>118</b> or the connection between ME <b>116</b> and <b>188</b>. On the other side, the ME <b>120</b> may similarly notify the ME <b>122</b> from the other communications direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another example a first ME pair includes MEs <b>116</b> and <b>120</b>, with a second ME pair including MEs <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>. If a power outage were to occur in ME <b>122</b> the second ME pair may indicate a failure of the layer two path and that the second ME pair may then trigger an AIS indication. The AIS indication may or may not contain the cause of the AIS failure. When the two AIS states of the first ME pair and second ME pair are &#x201c;stitched&#x201d; or shared, the AIS indication at ME <b>120</b> may be conveyed to the first ME pair which may then propagate the AIS conditional alarm with the originating ME pair identification to ME <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The failure determination may be triggered by the OAM performance threshold criteria or by traditional port state operational measurements, such as &#x201c;LOS&#x201d; for loss of signal. MEs <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may communicate information via a TLV field. The illustrative embodiments may provide a signaling protocol and method for passing the AIS state of one ME to another. If both MEs terminate in the same node, the AIS state may be associated from one ME to the other ME via standard operational measures reading and state information. For example, the AIS may be generated by the ME <b>116</b> and may be communicated to one or more other domains, entities, or back to the ME <b>114</b> and MEN <b>112</b>. The AIS may be a special state alarm that uses a special frame to alarm the AIS condition. For example, a remote defect indicator (RDI) may communicate faults to an MEP at a far end. In one embodiment, the AIS and remote defect indicator packets of the illustrative embodiments may utilize standards, recommendations, or protocols, such as ITU-T Recommendation Y.1731 (05/2006). One or more of the illustrative embodiments may allow an AIS signal to be sent downstream to the other end indicating that the ME <b>118</b>, access connection, UNI port, or other network element has a failure or error. For example, if a customer experiences a power outage, the ME <b>116</b> sends the alarm <b>124</b> to the other end of the communications environment indicating that there is a power outage or other problem at the ME <b>118</b>. The AIS may be utilized to report the state at each end of an ME and the RDI may communicate the state and AIS inside of an ME segment or pair. Both types of state information may be stitched together.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The alarm <b>124</b> may be any number of signals and alarm types. In one embodiment, a UNI directional frame loss alarm may indicate that data is destined for the ME <b>120</b>, but is not being received properly by the ME <b>120</b>. A continuity check packet alarm may indicate that the ME <b>120</b> or MEP is unable to hear or verify the presence or status of the far end which may include the ME <b>114</b> or the MEN <b>112</b>. The illustrative embodiment allows a problem to be identified between any number of coupled MEs. It is important to note that both point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint AIS alarm indications may be passed between respective yet different ME types. TLV field characterizations may indicate where the fault or alarm originated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the AIS may not diagnose the error or failure, but rather may locate the failure connection, node, or point. As a result, the proper service provider, operator, or customer may be alerted right away once an AIS is activated and sent back downstream. As a result, service providers may correctly identify the location of the problem to prevent the unnecessary use of resources. In one embodiment, MEP servers utilize notification engines, such as simple network management protocol (SNMP) to notify the appropriate service provider of the alarm and a suggested corrective action. For example, the ME <b>116</b> and corresponding connection to the ME <b>114</b> may not be tested for faults or problems when ME <b>118</b> has already been identified as failing due to loss of power. In one or more of the illustrative embodiments, an AIS, once generated, is passed or flipped from the last functioning ME to another back to the MEP. For example, the ME <b>120</b> may communicate the AIS back to the ME <b>122</b> which may be a MEP. In particular, the AIS may be passed to endpoints within the communications environment ensuring that fault location information may be retrieved from the endpoint devices. In another embodiment, the AIS fault or problem location may also be retrieved from the intermediary MEs, nodes, domains, entities, or other parts of the communications environment <b>100</b>. AIS stitching may be utilized between associated MEs within the communications environment <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flowchart of a process for detecting network problems in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process may be implemented by one or more MEs within a metro Ethernet environment, system, or network. The process may begin by detecting a problem (step <b>202</b>). The problem may be a problem, failure, or other issue that affects communications at or between MEPs within a MEN. In one embodiment, the problem may be detected by a functioning ME that determines a subsequent ME or data connection is unavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Next, the ME identifies the location of the problem (step <b>204</b>). The location may be identified utilizing a network identifier for a device, connection, or network segment. The network identifier may be a provider name, circuit identifier, ME association, MEP address, IP address, MAC address, assigned identifier, numeric sequence, or other information indicating the location of the device or connection that is experiencing the problem. As previously described, the last functioning ME in a series of MEs, domains, entities, or nodes may note the location. The network identifier may indicate the point at which packets or data are no longer able to proceed to the next ME, domain, or point. For example, by using AIS stitching between MEs, a fault may be more specifically identified, such as identifying frame loss that is occurring on the receive side of an ME and the identity of the last functioning ME.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Next, the ME generates an alarm indicating a location of the problem (step <b>206</b>). The alarm or AIS may indicate the location of the problem utilizing the identifier or other information. The ME sends the alarm signal to the MEPs (step <b>208</b>). The alarm signal may also be retrieved, read, or analyzed by any number of intermediary MEs operated by one or mote communications service providers. In one embodiment, ME associations may be paired and multiple service providers may use sharing standards or protocols for sharing AIS or RDI signals between ME domains. As a result, each service provider may know where the problem is occurring so that actions, such as troubleshooting, dispatching technicians, or other similar steps may be taken by the service provider experiencing the failure. A network identifier or ME identification may indicate where the problem or failure is from one or more sides or perspectives of the network including near and a far end identification. In one embodiment, the alarms may be color coded or numbered errors that identify the error, failure, problem, or issue. The AIS may also specify the problem category. The categories may include physical, Ethernet first mile, operational administration measurement (OAM) and other categories for bad packets, level of service (LOS), loss of signal, power loss, packet loss, fragmented packets, frame loss ratio (FLR), delay, TLV (i.e., circuit ID), or state (in-service, out-of-service).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, performance metrics may not be necessary even though one or more of the illustrative embodiments may be implemented with a system that performs stitching for performance metrics. One or more of the illustrative embodiments may allow one or more MEs to generate or receive an alarm with the alarm state and identify the location of the alarm. One or more of the illustrative embodiments allows a communications service provider or operator to determine whether the source of the problem originates within equipment, systems devices, or connections managed by the service provider or whether the source of the problem is with a different provider/customer.</p>
