<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2010-057855 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Mar. 15, 2010, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a content output apparatus, a content playback system, a content output method, and a program.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the past, to transmit content such as music or video to another apparatus, a transmission source and a transmission destination of the content were connected by a cable and transmission was performed via the cable. For example, Japan Patent No. 3834897 describes an audio-visual (AV) system that inputs/outputs video signals and audio signals by an interface specified in Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 1394.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, with the development in wireless communication, a content playback system that is capable of transmitting content by using wireless communication is being proposed. However, for example, in a case content playback reservations are made to one content output apparatus by a plurality of content transmission apparatuses having content pieces, a content transmission apparatus having content and the content output apparatus may not be able to communicate at a time the turn to playback the content has come.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In light of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a content output apparatus, a content playback system, a content output method, and a program which are novel and improved, and which are capable of rearranging the output order in a case it is not possible to output certain content.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a content output apparatus which includes a wireless communication unit for transmitting an acquisition request for content data based on a position of the content data in an output order, a communication control unit for investigating whether or not acquisition of the content data is possible, before transmitting the acquisition request, and an output control unit for rearranging the output order according to a result of the investigation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to such configuration, whether acquisition of content data is possible or not is investigated before the start of output of the content data. Then, pieces of content data are rearranged based on the result of the investigation. Therefore, if the communication channel to the content data is in an inaccessible state at the time of the investigation, the output order is automatically rearranged without the operation of the user, and thus playback of content being stopped due to the inaccessibility to the content data can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The output control unit may rearrange the output order, in a case the result of the investigation indicates that output of the content data is not possible, so as to lower the position of the content data in the output order.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The communication control unit may carry out the investigation based on whether communication with an apparatus having the content data is possible or not.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The communication control unit may carry out the investigation according to the output order, with respect to a plurality of pieces of the content data.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therein the wireless communication unit may receive an acquisition request for an output list for managing the output order. The output control unit may cause the communication control unit to transmit the output list, in response to the acquisition request for the output list.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a content playback system which includes a content output apparatus including a wireless communication unit for transmitting an acquisition request for content data based on a position of the content data in an output order, a communication control unit for investigating whether or not acquisition of the content data is possible, before transmitting the acquisition request, and an output control unit for rearranging the output order according to a result of the investigation, and a content transmission apparatus having the content data and transmitting the content data in response to the acquisition request.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a content output method which includes the steps of transmitting an acquisition request for content data based on a position of the content data in an output order, investigating whether or not acquisition of the content data is possible, before transmitting the acquisition request, and rearranging the output order according to a result of the investigation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a program for causing a computer to function as a content output apparatus including a wireless communication unit for transmitting an acquisition request for content data based on a position of the content data in an output order, a communication control unit for investigating whether or not acquisition of the content data is possible, before transmitting the acquisition request, and an output control unit for rearranging the output order according to a result of the investigation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the embodiments of the present invention described above, it is possible to rearrange the output order in a case it is not possible to output certain content.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(1-1. System Configuration)</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">First, a schematic configuration of a content playback system according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an explanatory diagram showing a configuration of a content playback system according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">A content playback system <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes a content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, a content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, a content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>3</b>, and a content output apparatus <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">The content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>3</b>, and the content output apparatus <b>20</b> are wireless communication apparatuses capable of connecting to each other according to Wi-Fi Direct specification. A wireless communication apparatus acting as a Group Owner in Wi-Fi Direct functions as the content output apparatus <b>20</b>, and a wireless communication apparatus acting as a Client functions as the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with a mobile phone with a small speaker and a music playback apparatus with a large speaker, both having a music playback function, it is desirable that the music playback apparatus with a large speaker functions as the content output apparatus <b>20</b> and the mobile phone with a small speaker functions as the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">The content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> has music content data, and transmits the content data to the content output apparatus <b>20</b> via wireless connection in response to an acquisition request for the content data from the content output apparatus <b>20</b>. That is, the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> has a function of a Digital Media Server (DMS), and functions as a so-called Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) server. The content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> also has a function of a Digital Media Controller (DMC) for controlling the content output apparatus <b>20</b> functioning as a Digital Media Renderer (DMR).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The content output apparatus <b>20</b> has an output unit, such as a speaker, and accepts a music playback reservation from the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>. Also, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> manages the output order of pieces of music content data for which playback reservations have been made. The content output apparatus <b>20</b> transmits, to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> that has music content data whose turn to be played back has come, an acquisition request for the content data. Then, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> outputs, from a speaker, the content data that the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> has transmitted in response to the acquisition request.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">The content output apparatus <b>20</b> is a playback apparatus that has a function of the DMR. That is, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> functions as a so-called DLNA client. The content output apparatus <b>20</b> functioning as the DMR has been know to have a function as follows. First, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> has a function of receiving, over a network, an instruction such as playback or cancellation of content data from the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> functioning as the DMC, and of controlling a playback function of itself. Furthermore, the content data to be played back by the content output apparatus <b>20</b> at this point may be content data stored within itself, or may be content data stored in an apparatus different from the content output apparatus <b>20</b> (for example, the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> that functions as the DMS). The content output apparatus <b>20</b> can acquire content data at a location specified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) via a network and playback the same.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">Also, regarding playback of content data, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> can accept a reservation for content data to be played back after the content data that is currently being played back. At this point, the content data for which a reservation is made may be one piece of content data or may be a playlist including pieces of content data. When playback of the content data that is currently being played back is finished, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> automatically starts playback of content data for which a reservation has been made such that the content data will be played back next.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">As described, the existing content output apparatus <b>20</b> can make a playback reservation for a plurality of content pieces by specifying, as content to be played back next, a playlist including the plurality of content pieces. However, it is not possible to accept a further playback reservation for content or a playlist to be played back after the next content or the next playlist. Also, if a playback reservation for a plurality of content pieces is to be made by specifying a playlist, the plurality of content pieces have to be specified &#x201c;at the same time.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">Therefore, with respect to the existing content output apparatus <b>20</b>, there is an issue that reservations for &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; content pieces are not &#x201c;asynchronously&#x201d; accepted from a plurality of content transmission apparatuses <b>10</b> functioning as control apparatuses. Also, once specified, it is not possible to edit a playback reservation for the content data. Furthermore, in a case the communication channel between the content output apparatus <b>20</b> and the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> is wireless, the communication channel to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> having content data may not be able to be used at the timing of starting playback of the content data. Therefore, there is an issue that content data may not be able to be acquired at the timing of playback start.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">Accordingly, in view of the above issues, the present embodiment extends a playlist playback specification of the DMR, and enables to edit a playlist for which a playback reservation has already been made. Also, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment carries out an investigation, before start of playback, on whether content data of content to be played back next is accessible. Then, when the result of the investigation indicates that the content data to be played back next is inaccessible, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> uses the function of editing a playlist mentioned above and changes the position, in the playback order, of the content data which is inaccessible.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(1-2. Extension of Edit Function for Output List)</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">Here, extension of the playlist playback specification of the DMR will be described with reference to a concrete example as follows. According to the present embodiment, to enable editing of an output list, a state variable for managing an output list including a plurality of content pieces and/or content groups is added to the DMR, and an action that uses the added state variable is further added.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">In the past, only either of values &#x201c;current&#x201d; and &#x201c;next&#x201d; could be held in a list of queued content pieces. Accordingly, first, the output list is extended so as to be able to hold values of a plurality of content pieces and/or content groups. For example, an extended output list is written in Extensible Markup Language (XML) as follows.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0060">First, an output list <b>1000</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> holds information such as an output order <b>1002</b>, output data <b>1004</b>, and a content holding apparatus <b>1006</b>. The output order <b>1002</b> corresponds to the index in the above output list written in XML, and when the value of the output order is 0, it indicates that the content is currently being played back.

<p id="p-0064" num="0067">In the above example, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> that carries out the action of adding or deleting content or content group to or from output list carries out the action below based on specified AVTInstanceID, index, AVTransportURI, and EmbeddedMetadata. For example, in a case values are specified for all of AVTInstanceID, index, AVTransportURI, and EmbeddedMetadata, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> inserts the specified AVTransportURI and EmbeddedMetadata in the specified index in the output list, and increments the index of AVTMedia following the specified index by one. For example, when an addition request for adding playlist E held by the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>4</b> to index=2 is made to the content output apparatus <b>20</b> holding the output list <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the output list <b>1000</b> is edited, and an output list <b>1100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is generated. Specifically, playlist E is inserted at the second position in the output order of the output list. Then, the index is incremented by one for each of content C and content D whose positions in the output order were respectively second and third in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">Furthermore, if, at this point, a special value such as &#x2212;1 is specified in the index, the specified AVTransportURI and EmbeddedMetadata are added at the end of the output list. According to this configuration, even if the control apparatus does not know how many content pieces are held in the output list at a current point, the control apparatus can add content at the end of the output list. For example, when an addition request for adding playlist E held by the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>-<b>4</b> to index=&#x2212;1 is made, the output list <b>1000</b> is edited, and an output list <b>1200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is generated. That is, playlist E is added at the end of the output list <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Furthermore, for example, if the values of AVTransportURI and EmbeddedMetadata are null, it may mean deletion of content specified by the index. In this case, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> deletes AVTransportURI and EmbeddedMetadata held at a specified index, and decrements the index of AVTMedia designated by the index following the specified index by one. For example, if a deletion request is made for index=1, content B at index=1 in the output list <b>1000</b> is deleted, and an output list <b>1300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">Next, an explanation will be given on the &#x201c;action of rearranging content pieces in output list.&#x201d; The content output apparatus <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment accepts a request for rearranging content pieces in an output list from the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> functioning as a control apparatus, or the like. For example, the action of rearranging content pieces in output list is expressed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">UpdateMediaListPosition (IN oldindex, IN newindex)</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">In the above example, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> that carries out the action of rearranging content pieces in output list moves the content specified by oldindex according to newindex. Specifically, in the case of oldindex&#x3c;newindex, content specified by oldindex is inserted in the position specified by newindex, and the index of the content that is in between is decremented by one. For example, a request for rearranging oldindex=1 and newindex=3 is made to the content output apparatus <b>20</b> holding the output list <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Then, an output list <b>1400</b> in which the position, in the output order, of playlist B for which oldindex is 1 is changed to third and the indices of content C and content D for which the indices are respectively 2 and 3 in the output list <b>1000</b> are decremented by one is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">In the foregoing, an explanation has been given on the overview of the content playback system <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment. The content output apparatus <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is enabled, by the extension of the output list described above, to asynchronously accept content playback reservations from a plurality of content transmission apparatuses <b>10</b> functioning as control apparatuses. Also, rearrangement of pieces of content data for which playback reservations have been made is also made possible by the above-described extension.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">Accordingly, the content playback system <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment smoothly plays back content pieces while investigating the state of wireless communication, by using the extended function.

<p id="p-0073" num="0076">Among the above, the data processing unit <b>104</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>, the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>, and the antenna <b>124</b> will function as a wireless communication unit when the communication control unit <b>116</b> controls their operations.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">At the time of receiving a wireless signal, the wireless interface unit <b>112</b> decodes various data frames by down-converting a wireless signal received by the antenna <b>124</b> and converting the same to a bit string. When it is checked that there is no error in the various data frames supplied by the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>108</b> supplies the various data frames to the data processing unit <b>104</b>. The data processing unit <b>104</b> processes and analyses the various data frames and data packets supplied from the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">Also, at the time of transmitting a wireless signal, the data processing unit <b>104</b> generates various data frames or data packets according to a request from the content output apparatus <b>20</b> or the like, for example, and supplies the same to the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>. The transmission processing unit <b>108</b> performs processing such as addition of various data headers and error detection codes such as a frame check sequence (FCS) on the packets generated by the data processing unit <b>104</b>, and supplies the data after processing to the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>. The wireless interface unit <b>112</b> generates, from the data received from the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>, a modulation signal in the frequency range of a carrier wave, and causes the antenna <b>124</b> to transmit the same as a wireless signal.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">The communication control unit <b>116</b> controls the operations of the data processing unit <b>104</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>, the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>, and the antenna <b>124</b>, and causes them to function as a reception unit or a transmission unit. For example, in response to an instruction from the reservation control unit <b>160</b>, the communication control unit <b>116</b> controls the operations of the data processing unit <b>104</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>, the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>, and the antenna <b>124</b>, and causes them to function as a transmission unit for transmitting a playback reservation message. Or, depending on the situation (for example, in a case there is no communication for a specific time or longer), the communication control unit <b>116</b> controls the operations of the data processing unit <b>104</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>, the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>, and the antenna <b>124</b>, and changes an operation mode so that they will operate in a power-saving mode. Furthermore, in response to a connection request from the content output apparatus <b>20</b>, for example, the communication control unit <b>116</b> controls the operations of the data processing unit <b>104</b>, the transmission processing unit <b>108</b>, the wireless interface unit <b>112</b>, and the antenna <b>124</b>, and causes the operation mode to transition from the power-saving mode to a normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">The memory <b>120</b> undertakes a role of a work area for data processing by the communication control unit <b>116</b>, or has a function of a storage medium for holding various types of data. The memory <b>120</b> may be a storage medium such as a non-volatile memory, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, or a magneto-optical (MO) disk. The non-volatile memory may be, for example, a flash memory, an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), or an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM). Also, the magnetic disk may be a hard disk, a discoid magnetic disk, or the like. Furthermore, the optical disk may be a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disc recordable (DVD-R), a Blu-ray disc (BD; registered trademark), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">The reservation control unit <b>160</b> makes a playback reservation for content to the content output apparatus <b>20</b> based on operation information from the input unit <b>166</b>. Specifically, the reservation control unit <b>160</b> makes the display unit <b>164</b> display a playback reservation screen, generates a playback reservation message by acquiring a playback reservation operation of a user via the input unit <b>166</b>, and instructs the communication control unit <b>116</b> to transmit the generated playback reservation message to the content output apparatus <b>20</b>. Also, when a transmission instruction is received from the content output apparatus <b>20</b>, the reservation control unit <b>160</b> acquires content data from the storage unit <b>162</b>, and instructs the communication control unit <b>116</b> to transmit the same to the content output apparatus <b>20</b>, in response to the transmission instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">The storage unit <b>162</b> has a function of a storage medium for storing content data, for example.

<p id="p-0080" num="0083">The display unit <b>164</b> is an example of an output apparatus for outputting various types of information to a user according to control by the reservation control unit <b>160</b>. For example, the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> may itself display a list of content data in the storage unit <b>162</b>, and have a user select content data to be output from the content output apparatus <b>20</b>. Or, an output list managed by the content output apparatus <b>20</b> may be acquired from the content output apparatus <b>20</b>, and be displayed by the display unit <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">The input unit <b>166</b> is configured from input means for a user to input information, such as a mouse, a keyboard, a touch panel, a button, a microphone, a switch, or a lever, an input control circuit that generates an input signal based on input from the user and outputs the same to a CPU (not shown), and the like. The user of the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> can input various types of data to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> or instruct processing operations thereto by operating the input means.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">Additionally, the functions of the communication control unit <b>116</b> and the reservation control unit <b>160</b> are achieved, in reality, by an arithmetic apparatus such as a central processing unit (CPU) not shown reading out a control program from a storage medium, such as a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), or the like, storing a control program describing processing for realizing these functions, and interpreting and carrying out the program.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0091">Then, in a case the result of the investigation indicates that connection to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> having content data which is to be played back soon is possible, the playback control unit <b>252</b>, which has received the result of the investigation, instructs the communication control unit <b>216</b> to transmit an acquisition request for the content data to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b>. On the other hand, in a case connection to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> is not possible, the playback control unit <b>252</b> rearranges the output order of the plurality of pieces of content data. Specifically, the output order is rearranged such that the position, in the output order, of the content data the acquisition of which has been indicated by the result of the investigation to be not possible is moved to a lower position. The position, in the output order, of content data may be moved such that the position is moved one position lower or is moved to the end of the output list.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">In a case the communication channel between the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> and the content output apparatus <b>20</b> is wireless, even if it is decided at the time of investigation that acquisition of content data is not possible, acquisition of the content data may sometimes become possible during the course of time. That is, there may be a case where the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> having content data is temporarily disconnected from a wireless network at the time it is decided that acquisition of the content data is not possible, but will join the wireless network again during the course of time.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Furthermore, in a case the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> is operating in a power-saving mode, the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> can transition to a normal mode during the time before playback start of content data by having a connection request made to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> in advance, and delay of the playback start of the content data can be prevented. That is, the investigation on the acquisition possibility of the content data carried out by the communication control unit <b>216</b> is preferably carried out prior to the playback start of the content data by at least a time necessary for the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> to transition from the power-saving mode to the normal mode or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">The memory <b>220</b> undertakes a role of a work area for data processing by the communication control unit <b>216</b>, or has a function of a storage medium for holding various types of data. The memory <b>220</b> may be a storage medium such as a non-volatile memory, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, or a magneto-optical (MO) disk. The non-volatile memory may be, for example, a flash memory, an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), or an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM). Also, the magnetic disk may be a hard disk, a discoid magnetic disk, or the like. Furthermore, the optical disk may be a compact disc (CD), a digital versatile disc recordable (DVD-R), a Blu-ray disc (BD; registered trademark), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">The speaker <b>232</b> is an output apparatus for outputting playback data of content. In the present embodiment, a configuration having a speaker is taken as an example of the output apparatus, but the output apparatus is not limited to such. For example, the output apparatus may be a display, and may be able to output video content.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">The amplifier <b>244</b> has a function of amplifying a signal input by the playback processing unit <b>248</b> and inputting the same to the speaker <b>232</b>. Also, the playback processing unit <b>248</b> performs decoding processing or the like on content data which has been input. The playback control unit <b>252</b> has a function of performing control such that the playback processing unit <b>248</b> performs playback processing.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">The storage unit <b>256</b> has a function of a storage medium for storing content data, for example. It may also functions as a storage medium for storing an output list. The storage unit <b>256</b> may be a storage medium such as a non-volatile memory, or a magnetic disk. The non-volatile memory may be, for example, a flash memory, an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), or an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM). Also, the magnetic disk may be a hard disk, a discoid magnetic disk, or the like.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&#x3c;4. Operation of Content Output Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">Next, an operation of the content output apparatus <b>20</b> will be described by using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart showing an operation performed at the time of the content output apparatus <b>20</b> receiving a control message from the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> functioning as a control apparatus. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart showing an operation performed by the content output apparatus <b>20</b> in the time until the start of content data.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(4-1. Operation at the Time of Control Message Reception)</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">First, an operation performed in a case the content output apparatus <b>20</b> received a control message will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Here, the types of control messages to be received are roughly divided into an acquisition request for an output list and an edit request for the output list, and the edit request for the output list may be further divided into a new reservation request and an edit request for an existing list.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">First, when a wireless communication unit of the content output apparatus <b>20</b> receives a control message from the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> (S<b>103</b>), the playback control unit <b>252</b> determines the type of the control message (S<b>106</b>). If the received control message here is an acquisition request message for an output list, the playback control unit <b>252</b> transmits an output list to the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> which is the transmission source of the control message, by giving an instruction to the communication control unit <b>216</b> (S<b>109</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">On the other hand, if it is decided by the decision at step S<b>106</b> that the type of the control message is an edit request for an output list, the playback control unit <b>252</b> further determines whether it is a playback reservation message for a new reservation or an edit request message for an existing list (S<b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">Then, if the control message is the playback reservation message for a new reservation, the playback control unit <b>252</b> acquires details of the new reservation (information for designating content, position in output order, and the like) from the playback reservation message (S<b>115</b>). On the other hand, if it is decided by the decision at step S<b>112</b> to be the edit request message for an existing list, the playback control unit <b>252</b> acquires the details of editing from the control message (S<b>118</b>). For example, in a case of deleting content data from an output list, information on the position, in the output order, of content data to be deleted and the like correspond to the details of editing. Or, in a case of rearranging the order of content pieces in an output list, the values of the output order before and after the change, for example, correspond to the details of editing.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">Then, the playback control unit <b>252</b> edits the output list based on the details of the new reservation or the details of editing which have been acquired. The concrete method of editing an output list is as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(4-2. Operation Before Content Output)</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">Next, an operation to be performed by the content output apparatus <b>20</b> in the time until output start of content data will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">First, the playback control unit <b>252</b> decides whether the output start of content next in the output order is close at hand or not (S<b>203</b>). If it is decided by the decision at step S<b>203</b> that the output start of the next content is close at hand, the communication control unit <b>216</b> is made to carry out accessibility investigation of the next content data (S<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">The playback control unit <b>252</b> decides whether access to the content data is possible or not based on the result of the investigation at step S<b>206</b> (S<b>209</b>), and in a case access is possible, decides next whether a timing of output start of the content has arrived (S<b>215</b>). Then, when the timing of output start has arrived, the content data is acquired and output of the same is started (S<b>218</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">On the other hand, if access to the content data is decided to be not possible based on the decision at step S<b>209</b>, the playback control unit <b>252</b> moves the position of the next content in the output order to the end of the output list (S<b>212</b>), returns to step S<b>206</b>, and carries out accessibility investigation of the next content data in the output list whose output order has been rearranged.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">&#x3c;5. Example of Effect&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">In the foregoing, the content playback system <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention has been described. The content playback system <b>1</b> first extends a list (output list) of queued content pieces which could hold only two values, &#x201c;Current&#x201d; and &#x201c;Next,&#x201d; according to the specification of MediaRenderer of an existing DLNA so as to enable the list to hold a plurality of queued content pieces. At this point, an index indicating a position in the output order is added as a state variable.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">Furthermore, the present embodiment enables to edit the output order of the output list by specifying the index. Actions that are specifically added are an action of adding or deleting content data to or from the output list and an action of rearranging the output list. Furthermore, an action for acquiring the output list is also added here to enable a control apparatus to perform operation while referring to the state of the output list at the time point.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">With the extended functions as described above, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is enabled to accept playback reservations from a plurality of control apparatuses at a plurality of timings. Also, editing of the output list by a plurality of control apparatuses is also made possible.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">Also, the content output apparatus <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment investigates, before acquisition of content data, whether acquisition of the content data is possible or not, and rearranges the output order of the output list according to the result of the investigation. According to such configuration, even if the content output apparatus <b>20</b> and the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> are connected via a network with low accessibility, the content data can be played back if only the content output apparatus <b>20</b> and the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> are connected via the network at the time of control, such as at the time of making a playback reservation, and at the time of playback. Also, even if the content output apparatus <b>20</b> is not able to access the content data immediately before playback start, the position of the content data in the output order is automatically moved, and thus, when the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> having the content data is reconnected to the network, playback of the content data is enabled. Here, since a user does not have to perform interaction control each time, it is highly convenient for the user.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0113">For example, according to the embodiment described above, investigation on whether access to content data is possible or not is carried out only on the content data that is next in the output order. However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. For example, the accessibility investigation may be carried out on the next three content pieces, taking into consideration that playback of content data may be skipped by a user operation.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114">Furthermore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a case is described where content data is moved to the end of the output list in a case access to the content data is not possible. However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. The output order may be rearranged such that the position, in the output order, of the content data to which access is not possible is moved one position lower.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0115">Additionally, in the embodiment described above, it is assumed that the content transmission apparatus <b>10</b> functions as a control apparatus. However, the present invention is not limited to such an example. For example, content data may be stored in another apparatus not having the control function.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0116">Moreover, in the present specification, the steps described in the flow charts include not only the processing performed chronologically in the described order, but also the processing performed in parallel or individually instead of being performed chronologically. Moreover, needless to say, the order may be changed as appropriate even if the steps are meant to be performed chronologically.</p>
