<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/835,137 entitled &#x201c;Secure Physical Billing System&#x201d; filed on Aug. 2, 2006, whose inventors were Kelly C. Sparks and Bennie Gibson, and which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully and completely set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to billing systems and, more particularly, to a secure physical billing system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current movie distribution offerings fall into two primary categories: PayTV and Home Video. PayTV solutions encompass all solutions where electronic data is transmitted to or from a customer's home. This includes, for example, satellite and cable pay-per-view, Internet-based video downloads and streams, cable video-on-demand (VOD) systems, and other electronic delivery methods that require any form of data transmission to or from inside the customer's home to exhibit or purchase the exhibition of the content. Home Video solutions encompass all physical delivery methods including rental houses, retail, and any other physical delivery method. In this industry, there are requirements that govern how content is released and when content is released, and these requirements dictate which form of delivery can be used with the PayTV solutions and the Home Video solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Technology has afforded some innovative ways to distribute content to consumers. However, by their very nature, many of these distribution methods fall into the PayTV solutions category by virtue of the fact that they all require some form of electronic data transmission to or from the customer's home to exhibit and/or pay for those exhibitions. As a result, these solutions are subject to the rules and restrictions set up by the movie studios, e.g., those that delay the availability of new releases for PayTV.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, Home Video solutions, such as rental houses and retail, are not subject to many of these rules and restrictions. Home Video solutions typically offer new releases soon after the material is made available. However, Home Video solutions lack the on-demand convenience of the PayTV solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some current technologies enable physical content to be delivered securely to the home, for example, via locked CDs or DVDs. However, these solutions typically still require electronic transmission to unlock or pay for content, which results in these technologies being classified as a PayTV services as well, even if the content is physically delivered to the customer's home.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments are disclosed of a method and apparatus for implementing a secure physical billing system. In one embodiment, a service provider may send a plurality of content storage devices to a customer via physical delivery. Each content storage device includes secure content. In addition, the service provider may send a billing storage device to the customer via physical delivery. The billing storage device includes decryption information, which may be used by a media player for decrypting the secure content of the content storage devices to exhibit the secure content to the customer. The content storage devices and the billing storage device may be provided to the customer via a physical delivery method, such as mail or courier, and without any electronic data transmission occurring to or from the physical location of the customer. The billing storage device may be provided to the customer once every billing period according to a predetermined billing cycle, e.g., a monthly billing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, in response to the customer receiving and loading a selected one of the content storage devices and the billing storage device into the media player, the media player may decrypt the secure content of the selected content storage device using the decryption information of the billing storage device, exhibit the secure content to the customer, and write secure billing information associated with the exhibition of the secure content to a writeable area of the billing storage device. The media player may exhibit the secure content to the customer without any electronic data transmission occurring to or from the physical location of the customer. At the end of the billing period, the customer may return the billing storage device to the service provider via physical delivery. The billing storage device may include the secure billing information stored in a writeable area of the billing storage device. The service provider may process the secure billing information and obtain payment from the customer for the activity during that billing period.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the service provider may also send an index storage device to the customer via physical delivery. The index storage device may include decryption information, which along with the decryption information of the billing storage device, may be used by the media player for decrypting the secure content of the content storage devices to exhibit the secure content to the customer.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turing now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a diagram is shown of the content preparation process, according to one embodiment. During the content preparation process, a media preparation system <b>100</b> encrypts, compresses, and stores secure content in content storage devices <b>150</b>. Each content storage device <b>150</b> is a secure physical medium for distributing the encrypted content. As the content is encrypted, compressed and stored, the keys to unlock the secure content are stored in a key database <b>110</b> for later use, as will be described further below. The owners of the content and the corresponding manufacturers may use the media preparation system <b>100</b> to exclusively create the content storage devices <b>150</b>, and then send the content storage devices <b>150</b> to a service provider for distribution to customers. In some cases, the service provider may obtain authorization from the content owners to also create content storage devices <b>150</b> using an in-house media preparation system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, the content storage device <b>150</b> is a digital video disc (DVD). In is noted, however, that in other embodiments the content storage device <b>150</b> may be other secure physical media, such as HD DVD, Blu-ray Disc, CD, Flash Memory Card, Hard Drive, USB Flash Drive, etc. The content that is stored in the content storage device <b>150</b> may be movies, documentaries, or television shows. The content may also be other audio-visual works, such as music videos, presentations, and picture slideshows, visual works such as pictures or background images with text, and audio works, such as music and other recorded audio.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of a public/private key assignment process, according to one embodiment. At manufacture, private keys are generated and stored in a secure memory of a media playback device or media player <b>200</b>. In one specific implementation, during the public/private key assignment process, the corresponding public keys that are tethered to a unique media player <b>200</b> are encrypted and stored in a billing storage device <b>125</b>. As will be described further below, when the billing storage device <b>125</b> is loaded into the media player <b>200</b>, the private keys are used by the media player <b>200</b> for decrypting the corresponding public keys of the billing storage device <b>125</b>, which are then used to decrypt and exhibit secure content to a customer. In this implementation, since the information on the billing storage device <b>125</b> is tethered to a unique media player <b>200</b>, only a single media player (i.e., media player <b>200</b>) may be configured to read the billing storage device <b>125</b>, based on the public/private key encryption technique. This may result in a secure physical billing media that cannot be read by any other media player but the one for which the billing media was created, since the private keys stored in the media player are required to unlock the public keys on the billing media. In one embodiment, the billing storage device <b>125</b> may be a storage device that is part pre-recorded (e.g., CD-ROM) and part recordable (e.g., CD-R) on the same disc, which enables both read-only data and unique recordable data on the same disc. It is noted, however, that in other embodiments the billing storage device <b>125</b> may be other secure physical media or computer readable storage media, such as CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, Flash Memory Cards, Hard Drive, USB Flash Drive, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In other implementations, the public keys on the billing storage device <b>125</b> may be tethered to two or more media players <b>200</b>. In this implementation, the decision on how many media players <b>200</b> will be configured to read a specific billing storage device <b>125</b> associated with a specific customer account may be determined based on the customer's needs or other requirements. In one specific example, the customer may have multiple media players <b>200</b> at home or at a business, which some or all need to be configured to read the billing storage device <b>125</b>. In another example, the customer has a family member living away from home (e.g., a son or daughter away at college), who will be provided a media payer <b>200</b> under the same account that can read the billing storage device <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of a content key assignment process, according to one embodiment. In one specific implementation, during the content key assignment process, the content keys associated with the secure content of content storage devices <b>150</b>, which were stored in key database <b>110</b>, are encrypted by the media preparation system <b>100</b> using the corresponding public keys (which, as described above, are stored in the associated billing storage device <b>125</b>). In one embodiment, the secure content of each content storage device <b>150</b> is associated with one content key that will decrypt the secure content of the content storage device <b>150</b>. In other words, in the case of movies for example, a movie title stored in a particular content storage device <b>150</b> is associated with one content key that will decrypt that specific movie title of the storage device <b>150</b> for exhibition to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one specific implementation, the content keys associated with the secure content of particular content storage device <b>150</b> may be encrypted and stored in an index storage device <b>175</b>. It is noted, however, that in other embodiments, the content keys may be stored in the corresponding billing content device <b>125</b> along with the public keys. As will be described below, additional information may be stored in the billing storage device <b>125</b> and/or in the index storage device <b>175</b>. In one embodiment, the index storage device <b>175</b> may be a CD. It is noted, however, that in other embodiments the index storage device <b>175</b> may be other secure physical media or computer readable storage media, such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, Flash Memory Cards, Hard Drive, USB Flash Drive, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for physical distribution of secure content to customers and physical collection of secure billing information (from the service provider side), according to one embodiment. The physical distribution of secure content and the physical collection of secure billing information are performed via physical deliver and without any electronic data transmission occurring to or from the physical location of the customer. It should be noted that in various embodiments, some of the steps shown may be performed concurrently, in a different order than shown, or omitted. Additional steps may also be performed as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4A</figref>, the service provider establishes an account for a particular customer (block <b>405</b>). The service provider may establish an account for the customer in response to receiving information from the customer, such as name, address, payment information, content preference information, etc. The payment information may be information associated with any payment method, such as credit card account or checking account information. The content preference information may be any customer content preferences, such as genre, era, actor, artist, and director preferences, and/or specific content titles.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After establishing the account, the service provider creates a billing storage device <b>125</b> and an index storage device <b>175</b>, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>. The service provider provides one or more content storage devices <b>150</b>, the billing storage device <b>125</b>, and the index storage device <b>175</b> to the customer via physical delivery (block <b>410</b>). As described above, each of the content storage devices <b>150</b> includes secure content, and the billing storage device <b>125</b> and index storage device <b>175</b> include decryption information which is used by a media player <b>200</b> of the customer for decrypting the secure content of the content storage devices <b>150</b> to exhibit the secure content to the customer. In some implementations, all the encryption/decryption information is stored in the billing storage device <b>125</b>, and therefore there is no need to create or distribution index storage device(s) <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The storage devices are provided to the customer via physical delivery and without any electronic data transmission occurring to or from the physical location of the customer (e.g., home or business). The physical delivery method employed may be any method for physically delivering goods, such as delivery by mail and delivery by courier. The service provider may physically deliver the storage devices from a centralized service center. To provide faster delivery, the service provider may deliver the storage devices from local or regional service centers, which are strategically located across the geographic service area. The service provider may also offer a customer pick-up/drop-off option at local service centers or local retail stores.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The service provider may provide a billing storage device <b>125</b> and an index storage device <b>175</b> once every billing period according to a predetermined billing cycle. In one embodiment, the predetermined billing cycle is a monthly billing cycle. It is noted, however, that the predetermined billing cycle may be various time periods, such as a bi-monthly billing cycle or a quarterly billing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As noted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the customer receives the one or more content storage devices <b>150</b>, the billing storage device <b>125</b>, and the index storage device <b>175</b> via physical deliver (block <b>415</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for physical distribution of secure content to customers and physical collection of secure billing information (from the customer side), according to one embodiment. It should be noted that in various embodiments, some of the steps shown may be performed concurrently, in a different order than shown, or omitted. Additional steps may also be performed as desired. As noted above, in some implementations, the customer may only receive one or more content storage devices <b>150</b> and a billing storage device <b>125</b> each billing period.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The customer may load a content storage device <b>150</b>, the billing storage device <b>125</b>, and the index storage device <b>175</b> into media player <b>200</b> (block <b>420</b>). The customer may, at any point in time during the current billing period, select one of the received content storage devices <b>150</b> and load the selected content storage device <b>150</b> into the media player <b>200</b>. Media player <b>200</b> uses the decryption information of the billing storage device <b>125</b> and of the index storage device <b>175</b> to decrypt the secure content of the selected content storage device <b>150</b> (block <b>425</b>). One implementation of the decryption process will be further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-13</figref>. After decrypting the secure content, media player <b>200</b> exhibits the secure content to the customer (block <b>430</b>). Specifically, the secure content is exhibited to the customer without any electronic data transmission occurring to or from the physical location of the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Media player <b>200</b> may subsequently store secure billing information associated with the exhibition of the secure content (block <b>435</b>). The secure billing information may include data indicating the number of times the secure content of each content storage device <b>150</b> was exhibited to the customer. In other words, this data may indicate the number of times content was rented. In the case of movies for example, the data may indicate how many times each movie title was exhibited to the user. The secure billing information may also include data indicating whether the customer purchased any of the secure content associated with the content storage devices <b>150</b>. If the customer purchases content (e.g., a movie title), the customer pays a one time fee for unlimited viewing of the content. The secure billing information may also include data indicating whether the customer selected any of the secure content for a rent-to-own program, or is currently participating in a rent-to-own program. In a rent-to-own program, the customer may obtain ownership of content and unlimited viewing privileges after renting the content a predetermined number of times.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The process of loading a content storage device <b>150</b>, decrypting the secure content, exhibiting the secure content, and storing the associated billing information may be repeated various times during the current billing period. However, when the end of the current billing period arrives (block <b>440</b>), the customer returns the billing storage device <b>125</b> to the service provider via physical delivery and without any electronic data transmission occurring to or from the physical location of the customer (block <b>445</b>). For example, the customer may return the billing storage device <b>125</b> to a local service center or retail store, a regional service center, or a centralized service center. In some implementations, the customer may have the option of returning the billing storage device <b>125</b> before the end of the current billing period, for example, if the customer wants to receive additional content storage devices <b>150</b> during the current billing period.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Even though the customer returns the billing storage device <b>125</b>, the customer may keep all the received content storage devices <b>150</b> to begin to build a library of secure content. The library of secure content may always be available for the customer whether they want to rent, buy, or participate in a rent-to-own program. The customer may keep or discard the index storage device <b>175</b>, since the customer will not only receive an updated billing storage device <b>125</b> in the next billing period, but also an updated index storage device <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the service provider receives the billing storage device <b>125</b> from the customer (block <b>450</b>). The service provider then processes the secure billing information contained in the billing storage device <b>125</b> (block <b>455</b>). The service provider may have processing capabilities in all of their local service centers and retail stores, and the regional service centers. In some cases, the service provider may have their processing facilities only in the regional service centers, or just in a centralized service center.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After processing the billing information, the service provider processes payment from the customer for the detected activity within the billing period (block <b>460</b>). For instance, as described above, the customer may be billed for rentals, purchases, and for participating in a rent-to-own program.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, for movie rentals, media player <b>200</b> may include a mechanism for detecting whether the customer watched all or just part of the movie associated with a content storage device <b>150</b>. Media player <b>200</b> may indicate in the billing information written to the billing storage device <b>125</b> whether the customer watched all or just part of the movie. In one embodiment, the service provider may bill the customer on a pro-rated basis depending on the percentage of the movie the customer watched. In other embodiments, the service provider may bill the customer the full rental fee even if the customer just watched part of the movie. In one embodiment, the customer is charged a rental fee each time the movie is exhibited to the customer. In other embodiments, each time a customer rents a movie, the customer may watch the movie as many times as desired within a predetermined amount of time, e.g., 12 hours or 24 hours, without being charged another rental fee. It is noted that these billing options may also be applied to other types of content besides movies.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For purchases, media player <b>200</b> may store identification information which identifies certain content as purchased content, so the activity with respect to that particular content (outside of the initial purchase transaction) will not be noted in the billing information that is written to the billing storage device <b>125</b>. In other embodiments, the activity with respect to purchased content is noted in the billing storage device <b>125</b>, however, the processing center maintains records of purchase activity for each customer and does not bill the customer for activity if the customer previously purchased the content. For a rent-to-own program, the customer may obtain ownership of particular content after renting the content a predetermined number of times, e.g., when the total rental fees for the content total approximately one and a half times or two times the typical cost of the content. It is noted, however, that in other embodiments the rental, purchase, and rent-to-own program, and the billing associated with the programs, may be modified as desired. For instance, in some embodiments, the customer may be automatically enrolled in a rent-to-own program each time the customer rents some content.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">After billing the customer, the process may repeat. That is, the service provider may send one or more additional content storage devices <b>150</b>, an updated billing storage device <b>125</b>, and an updated index storage device <b>175</b> to the customer via physical deliver (block <b>405</b>). The content storage devices <b>150</b> may be selected based on user preferences associated with the account. It is noted, however, that certain content may be sent to the customer for other reasons, e.g., for advertisement and promotion purposes, for market testing, and based on general popularity of newly released content. The updated billing storage device <b>125</b> and the updated index storage device <b>175</b> include encryption/decryption information (and other supporting information) for the content that is provided to the customer in the current billing period, as well as for the content that was previously provided to the customer in previous billing periods. As described above, in some embodiments, only the billing storage device <b>125</b> is used by the service provider (and not the index storage device <b>175</b>), and therefore only an updated billing storage device <b>125</b> is provided to the customer each billing period.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In various embodiments, since the information on the billing storage device <b>125</b> is tethered to a specific player of a specific customer (or in some cases, multiple players of the same customer), the billing storage device <b>125</b> may include additional information that is personalized for each customer. For instance, the billing storage device <b>125</b> may include personalized advertisements, which could be exhibited to the user via media player <b>200</b>. The advertisements included in a particular billing storage device <b>125</b> may be selected based on the customer's past behavior, billing history, selected user preferences, etc. Loyalty rewards or incentives could also be written into the billing storage device <b>125</b> based on this information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Furthermore, to deal with specific release dates for films (or other content), the billing storage device <b>125</b> may also contain time zone settings so that media player <b>200</b> will know when to unlock or release films that might only be available for viewing starting at a certain future date. For example, a film may be included in a content storage device <b>150</b> and sent to the customer before the official release date. However, the time zone and unlock information on the accompanying billing storage device <b>125</b> will prevent the customer from viewing the content until a specified future date, i.e., the official release date. The stored time zone settings (based on the customer's billing address) will allow the key for the film, which is used to unlock the content, to be released at exactly midnight the release date. With this method, a film can be released exactly on the release date, regardless of a customer's time zone. It is noted that this personalized information, i.e., personalized advertisements, loyalty rewards/incentives, and time zone settings and unlock information for content release dates, may also be included within the index storage device <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of media player <b>200</b>. Media player <b>200</b> includes a memory unit <b>210</b>, a processing unit <b>220</b>, and a storage device receiving mechanism <b>230</b>. Media player <b>200</b> may also include various other components and features (not shown) that are typical of media players, such as one or more power converters, an LED display, rewind/fast forward/stop/play/power/eject buttons, stereo system and television connectors, etc. Media player <b>200</b> may be a stand-alone system, or may be one of a plurality of devices of a system, such as a personal computer system or an automobile computer system, among others. Media player <b>200</b> is connectable to a display device for exhibiting secure content to the customer. For example, media player <b>200</b> may be connected to a television, or to computer monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated, memory unit <b>210</b> includes private key encryption engine <b>212</b> and public key decryption engine <b>214</b>, and processing unit <b>220</b> includes key decryption engine <b>222</b> and private key encryption engine <b>224</b>, for encrypting/decrypting information associated with the exhibition of secure content, as will be further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-13</figref>. In one embodiment, memory unit <b>210</b> may be secure flash memory, although other embodiments are contemplated which may include other types of memory, e.g., SDRAM or hard disk drive. Processing unit <b>220</b> may be a video digital signal processor (DSP) unit. It is noted, however, that in other embodiments processing unit <b>220</b> may be other types of processing devices, e.g., a processor in the x86 family of processors.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Storage device receiving mechanism <b>230</b> is a mechanism that is configured to receive one or more content storage devices <b>150</b>, the billing storage device <b>125</b>, and the index storage device <b>175</b>. Receiving mechanism <b>230</b> may include a single receiving slot or tray, which opens to accept all the storage devices. In other embodiments, receiving mechanism <b>230</b> includes three separate receiving slots or trays, which can be separately opened by the customer. For example, a first receiving slot may receive one or more content storage devices <b>150</b>, a second receiving slot may receive the billing storage device <b>125</b>, and a third receiving slot may receive the index storage device <b>175</b>. When the customer loads the pertinent storage devices, the receiving mechanism <b>230</b> may accept the storage devices and load the storage devices inside media player <b>200</b> for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In various embodiments, memory unit <b>210</b> of media player <b>200</b> may include program instructions, which are executable by processing unit <b>220</b> to obtain the encryption/decryption information from the received billing storage device <b>125</b>, decrypt the secure content of a received content storage device <b>150</b> using the decryption information, exhibit the secure content to the customer, and write secure billing information to a writeable area of the received billing storage device <b>125</b>. The secure billing information written into the received billing storage device <b>125</b> is information with the exhibition of the secure content to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be noted that the components described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are meant to be exemplary only, and are not intended to limit the invention to any specific set of components or configurations. For example, in various embodiments, one or more of the components described may be omitted, combined, modified, or additional components included, as desired. For instance, in some embodiments, media player <b>200</b> may include multiple memory units and/or processing units.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-13</figref> illustrate a process by which media player <b>200</b> decrypts the secure content of content storage device <b>150</b> to exhibit the content to the customer, according to one embodiment. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the storage devices are loaded into media player <b>200</b>, media player <b>200</b> may read a tethered public key from the billing storage device <b>125</b> and decrypt it to enable the contents of the billing storage device <b>125</b> to be accessed. In one embodiment, the billing storage device <b>125</b> may be tethered to a single media player <b>200</b> (or a predetermined number of media players <b>200</b>) utilizing public/private encryption methodologies. It is noted, however, that in other embodiments other encryption methodologies may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Once the contents of the billing storage device <b>125</b> are accessible to the media player <b>200</b>, the media player <b>200</b> may read the public key necessary to access the contents of the index storage device <b>175</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Media player <b>200</b> may then use the public key obtained from the billing storage device <b>125</b> to access the contents of the index storage device <b>175</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). For example, based on instruction from the customer, media player <b>200</b> may access content information, such as pricing, content descriptions, content trailers, and other associated information.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the customer selects and loads a content storage device <b>150</b> into media player <b>200</b> for playback, media player <b>200</b> utilizes a public key obtained from the billing storage device <b>125</b> to access a content key associated with the selected content from the index storage device <b>175</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternately, as described above, in other embodiments, the billing storage device <b>125</b> may contain the content keys associated with the content storage devices <b>150</b> (since in some implantations the index storage device <b>175</b> may not be used). In these embodiments, each content key may be tethered to media player <b>200</b> utilizing a public key that is unique to media player <b>200</b> (i.e., matching public/private keys). In one specific implementation, since the billing storage device <b>125</b> may contain a recordable surface, unique content keys that are encrypted with a public key that is tied to a media player <b>200</b> may be written in the recordable area of the billing storage device <b>125</b>. With many different unique private keys available on each media player <b>200</b>, the billing storage device <b>125</b> may be encrypted uniquely for each media player <b>200</b> every billing period with a different public/private key scheme. In one embodiment, the entire set of keys for the library of content associated with the customer may be tethered each billing period.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some cases, the index storage device <b>175</b> may be a ROM-based media. In one specific implementation, it may not be commercially feasible to make the index storage devices <b>175</b> unique down to the player level. Therefore, in this specific implementation, all keys on the index storage devices <b>175</b> may be encrypted using a public key that is known to all or some significant number of media players <b>200</b>. The security risks or concerns associated with this technique may be mitigated by encrypting the non-unique public key for the index storage devices <b>175</b> with a unique public key on the billing storage device <b>125</b> tethered to the pertinent media player <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref> illustrates a process for using the public/private keys to securely transfer secure data, e.g., a content key, from one internal player component, such as memory unit <b>210</b>, to another, such as processing unit <b>220</b>. The content key that is securely transferred may be the content key that was obtained from the index storage device <b>175</b> (or from the billing storage device <b>125</b>), as was described above. This process may be necessary in some implementations where the processing unit <b>220</b> requires access to the content keys.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, media player <b>200</b> may first access a tethered public key from the billing storage device <b>125</b>. Then, processing unit <b>220</b> may create a random key (e.g., a random large bit key) and encrypt the random key with the public key obtained from the billing storage device <b>125</b>, before sending it to memory unit <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Memory unit <b>210</b> may decrypt and utilize the random key obtained from processing unit <b>220</b> to encrypt the content key, and send the encrypted content key to processing unit <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Once the encrypted content key is stored in processing unit <b>220</b>, processing unit <b>220</b> may utilize the random key to decrypt the received content key (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). It is noted, however, that in other implementations, the content key may be moved from memory unit <b>210</b> to memory unit <b>220</b> by other methods.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After decrypting the content key, media player <b>200</b> may read the secure content from the content storage device <b>150</b> and decrypt the content using the content key to exhibit the content to the customer (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). As was previously described above, after the exhibition of the content, billing information is securely written to the billing storage device <b>125</b>. In one embodiment, the billing information may also be written to memory unit <b>210</b> of media player <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). At the end of a billing period, the billing storage device <b>125</b> is physically delivered to a local, regional, or central location, and the updated billing storage device <b>125</b> and the updated index storage device <b>175</b> are then physically delivered to the customer (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The customer may then load the updated billing storage device <b>125</b> and the updated index storage device <b>175</b> into media player <b>200</b> and the process may start all over again (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Based on the method and apparatus described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref>, the consumer may be able to have a secure, on-demand experience with respect to accessing content, such as movies, and at the same time, not require electronic data transmission into or out of the physical location of the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various other embodiments, additional methods may be employed to accomplish a secure physical billing. For instance, in one embodiment, media player <b>200</b> may generate a paper printout of a secure billing code that contains the necessary encoded information required for billing purposes. The resulting printout may then be physically delivered to a service center. In another example, media player <b>200</b> may generate a viewable billing code on a display area of media player <b>200</b> or on the content display (e.g., a television), or media player <b>200</b> may generate an audible playback of the billing code. The billing code contains the necessary encoded information required for billing purposes. The user then simply records the code and physically delivers it to a service center.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although the embodiments above have been described in considerable detail, numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated. It is intended that the following claims be interpreted to embrace all such variations and modifications.</p>
