<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The described technology relates generally to an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, and more particularly, to an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display to which a thin film encapsulation (TFE) technology is applied and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An organic light emitting diode (OLED) display is a self light emitting display that is provided with an organic light emitting diode that emits light to display an image. An organic light emitting diode may deteriorate due to penetration of external moisture, oxygen and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary embodiment provides an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display that includes a first substrate, a display portion on the first substrate and including a driving circuit portion and an organic light emitting diode, a thin film encapsulation layer that covers the display portion, an adhesive layer that covers an upper surface and a side of the thin film encapsulation layer, an absorption functional layer on the adhesive layer, the absorption functional layer absorbing at least one of oxygen and moisture, and a second substrate on the absorption functional layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first substrate and the second substrate may be made of a flexible polymer film. The first substrate may be a transparent polymer film. The organic light emitting diode (OLED) display may further include a barrier layer between the first substrate and the display portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The absorption functional layer may include at least one of a metal and a metal oxide. The absorption functional layer may be formed on one side of the second substrate by sputtering. The absorption functional layer may include at least one of titanium, titanium alloy, titanium oxide, potassium, potassium oxide, magnesium, magnesium oxide, barium and barium oxide. The absorption functional layer may have a smaller area than the adhesive layer. The adhesive layer may cover the side of the absorption functional layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The organic light emitting diode (OLED) display may further include an insulation pattern layer between the absorption functional layer and the second substrate. The insulation pattern layer may include at least one opening at a portion of the insulation pattern layer that is adjacent to the edge of the second substrate. The absorption functional layer may contact the second substrate through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another exemplary embodiment provides a method for manufacturing an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display that includes forming a first substrate on a first support plate, sequentially forming a display portion that includes a driving circuit portion and an organic light emitting diode and a thin film encapsulation layer that covers the display portion on the first substrate, forming a second substrate on a second support plate, sequentially forming an absorption functional layer and an adhesive layer on the second substrate, aligning and disposing the first support plate and the second support plate so that the adhesive layer and the thin film encapsulation layer face each other, attaching the first support plate and the second support plate to each other so that the adhesive layer contacts the thin film encapsulation layer, and separating the first support plate from the first substrate and separating the second support plate from the second substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first substrate may be formed by coating a polymer resin on the first support plate, and the second substrate may be formed by coating a polymer resin on the second support plate. The method for manufacturing an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display may further include forming a barrier layer on the first substrate before forming the display portion on the first substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The absorption functional layer may include at least one of a metal and a metal oxide, and may be formed on the second substrate by sputtering. The absorption functional layer may include at least one of titanium, titanium alloy, titanium oxide, potassium, potassium oxide, magnesium, magnesium oxide, barium and barium oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The adhesive layer may have a larger area than the absorption functional layer and may cover an upper portion and a side of the absorption functional layer. The adhesive layer may be larger than the thin film encapsulation layer and may cover an upper portion and a side of the thin film encapsulation layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method for manufacturing an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display may further include forming an insulation pattern layer on the second substrate before forming the absorption functional layer on the second substrate. The insulation pattern layer may include at least one opening at a portion of the insulation pattern layer that is adjacent to the edge of the second substrate, and the absorption functional layer may contact the second substrate through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the exemplary embodiments, the organic light emitting diode (OLED) display may minimize an increase of dead space and improve a sealing function of the driving circuit portion and the organic light emitting diode by using the thin film encapsulation layer and adhesive layer and absorption functional layer. As a result, a use life-span may be increased and a deterioration of the organic light emitting diode may be minimized.</p>

Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the drawing figures, the dimensions of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity of illustration. It will also be understood that when a layer or element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d; another layer or substrate, it can be directly on the other layer or substrate, or intervening layers may also be present. Further, it will be understood that when a layer is referred to as being &#x201c;under&#x201d; another layer, it can be directly under, and one or more intervening layers may also be present. In addition, it will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being &#x201c;between&#x201d; two layers, it can be the only layer between the two layers, or one or more intervening layers may also be present.

According to a thin film encapsulation technology, a display area of a substrate may be covered by a thin film encapsulation layer by alternately layering one or more layers of the inorganic and organic layers on the organic light emitting diodes. The thin film encapsulation layer may provide a slim organic light emitting diode (OLED) display that includes an ultra thin substrate and a flexible organic light emitting diode (OLED) display that includes a flexible film substrate.</p>

The embodiments may further avoid an increase in dead space (that is, a region in which a display is not implemented) due to an increase in the width of the thin film encapsulation layer outside the display area in an effort to increase the sealing performance and hence to increase the storage life-span.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">While this disclosure has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be practical exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
