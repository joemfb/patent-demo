No. 8,306,148 on Nov. 6, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/116,533, filed Nov. 20, 2008, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to digital video broadcasting (DVB). More specifically, the present invention relates to reducing Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in multi-carrier modulation based DVB systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As known to those of skill in the art, DVB is the European consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of digital terrestrial television. DVB systems transmit a compressed digital audio/video stream, using multi-carrier modulation, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Another popular method of transmitting signals is digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T). When broadcasters employ this method, the transmitted signals do not travel via cable. Instead, they move from aerial antenna to aerial antenna, and from a signal blaster to home receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DVB-T broadcasters transmit data using a compressed digital audio-video stream, with the entire process based on a Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG)-2 standard. These transmissions may include all kinds of digital broadcasting, including high definition television (HDTV) and other high-intensity methods. This is an improvement over the old analog signals, which required separate streams of transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Impulse noise is a growing concern in DVB-T transmissions because of its negative impact upon transmitted digital data and is common in OFDM based systems. Although OFDM based DVB-T system receivers provide a level of inherent immunity against impulse noise, this immunity is insufficient to ensure that digital TV signals are reliably transmitted in accordance with applicable standards. As an example, OFDM systems include data that is transmitted on multiple carriers simultaneously. In real life, when data is transmitted, it is passed through a data channel. This data channel subsequently manifests itself as a multiplicative impairment (e.g., impulse noise) on one of more of these carriers when they are received on a receiver side.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While impulse noise has traditionally been ignored in North American TV receiver market, several standards/specifications in the European market require high tolerance to impulse noise. Another troublesome aspect of OFDM systems is PAPR, which impacts the presence and effects of impulse noise. By reducing PAPR, the effects of impulse noise may correspondingly be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some of the traditional techniques for reducing PAPR in OFDM systems include, by way of example, tone reservation, tone injection, or adaptive constellation extension. Each of these techniques is well understood by those of skill in the relevant art and will not be discussed in depth herein. All of these techniques, however, cause either a loss in data rate or an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for reception. These techniques, therefore, have only limited utility.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To assist a receiver in overcoming multi-path distortion, pilot signals with known data patterns are transmitted. The pilot signals, sometimes called pilot tones or simply pilots, are used to support channel estimation operations. Traditional channel estimation operations attempt to estimate the amplitude and phase distortion introduced by the communications channel and may thus compensate for the SNR losses discussed above. Although more effective than many of the other techniques, channel estimation operations are not precise enough to completely compensate for all SNR losses.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What is needed, therefore, are improved methods and systems for reducing PAPR OFDM based DVB-T system receivers that may compensate for corresponding losses in SNR.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Consistent with the principles of the present invention as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention includes a method for performing channel estimation in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) signal. The method includes performing the channel estimation based upon use of reserved tone channel carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present invention provide reductions in PAPR comparable to the traditional techniques above. In the embodiments of the present invention, however, SNR losses are compensated for by improving the precision of the channel estimation process.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">By way of example, OFDM systems work by splitting a wide-band digital signal into a large number of slower digital streams and then transmitting all of the streams on a set of closely spaced adjacent carrier frequencies (i.e., tones). Each of the streams includes different types of tones. For example, a typical stream (e.g., symbol) might include data carriers, reserved tones, continuous pilots, and scattered pilots. As understood by those of skill in the art, some of these tones may be reserved for PAPR reduction. Once the data carriers are filled with data, appropriate values of the extra data (i.e., channel estimation data) are inserted into the reserved carriers to decrease the PAPR of the time domain signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention parameterizes an allowable set of values for the reserved tones. Typical parameterizations include values from a linear feedback shift register, or a finite number of known quantized values. The transmitter finds the best signal from the parameterized set of values for PAPR reduction, during an initialization process, and then signals the chosen parameters (possibly in a robust channel). The receiver then decodes the parameters and uses the reserved tones as additional pilots to improve channel estimation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some PAPR reduction is typically lost because the search space for data values for the reserved tones is reduced. However, given the more accurate channel estimation operations of the present invention, additional known techniques such as the Adaptive Constellation Extension (ACE) may be applied to gain further reductions. The process of computing the final reserved tone values may be arrived at via an iterative technique that includes multiple PAPR reduction techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A method for performing channel estimation in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal includes choosing reserved tones to be part of a pilot pattern, and using the reserved tones in the pilot pattern to perform the channel estimation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An apparatus for use in performing channel estimation in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system includes a receiver, a pilot symbol extractor, and a channel estimator. The receiver is configured to receive a transmitted OFDM signal. The pilot symbol extractor is configured to extract pilot symbols from the OFDM signal. The channel estimator is configured to perform the channel estimation, including using reserved tones as pilot tones.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium stores a set of instructions for execution by a general purpose computer to perform a method for providing channel estimation in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The set of instructions includes a choosing code segment for choosing reserved tones to be part of a pilot pattern, and a using code segment for using the reserved tones in the pilot pattern to perform the channel estimation.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing constructions of transmission/reception terminals of a conventional OFDM mobile communication system. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a mobile communication system using OFDM scheme includes a transmission terminal <b>100</b> and a reception terminal <b>150</b>. The transmission terminal <b>100</b> includes a data transmitter <b>102</b>, a coder <b>104</b>, a symbol mapper <b>106</b>, a serial to parallel (S/P) converter <b>108</b>, a pilot symbol inserter <b>110</b>, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) unit <b>112</b>, a parallel to serial (P/S) converter <b>114</b>, a guard interval inserter <b>116</b>, a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter <b>118</b>, and a radio frequency (RF) processor <b>120</b>.</p>

The guard interval inserter <b>116</b> receives the signals outputted from the P/S converter <b>114</b>, inserts guard intervals into the received signals, and then outputs them to the D/A converter <b>118</b>. Here, the inserted guard interval prevents interference between OFDM symbols transmitted in the OFDM communication system; that is to say, the inserted guard interval prevents interference between a previous OFDM symbol transmitted during a previous OFDM symbol period and a current OFDM symbol to be transmitted during a current OFDM symbol period.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In inserting the guard interval, a method of inserting null data has been proposed. However, insertion of null data as a guard interval may cause a receiver to erroneously estimate a start point of an OFDM symbol, thereby allowing interference between sub-carriers, which increases the probability of erroneous determination of the starting point for received OFDM symbols. Therefore, a cyclic prefix method or a cyclic postfix method is usually used in inserting the guard interval. In the cyclic prefix method, a predetermined number of last bits of an OFDM symbol are copied and inserted into an OFDM symbol. In the cyclic postfix method, a predetermined number of initial bits of an OFDM symbol are copied and inserted into an OFDM symbol.</p>

The RF processor <b>120</b> includes a filter and a front end unit. The RF processor <b>120</b> receives the signals from the D/A converter <b>118</b>, RF-processes the signals, and then transmits the signals over the air through a transmit antenna. Hereinafter, the reception terminal <b>150</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The reception terminal <b>150</b> includes an RF processor <b>152</b>, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>154</b>, a guard interval remover <b>156</b>, a S/P converter <b>158</b>, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) unit <b>160</b>, a pilot symbol extractor <b>162</b>, a channel estimator <b>164</b>, an equalizer <b>166</b>, a P/S converter <b>168</b>, a symbol demapper <b>170</b>, a decoder <b>172</b>, and a data receiver <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The signals transmitted from the transmission terminal <b>100</b> pass through multi-path channels and are received by a receive antenna of the reception terminal <b>150</b> in a state in which noise is included in the signals. The signals received through the receive antenna are inputted to the RF processor <b>152</b>, and the RF processor <b>152</b> down-converts the received signals into signals of an intermediate frequency (IF) band, and then outputs the IF signals to the A/D converter <b>154</b>. The A/D converter <b>154</b> converts the analog signals outputted from the RF processor <b>152</b> into digital signals and then outputs the digital signals to the guard interval remover <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The guard interval remover <b>156</b> receives the digital signals converted by and outputted from the A/D converter <b>154</b>, eliminates guard intervals from the digital signals, and then outputs them to the S/P converter <b>158</b>. The S/P converter <b>158</b> receives the serial signals outputted from the guard interval remover <b>156</b>, converts the serial signals into parallel signals, and then outputs the parallel signals to the FFT unit <b>160</b>. The FFT unit <b>160</b> performs N-point FFT on the signals outputted from the P/S converter <b>158</b>, and then outputs them to both the equalizer <b>166</b> and the pilot symbol extractor <b>162</b>.

The P/S converter <b>168</b> receives the parallel signals outputted from the equalizer <b>166</b>, converts the parallel signals into serial signals, and then outputs the converted serial signals to the symbol demapper <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As indicated, the signals outputted from the FFT unit <b>160</b> are also inputted to the pilot symbol extractor <b>162</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The symbol demapper <b>170</b> receives the signals outputted from the P/S converter <b>168</b>, demodulates the signals according to a demodulation scheme corresponding to the modulation scheme of the transmission terminal <b>100</b>, and then outputs the demodulated signals to the decoder <b>172</b>. The decoder <b>172</b> decodes the signals from the symbol demapper <b>170</b> according to a decoding scheme corresponding to the coding scheme of the transmission terminal <b>100</b> and outputs the decoded signals to the data receiver <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In OFDM systems, data is transmitted and received via multiple carrier frequencies. In some OFDM systems, for example, there may be approximately 128 independent OFDM sub-carriers (i.e., tones) that occupy approximately 528 megahertz of bandwidth. In these systems, data is modulated and transmitted via many of these sub-carriers. Approximately 10 of the sub-carriers do not necessarily carry information. These sub-carriers, also referred to as pilot tones, may be used to guard the information carrying sub-carriers, to simplify the filtering requirements of the system, or to provide reference phase/amplitude information for the demodulator. The positions of the pilot tones may be defined according to the communication standard or defined by the user/designer of the system. Some pilot tones are located on two ends of the frequency spectrum and some of the pilot tones are interspersed within the frequency spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For each transmitted carrier signal, an OFDM receiver normally attempts to compensate for the distortion induced by the transmission channel. This will normally involve a channel estimation operation and a channel compensation operation. To assist a receiver in overcoming multipath distortion, pilot signals with known data patterns are transmitted. The pilot signals, sometimes called pilot tones or simply pilots, are used to support channel estimation operations. Such channel estimation operations normally attempt to estimate the amplitude and phase distortion introduced by the communications channel.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pattern structure of the pilots may be in essentially any manner, provided that the Nyquist sampling criteria for the communication channel's impulse response and rate of change are satisfied. The number of pilots transmitted is often a function of the expected multipath distortion delay and the anticipated rate of change in channel conditions. However, for purposes of efficiency, it is desirable to minimize the number of pilots transmitted since the transmission of a pilot precludes the transmission of data in the transmission slot used to transmit the pilot.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">DVB-T OFDM systems often use their pilot tones for the purpose of making channel estimation easier. However, the sparseness of these tones renders it difficult to estimate the channel quickly and with efficient memory usage and calculations.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Channel estimation is an important and necessary function for modern wireless receivers. With even a limited knowledge of the wireless channel properties, a receiver may gain insight into the information that was sent by the transmitter. The goal of channel estimation is to measure the effects of the channel on known, or partially known transmissions. A channel will change with changing conditions and topology. OFDM systems are especially suited for channel estimation. The subcarriers are closely spaced and the system is generally used in high speed applications that are capable of computing channel estimates with minimal delay. Subcarriers that are sent with a known power and make-up are called pilots and are used for synchronization. As noted above, the present invention provides a unique and novel approach to accomplishing channel estimation.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">More specifically, the present invention provides enhancements to known channel estimation techniques, such as tone reservation. In tone reservation, for example, carriers are reserved and populated with arbitrary values in order to decrease the PAPR.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention, on the other hand, is illustrated in the following example. Assume that non-arbitrary values may be chosen for carriers that are known. That is, for example, in a given symbol, carriers <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>10</b> are available and instead of using arbitrary values for each of these carriers may take five values (e.g., &#x2212;2, &#x2212;1, 0, 1, and 2). Thus, there are 125 choices (i.e., 5<sup>3</sup>). Assume that each of the 125 choices includes sufficient granularity such that the PAPR could be decreased by an amount comparable to PAPR reduction using the arbitrary values, noted above. In this scenario, the PAPR could be reduced almost as much as it could by using the arbitrary values. By using small sets of non-arbitrary values, however, the receiver has more information with which to perform channel estimates and equalization. The ability to provide this information to the receiver enables these carriers to be used as pilots. Traditionally, only dedicated pilots could be used to provide channel estimates. The present invention enables additional, non-pilot channel carriers, to be used to provide the channel estimates.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graphical illustration of a pilot pattern sequence <b>200</b> formulated in accordance with known channel estimation techniques. The pilot pattern sequence <b>200</b> includes a symbol group <b>202</b> of nine OFDM symbols arranged along a Y axis <b>204</b>. The Y axis <b>204</b>, for example, may be in gradations of 200 microseconds (&#x3bc;s) up to 1 millisecond. The fidelity of these gradations is dependent upon the total duration of each of the OFDM symbols. The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also includes an X axis <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each of the symbols within the symbol group <b>202</b> includes different carrier types comprising data carriers (d<sub>i,j</sub>), continuous pilots (c<sub>i,j</sub>), scattered pilots (s<sub>i,j</sub>), and reserved tones (r<sub>i,j</sub>). The reserved tones (r<sub>i,j</sub>) are generally unused. Although the pilot sequence <b>200</b> is representative of a sequence configured for use in a DVB-T2 system, it may apply to any OFDM system.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first element in the carrier type subscript (e.g. d<sub>i,j</sub>) represents a carrier index. The second element of the subscript represents a time index. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a first OFDM symbol <b>207</b>, occurring at time <b>0</b> includes a continuous pilot c<sub>0,0</sub>, a data carrier d<sub>1,0</sub>, a data carrier d<sub>2,0</sub>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an OFDM symbol, the data carriers are representative of actual transmitted data. The continuous pilots and the scattered pilots are provided to be able to perform channel estimation. For the symbol <b>207</b>, the continuous pilots are c<sub>0,0 </sub>and c<sub>15,0</sub>. The symbol <b>207</b> also includes a scattered pilot s<sub>12,0</sub>. The notion of why two different types of pilots are used is well understood by those of skill in the art and will not be discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Focusing on other aspects of pilots signals, most OFDM systems include the concept of having pilots that are not located within any particular system. For example, in the symbol group <b>202</b>, all of the continuous pilots have a carrier index identical to other carrier pilots, meaning they are in vertical columns with other continuous pilots. For example, there are continuous pilots at carrier index &#x201c;0&#x201d; and carrier index &#x201c;15.&#x201d; The fact that the continuous pilots are all in vertical columns together means that the pilot location stays the same, across different symbols. That is, if carrier <b>0</b> is a pilot in symbol <b>0</b> (i.e., symbol <b>207</b>), then carrier <b>0</b> is also a pilot in a symbol <b>208</b>, carrier <b>0</b> is also a pilot in symbol <b>210</b>, etc. This process is typical of DVB-T systems and wireless local area network (LAN) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The problem, however, with pilot configurations such as the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the density of the continuous pilots is typically insufficient to adequately perform channel estimation. To compensate for this lack of continuous pilot density, roving or &#x201c;scattered&#x201d; pilots are provided to augment the channel estimation capability of the continuous pilots. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as discussed above, in the symbol <b>207</b> the scattered pilot is denoted as s<sub>12,0</sub>. The symbol <b>208</b> includes a scattered pilot s<sub>9,1</sub>, etc. These are the typical types of pilots that may be found in conventional OFDM systems.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graphical illustration <b>300</b> of a single symbol sequence, prior to choosing reserved tone values, according to known channel estimation techniques. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of the single symbol <b>207</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and is representative of a single symbol occurring at time index &#x201c;0.&#x201d; In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the &#x201c;0s&#x201d; have been removed from the time index column for purposes of simplification.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">By way of background, before reserved tones, such as the reserved tones (r<sub>i,j</sub>), are assigned proper non-zero values, the data carriers (d<sub>i,j</sub>), the continuous pilots (c<sub>i,j</sub>), and the scattered pilots (s<sub>i,j</sub>j) are assigned specific values first. After this assignment, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) <b>302</b> is applied to the values assigned to the data carriers, the continuous pilots, and the scattered pilots to create a time domain signal <b>304</b>. This newly computed time domain signal <b>304</b>, for example, might potentially have a high PAPR. If the time domain signal <b>304</b> has a high PAPR and if there are no reserved tones, the continuous pilots (c<sub>i,j</sub>), and the scattered pilots (s<sub>i,j</sub>) could be used to perform the channel estimation to decode (and record) the data embedded within the data carriers (d<sub>i,j</sub>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, values for the reserved tones (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) are chosen as zero.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graphical illustration <b>400</b> of the single symbol <b>207</b> before choosing reserved tone values according to known channel estimation techniques. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, arbitrary values for the reserved tones (r<sub>i,j</sub>) are selected. By way of example, using methods well understood by those of skill in the art, arbitrary non-zero complex values for the reserved tones (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) may be selected. Methods for reserve tone determination and selection are provided, for example, in a Thesis by J. Tellado, Peak to average power reduction for multicarrier modulation, Ph.D. dissertation, Stanford, Calif.: Stanford Univ., 2000. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the values for (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) are zero.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, these reserve tone values, although arbitrary, are chosen to be non-zero values. More specifically, the non-zero values are chosen such that when an FFT <b>402</b> is applied thereto, a minimum PAPR may be achieved since the continuous pilots (c<sub>i,j</sub>), the scattered pilots (s<sub>i,j</sub>) and the data carriers (d<sub>i,j</sub>) are fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Before application of reserved tones, all carriers must have some value. Since the maximum transmit power is limited by regulation, if no carrier is used, its value is set to 0 so that the useful carriers may be transmitted at higher power. For the purposes of the present invention, however, these values may be selected randomly. This random selection would cause, with very high probability, the equivalent time domain signal to have high PAPR.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In embodiments of the present invention, instead of choosing the reserved tone values (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) as arbitrary values, they are chosen to be part of a pilot pattern from some limited set, which is from a subset of reserved carrier pilots. In the present invention, the reserved tone values are not the same as the arbitrary values from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Instead, the reserved tone values (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) are chosen to be close enough to the reserved tone values from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> such that the resulting signal has a low PAPR. As a result of this value selection process, the reserved tones (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) may be used as pilots to assist and improve the channel estimation process. This process is illustrated more clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> below.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In accordance with known methods, such as those highlighted in the thesis noted above, reserved tone values may be determined. All of these values may be determined ahead of time. They may also, however, be determined dynamically during an iterative process that commences during receiver initialization. Generally, all these methods use a projection of signal peaks onto the reserved tones to produce a reduction signal. This reduction signal is then used for peak-canceling purposes in order to lower the PAPR of the OFDM transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a first method, the first k reserved tones are allowed to be any of the elements from a known large set such as {a+ib, a is a multiple of 0.08 and so is b}. The later reserved tones are produced by filtering the previous tones with a known filter. In this scenario, the receiver would estimate the first k reserved tones using traditional methods and the rest would follow from them. Allowing for 64 different filters (requiring only 6 bits of signaling), allowing a and b to be between &#x2212;2 and +2, and allowing k to be a small number (e.g., 15), numerous possible tone patterns may provide substantial PAPR reductions.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A second method for choosing reserved tone values is essentially the same as the first method above. In the second method, however, a and b are generated using linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs). Numerous other well known techniques for choosing reserve tone values are available.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graphical illustration <b>500</b> of the single symbol sequence <b>207</b> after choosing reserved tone values from known pattern subsets, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, in order to decrease the PAPR, the reserved tones (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>), which have similar characteristics to continuous pilots (c<sub>0</sub>, and c<sub>15</sub>) and scattered pilot s<sub>12</sub>, are used to assist in enhanced channel estimation. Although specifically dedicated reserve tones are used in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, scattered pilots could be used instead of reserved tones.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the value of reserved tones (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>) may be determined using one of the methods noted above. More specifically, reserved tone values for (r<sub>5</sub>) and (r<sub>19</sub>), shown as (r&#x2032;<sub>5</sub>) and (r&#x2032;<sub>19</sub>) respectively, are chosen to be non-zero and non-arbitrary. An FFT <b>502</b> is applied to the values (r&#x2032;<sub>5</sub>) and (r&#x2032;<sub>19</sub>) to produce a low, but not necessarily a minimum, PAPR <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present invention includes embodiments that transmit known values to an OFDM receiver using reserved tones to provide more precise channel estimation. Middle values, chosen for the reserved tones, may be added or subtracted in accordance with the technique illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for all of the carriers. Middle values are those values that may be constrained (i.e., adding or subtracting other values) in different ways that will not adversely affect the PAPR reduction. These values may be constrained in some way, as represented by constraint sets A<b>5</b> and A<b>19</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and are derived from a finite set. In this manner, the OFDM receiver has additional information that may be used to provide more accurate channel estimates, or decode or de-map the actual transmitted value more accurately. This process may also be used for tone injection.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiments discussed above, the use of middle values allows various techniques to be used to decrease the PAPR while simultaneously permitting reserved tone carriers, for example, r&#x2032;<sub>5 </sub>and r&#x2032;<sub>19</sub>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to be used as pilot tones. If arbitrary complex values are used for the reserved tone carriers, higher PAPR reduction values may be achieved. However, it is possible to use sub-optimal, albeit acceptable, values for PAPR reduction, where there may be two or three possible constraint set solutions. For example, if three pilot carriers are used, middle values could be chosen such as 1, &#x2212;1, and 2. Many other combinations of middle values may be chosen. So with these middle values, sequences may be used that will not adversely affect the PAPR reduction capabilities, but would fit within the constraint sets A<b>5</b> and A<b>19</b> (i.e., the set of values actually permitted), associated with r&#x2032;<sub>5 </sub>and r&#x2032;.<sub>19</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exemplary flowchart <b>600</b> of a method of practicing an embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, the method <b>600</b> includes a method for decreasing PAPR for a multicarrier modulation signal including two or more groups of carriers. In a step <b>602</b> during a first timeframe, non-zero values are assigned for carrier types within a first of the two or more groups. Additionally, zero values are assigned for carrier types within a second of the two or more groups after assigning the non-zero values. During a second timeframe in step <b>604</b>, arbitrary non-zero values are chosen for the carrier types within the second group. Within a step <b>606</b> during a third timeframe, non-zero values for the carrier types within the second group are chosen based upon a predetermined PAPR threshold. The method <b>600</b> may be implemented, for example, during a transmitter training phase or an initialization process.</p>
