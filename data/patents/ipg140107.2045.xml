<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0042">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the invention relates to a method <b>1</b> of fabricating a gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; for example for a timepiece. Fabricating method <b>1</b> includes successive steps for preparing a substrate <b>29</b> made of micro-machinable materials, such as, preferably, silicon-based materials. In the illustration below, the respective sizes are not to the same scale. Some thicknesses, such as those of coatings <b>37</b> and <b>47</b>, are been increased so as to make said illustration easier to comprehend.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0043">A first step <b>2</b> of method <b>1</b> consists in taking a substrate <b>9</b> that includes a top layer <b>31</b> and a bottom layer <b>33</b>, made of micro-machinable material, and secured to each other by an intermediate layer <b>32</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0044">Preferably, substrate <b>29</b> is a silicon-on-insulator (S.O.I.). Thus intermediate layer <b>32</b> is preferably made of silicon dioxide. Further, top and bottom layers <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> are crystalline silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0045">According to the invention, method <b>1</b> includes a second step <b>3</b>, for etching at least one pattern <b>34</b> in top layer <b>31</b> and intermediate layer <b>32</b> until the top of bottom layer <b>33</b> is partially exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0046">The second step <b>3</b> consists, firstly, in structuring at least one protective mask <b>36</b> on top layer <b>31</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows, mask <b>36</b> includes at least one pattern <b>34</b>, which does not cover top layer <b>31</b>. This mask <b>36</b> may, for example, be obtained by photolithography using a positive or negative photosensitive resin.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0047">Secondly, top layer <b>31</b> is etched until intermediate layer <b>32</b> is exposed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. According to the invention, the etching preferably includes a dry anisotropic DRIE etch. The anisotropic etch is performed on top layer <b>31</b> over pattern <b>34</b> of mask <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0048">Thirdly, pattern <b>34</b> is extended into intermediate layer <b>32</b> by etching until the top of bottom layer <b>33</b> is partially exposed. According to the invention, the etching may include a chemical or directional etch of the exposed parts of layer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0049">Fourthly, mask <b>36</b> is removed. Of course, depending upon the resistance of mask <b>36</b> to the mode of etching intermediate layer <b>32</b>, mask <b>36</b> can be removed prior to or after this etch.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0050">Thus, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows, at the end of second step <b>3</b>, the entire thickness of top and intermediate layers <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> are etched with at least one cavity <b>35</b>, for forming a first wheel set <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>&#x2032; of the future gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0051">In a third step <b>5</b>, an electrically conductive coating <b>37</b> is deposited by coating at least the bottom of each of said at least one cavity <b>35</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it can be seen that it is the whole top of substrate <b>29</b> that is coated. As will be explained below, the walls of said at least one cavity <b>35</b> do not need to be coated, although the coating may be required to be present on the top of top layer <b>31</b> for the alternative embodiment of gear train <b>51</b>&#x2032; below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0052">Preferably, coating <b>37</b> is obtained by vapour phase deposition. However, other types of deposition can be envisaged, such as chemical deposition. Coating <b>37</b> preferably includes at least one gold layer, which may be deposited on a chromium primer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0053">Preferably, in order to limit the areas of the future electroforming, method <b>1</b> can include a step <b>6</b> consisting in mounting a part <b>38</b> on the top of substrate <b>29</b>. This step <b>6</b> may consist, for example, in structuring a positive or negative photosensitive resin by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0054">Advantageously, this step <b>6</b> can also allow the formation of at least one recess <b>39</b>, flaring out coaxially from said at least one cavity <b>35</b>, to make said variant of gear train <b>51</b>&#x2032;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0055">Preferably, method <b>1</b> can include at the same time, prior to or after step <b>6</b>, a step <b>7</b>, which consists in mounting a pin <b>40</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, from the bottom of said at least one cavity <b>35</b> to form an arbour hole <b>54</b>, <b>54</b>&#x2032; for gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; immediately during the future electroforming. This has the advantage not only of avoiding the need to machine gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; once the electroforming has finished, but also of making it possible to make an inner section of any shape, whether uniform or not, over the entire top of the future hole <b>54</b>, <b>54</b>&#x2032;. This step <b>7</b> may also consist, for example, in structuring a positive or negative photosensitive resin by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0056">Method <b>1</b> then continues with electroforming step <b>9</b> for growing an electrolytic deposition <b>41</b> at least in the bottom of said at least one cavity <b>35</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, showing gear train variant <b>51</b>&#x2032;, it can be seen that deposition <b>41</b> grows both in said at least one cavity <b>35</b> and in said at least one recess <b>39</b> around pin <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0057">Preferably, step <b>9</b> is stopped before the deposition exceeds the top of substrate <b>29</b>. In the case of the first gear train variant <b>51</b>, the top of substrate <b>29</b> is the top of said at least one cavity <b>35</b>. In the case of the second gear train variant <b>51</b>&#x2032;, the top of substrate <b>29</b> is the top of said at least one recess <b>39</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It is clear why, in this second variant, it may be necessary for the top of top layer <b>31</b>, i.e. the bottom of said at least one recess <b>39</b>, to also include coating <b>37</b> formed in step <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0058">According to the invention, method <b>1</b> continues with step <b>13</b> for etching at least one pattern <b>44</b> in bottom layer <b>33</b> until coating <b>37</b> is exposed, and possibly deposition <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0059">Step <b>13</b> consists, firstly, in structuring at least one protective mask <b>46</b> on bottom layer <b>33</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also shows, mask <b>46</b> includes at least one pattern <b>44</b>, which does not cover bottom layer <b>33</b>. This mask <b>46</b> may, for example, be obtained by photolithography using a positive or negative photosensitive resin.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0060">Secondly, bottom layer <b>33</b> is etched until coating <b>37</b> is exposed and, possibly, deposition <b>41</b>. According to the invention, the etching preferably includes a dry anisotropic DRIE etch. The anisotropic etch is performed in bottom layer <b>33</b> according to pattern <b>44</b> of mask <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0061">Thirdly, mask <b>46</b> is removed. Thus, at the end of step <b>13</b>, the entire thickness of bottom layer <b>33</b> is etched with at least one second cavity <b>45</b>, allowing a second wheel set <b>57</b>, <b>57</b>&#x2032; of the future gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0062">Method <b>1</b> then includes a step <b>16</b> consisting in structuring a photosensitive resin <b>43</b> over the bottom of bottom layer <b>33</b>, forming a sheathing <b>51</b> on the walls of said at least one second cavity <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0063">Preferably, in a next step <b>15</b>, an electrically conductive coating <b>47</b> is deposited, covering the top of structured resin <b>43</b>. By analogy with the walls of said at least one cavity <b>35</b>, sheathing <b>51</b> of said at least one second cavity <b>45</b> no longer needs to be coated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0064">Preferably, coating <b>47</b> is obtained by a vapour phase deposition. However, other types of deposition can be envisaged, such as a chemical deposition. Preferably, coating <b>47</b> includes at least one gold layer, possibly deposited on a chromium primer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0065">Preferably, in order to form at least one second recess <b>49</b> that flares out coaxially from said at least one second cavity <b>45</b>, method <b>1</b> includes a step <b>17</b> consisting in mounting a part <b>48</b> on the bottom of substrate <b>29</b>. This step <b>17</b> may consist, for example, in structuring a positive or negative photosensitive resin by photolithography.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0066">Preferably, step <b>17</b> of the method <b>1</b> can also consist in mounting a pin <b>42</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, from the bottom of said at least one second cavity <b>45</b>, so as to form an arbour hole <b>54</b>, <b>54</b>&#x2032; for gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; immediately during the future electroforming with the same advantages as explained with reference to pin <b>40</b>. Preferably, if pins <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are respectively formed in cavities <b>35</b> and <b>45</b>, they are aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0067">Method <b>1</b> continues then with a new electroforming step <b>19</b> for continuing the deposition started in step <b>9</b>, so as to fill said at least one cavity <b>35</b> (and possibly said at least one recess <b>39</b>) and for starting to electroform a material in said at least one second cavity <b>45</b> and said at least one second recess <b>49</b> to form an arbour <b>53</b>, <b>53</b>&#x2032; fitted with a collar <b>52</b>, <b>52</b>&#x2032; and, possibly, a second collar <b>54</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0068">Preferably, at the end of step <b>19</b>, electrolytic deposition <b>41</b> exceeds the top and bottom of substrate <b>29</b>. Lapping is then performed to make deposition <b>41</b> level with substrate <b>29</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0069">Method <b>1</b> continues with step <b>21</b> of removing resin <b>43</b> from part <b>48</b> and, possibly, from part <b>38</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The next step <b>23</b> consists in removing intermediate layer <b>32</b> so as to detach the first <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>&#x2032; and second <b>57</b>, <b>57</b>&#x2032; wheel sets formed in top layer <b>31</b> and bottom layer <b>33</b> respectively. According to the invention, removal is performed by etching which may consist, for example, of a chemical etch. Finally, in the final step <b>25</b>, the gear train <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; thereby formed is released from substrate <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0070">Thus, according to the first variant of method <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the invention allows a composite gear train <b>51</b> to be made, comprising an arbour <b>53</b>, a first end of which is fitted with an integral collar <b>52</b>, a first wheel set <b>55</b> made of micro-machinable material being fitted onto the second end of arbour <b>53</b> and a second wheel set <b>57</b> made of micro-machinable material, which is independent of the movements of said first wheel set and which includes an aperture <b>58</b> whose wall is mounted opposite arbour <b>53</b> so that the second wheel set <b>57</b> is freely mounted on said first end of arbour <b>53</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, it can be seen that arbour <b>53</b> includes a hole <b>54</b> allowing gear train <b>51</b> to be driven against an arbour or pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0071">According to the second variant of method <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the invention allows a composite gear train <b>51</b>&#x2032; to be made comprising an arbour <b>53</b>&#x2032;, whose first and second ends are fitted with an integral collar <b>52</b>&#x2032;, <b>56</b>&#x2032;. Moreover, gear train <b>51</b>&#x2032; includes a first wheel set, wherein a first wheel <b>55</b>&#x2032;, made of micro-machinable material, is fitted onto the second end of arbour <b>53</b>&#x2032;, secured to and partially covering the second collar, forming a second wheel <b>56</b>&#x2032; of electroformed material. A second wheel set <b>57</b>&#x2032; in micro-machinable material, which is independent of the movements of said first wheel set and which includes an aperture <b>58</b>&#x2032;, whose wall is mounted opposite said arbour, so that the second wheel set <b>57</b>&#x2032; is freely mounted on said first end of arbour <b>53</b>&#x2032;. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, it can be seen that arbour <b>53</b>&#x2032; includes a hole <b>54</b>&#x2032; allowing gear train <b>51</b>&#x2032; to be driven against an arbour or pivot.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0072">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref> show, the first wheel set <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>&#x2032; can include, at least partially, an external coating that corresponds to fine coating layer <b>37</b> to improve the tribology of said first wheel set <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>&#x2032;. Moreover, preferably, the electroformed arbour <b>53</b>, <b>53</b>&#x2032; is made of a low friction material.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0073">Of course, the present invention is not limited to the illustrated example but is capable of various variants and alterations which will appear to those skilled in the art. Thus, several gear trains <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032; can be fabricated on the same substrate <b>29</b> to allow mass production of gear trains <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>&#x2032;, which are not necessarily identical to each other. Likewise, one could also envisage changing the silicon-based materials for crystallised alumina or crystallised silica or silicon carbide.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0074">One could also envisage coatings <b>37</b> and/or <b>47</b> being different in nature and/or each deposited in accordance with different methods from those explained above.
