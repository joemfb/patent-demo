<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates, in general, to the field of life insurance. In particular, the present invention is a business method and computing system for providing a death benefit to an individual having an uninsurable trait.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An insurance policy is a contract between an insurer and a policy owner, typically also the insured. The insurer agrees to pay a sum of money to a beneficiary designated by the policy owner upon the occurrence of an insured event. When the insurance policy is a life insurance policy, the insured event is typically the death of the policy owner from an accident or sickness, and typically excludes suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion. In return, the policy owner agrees to pay a premium to the insurer either at regular intervals or in a lump sum.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The insurer calculates the premium by evaluating the risk of insuring the policy owner. The evaluation typically includes an investigation of the health, lifestyle, and family history of the policy owner in conjunction with mortality tables. If the evaluation indicates that the risk of insuring the policy owner is minimal, the premium will likely be affordable. If the evaluation indicates that the risk of insuring the policy owner exceeds the risk the insurer is willing to accept, the premium will likely be unaffordable for the policy owner, and, in some cases, the insurer may deny coverage. In either case, the only alternative for the policy owner is not to have a life insurance policy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a demand for a method for providing a death benefit to an individual having an uninsurable trait. The presently disclosed method and system satisfies this demand.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A business method and computer system for providing a death benefit to a participant having an uninsurable trait. The method collects registration information from the participant, and associates the participant with at least one other participant having the uninsurable trait to form a group of participants. In one embodiment, the method collects personal information, contact information, uninsurable trait information, and previous insurance coverage information from the participant by sending a request for the registration information to the participant, and receiving and storing the registration information. The method analyzes the registration information to determine whether the participant qualifies to receive the death benefit and the group to associate with the participant. In one embodiment, the participant has the option to request a coverage amount to receive as the death benefit or to request a funding payment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method receives a funding payment from each participant in the group to create a funding pool for a time period, and stores the amount of the funding payment received from each participant in the group. The method disburses the funding pool to deceased participants in the group who died during the time period, each deceased participant receiving a portion of the funding pool. In one embodiment, the method disburses the funding pool to each eligible deceased participant. In various embodiments, the deceased participant is eligible after remitting the funding payment for the time period in which he died, the time period in which he died and a number funding payments for prior time periods, and the time period in which he died and a number funding payments for prior consecutive time periods. In various other embodiments, the deceased participant is eligible if the cause of death is the uninsured trait associated with the group of similarly situated participants of which the deceased participant was a member, and for any cause of death except and excluded cause of death. In various embodiments, the amount of the funding pool that each deceased participant receives is proportional to the funding payment received from each deceased participant for the time period in which they died, an average of the funding payments received from each deceased participant over a number of prior time periods, an average of the funding payments received from each deceased participant for the time period in which they died and a number of prior time periods, and an average of the funding payments received from each deceased participant for the time period in which they died and a number of prior consecutive time periods. The amount of the portion of the funding pool for each deceased participant is the death benefit for the deceased participant.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the uninsurable trait includes a health condition or lifestyle risk. The health condition includes illnesses such as cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, heart disease, or the like, a diagnosis of cancer in remission, and a terminal illness.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>D are flow charts that illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the method performed by the life insurance cooperative program <b>232</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The participant <b>110</b> initiates the execution of the life insurance cooperative program <b>232</b> by accessing the web pages <b>244</b> stored on the server computer <b>130</b>. The method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> begins by collecting registration information and qualifies the participant <b>110</b> (step <b>310</b>). The method then receives a funding payment from the participant <b>110</b> for a time period (step <b>330</b>). In one embodiment, the time period is a calendar month and the method receives the funding payment from the participant <b>110</b> before the calendar month. After each time period, the method determines whether the participant <b>110</b> died during the time period (step <b>340</b>). If the participant <b>110</b> did not die during the time period (step <b>340</b>, No branch), the method iterates to receive the funding payment from the participant <b>110</b> for the next time period (step <b>330</b>). If the participant <b>110</b> died during the time period (step <b>340</b>, Yes branch), the method determines whether the participant <b>110</b> is eligible to receive a disbursement (step <b>350</b>). If the participant <b>110</b> is not eligible to receive a disbursement (step <b>350</b>, No branch), the method ends. If the participant <b>110</b> is eligible to receive a disbursement (step <b>350</b>, Yes branch), the method disburses the funds, or a portion thereof, to the deceased, eligible participant <b>110</b> (step <b>360</b>). In one embodiment, the participant <b>110</b> is immediately eligible to receive a disbursement, that is, he is eligible because he made the funding payment for the time period in which he died. In another embodiment, a deceased participant <b>110</b> is eligible to receive a disbursement because he made the funding payment for the time period in which he died and a number of funding payments for prior time periods. In yet another embodiment, a deceased participant <b>110</b> is eligible to receive a disbursement because he made the funding payment for the time period in which he died and a number of funding payments for prior consecutive time periods. For example, if the funding payments are paid monthly, in one exemplary embodiment, the participant <b>110</b> is eligible after making six consecutive funding payments (i.e., the current month and the previous five months). In another embodiment, the deceased participant <b>110</b> is eligible to receive a disbursement if a cause of death for the deceased participant <b>110</b> is the uninsurable trait associated with the group of similarly situated participants <b>110</b> of which the deceased participant <b>110</b> was a member. In yet another embodiment, the deceased participant <b>110</b> will be eligible for any cause of death except an excluded cause of death such as suicide, fraud, war, riot, civil commotion, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates, in greater detail, the collection of registration information and qualification of the participant <b>110</b> (step <b>310</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> also illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the method performed by the registration program <b>234</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> begins by collecting registration information from the participant <b>110</b>. The collection of the registration information includes collection of personal information (step <b>312</b>), collection of contact information (step <b>314</b>), collection of uninsurable trait information (step <b>316</b>), and collection of previous coverage information (step <b>318</b>). The personal information includes information such as the participants <b>110</b> first name, last name, date of birth, gender, whether he accepts the terms and conditions, and the like. The contact information includes information such as the participants <b>110</b> username, password, address, phone number, e-mail address, and the like. The uninsurable trait information includes information such as the participants <b>110</b> health conditions, lifestyle risks, and the like. The previous coverage information includes information such as the participants <b>110</b> requested amount of coverage, requested amount of funding payment, whether he was previously denied coverage for a life insurance policy and the reason for the denial, and the like. One exemplary means for collecting the registration information is the web pages <b>244</b> stored on the server computer <b>130</b>. The client computer <b>120</b> sends a web page request to the server computer <b>130</b>. In response, the client computer receives the web pages <b>244</b> that it displays to the participant <b>110</b>. The participant <b>110</b> enters the registration information on the web pages <b>244</b>, and uses a control means such as a button to send the registration information to the server computer <b>130</b> where it is stored in the data storage device <b>210</b>, database <b>220</b>, memory <b>230</b>, or any combination thereof. The method then determines whether the participant qualifies to receive the death benefit (step <b>320</b>). In one embodiment, the method determines whether the participant <b>110</b> qualifies by analyzing the registration information. The analysis includes determining whether the participant <b>110</b> has an uninsurable trait, whether an insurer previously denied the participant <b>110</b> coverage for a life insurance policy, and whether the number of similarly situated participants <b>110</b> provides a sufficient death benefit for the participant <b>110</b>. If the participant <b>110</b> does not qualify (step <b>320</b>, No branch), the method ends. If the participant <b>110</b> qualifies (step <b>320</b>, Yes branch), the method associates the participant with a group of similarly situated participants <b>110</b> (step <b>322</b>). In one embodiment, the participant <b>110</b> is associated with only one group of similarly situated participants <b>110</b> even though the participant <b>110</b> may have a number of uninsurable traits. In another embodiment, the participant <b>110</b> is associated with a number of groups of similarly situated participants <b>110</b>. In yet another embodiment, every participant <b>110</b> regardless of their uninsurable trait is associated with one group, that is, every participant <b>110</b> is similarly situated because they have an uninsurable trait. The method then determines whether the participant <b>110</b> is providing a requested coverage amount or a requested funding payment (step <b>324</b>). If the participant <b>110</b> provides a requested coverage amount (step <b>324</b>, Requested Coverage Amount branch), the method determines the expected funding payment for the participant <b>110</b> to pay to obtain the requested coverage amount (step <b>326</b>). If the participant <b>110</b> provides a requested funding payment (step <b>324</b>, Requested Funding Payment branch), the method determines the expected coverage amount that the participant <b>110</b> may obtain by paying the requested funding payment (step <b>328</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates, in greater detail, the receipt of funding from the participant <b>110</b> (step <b>330</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> also illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the method performed by the funding program <b>236</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The participant <b>110</b> initiates the execution of the funding program <b>236</b> by sending a funding request via the network <b>100</b> to the server computer <b>130</b>. The method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> begins by receiving a periodic payment from a participant <b>110</b> (step <b>332</b>) via an electronic funds transfer, credit card transaction, check, or the like. The method then associates the payment with the participant <b>110</b> in the funding pool table <b>224</b> of the database <b>220</b> (step <b>334</b>). The method then transfers the payment from the participant <b>110</b> to the funding pool <b>140</b> (step <b>336</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates, in greater detail, the disbursing of funds to the participant <b>110</b> (step <b>360</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The flow chart shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> also illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the method performed by the disbursement program <b>238</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The participant <b>110</b> initiates the execution of the disbursement program <b>238</b> by sending a disbursement request via the network <b>100</b> to the server computer <b>130</b>. The method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> begins by determining the number of participants who died during the previous period (step <b>362</b>). The method then determines the cause of death for each deceased participant (step <b>364</b>). In one embodiment, each deceased participant is eligible only if the documented cause of death is the health condition or lifestyle risk that defined the group of similarly situated participants <b>110</b> of which the deceased participant <b>110</b> was a member. In another embodiment, each deceased participant is eligible unless the documented cause of death is an excluded cause of death, such as, suicide, fraud, war, riot, civil commotion, or the like. The method then computes the funding pool available for disbursement (step <b>366</b>). In one embodiment, the funding pool available for disbursement is the sum of the funding payments made by participants in the group during the previous period, less any operating costs to implement the life insurance cooperative. The method then computes the portion of the funding pool to disburse to each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> (step <b>368</b>). In one embodiment, the computation of the disbursement for each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> is proportional to the funding payment received from each deceased participant <b>110</b> for the time period in which they died. In another embodiment, the computation of the disbursement for each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> is proportional to an average of the funding payments received from each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> over a number of prior time periods. In yet another embodiment, the computation of the disbursement for each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> is proportional to an average of the funding payments received from each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> for the time period in which they died and a number of prior time periods. In yet another embodiment, the computation of the disbursement for each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> is proportional to an average of the funding payments received from each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> for the time period in which they died and a number of prior consecutive time periods. For example, if funding payments are received monthly, the disbursement for a deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> is the pro-rated share of the funding pool available based on the average funding payment for the deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> for the current month and the previous five months. The method then transfers the computed disbursement to each deceased and eligible participant <b>110</b> (step <b>370</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the disclosed exemplary embodiments describe a fully functioning business method and computing system for providing a death benefit to an individual having an uninsurable trait, the reader should understand that other equivalent exemplary embodiments exist.
