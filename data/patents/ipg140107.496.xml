<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A portable and disposable sanitary toilet seat cover comprises an annulus for placement on the toilet seat, the annulus having depending from its inner and outer boundaries inner and outer skirts. A drawstring is reaved into the annulus adjacent the relatively outer boundary thereof and also passes through a perforation at the rear of the cover where there is provided a glove in a stowed condition. When the toilet has been used, actuation of the drawstring collapses the annulus and its skirts and releases the stowed glove. Following full collapse of the cover, a hand is inserted into the glove to grasp the crumpled cover and the glove is then inverted to encase the used toilet seat cover for hygienic disposal.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is related to the field of portable, disposable, sanitary toilet seat covers of the kind that when placed in situ effectively isolate an individual's skin from any contact with the toilet seat, and is easily disposable following use.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In this day and age when transmissible infections and diseases are rife, the need for increased hygiene is of paramount importance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Of course, the use of sanitary disposable toilet seat covers is well known in hospitals and other medical establishments and generally such covers are provided in roll form such as to be easily deployed from a suitable dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Equally, portable sanitary disposable toilet seat covers are also available, particularly for travelers when prevailing conditions may be less than hygienic and where such covers prove to be at least a primary barrier against contamination through contact with toilet seats.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,360 to Besner et al discloses one such sanitary, portable and disposable toilet seat cover with an attached wipe. Although apparently effective in terms of preventing contact between the user's skin and the toilet seat and sides thereof, its simplicity neglects to address the total issue in terms of disposing of the cover after usage. In this respect, it is equally important to ensure continued isolation of an individual's skin from contaminant media and this earlier proposal fails to provide a complete solution to the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is a need for an improved portable and disposable sanitary toilet seat cover.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide an improved portable and disposable sanitary toilet seat cover.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of the present invention is that the cover affords a complete all-embracing hygienic insulation for the individual's skin from the whole of the toilet seat. In this respect, the toilet seat cover of the present invention is so formed as to encompass the totality of the seat form at its inner and outer peripheries.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further advantage of the present invention is that the cover provides a collapsible feature enabling the cover to be compressed into a relatively small dimension following use, and the cover is typically made out of biodegradable material such as plastic, recycled paper or the like, and preferably pre-sanitized.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A still further advantage of the present invention is that seat cover provides a glove formation integral with the cover and deployable once use of the cover is completed and at the instant of preparation for disposal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another advantage of the present invention is that the cover provides an invertible glove to ensure that no contact between the individual's skin and the used seat cover occurs during preparation for disposal and disposal per se.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a portable and disposable sanitary toilet seat cover comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">an annulus of a width corresponding to the width of a toilet seat and adapted to provide at least a covering for a top surface of the seat;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">an inner skirt integral with and depending from the annulus on an inner boundary of the annulus;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">an outer skirt integral with and depending from the annulus on an outer boundary of the annulus;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">a glove integral with the annulus; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0017">a drawstring provided on the outer boundary of the annulus and adapted, when drawstring ends of the drawstring string are drawn away from the annulus, to inwardly collapse the annulus to sufficiently small dimension for fitting the annulus within a user's hand in the glove to for disposal of the seat cover.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The seat cover of the invention may be of double thickness with the boundaries suitably bonded together either thermally or adhesively. The material from which the seat cover is made may be of medical hygienic standard and may be transparent or opaque.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">Both the inner and outer skirts of the annulus are pleated to provide an effective curtain hanging over the inner and outer aspects of the toilet seat. The pleating may conveniently be achieved by forming slits radially extending from the respective inner and outer boundaries of the annulus. Such pleating enables ease of accommodation of differently shaped toilet seats and to ensure adequate coverage over the totality of the toilet seat. The skirts may be flared if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">The annulus is so formed as to provide a looped path for the drawstring, the loops being formed of pairs of short slits, the drawstring being threaded through these loops.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">The glove may be of transparent material and is formed with a neck connecting it to the annulus, the neck being suitably perforated in line with the said slits of the looped path whereby the drawstring may also pass therethrough. The glove is initially formed into a rolled, stowed form. The perforation of the neck is conveniently weaker than the slits and accordingly permits rupture upon actuation of the drawstring to enable release of the glove into an unravelled user condition whereby a hand can be inserted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of using the portable and disposable sanitary toilet seat cover of the first aspect, the method comprises the steps of:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0023">placing the annulus on the top surface of a toilet seat hinged to the top of a toilet bowl;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0024">deploying the skirts of the annulus such that they depend from the boundaries of the annulus to cover the inner and outer peripheries of the toilet seat and the gap between the seat and the toilet bowl;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0025">actuating the drawstring following completion of toilet use by the individual, thus both collapsing the annulus with its dependent skirts into a relatively small crumpled mass and deploying the glove; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0026">placing a hand in the glove to grasp the crumpled mass of the annulus and the skirts; and inverting the glove whereby the outer surface thereof encases the mass and insulates the wearer's hand from said mass.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0027">The crumpled mass of the annulus and the skirts are thus encased within the now inverted glove to protect the wearer from any contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0028">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a careful reading of the detailed description provided herein, with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">With reference to the annexed drawings the preferred embodiment of the present invention will be herein described for indicative purpose and by no means as of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, a portable and disposable sanitary toilet seat cover in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown at <b>1</b> and comprises an annulus <b>2</b> having an inner skirt <b>4</b> and an outer skirt <b>6</b> formed at and depending from respective inner <b>8</b> and outer <b>10</b> boundaries thereof. The outer skirt <b>6</b> is pleated and flared as at <b>7</b>, typically along dashed lines <b>11</b>, preferably by providing spaced apart substantially radial outer pleat slits <b>12</b> cut therein as shown, so as to form outer pleats <b>12</b> pre-shape the seat cover <b>1</b> before it is used (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>). In an alternative embodiment (not shown) the outer pleat slits <b>12</b> are omitted on the outer boundary <b>10</b> and the pleats are provided merely by folding or creasing over the material as appropriate, and preferably secured in that folding position. The inner skirt <b>4</b> simply has substantially radial inner pleat slits <b>12</b> provided therein to form inner pleats <b>12</b> and allow the inner boundary <b>8</b> to flare downwardly when used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0040">Adjacent the outer boundary <b>10</b> the material from which the seat cover <b>1</b> is made is further punctured with relatively smaller pair of substantially radial parallel drawstring retainer slits <b>14</b>, which form outer loops through which a drawstring <b>18</b> is threaded with the ends <b>19</b> collected at the front <b>20</b> of the cover <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0041">At the rear <b>22</b> of the seat cover <b>1</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a neck <b>32</b> is formed and a perforation <b>30</b>, also typically formed by a pair of short parallel neck slits, is provided therein through which the drawstring <b>18</b> also passes, generally underneath the neck <b>32</b>, on a lower face which rests on the seat <b>50</b> and opposite the upper face upon which the drawstring <b>18</b> is disposed on the annulus <b>2</b>. The perforation <b>30</b> is relatively weak (the two slits being close to each other) and is adapted therefore to form a breakable neck loop <b>30</b> for rupture upon the application of stress, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The neck <b>32</b> has at its outer portion remote from the annulus <b>2</b> a mitten-shaped formation <b>34</b> with two thumbs <b>35</b> is provided and a mirror image formation <b>36</b> is contiguous therewith. During completion of manufacture of the seat cover <b>1</b>, the formations <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> are folded one on to the other and adhered together at their edges to form a glove <b>40</b> for insertion of a hand <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>). The glove <b>40</b> may be use either right or left handed and the two thumbs, or thumb portions, <b>35</b> are provided for that purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, instead of simple straight slits <b>12</b> for cover <b>1</b>, an alternative embodiment of cover <b>1</b>&#x2032; may have outer pleat slits <b>12</b>&#x2032; cut along lines <b>11</b>&#x2032; that are spaced apart at <b>10</b> and which fan inwardly towards, and preferably intersect, one another to provide wedge shaped slits <b>12</b>&#x2032;. The inner slits <b>12</b>&#x2032; at 8 may be similarly sized and shaped. Further, in addition to neck perforation <b>30</b>, the mirror image <b>36</b> for glove <b>40</b> may have a glove tab <b>102</b> having tab perforations <b>104</b> forming a breakable tab loop <b>104</b> disposed thereon, and through which the drawstring <b>19</b> may be further threaded, in addition to loop <b>30</b>. Thus, when drawstring <b>19</b> of cover <b>1</b>&#x2032; is pulled away from the annulus <b>2</b> at front <b>20</b>, both perforations <b>30</b>, <b>104</b> are severed to release glove <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0043">In use, the seat cover <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; is applied to a toilet seat <b>50</b> conventionally hinged to the top of a toilet bowl <b>52</b> having a base <b>54</b> and a cistern <b>56</b> for holding and dispensing flush water, these elements comprising a toilet <b>60</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the cover is opened out to provide the initial configuration <b>100</b> shown with the annulus <b>2</b> in a substantially flat horizontal orientation with the skirts <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> depending therefrom. In the initial configuration <b>100</b>, the glove <b>40</b> is rolled up at the rear <b>22</b> of the cover <b>1</b> and effectively held in that stowed position by the drawstring <b>18</b> and inner and outer skirts <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> are fully extended for covering the seat <b>50</b>. The cover is positively located over the seat <b>50</b> as seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with the ends <b>19</b> of the drawstring disposed at the front <b>20</b> of the cover <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0044">In deploying the seat cover <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; in this way, the whole of the seat <b>50</b> is covered including the usual gap (not shown) between the underside of the seat <b>50</b> and rim <b>53</b> of the bowl <b>52</b>, both inside and outside. It will be understood that the cover <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; is relieved at the rear <b>22</b> as at <b>23</b>, <b>23</b>&#x2032; to accommodate the cistern <b>56</b> and conduit <b>57</b> leading to the bowl <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, when the individual has completed usage of the toilet <b>60</b>, the drawstring <b>18</b> is pulled tight as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which action initially collapses the annulus <b>2</b> and its skirts <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> and simultaneously ruptures the loops <b>30</b>, and <b>104</b> for cover <b>1</b>&#x2032;, <b>104</b> formed by perforations <b>30</b>, <b>104</b> to release the glove <b>40</b> from its rolled up status. The opened glove <b>40</b> is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> allowing access of hand <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Further actuation of the drawstring <b>18</b> further collapses and crumples the glove <b>40</b> to a point at which the gloved hand <b>49</b> can grasp and encase the cover as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The glove <b>40</b> is then inverted, i.e. reversed, using the other hand of the individual to enclose the crumpled used toilet seat cover <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; therewithin, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0046">This encasement seeks to ensure that the skin of the individual does not come into contact with any part of the used seat cover <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032;. Accordingly the seat cover <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; encased as aforesaid may be disposed of in a safe and sanitary fashion protecting not only the user but also others who subsequently visit the toilet.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0047">It will be understood that the material from which the toilet seat cover is made may be any suitable kind, preferably pre-sanitized.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">Further the material is preferably such as to allow folded stowage for ease of portability. Conveniently, a dispenser may be provided with a charge of seat covers for use during travel or indeed in the home or office.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">Although the present invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be understood that the disclosure has been made by way of example only and that the present invention is not limited to the features of the embodiments described and illustrated herein, but includes all variations and modifications within the scope and spirit of the invention as hereinafter claimed.</p>
