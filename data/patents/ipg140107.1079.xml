<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/168,675, filed Apr. 13, 2009.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a device for dispensing multi-phase compositions, and more particularly to such a device capable of dispensing user-determined proportions of multi-phased oral compositions such as toothpaste and related dentifrice.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A relatively recent development in toothpaste and related dentifrice compositions is to include multiple material phases (streams) for additional functionality, aesthetics or the like. For example, one phase or stream of toothpaste may include fluoride or related anti-cavity treatment, while another phase may include antibacterial agents, breath treatment, tartar control agents, baking soda, whitening agents or the like. Likewise, multiple streams have been employed to provide visually appealing effects in the dispensed product; such attributes help distinguish the composition from other products on the market. In one form, portions of the multi-phase composition may include stripes, particles or related visually distinct cues.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The different streams may be co-dispensed such that each occupies a separate portion of a generally continuous flow of the oral composition. To effect multi-phase dispensing, the various streams may be segmented into separate reservoirs, or compartments within the dispenser such that when the dispenser is squeezed or otherwise pressurized, the materials from the separate compartments are routed side-by-side through a nozzle or related discharge orifice. In another less precise form, the composition may be loaded into a single-compartment dispenser in such a way as to preserve its multi-phased attributes as the composition is discharged from the nozzle. The efficacy of this latter configuration is generally better when the dispenser's reservoir is relatively full, and falls off as the supply of dentifrice is depleted. In still another form, a partitioned insert may be placed adjacent the nozzle such that different materials making up the multi-phase composition pass through the various insert compartments, thereby being co-dispensed as a whole while substantially preserving their independent features. In all of these configurations, the dispensers are made up of fixed componentry, such that a particular ratio of streams or materials making up the oral composition is determined at the time of manufacture of the dispenser and packaging of the composition therein, and cannot be subsequently adjusted by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There exists circumstances where the ratio of ingredients making up the oral composition may need to be varied according to the needs or preferences of the user. Thus, what is desired is a dispenser that allows for adjustment of the ratio of the flow of one or more materials making up a multi-phase oral composition. What is further desired is such a dispenser that is easy and inexpensive to manufacture and operate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These desires are met by the present invention, wherein a device and a method of operating the device to allow variations in a dispensed composition are disclosed. According to a first aspect of the invention, a flow control assembly for a multi-phase oral composition dispenser is disclosed. In the present context, a composition is considered to be multi-phase when it possesses two or more streams being dispensed substantially simultaneously, and where one of the streams differs from the other in at least one material regard. Examples of such differences may include, but are not limited to, visual appearance, chemical composition and textural variations. Specifically, relative portions (or ratios, for example, volume ratios) of the separate streams making up the composition may be varied, thereby enabling the user to achieve a desired amount of a particular stream in the dispensed product. In the present context, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; refers to an arrangement of elements or features that, while in theory would be expected to exhibit exact correspondence or behavior, may, in practice embody something slightly less than exact. As such, the term denotes the degree by which a quantitative value, measurement or other related representation may vary from a stated reference without resulting in a change in the basic function of the subject matter at issue.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The flow control assembly includes a housing defining a flowpath such that the flowpath terminates in a discharge orifice. The flowpath can fluidly engage a reservoir that together with the assembly makes up a dispenser such that at least a portion of the multi-phase oral composition being dispensed from the reservoir passes through the flowpath and the discharge orifice that is provided for in the housing. The assembly also includes an insert disposed within the flowpath and adjustable so that upon relative movement between the insert and housing, the insert cooperates with the orifice to vary the way the multi-phase composition is dispensed. Thus, the cooperation of the insert and the housing is such that, depending on the setting or position established between them, a single phase or combination of phases of the multi-phase material may be passed through the orifice to be dispensed. A restrictor is used to block at least a portion of the orifice, and can be used to prevent or limit the amount of at least one of the phases that can be dispensed. In this way, a flow of the multi-phase composition that is passing through the orifice is reduced relative to the flow if the restrictor were not present. Specifically, the restrictor is cooperative with the insert such that upon the selective rotation between them, the restrictor defines at least a partial blockage of one or more of the fluidly decoupled channels. The cooperation of the restrictor with the insert and the remainder of the housing allows the multi-phase composition to be co-dispensed, such that, in addition to allowing a single stream of the multi-phase material to be dispensed, two or more discreet streams may be discharged simultaneously, depending on the setting of the housing relative to the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Optionally, the housing is adjustable relative to the insert by being selectively rotatable about a composition-dispensing axis defined in the flowpath. In another option, ribs define numerous fluid channels over the portion of the flowpath that is occupied by the insert. In one form, the fluid channels defined by the ribs may form a channel on the outer surface of the insert that can be used to convey one or more of the phases of the multi-phase composition. Likewise, the insert may include a centrally disposed inner channel that is radially surrounded by and fluidly decoupled from the outer channel discussed above. In this way, a stream situated in or flowing through the outer channel is kept separated from a stream flowing through the inner channel such that no intermixing occurs while those portions of the streams are in the channels. The restrictor may be made from a geometric shape, such as a semicircle, rectangle or triangle. In this way, it may better cooperate with a corresponding shape formed by one or more of the channels formed in the insert. In a particular form, the restrictor is integrally formed with the orifice such that it defines a fixed discharge profile. The housing may additionally include a cap that can cooperate with the housing to act as a closure device for the orifice. In a particular embodiment, the cap is hingedly connected to the housing. The operation of the housing and the flow control assembly resembles a valve, in that the discharge of the composition can be controlled by varying the position of the two relative to one another, while the addition of the cap gives the assembly the ability to shut off discharge flow altogether. One or all of the components making up the assembly may be made from low-cost materials, such as plastic or related resins. Specific examples may include (but are not limited to) acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terapthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, an oral composition dispenser made up of at least a reservoir and flow control assembly is disclosed. The reservoir is configured to contain an oral composition made up of numerous substantially discreet phases and a flow control assembly in fluid communication with the reservoir. In the present context, the term &#x201c;phase&#x201d; refers to a physically distinct and substantially homogeneous portion of the oral composition. Such phases may be distinct on the basis of visual, chemical makeup, texture or related attributes. The flow control assembly includes a housing fluidly coupled to the reservoir, where the housing includes a flowpath that allows at least a portion of the oral composition stored in the reservoir to pass through it and a discharge orifice. The flow control assembly further includes an insert situated within the flowpath such that the housing and insert are adjustable relative to one another. The insert defines numerous channels. As with the previous aspect, a restrictor cooperates with channels formed in the insert to allow selective discharge of the discreet phases through the orifice. Thus, where the composition is made up of multiple phases, adjustment of the insert and housing allows the user to vary the relative portions of the phases that are dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Optionally, the reservoir comprises numerous material compartments, each to contain at least one substantially discreet phase of the composition. In a more particular form, at least two of the reservoir material compartments are arranged concentrically relative to one another. The insert may be rigidly affixed to the dispenser such that the insert and the reservoir do not move relative to one another. In this way, movement is between the housing and the reservoir. The insert may define a generally cylindrical structure along a flowpath axis formed in the insert. Furthermore, the structure may include one or more ribs that can be used to enhance rotational stability of the insert relative to the housing. The ribs, which are placed around the periphery of the insert and oriented along the axial dimension of the insert, help to axially and radially align the outer surface of the insert and the inner surface of the housing; their presence prevents misalignment and wobble from occurring during rotational movement between the insert and housing. In an exemplary form of the channels, the insert may include a single inner channel with numerous outer channels arranged concentrically around the inner channel, where one phase or stream of the multi-phase composition may be fluidly coupled to the inner channel, and where another phase or stream (or phases or streams) of the multi-phase composition may be fluidly coupled to the outer channel. In one form, the numerous outer channels may be formed on the outer surface of the insert, and coincide with the placement of the ribs. In this way, the ribs act as flowpath guides that, in addition to being used for insert stability, wobble-free operation or the like, can help direct the flow of the phase or stream that flows over the outer surface of the insert toward the discharge orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the invention, a method of making a dispenser of multi-phase oral composition is disclosed. The method includes configuring the dispenser to comprise a reservoir and an adjustable flow control assembly in fluid communication with the reservoir, placing a plurality of discreet phases of the multi-phase oral composition into the reservoir, providing a discharge orifice and selective blockage in the flow control assembly such that one or more of the substantially discreet phases of oral composition may be prevented from being discharged through the discharge orifice, and securing the flow control assembly to the reservoir. In this way, when a user adjusts the flow control assembly, the ratio of the various discreet phases making up the multi-phase oral composition can be dispensed in a manner deemed suitable to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, the method further includes configuring the flow control assembly to comprise a housing rotatably disposed about an insert. In this way, when a user rotates the housing relative to the insert (such as by twisting one relative to the other), various channels formed in the flow control assembly can cooperate with a restrictor or related flow blockage member to dispense the user-determined ratio. Thus, upon rotation between the insert and the housing, at least one of the segmented discreet phases may be discharged at an amount that is less than others of the segmented discreet phases. Such lower amount can extend all the way down to zero in situations where the restrictor completely blocks off the channel from a discharge orifice. Numerous ribs may be placed around the outer surface of the insert to ensure a wobble-free rotational fit between the insert and housing. The channels may include an inner channel and an outer channel, where the ribs may further segment the outer channel into numerous smaller channels that may help to (with additional sealing) carry a single phase of the discreet phases or define a channel with a unique phase configured to pass through. The outer channel may be concentrically arranged about the inner channel, at least over the portion of the flowpath defined by the insert. The method further includes affixing a cap to the housing. In this way, the cap keeps the composition that is in the dispenser from contacting the ambient environment.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the invention, a multi-phase oral composition dispensing apparatus is disclosed. The apparatus includes an oral composition reservoir, a multichannel device configured to at least partially segment one or more of the phases of the oral composition being dispensed from the reservoir, and a flow control device. The reservoir can contain an oral composition that is made up of numerous substantially discreet phases, while the flow control device is in fluid communication with the reservoir and includes a housing and a restrictor. The housing is fluidly coupled to the reservoir and defines a flowpath through which at least a portion of the oral composition dispensed from the reservoir passes. Furthermore, a discharge orifice is provided in the housing. The restrictor blocks at least a portion of the discharge orifice such that a flow of the oral composition dispensed therethrough is reduced relative to a flow if the restrictor were not present. At least one of the housing and the restrictor are adjustable relative to the dispenser such that the relative portions of the discreet phases that are dispensed through the orifice can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Optionally, the reservoir includes an inner reservoir and an outer reservoir, and in a specific embodiment, the outer reservoir is concentrically placed about the inner reservoir. One portion of the housing may be in selective fluid communication with the outer reservoir, while another portion of the housing may be in selective fluid communication with the inner reservoir. The dispenser may be rotatably coupled to the flow control device such that the selective fluid communication can be varied by rotational movement between the dispenser and at least one of the restrictor and the housing. Likewise, one of the inner and outer reservoirs may be formed to define a substantially fixed fluid coupling to the discharge orifice while the other may form a variable fluid coupling to the discharge orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one particular option, the multichannel device is a fitment that is either affixed to or integral with the reservoir. In such configuration, no insert is needed, as the cooperation of the fitment and the reservoir is such that variability of the flow of the multiphase material from the reservoir to the flow control device can be achieved by selective rotation or other similar movement.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet another option, the multichannel device comprises an insert coupled to the housing such that the flow control device and the insert together define a flow control assembly. Such a configuration is similar to that of the flow control assembly discussed in some of the previous embodiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a flow control assembly <b>40</b> is shown, made up of a housing <b>20</b> and an insert <b>30</b>. The assembly <b>40</b> (and its components, housing <b>20</b> and an insert <b>30</b>) function as devices to facilitate the dispensing of toothpaste or related multi-phase dentifrice compositions. Housing <b>20</b> includes an outer surface <b>20</b>C that is generally exposed to the ambient environment, and an inner surface <b>20</b>D that can engage insert <b>30</b> to facilitate mounting of the latter into the former. In a preferred (although not necessary) embodiment, the housing <b>20</b> and insert <b>30</b> may be made from lightweight, moldable materials, such as a plastic or related resin. Housing <b>20</b> is generally hollow inside such that an axial flowpath <b>22</b> extends from the back <b>20</b>A to the front <b>20</b>B, the latter of which terminates in a discharge orifice (also called simply, orifice) <b>24</b>. An oral composition stored in a reservoir (shown and described later) is forced out through the orifice <b>24</b> via flowpath <b>22</b>. A restrictor <b>26</b> is integrally formed into the housing <b>20</b> such that it partially covers orifice <b>24</b>. As shown, the restrictor <b>26</b> defines a semi-circular shape, although it will be appreciated that other shapes, including geometric shapes, such as rectangles, triangles or the like may be employed. As will be discussed in more detail below, the shape of the restrictor <b>26</b> can be advantageously made to cooperate with shapes formed by insert <b>30</b> and between insert <b>30</b> and inner surface <b>20</b>D of the housing <b>20</b> such that when the composition is forced through flowpath <b>22</b> from back <b>20</b>A to the front <b>20</b>B, discreet portions of the composition can be dispensed in ratios determined by the fraction of the discharge orifice <b>24</b> that is open to the ambient environment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A cap <b>28</b> may be attached to the housing <b>20</b> through hinge <b>29</b>. The cap <b>28</b>, hinge <b>29</b> and housing <b>20</b> may be formed from a single piece of material such that all three define a unitary structure. Complementary shapes may be formed on the housing <b>20</b> and cap <b>28</b> so that secure closure may be effected. For example, a radially inward collar <b>28</b>B is formed on the inner surface of cap <b>28</b>, and may include an undercut that cooperates with a ring-shaped ridge <b>24</b>A that protrudes radially outward from the front <b>20</b>B of the housing that defines orifice <b>24</b>. Such cooperation can be used to promote a snap-fit connection between the cap <b>28</b> and the front end <b>20</b>B of the housing <b>20</b>. Likewise, a ledge <b>20</b>E may be formed about a substantial periphery of the outer surface <b>20</b>C of housing <b>20</b> so that a bottom flange <b>28</b>A formed in cap <b>28</b> can form a close-tolerance engagement with the ledge <b>20</b>E when the flow control assembly <b>40</b> is not being used to dispense product. In this way, the cap <b>28</b> keeps ambient air away from orifice <b>24</b> such that exposure to the composition inside is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Insert <b>30</b> is sized and shaped to nest within a complementary shape formed on the inner surface <b>20</b>D of housing <b>20</b>. As with the housing discussed above, insert <b>30</b> includes a back <b>30</b>A and a front <b>30</b>B, where the latter is fluidly downstream of the latter. Also like housing <b>20</b>, insert includes an outer surface <b>30</b>C and an inner surface <b>30</b>D, the latter of which defines one of the numerous channels through which the composition may pass on its way out orifice <b>24</b>. The channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> formed on the outer surface <b>30</b>C are segmented by ribs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> that extend axially along a dimension aligned with flowpath <b>22</b>. Ribs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> have corresponding leading edge <b>32</b>A, <b>34</b>A and <b>36</b>A (the latter of which is not presently shown) that align with a corresponding endwall <b>23</b>A (shown with particularity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) formed at the axially front end of flange <b>23</b>. As previously stated, the ribs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> enhance rotational stability between the insert <b>30</b> and the housing <b>20</b>, as the relatively close-tolerance fit of the ribs to the inner surface of the housing promotes axially and radial alignment to reduce or eliminate wobble during rotation between the housing <b>20</b> and the insert <b>30</b>. The channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> formed by the space between adjacent ribs may, with additional sealing (not shown), help allow a discreet portion of the composition (for example, that may correspond to separate composition phases as discussed above) to pass through between the housing <b>20</b> and insert <b>30</b> while maintaining their phase separate from the phase of the channel <b>39</b> (in the case of a two-phase composition), or substantially from one another (in the case of a multi-phase composition with more than two phases).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the insert <b>30</b> shown, there are four separate channels formed, including outer channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> defined by the space between the outer surface <b>30</b>C of the insert <b>30</b> and the complementary parts of inner surface <b>20</b>D of the housing <b>20</b> and an inner channel <b>39</b> that terminates in a half-cylindrical shape at the front <b>30</b>B of insert <b>30</b>. In the configuration shown, the outer channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> form a concentric flowpath around that of the inner channel <b>39</b>. In one particular form, a first phase of a multi-phase composition may be routed through the flowpath defined by the outer channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>, while a second phase of a multi-phase composition may be routed through the flowpath defined by the inner channel <b>39</b>. Thus, in circumstances where the multi-phase composition is made up of two discreet phases, the outer channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> together can be thought of as forming a single channel for one of the two phases, while the inner channel <b>39</b> may be thought of as acting as a conduit for the other of the two phases. In circumstances where the multi-phase composition may include more than two discreet phases, the inventors contemplate that the outer channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> (or some combination of one or more of the outer channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>) could each be used to carry a respective phase. The front <b>30</b>B of insert <b>30</b> abuts restrictor <b>26</b> that forms part of orifice <b>24</b> such that when a channel <b>33</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> or <b>39</b> aligns with restrictor <b>26</b>, the flow of that portion of the composition situated in that channel is reduced in proportion to such alignment. Of course, when there is complete alignment such that one or more channels are entirely blocked by restrictor <b>26</b>, flow through orifice <b>24</b> from that channel is substantially cut off.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown with particularity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the various arrows <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C and <b>22</b>D correspond to the four channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> that are defined around and in insert <b>30</b>. The arrows relate to on oral composition flowpath past insert <b>30</b> that is generally defined by the various channels. As can additionally be seen, the inner surface <b>20</b>D of housing <b>20</b> has various concentrically-arranged flanges <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> that are formed in and extend from the inner surface <b>20</b>D. As stated above, the endwall <b>23</b>A formed where the front end of flange <b>23</b> meets the back end of flange <b>21</b> acts as a seat for leading edge <b>32</b>A, <b>34</b>A and <b>36</b>A of ribs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>. By their smooth-walled peripheral placement around the flowpath <b>22</b>, the flanges <b>21</b> and <b>23</b> allow rotation of the housing <b>20</b> relative to the insert <b>30</b>. Likewise, the fit between the radially outer edges of the ribs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> and the cylindrical compartment of flange <b>23</b> is tight enough to reduce fluid cross-talk among the channels <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>, but not so great as to appreciably inhibit rotation between the housing <b>20</b> and the insert <b>30</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, a circumferential ridge <b>31</b> formed on the inner surface <b>30</b>D can be used to engage a complementary surface <b>11</b>A on the reservoir to substantially affix the two together, such as in a resilient snap-fit relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, an exploded view of a dispenser <b>1</b> and various embodiments of a composition-containing reservoir <b>10</b> are shown. The dispenser <b>1</b> includes the aforementioned flow control assembly <b>40</b> and reservoir <b>10</b>. Reservoir <b>10</b> may be configured in any manner suitable to ensure that the various streams making up the oral composition are fluidly coupled to respective channels formed in the insert <b>30</b>. Moreover, the reservoir <b>10</b> may be configured such that upon the application of pressure (such as by squeezing the tube that makes up reservoir <b>10</b> or by actuating a piston or related axial plunger), oral composition contained within the reservoir <b>10</b> is forced out through the flow control device <b>40</b>. The flowpath F of the composition through the entire assembly <b>1</b> includes the flowpath <b>22</b> that passes through the flow control assembly <b>40</b> as previously described. As shown with particularity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reservoir <b>10</b> is made up of a pair of concentric tubes <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B with an annular space defined between them. The inner tube <b>10</b>A may be used to contain one of the discreet portions of the multi-phase oral composition, and is defined by an outer diameter D<b>2</b> (shown in one form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>) that is compatible with the inner diameter D<b>1</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the insert <b>30</b> to facilitate secure connection between them. As with the snap-fit connection formed between the cap <b>28</b> and housing <b>20</b> discussed above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inner tube <b>10</b>A further may include an undercut or flange <b>11</b> that can cooperate with the circumferential ridge <b>31</b> that projects radially from the inner surface <b>30</b>D of the insert <b>30</b>. Such circumferential ridge <b>31</b> may be made up of a ring-like structure around the inner periphery (as shown), or by a series of bumps or related protuberances. By combining the undercut or flange <b>11</b> with the circumferential ridge <b>31</b>, a snap-fit is formed between the insert <b>30</b> and the inner tube <b>10</b>A. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that other connections, such as a friction fit, are within the scope of the present invention, and could be employed. In one particular form, a splined fit with complementary longitudinal ridges <b>11</b>B on the inner tube <b>10</b>A and <b>31</b>B on the inner surface of insert <b>30</b> adjacent the circumferential ridge <b>31</b> cooperate with one another to inhibit rotational movement between the inner tube <b>10</b>A and the insert <b>30</b>. Regardless of the connection between the inner tube <b>10</b>A and insert <b>30</b>, housing <b>20</b>, by virtue of the connection between a portion of its inner surface <b>20</b>D and the ribs <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> of insert <b>30</b>, can rotate about the axis formed by flowpath F to allow different settings of the flow control device <b>40</b> to be dialed in, thereby varying the proportions of the discreet streams that make up the oral composition. A portion of the flange <b>25</b> of the housing <b>20</b> may also form a friction fit or snap-fit with the outer tube <b>10</b>B of reservoir <b>10</b>. A sealing ring (not shown) may be placed between cooperating surfaces to reduce the likelihood of leakage of oral composition from the reservoir <b>10</b>. In the form shown, the outer tube <b>10</b>B includes mounting structure, such as a flange, shoulder or the like to facilitate secure mounting between the reservoir <b>10</b> and the housing <b>20</b> of the flow control device <b>40</b>. In a like manner (also shown with particularity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the end of inner tube <b>10</b>A includes a taper (i.e., shoulder) to facilitate mounting the insert <b>30</b>. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that a non-tapered variant (not shown) of both the inner and outer tubes <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B may also be employed. Referring with particularity to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, alternate embodiments of the reservoir <b>10</b> with numerous compartments <b>13</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> formed therein is shown. The various compartments can be used to store the various discreet portions of the oral composition. For example, compartments <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> may include a first portion, while compartment <b>19</b> may include a second portion. Examples of such portions may include (but are not limited to) the aforementioned fluoride or related anti-cavity treatment, antibacterial agents, breath treatment, tartar control agents, baking soda, whitening agents or the like. As shown, the inner and outer tubes may each define shoulders at their ends to allow placement of the housing (on the outer tube) and the insert (on the inner tube). In another configuration (not shown), one or both of the inner and outer tubes may include a mid-line divider that splits the tubes into two semicircular halves. Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an alternate embodiment of the dispenser of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown. In the present embodiment, the separate insert <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> has been replaced by a fitment <b>130</b> that is affixed to or integral with reservoir <b>110</b>, such as through one or more tubes, such as an inner tube <b>110</b>A. As shown, fitment <b>130</b> can be formed with a shoulder-like extension or fairing <b>115</b> to promote seating between the inner tube <b>110</b>A of the reservoir <b>110</b> and the housing <b>20</b>. As shown, fitment <b>130</b> has a back <b>130</b>A, front <b>130</b>B, outer surface <b>130</b>C and inner surface <b>130</b>D. Various ribs <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> (this last one not shown) divide the fitment <b>130</b> into numerous channels <b>133</b>, <b>135</b> and <b>137</b> to facilitate the flow of the multiphase material from the reservoir <b>110</b>. The various ribs have corresponding leading edges <b>132</b>A, <b>134</b>A and <b>136</b>A (this last, like the rib <b>136</b> into which it is formed, not shown) that promote rotational stability between the fitment <b>130</b> and the housing <b>20</b>, as well as promote axially and radial alignment to reduce or eliminate wobble during movement between them. A channel <b>139</b> can be used to establish selective fluid communication between a material disposed in the reservoir <b>110</b> and an axial flowpath <b>22</b> formed in orifice <b>24</b>. In its ability to segment the flow of the multi-phase material, fitment <b>130</b> functions in a manner similar to that of insert <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. While presently shown as being structurally similar to insert <b>30</b>, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that minor configurational changes to the fitment <b>130</b> may be made to facilitate coupling to the reservoir <b>110</b>, whether such coupling is through affixation, integral formation or the like.
