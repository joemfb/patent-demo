<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a chat system to which the present invention is applied. The chat system is principally composed of clients who perform text chatting and a chat server and allows real time chatting and downloading of music data of a jukebox in the chart server.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">More particularly, the chat system shown includes a single shared server <b>2</b> which includes a jukebox and has a function for chatting, and three client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>, all connected to each other over a network <b>1</b> such as the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shared server <b>2</b> is formed from, for example, a work station or a personal computer and functions as a chat server by executing a chat server program to provide a chat environment so that the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> can perform a chat among them. The shared server <b>2</b> functions also as a jukebox server by executing a music data transmission program so that music data requested by any of the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> are read out from a music database <b>11</b> and provided to the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> (in the description below, where there is no necessity to distinguish the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> from one another, they are or each of them is referred to simply as client computers <b>3</b> or client computer <b>3</b>) stores therein a chat client program for performing a chat while a chat space provided by the shared server <b>2</b> is shared with the other client computers. Thus, by execution of the chat client program and execution of the chat server program by the shared server <b>2</b>, a chat space for performing a chat (details are hereinafter described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) is displayed on the client computer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The client computer <b>3</b> can download music data from the music database <b>11</b> by receiving a tune list of music data stored in the music database <b>11</b> of the shared server <b>2</b>, selecting a predetermined tune from within the tune list and requesting the shared server <b>2</b> for the music data of the predetermined tune.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of a construction of the shared server <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a communication interface <b>21</b> is an apparatus for connection, for example, to the network <b>1</b> and is formed from a modem, a terminal adapter, a network card or a like element. A read only memory (ROM) <b>23</b> stores programs to be used by a central processing unit (CPU) <b>24</b> and data and so forth which are fixed from among parameters for arithmetic operation. The CPU <b>24</b> executes various application programs and a program of a basic OS (Operating System) thereby to perform such various processes as hereinafter described. A random access memory (RAM) <b>25</b> stores a program to be executed by the CPU <b>24</b>, data necessary for processing and so forth. The elements mentioned from the communication interface <b>21</b> to the RAM <b>25</b> are connected to one another by a bus <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The music database <b>11</b> has a plurality of music data stored therein so that it may function as a jukebox server. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a tune list <b>41</b> and tune data <b>42</b> are stored in the music database <b>11</b>. The tune list <b>41</b> includes tune information such as titles, names of artists and updating dates and points to the tune data <b>42</b> (addresses indicating locations at which the tune data <b>42</b> are stored). The tune data <b>42</b> include entities (music data) of the pointers to the tune data <b>42</b> stored in the tune list <b>41</b> and are stored in the form of data compressed in accordance with the MP3 (Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3), the ATRAC (Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding) 3 or some other suitable compression system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inputting section <b>27</b> is formed from, for example, a keyboard, a mouse and so forth and operated by a user to input various instructions to the CPU <b>24</b>. A liquid crystal display (LCD) unit <b>28</b> displays predetermined information under the control of the CPU <b>24</b>. A speaker <b>29</b> reproduces predetermined music data under the control of the CPU <b>24</b>. A hard disk (HD) <b>30</b> stores, for example, the OS, the chat client program and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A drive <b>31</b> is constructed such that a magnetic disk <b>32</b>, an optical disk <b>33</b>, a magneto-optical disk <b>34</b> or a semiconductor memory <b>35</b> can be loaded therein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The music database <b>11</b> and the elements mentioned above from the inputting section <b>27</b> to the drive <b>31</b> are connected to an input/output interface <b>26</b>, which is in turn connected to the CPU <b>24</b> by the bus <b>22</b>.</p>

The client computer <b>3</b> further includes a drive <b>61</b> similar to the drive <b>31</b>, and a magnetic disk <b>62</b>, an optical disk <b>63</b>, a magneto-optical disk <b>64</b> or a semiconductor memory <b>65</b> can be loaded into the drive <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Now, operation of the chat system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> when the client computer <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> transmits a music reproduction request to the shared server <b>2</b> and the shared server <b>2</b> receiving the request provides (transmits) music data to the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is assumed that the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> are connected to the shared server <b>2</b> over the network <b>1</b> and log in a common chat room (group) of the chat system. If the user of the client computer <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> operates the mouse which forms the inputting section <b>57</b> to issue a request for reproduction of a predetermined tune, then the instruction is transmitted to the shared server <b>2</b> over the network <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The shared server <b>2</b> receives the instruction (request) transmitted thereto, reads out music data of the request stored in the music database <b>11</b> and transmits the music data to the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>. In particular, since the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> log in the common chat room with the client computer <b>3</b>-<b>1</b>, the music data of the request from the client computer <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> are automatically downloaded to the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> even if the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> do not request for the music data separately.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, a music data transmission and reproduction process executed by the shared server <b>2</b> and the client computers <b>3</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.
