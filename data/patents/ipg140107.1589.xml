<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a terminal block and to a method of molding a terminal block.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-98007 discloses a terminal block for electrically connecting conductors, such as busbars, extending from electric devices, such as a motor and an inverter. The terminal block has a body formed by insert molding to include side by side nuts. Conductors in electric devices are placed one over another on the terminal block body and are connected electrically by fastening bolts and the nuts. Synthetic resin partition walls are formed between the nuts and extend up beyond above fastening surfaces of the nuts. The partition walls ensure electrical insulation between the respective nuts and between the conductors placed on the fastening surfaces of the nuts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attempts to shape the above-described terminal block by one molding can reduce insulation between the nuts and produce voids in the partition walls. Thus, an attempt to shape the terminal block by two separate moldings is being studied. Specifically, consideration is given to a primary molding to shape thin insulation walls with no voids and a secondary molding with the insulation walls arranged between the respective nuts to form partition walls having the insulation walls inside. Thus, the insulation walls formed by the primary molding reliably insulate the nuts from each other regardless of whether voids are produced in secondary molding resin. Therefore electrical insulation between the nuts can be ensured when primary molding is completed. However, the insulation walls may be inclined by injection pressure of the secondary molding. Inclined insulation walls may result in an uneven thickness of resin in the secondary molding at opposite sides of the insulation walls or may hinder the flow of the secondary molding resin. Thus, the secondary molding resin may not cover the insulation walls sufficiently, and the thin secondary molding resin may peel off.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention was completed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to improve durability of a terminal block.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to a terminal block for fastening conductors placed one above another and fastening the conductors by bolts. The terminal block has nuts on which the conductors are to be placed and partitions between adjacent nuts. The partition extends in a direction crossing an arrangement direction of the nuts and includes an insulation wall made of a primary molding resin located at least in a range in a vertical direction from the lower surfaces of the nuts to the upper surfaces of the bolts to be fastened to the nuts to ensure insulating between the adjacent nuts. A secondary molding made of a secondary molding resin fills clearances between the insulation wall and the nuts and at least partly covers the side surface of the insulation wall.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The secondary molding preferably covers the side surface of the insulation wall over substantially the entire periphery, but an exposed part of the insulation wall preferably projects up beyond the secondary molding. Accordingly, the insulation wall in the partition wall is not likely to incline and the properly aligned insulation wall is confirmed easily, thereby assuring the secondary molding resin will not peel off.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The secondary molding is formed with the adjacent nuts insulated by the insulation wall. Thus, electrical insulation between adjacent nuts is ensured reliably when the primary molding is completed. Further, the secondary molding mold fixes and covers the projection on the upper end of the insulation wall. Thus, the injection pressure of the secondary molding resin cannot incline the insulation wall and the secondary molding is formed evenly around the insulation wall. Accordingly, the secondary molding is less likely to peel off as compared with the case where the secondary molding is formed with an inclined insulation wall. Further, the exposed portion on the upper surface of the secondary molding guarantees that the insulation wall is not inclined in the partition wall. Furthermore, forming the partition in two processes, i.e. by primary molding and secondary processing reduces the likelihood of voids, as compared with the case where the partition is formed only by one molding.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The exposed portion could be a long straight part. However, resin warping and resin peel-off are likely to occur at an interface between the straight part and the secondary molding portion covering the straight part when heating and cooling are repeated, such as in a heat cycle test. Accordingly, plural exposed portions preferably are arranged in the direction crossing the arrangement direction of the nuts on the upper surface of the secondary molding. As a result, resin warping and resin peel-off can be suppressed at the interface between the exposed portions and the secondary molding.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An external force on the exposed portion could cause the exposed portion to deform away from the secondary molding and the resin may peel off at the interface between the exposed portion and the secondary molding at the side where the external force acts. Accordingly, a substantially fillet-like incline preferably is formed on the upper surface of the secondary molding and at least partly covers a base end of the exposed portion. The fillet-like incline is likely to follow deformation of the exposed portion when an external force acts on the exposed portion. Thus, the resin is not likely to peel off at the interface between the base end of the exposed portion and the incline.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The terminal block may further comprise a heat sink on a side of the nuts opposite the side where the conductors are to be placed and an insulation plate may be sandwiched between the nuts and the heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The secondary molding may at least partly cover the nuts, the insulation plate and the heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The secondary molding may include: an upper cover that closely contacts the nuts and upper ends of surrounding walls of the insulation plate, a lower cover that closely contacts a sink body of the heat sink, and a side wall that closely contacts the outer side surfaces of the insulation plate and the sink body of the heat sink.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The upper cover may be formed to fill clearances between inner peripheral surfaces of the surrounding wall of the nut accommodating recess and side surface of the respective nut. The upper cover also may comprise surrounding wall covers that at least partly cover the upper surfaces of the surrounding walls.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Substantially side by side nut accommodating recesses may be provided for receiving the nuts. A creepage distance capable of providing electrical insulation between the adjacent nut accommodating recesses is ensured only by the insulation walls.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A terminal block is identified by the number <b>10</b> in the figures and is to be mounted on a motor case to be installed in a vehicle, such as an electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle. The terminal block <b>10</b> electrically connects busbars, such as a three-pole busbar in a motor, such as a three-phase alternating current motor, and one or more busbars, such as a three-pole busbar in an inverter.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The terminal block <b>10</b> includes nuts <b>30</b> on which the busbars are to be placed. A heat sink <b>40</b> is on a side of the nuts <b>30</b> opposite the side on which the busbars are to be placed and an insulation plate <b>20</b> made e.g. of synthetic resin is sandwiched between the nuts <b>30</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b>. A molded resin portion <b>60</b> at least partly covering the insulation plate <b>20</b>, the nuts <b>30</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b>. Heat from the busbars is transferred to the nuts <b>30</b> and then to the heat sink <b>40</b> via the insulation plate <b>20</b> and is radiated from the heat sink <b>40</b> to the motor case. In the following description, a vertical direction is based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and a lateral direction is based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each nut <b>30</b> is a substantially rectangular thermally conductive metal block with four rounded corners, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 12</figref> and a bolt fastening hole <b>31</b> vertically penetrates a substantially central part of the nut <b>30</b>. An unillustrated bolt is to be threaded into the bolt fastening hole <b>31</b> for electrically connecting unillustrated busbars placed on an upper fastening surface <b>30</b>A of the nut <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A step <b>32</b> is formed on an outer peripheral part of an upper end portion of the nut <b>30</b> and is slightly lower than the upper fastening surface <b>30</b>A of the nut <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The step <b>32</b> is provided over the entire outer periphery of the nut <b>30</b> and is substantially parallel to the upper fastening surface <b>30</b>A and a lower fastening surface <b>30</b>B of the nut <b>30</b>. The upper fastening surface <b>30</b>A, the lower fastening surface <b>30</b>B and the step <b>32</b> of the nut <b>30</b> are substantially even and flat.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The insulation plate <b>20</b> is made of synthetic resin with a content of glass and talc of more than about 50% (particularly about 66%) and hence has higher thermal conductivity and a lower likelihood of warping after molding as compared with synthetic resin having a content of glass and talc of about 33%. Thus, a bottom wall <b>22</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b> easily is held in close contact with the nuts <b>30</b>. Heat from the busbars is transferred to the nuts <b>30</b> and then to the insulation plate <b>20</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the insulation plate <b>20</b> is wide and five nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> are arranged side by side in the lateral direction for accommodating the nuts <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each nut accommodating recess <b>21</b> includes the bottom plate <b>22</b> for closely contacting the lower fastening surface <b>30</b>B of the nut <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and a surrounding wall <b>23</b> projecting up from the bottom wall <b>22</b> to surround the side surface of the nut <b>30</b> over substantially the entire periphery. Additionally, each nut accommodating recess <b>21</b> has an open upper end that defines a substantially rectangular shape with four rounded corners, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The respective nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> are formed substantially side by side so that their longer sides abut on each other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bottom wall <b>22</b> is a single plate common to all of the nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Further, the upper and lower surfaces of the bottom wall <b>22</b> are substantially flat. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper surface of the bottom wall <b>22</b> and the lower fastening surface <b>30</b>B of the nut <b>30</b> can be held in close contact with each other without any clearance in the nut accommodating recess <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each surrounding wall <b>23</b> has a substantially rectangular inner peripheral shape that conforms to the outer peripheral shape of the nut <b>30</b>, but is slightly larger than the outer peripheral shape of the nut <b>30</b>. Thus, a tiny clearance is formed between the inner peripheral surface of the surrounding wall <b>23</b> and the side surface of the nut <b>30</b> when the nut <b>30</b> is accommodated in the nut accommodating recess <b>21</b>. A part of the surrounding wall <b>23</b> between adjacent nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> is common to both nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> and defines an insulation wall <b>24</b> that partitions the nuts <b>30</b> in adjacent nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The insulation walls <b>24</b> extend in a direction substantially perpendicular to an arrangement direction AD of the nuts <b>30</b> when the nuts <b>30</b> and the nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b>. Further, the height of the insulation walls <b>24</b> is more than 1.5 times the height of the nuts <b>30</b>, and preferably at least twice the height of the nuts <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The height of the insulation walls <b>24</b> is so set that the upper surfaces of the insulation walls <b>24</b> are higher than the upper surfaces of the uppermost busbars placed on the upper fastening surfaces <b>30</b>A of the nuts <b>30</b> in the nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b>. Further, insulation walls <b>24</b> ensure a creepage distance capable of providing electrical insulation between the adjacent nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Positioning ribs <b>25</b> project into each nut accommodating recess <b>21</b> from the inner peripheral surface of each surrounding wall <b>23</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The positioning ribs <b>25</b> extend vertically straight, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Projecting ends of the positioning ribs <b>25</b> contact the side surface of the nut <b>30</b> in the nut accommodating recess <b>21</b>. Further, the height of the positioning ribs <b>25</b> substantially equals the height of the nuts <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, each positioning rib <b>25</b> is held in contact with the side surface of the nut <b>30</b> over substantially the entire height when the nut <b>30</b> is accommodated in the nut accommodating recess <b>21</b>. In this way, the positioning ribs <b>25</b> precisely position the nuts <b>30</b> in the nut accommodating recess <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A bolt escaping recess <b>26</b> is formed in a central part of the bottom wall <b>22</b> surrounded by the surrounding wall <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 10</figref>, the bolt escaping recess <b>26</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape that makes a circular opening in the upper surface of the bottom wall <b>22</b> and/or projects downward.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the bolt escaping recess <b>26</b> is substantially coaxial with the bolt fastening hole <b>31</b> of the nut <b>30</b>. Thus, a bolt that is threaded into the bolt fastening hole <b>31</b> can penetrate through the bolt fastening hole <b>31</b>, but will not interfere with the bottom wall <b>22</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b> and will not break the insulation plate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The heat sink <b>40</b> is made of aluminum die-cast or another material having a high thermal capacity and/or thermal heat conductivity and has a wide shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The heat sink <b>40</b> includes a sink body <b>41</b> on which the insulation plate <b>20</b> is to be placed, and a fixing portion <b>42</b> unitary with a lateral edge of the sink body <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The insulation plate <b>20</b> is to be placed on the upper surface of the sink body <b>41</b>. Further, the upper surface of the sink body <b>41</b> is flat and/or polished to be free from unevenness so that the lower surface of the bottom wall <b>22</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b> closely contacts the upper surface of the sink body <b>41</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the sink body <b>41</b> is formed with five bottomed accommodating recesses <b>43</b> arranged at substantially regular intervals or pitches in the lateral direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the accommodating recesses <b>43</b> define substantially circular openings in the upper surface of the sink body <b>41</b> and extend down from the upper surface of the sink body <b>41</b>. Each accommodating recess <b>43</b> has a diameter substantially equal to the outer diameter of the bolt escaping recess <b>26</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b> so that the bolt escaping recess <b>26</b> can fit into the accommodating recess <b>43</b>. Thus the insulation plate <b>20</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b> to be assembled and positioned by fitting the bolt escaping recesses <b>26</b> into the respective accommodating recesses <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fixing portion <b>42</b> is wide and bolt insertion holes <b>42</b>A vertically penetrate opposite lateral ends of the fixing portion <b>42</b>. Unillustrated fixing bolts are inserted into the bolt insertion holes <b>42</b>A after the terminal block <b>10</b> is placed on the motor case, and are tightened to mount the terminal block <b>10</b> to the motor case.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Recesses <b>46</b> are formed in the lower surfaces of the sink body <b>41</b> and the fixing portion <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. At least one heat radiation fin <b>46</b>A is formed in the recess <b>46</b> of the fixing portion <b>42</b>, and a coolant (such as cooling water) can contact the fin <b>46</b>A. The heat radiation fin <b>46</b>A increases a contact area with the cooling water in the recess <b>46</b>, efficiently cools the heat sink <b>40</b> and improves heat radiation from the heat sink <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the molded resin portion <b>60</b> is made of secondary molding resin to at least partly cover the outsides of the insulation plate <b>20</b>, the nuts <b>30</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b> that have been assembled together. The molded resin portion <b>60</b> includes an upper cover <b>61</b> that closely contacts the steps <b>32</b> of the nuts <b>30</b> and upper parts of the surrounding walls <b>23</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b>, a lower cover <b>62</b> that closely contacts a lower outer peripheral edge portion of the sink body <b>41</b> of the heat sink <b>40</b>, and a side wall <b>63</b> that closely contacts outer side surfaces of the insulation plate <b>20</b> and the sink body <b>41</b> of the heat sink <b>40</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the side wall <b>63</b> unitarily joins the upper and lower covers <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the upper cover <b>61</b> comprises nut coverings <b>61</b>A that at least partly cover the outer peripheral edges of the steps <b>32</b> of the respective nuts <b>30</b> over substantially the entire peripheries and surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B at least partly covering the upper surfaces of the surrounding walls <b>23</b>. The nut coverings <b>61</b>A and the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B are formed unitarily so that the upper cover <b>61</b> covers all the nuts <b>30</b> and surrounding walls <b>23</b> together. Thus, the nuts <b>30</b> cannot be separated up from the upper surface of the insulation plate <b>20</b> by being pulled by the bolts while fastening the bolts to the nuts <b>30</b>, thereby preventing a reduction in heat transfer performance of the terminal block <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The upper cover <b>61</b> is formed to fill up the clearances between the inner peripheral surfaces of the surrounding walls <b>23</b> of the nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> and the side surfaces of the nuts <b>30</b>. Thus, the outer peripheral edge areas of the steps <b>32</b> of the nuts <b>30</b> are held in close contact with the nut coverings <b>61</b>A and the outer peripheral surfaces of the nuts <b>30</b> are held in close contact with the molded resin portion <b>60</b> over the entire peripheries to prevent upward movements of the nuts <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the lower cover <b>62</b> at least partly covers the lower outer peripheral edge of the sink body <b>41</b> of the heat sink <b>40</b> from below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the side wall <b>63</b> entirely covers the inner and outer side surfaces of the surrounding walls <b>23</b> and the side surface of the sink body <b>41</b> of the heat sink <b>40</b> between the upper and lower covers <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B are integral with and cover upper surfaces of the insulation walls <b>24</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b> and the side wall <b>63</b> covers the side surfaces of the insulation walls <b>24</b> over substantially the entire peripheries to form partition walls <b>50</b> that partition the respective nuts <b>30</b>. Further, the side wall <b>63</b> evenly covers the side surfaces of the insulation walls <b>24</b> over substantially the entire peripheries, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. Thus, each partition wall <b>50</b> is formed by covering the insulation wall <b>24</b> made of primary molding resin by the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B and the side wall <b>63</b> made of secondary molding resin so that each partition wall <b>50</b> is formed in two separate molding steps. This process suppresses production of voids in the partition wall <b>50</b> as compared with partition walls formed by one molding. Further, the insulation walls <b>24</b> are substantially evenly surrounded by the side wall <b>63</b> at all areas so that the side wall <b>63</b> will not peel off at interfaces between the insulation walls <b>24</b> and the side wall <b>63</b> as compared with the case where the insulation walls <b>24</b> are inclined in the partition walls <b>50</b> and the thickness of the side wall <b>63</b> is partly small.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the insulation walls <b>24</b> have exposed portions <b>27</b>A on the upper end surfaces of the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B at the partition walls <b>50</b>. The exposed portions <b>27</b>A are parts of projections <b>27</b> that project up from upper end surfaces <b>24</b>A of the insulation walls <b>24</b> and are exposed up from the upper end surfaces of the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Three exposed portions <b>27</b>A are formed side by side in a length direction of each insulation wall <b>24</b> and are at opposite end parts of the insulation wall <b>24</b> in the length direction and a substantially central part of the insulation wall <b>24</b> in the length direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The exposed portions <b>27</b>A are upper ends of the projections <b>27</b>, while lower parts of the projections <b>27</b> are covered by the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B. Thus, three exposed portions <b>27</b>A are formed on the upper end surface of the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B suppress resin warping and resin peel-off at interfaces between the insulation wall <b>24</b> and the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B and the side wall <b>63</b> as compared with an exposed portion having a long straight line.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the exposed portions <b>27</b>A are in lateral central parts on the upper end surfaces of the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B. Thus the insulation walls <b>24</b> are arranged at proper positions without being inclined in the partition walls <b>50</b> and the opposite left and right surfaces of the insulation walls <b>24</b> are covered by the side wall <b>63</b> with a substantially even thickness as described above. That is, the disposition of the exposed portions <b>27</b>A in the lateral central parts of the upper end surfaces of the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B can be confirmed visually to guarantee that the insulation walls <b>24</b> are at the proper positions and are not inclined in the partition walls <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an incline <b>64</b> is formed at a base end of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A exposed from the upper end surface of the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B and extends obliquely like a fillet from the upper end surface of the surrounding wall covering portion <b>61</b>B toward the side surface of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A. The incline <b>64</b> is thin and flexible, and is formed over the entire periphery between the base end of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A and the upper end surface of the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The incline <b>64</b> closely contacts the base end of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A and follows deformation of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A when an external force acts on the exposed portion <b>27</b>A. Accordingly, the resin will not peel-off at the interface between the base end of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A and the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The terminal block <b>10</b> is made by initially accommodating the nuts <b>30</b> into the nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b> and the bolt escaping recesses <b>26</b> of the nut accommodating recesses <b>21</b> are fit into the respective accommodating recesses <b>43</b> of the heat sink <b>40</b>. The assembly of the nuts <b>30</b>, the insulation plate <b>20</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b> is set in a lower mold <b>72</b>. Thereafter, a movable upper mold <b>71</b> is closed with the lower mold <b>72</b> to clamp a mold as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The upper mold <b>71</b> includes supports <b>73</b> for supporting the upper ends of the projections <b>27</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b>, which are fit therein from above. The supports <b>73</b> are substantially rectangular recesses formed in the inner surface of the upper mold <b>71</b> and extend up. The upper ends of the projections <b>27</b> closely contact the inner surfaces of the supports <b>73</b> when the upper and lower molds <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are clamped. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an inclined surface <b>73</b>A inclined from an inner side toward an outer side is formed over the entire periphery in an opening of each support <b>73</b>. In this way, the inclined surfaces <b>73</b>A guide the leading ends of the projections <b>27</b> into the supports <b>73</b> and the supports <b>73</b> support the projections <b>27</b> when the upper and lower molds <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are clamped so that the insulation walls <b>24</b> are not inclined laterally.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the lower mold <b>72</b> is fit into the recess <b>46</b> formed in the lower surface of the heat sink <b>40</b> to support the heat sink <b>40</b> in a positioned state. In this way, the insulation plate <b>20</b>, the nuts <b>30</b> and the heat sink <b>40</b> can be held in the upper and lower molds <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> while being positioned, and can be held in close contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Secondary molding resin then is injected into the upper and lower molds <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> to shape the molded resin portion <b>60</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. At this time, the supports <b>73</b> support the upper ends of the projections <b>27</b> so that an injection pressure of the secondary molding resin will not incline the insulation walls <b>24</b> and the insulation walls <b>24</b> will be at proper positions in the partition walls <b>50</b>. Thus, the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B and the side wall <b>63</b> covering the insulation walls <b>24</b> will not become thinner and peel off.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Side surfaces of the nuts <b>30</b> are held in contact only with the positioning ribs <b>25</b> on the inner peripheral surfaces of the surrounding walls <b>23</b> of the insulation plate <b>20</b>. Thus, clearances are formed between the inner surfaces of the surrounding walls <b>23</b> and the side surfaces of the nuts <b>30</b> and the secondary molding resin can flow into these clearances.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The upper and lower molds <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are opened when the secondary molding resin is cured to complete the terminal block <b>10</b>. In this state, the exposed portions <b>27</b>A are exposed on the upper surfaces of the surrounding wall covering portions <b>61</b>B and it can be confirmed that the insulation walls <b>24</b> are not inclined if the exposed portions <b>27</b>A are in lateral central parts of the partition walls <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, the supports <b>73</b> support the upper ends of the projections <b>27</b> so that the injection pressure of the secondary molding resin cannot incline the insulation walls <b>24</b>. In this way, the secondary molding resin is less likely to peel off as compared with the case where the partition walls <b>50</b> are shaped with the insulation walls <b>24</b> inclined in the partition walls <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, the exposed portions <b>27</b>A are exposed in the lateral central parts on the upper end surfaces of the surrounding wall coverings <b>61</b>B. Thus, the positions of the insulation walls <b>24</b> in the partition walls <b>50</b> can be confirmed easily to guaranty that the insulation walls <b>24</b> are not inclined in the partition walls <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The surrounding wall cover <b>61</b>B covers the upper end surface <b>24</b>A of the insulation wall <b>24</b> and surround the three exposed portions <b>27</b>A over substantially the entire peripheries, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the exposed portions <b>27</b>A do not form a long straight part. This can suppress warping and peel-off of the secondary molding resin in parts around the exposed portions <b>27</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, inclined surfaces <b>73</b>A of the supports <b>73</b> form the flexible inclines <b>64</b> between the exposed portions <b>27</b>A and the surrounding wall covering <b>61</b>B. The inclines <b>64</b> can follow the exposed portions <b>27</b>A to suppress peel-off of the secondary molding resin even if an external force acts on the exposed portions <b>27</b>A to deform the insulation wall <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The invention is not limited to the above described embodiment. For example, the following embodiments also are included in the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Although heat can be radiated from below by arranging the heat sink <b>40</b> below the insulation plate <b>20</b> in this embodiment, the present invention is not limited to such a mode and can also be applied, for example, when the lower side of the insulation plate <b>20</b> is covered by the resin molded portion <b>60</b> which is made of synthetic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although three exposed portions <b>27</b>A are arranged in this embodiment, the present invention is not limited to such a mode and one, two or four or more exposed portions may be arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although the incline <b>64</b> is provided over the entire periphery of the base end of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A in this embodiment, the invention is not limited to such a mode and inclines may be provided only at a lateral side or at the substantially opposite lateral sides of the base end portion of the exposed portion <b>27</b>A.</p>
