<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to devices and methods for measuring the quantity of an analyte in a sample using, for example, a fluorescence-based assay, an absorbance-based assay, or a light-scattering assay.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional fluorometers used to perform analyte readings, are typically designed as versatile instruments that can use several types of excitation and emission filters and may be equipped with adjustable sensitivities, so that they may be configured for many different types of assays. The Turner BioSystems TBS-380, and the BioRad VersaFluor fluorometer are examples of the typical laboratory fluorometer. A significant drawback to this design is that the user must choose the filters and/or light sources to use, requiring the user to understand how fluorescence works, look up the excitation and emission values of their assay, understand how to choose the appropriate filter sets and possibly purchase and install new filter sets. In addition, the user must often determine the appropriate gain setting (sensitivity) of the instrument by an iterative process before beginning the assay. The extensive tables that are offered with these instruments illustrate the potential difficulties for the user in setting up the instrument to perform their assay of interest. In particular, if the user intends to use only one type of assay, this selection process presents a formidable barrier to using the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, conventional fluorometers typically measure light emitted from the sample and display the readout in relative fluorescence values. Because the display is in relative fluorescence values, the user must, in general, use standards to generate a standard curve, plot the relative fluorescence values of the standards, fit a line to the curve, compare the relative fluorescence value of the samples to the standard curve, and ultimately back-calculate to determine the concentration of the sample. These operations can present difficulties to the untrained user and, even for the experienced user, these operations are tedious and time-consuming. Generally, a fluorometer can be configured to download data to a computer to make this operation easier. Unfortunately, this labor-saving feature requires installation of software onto a compatible computer, which may require purchasing a compatible computer, finding an appropriate communications port to transfer the data from the instrument to the computer, finding a suitable place in the laboratory where the instrument can permanently be connected to the computer and then hoping that the installed software will operate properly with the instrument. These actions can provide formidable barriers to the would-be user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is at least one fluorometer, the Turner BioSystems Modulus instrument, which has some software built in for performing calculations automatically from standards provided by the user, making the performance of those select assays easier for the user. The Turner fluorometer, however, requires five standards to calculate the standard curve, requiring a significant investment of time for the user, which may be particularly tedious if the user is measuring only a small number of samples. Finally, this instrument is again designed for maximal flexibility, offering separate modules for each assay, which must be snapped into the instrument and are small enough to be easily lost in a typical laboratory environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typical fluorometers also use specialized cuvettes to hold the sample. In general, the cuvettes are unique to a specific instrument, require adapters for small sample sizes, are not generally available from standard laboratory supply companies and may be expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is desired in the art is a small device for the measurement of a defined set of assays. The device should be designed for seamless integration with the specific set of assays, such that the user-interface would allow the user to choose from a defined set of assays and immediately begin to perform the assay. Upon choosing the assay of interest, the device would automatically choose the correct light sources, filter sets and sensitivity settings for the assay chosen. In addition, the device would be designed with sophisticated algorithms for data analysis appropriate for the specific assays, such that the customer need only measure a small number of standards (2 or 3). The device would also be designed to calculate a standard curve from these standards, and upon measurement of the samples, the device would automatically perform the required analysis and simply display the concentration of the sample for the user. By building automatic configurations of light sources, filter sets and gain settings and by incorporating data analysis algorithms into the device, the user would no longer encounter a learning curve just to use the device. In addition, the user would not need to choose, purchase and install filters, or determine the gain setting or sensitivity of the instrument. Finally, the user would be spared the tedium of using a large number of standards for the curve, plotting the curve, fitting a line to the curve, comparing the value of the sample to the curve, and back-calculating the concentration of the sample from the standard curve equation. The device would have a small footprint and would not require connection to a computer, such that the instrument system would not require a large dedicated amount of benchspace. In addition, because the device would not require connection to a computer for data analysis, the difficulties of finding a compatible computer for the software, installing the software on the computer and connecting the device to the computer are eliminated. Finally, the device would use a readily-available, inexpensive, disposable, laboratory test-tube to minimize the stress and expense of finding appropriate replacement cuvettes for the instrument.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0064">Introduction</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0065">The device and methods of present invention allow a seamless, intuitive interaction between the instrument and the user and accessibility of the methods to the user within the everyday workflow. Herein we disclose a fluorometer that comprises an analyte sensing element (ASE) that is operably linked allowing for detection of a predetermined analyte such that the selection of the predetermined analyte selects the appropriate ASE. Thus, in one embodiment the device is configured such that machine-executable instructions select the proper analyte sensing element that corresponds to the assay being used for detection of a specific analyte. The methods comprise generating a standard curve by measuring two or more standards, one of which may be a zero or blank standard. The standard curve can be generated by applying the values of the standard to a specific algorithm to generate an equation expressing the relationship between the signal generated by the assay as read by the instrument and the concentration of analyte in the sample. The device may be designed such that the user interface prompts the user to choose the assay, insert the standards, and insert the samples. From this simple input, the device automatically can choose the appropriate analyte-sensing elements and algorithm, perform the necessary calculations to determine the standard curve, and compare the signal from the sample to the standard curve and perform the necessary calculations to show the quantity of the analyte in the sample as a readout for the user. In addition, the device may also be configured to accept an inexpensive, disposable plastic, optically clear microcentrifuge-shaped tube that holds the standards or samples and are readily available. Furthermore, the device can be used to monitor and quantify multiple analytes in the same sample by, for example, labeling analytes with different dyes and then exciting and/or filtering emission spectra at particular wavelengths such that the dye/analyte of interest can be distinctly monitored in the presence of other dyes/analytes.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0066">Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to specific compositions or process steps, as such may vary. It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular form &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

<p id="p-0052" num="0067">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention is related. The following terms are defined for purposes of the invention as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0068">The term &#x201c;analyte&#x201d; refers to a molecule that is to be measured or detected in the assay of this invention. The term &#x201c;analyte&#x201d; includes any substance for which there exists a specific binding molecule, or for which a specific binding molecule can be prepared, or for which the analyte interacts with a reporter molecule to create a detectable signal. Representative analytes include, but are not limited to, drugs, antigens, haptens, antibodies, proteins, peptides, amino acids, hormones, steroids, cancer cell markers, tissue cells, viruses, vitamins, nucleic acids, metal ions, enzymes, lipids, radioactive isotopes, viruses, bacteria, pathogens, chemical contaminants, and pesticides.</p>

The ASE are operably linked such that a predetermined analyte can be measured without the manual selection of wavelength and filters or the need to perform additional calculations by the end user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0070">The term &#x201c;aqueous solution&#x201d; as used herein refers to a solution that is predominantly water and retains the solution characteristics of water. Where the aqueous solution contains solvents in addition to water, water is typically the predominant solvent.</p>

<p id="p-0061" num="0076">The term &#x201c;label&#x201d; as used herein refers to a chemical moiety or protein that retains it's native properties (e.g. spectral properties, conformation and activity) when attached to a labeling reagent and used in the present methods. The label can be directly detectable (fluorophore) or indirectly detectable (hapten or enzyme). Such labels include, but are not limited to, radiolabels that can be measured with radiation-counting devices; pigments, dyes or other chromogens that can be visually observed or measured with a spectrophotometer; spin labels that can be measured with a spin label analyzer; and fluorescent labels (fluorophores), where the output signal is generated by the excitation of a suitable molecular adduct and that can be visualized by excitation with light that is absorbed by the dye or can be measured with standard fluorometers or imaging systems, for example. The label can be a chemiluminescent substance, where the output signal is generated by chemical modification of the signal compound; a metal-containing substance; or an enzyme, where there occurs an enzyme-dependent secondary generation of signal, such as the formation of a colored product from a colorless substrate. The term label can also refer to a &#x201c;tag&#x201d; or hapten that can bind selectively to a conjugated molecule such that the conjugated molecule, when added subsequently along with a substrate, is used to generate a detectable signal. For example, one can use biotin as a tag and then use an avidin or streptavidin conjugate of horseradish peroxidate (HRP) to bind to the tag, and then use a colorimetric substrate (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)) or a fluorogenic substrate such as Amplex Red reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to detect the presence of HRP. Numerous labels are know by those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, particles, fluorophores, haptens, enzymes and their colorimetric, fluorogenic and chemiluminescent substrates and other labels that are described in RICHARD P.

<p id="p-0069" num="0084">In one embodiment, the device is not limited by the sample container for which the receptacle is configured to receive. Example of sample containers that the receptacle may fit include but are not limited to, petri dishes, culture flasks, 4-well plates, 8-well plates, 24-well plates, 96-well plates, cuvettes, centrifuge tubes, and microcentrifuge tubes to name a few. As used herein a &#x201c;receptacle being configured to fit or receive&#x201d; means that the receptacle for the sample container is designed such that the sample container fits snuggly into the opening, allowing little or no movement of the sample container, beyond the vertical axis. In addition, the receptacle and the computer processing unit may or may not be coordinated to one another such that, unless the sample container is positioned properly in the receptacle, the computer processing unit will not initiate a measurement of the sample. The receptacle may accept only 1 sample container, or it may be configured to accept 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 10 or more sample tubes.

<p id="p-0070" num="0085">Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to a device for measuring the quantity of an analyte in a sample container, where the device comprises an energy source, a photodetector, a computer processing unit with machine executable instructions and a receptacle for holding the sample container, where the sample container comprises an optically clear plastic. In one specific embodiment, the plastic is comprised of polypropylene and/or polyethylene. Real-time PCR instruments, such as the BioRad DNA Engine and the Opticon 2 Real-Time PCR Detection System are examples of instruments that use this type of tube for a sample requiring a fluorophore for detection. This type of instrument and the corresponding tubes are in common use, and thus the tubes are readily available from many sources.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0086">The device of the present invention also comprises a photodetector. The photodetector can be any device that is capable of accepting an optical signal and producing an electrical signal containing the same information as in the optical signal. Examples of photodetectors that may be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, photoresistors, photovoltaic cells, photodiodes, photomultipliers, phototubes, phototransistors and pyroelectric devices that detect changes in temperature due to illumination.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0087">The device of the present invention also comprises one or more analyte sensing elements. Each of the analyte sensing elements of the present invention comprise a particular combination of 1) an energy source which itself may emit a restricted range of wavelengths of electromagnetic energy, 2) an &#x201c;excitation filter&#x201d; which is capable of isolating a range of wavelength of electromagnetic energy, such as but not limited to light, and 3) an &#x201c;emission filter&#x201d; that is capable of isolating a range of wavelength of electromagnetic energy that is emitted from the sample. Upon excitation by energy from the energy source, the sample will, generally speaking, emit a form of electromagnetic energy, such as, but not limited to light that can be generated by fluorescence, phosphorescence or luminescence. In one embodiment of the present invention, the device comprises a single analyte sensing element (ASE). In another embodiment, the device comprises more than ASE. In a more particular embodiment, the device comprises two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten or more ASEs. If the device comprises more than one ASE, then the multiple ASEs may share one or more individual components of the ASEs. Thus, for example, when a device of the present invention comprises two ASEs, these ASEs may share an energy source and have separate emission filters and excitation filters. To continue the example, the ASEs may share an energy source and an emission filter and have separate excitation filters. Of course, in one embodiment, the device of the present invention may comprise more than one distinct ASE, where the distinct ASEs share neither an energy source nor an emission filter nor an excitation filter. In a more particular embodiment, the device comprises more than one ASE where none of components of the ASEs are shared, although they may be integrated into or connected to the same computer processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0088">As used herein, an energy source is a source of electromagnetic energy and includes any type of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum including, but not limited to, radio energy, microwave energy, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-ray light and even gamma radiation. In one embodiment, the energy emitted from the energy source is visible light. In a more particular embodiment, a peak wavelength of visible light is emitted from the energy source. For example, the peak wavelength of visible light may be, but is not limited to, between 400 nm and 450 nm, or between 425 and 475 nm, or between 450 nm and 500 nm, or between 475 nm and 525 nm, or between 500 nm and 550 nm, or between 525 and 575 nm, or between 550 nm and 600 nm, or between 575 nm and 625 nm, or between 600 nm and 650 nm, or between 625 and 675 nm, or between 650 nm and 700 nm, or between 675 nm and 725 nm. These peak wavelengths ideally correspond to the optimal excitation wavelength of the report molecule of choice for detection of a predetermined analyte. In another embodiment the peak wavelengths correspond to the optimal wavelength to product autofluorescence from the predetermined analyte. In yet another embodiment the peak wavelength correspond to the optimal wavelength for measuring light scatter from the predetermined analyte.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0089">The energy source can be any device or composition that is capable of emitting electromagnetic energy. Examples of energy sources include, but are not limited to light emitting diodes (LED), incandescent light bulbs, gas discharge lamps (e.g., helium, krypton, neon, argon, sodium vapor and nitrogen), a laser, a maser, free charged particles such as ions, accelerated particles, chemiluminescent chemicals, fluorescent substances, and phosphorescent substances. In one particular embodiment, the energy source is at least one light emitting diode. In another particular embodiment, the energy source is more than one light emitting diode. In a more particular embodiment, the energy source is a single light emitting diode that emits visible light. In an even more particular embodiment, the energy source is one or more light emitting diodes that emits visible light with a predetermined peak wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0090">Another component of the ASE of the present invention includes at least one emission filter and one excitation filter. As used herein, an excitation filter is a filter that is placed in between the energy source and the sample such that the energy emitted from the energy source is filtered prior to striking the sample. As used herein, the emission filter is a filter that is placed in between the sample and the photodetector such that the energy emitted from the sample is filtered prior to striking the photodetector. In general, filters act to exclude (filter out) certain wavelengths of electromagnetic energy from passing through the filter. Filters may exclude wavelengths of electromagnetic energy below or above a specific wavelength. For example, a filter can exclude all wavelengths of light below 650 nm or all wavelengths above 490 nm. Filters may also exclude electromagnetic energy within a specific range of wavelengths. For example, a filter may exclude all wavelengths of light except for light with a wavelength in between about 520 nm and about 580 nm. The selection of an appropriate filter for use with the energy source should be readily apparent. In one specific embodiment, the ASE comprises an energy source that emits light, an excitation filter that filters out light of wavelengths greater than about 490 nm and an emission filter than filters out light of wavelengths less than about 520 nm and greater than about 580 nm. In another specific embodiment, the ASE comprises an energy source that emits light, an excitation filter that filters out light of wavelengths less than 570 nm and greater than about 647 nm and an emission filter than filters out light of wavelengths of less than about 565 nm. In yet another embodiment, the device comprises at least two ASEs where the first ASE comprises an energy source that emits light, an excitation filter that filters out light of wavelengths greater than about 490 nm and an emission filter than filters out light of wavelengths less than about 520 nm and greater than about 580 nm, and where the second ASE comprises an energy source that emits light, an excitation filter that filters out light of wavelengths less than 570 nm and greater than about 647 nm and an emission filter than filters out light of wavelengths of less than about 565 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0091">In one embodiment, the device comprises more than one ASE, and the multiple ASEs are configured in a spatial arrangement such that the core components of the ASEs do not move. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example of a device with 2 ASEs, where the core components of the ASEs are centered on the sample receptacle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first ASE is comprised of components <b>201</b>, <b>203</b> and <b>207</b> and the second ASE is comprised of components <b>213</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>217</b>. In one example of this spatial configuration, energy (e.g., light) is emitted from energy source <b>201</b> (e.g., light emitting diode) and passes through excitation filter <b>203</b> before passing through the sample that is sitting in receptacle <b>205</b>. Once the light strikes the sample, the light emitted from the excited sample passes through emission filter <b>207</b> and is reflected by mirror <b>209</b> into or onto a photodetector <b>211</b>. Continuing this example, energy (e.g., light) is emitted from energy source <b>213</b> (e.g., light emitting diode) and passes through excitation filter <b>215</b> before passing through the sample that is sitting in receptacle <b>205</b>. Once the light strikes the sample, the light emitted from the excited sample passes through emission filter <b>217</b> and is reflected by mirror <b>219</b> into or onto a photodetector <b>211</b>. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, mirrors may or may not be necessary to direct the energy beam into or onto the photodetector, depending on the spatial relationship between the energy emitted from the excited sample and the photodetector. Thus, one or more mirrors are optional and may be present in some specific embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0092">The devices of the present invention also comprise a computer processing unit. The processor controls the operation of the device and also provides control of various functionalities of the device. The processor can be a central processor that controls functionality via a bus structure or other communications interface. The processor can also be implemented by distributing the processing functions among one or more of the various components utilized to implement the functionalities of the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0093">One component of the computer processing unit will include memory. Memory is used to provide storage for program data or other data used by computer processing unit during operation and can be implemented using various RAM or ROM memory devices. Memory can be used for example, to store operating instructions and to provide memory registers for operating and storage.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0094">Memory can also be used in conjunction with a storage device such as, but not limited to, a disk storage device or a flash memory device. A storage device can also be used to store program instructions, control and calibration curves, operational data, history logs, and other data which may be desired to be stored within the device. Alternatively, the storage device, if one is present, need not be within the device. In one embodiment, the storage device will not store large amounts of data, but the data or instructions it stores is capable of being accessed frequently and rapidly. In another embodiment, a cache is present to minimize latencies associated with retrieving frequently used data or instructions from the storage device. In more specific embodiments, the storage device may store less 1 gigabyte (GB), less than 500 megabytes (MB), less than 250 MB, less than 100 MB, less than 50 MB, less than 20 MB, less than 10 MB, less than 9 MB, less than 8 MB, less than 7 MB, less than 6 MB, less than 5 MB, less than 4 MB, less than 3 MB, less than 2 MB or less than 1 MB of data and/or instructions. In another specific embodiment, the storage device may store large amounts of data, for example 1 GB or more of data.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0095">The memory of the device will comprise machine executable instructions. The machine executable instructions control the operation of the ASEs within the device. For example, the machine executable instructions are configured to select an appropriate ASE, depending on the particular analyte being measured. Thus, in one particular embodiment the device comprises more than one ASE and comprises machine executable instructions. The end-user can select and input into the device the specific analyte to be measured and, in turn, the machine executable instructions will select and utilize the proper ASE within the device to measure the selected analyte. In a particular embodiment, the ASE has been optimized for use with a specific reporter molecule, which is used to measure the selected analyte.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0096">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the end-user may select a specific analyte to be measured by the device and the machine executable instructions will determine which ASE to utilize. If one particular analyte is chosen, the machine executable instructions will operate to turn on power to energy source <b>201</b> and photodetector <b>209</b>, but not energy source <b>211</b> or photodetector <b>217</b>. Energy from energy source <b>201</b> will pass through excitation filter <b>203</b> and strike the sample sitting in receptacle <b>205</b>. Energy emitted from the sample will then pass through emission filter <b>207</b> before traveling to photodetector <b>209</b>. If the end-user then chooses a different analyte to measure, the machine executable instructions will operate to turn on power to energy source <b>211</b> and photodetector <b>217</b>, but not energy source <b>201</b> or photodetector <b>209</b>. Energy from energy source <b>211</b> will pass through excitation filter <b>213</b> and strike the sample sitting in receptacle <b>205</b>. Energy emitted from the sample will then pass through emission filter <b>215</b> before traveling to photodetector in <b>217</b>. In this sense, the machine executable instructions are capable of being configured to select the proper ASE that corresponds to the analyte being measured.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0097">In another embodiment, the machine executable instructions are configured such that they are capable of selecting the analyte to be measured, without end-user input. In this embodiment, the end-used will simply place the sample container in receptacle <b>205</b>. Once in place, the machine executable instructions may or may not perform one or a series of operations to determine the most appropriate ASE to use to analyze the sample. Once the machine executable instructions select the proper ASE that corresponds to the analyte within the sample, the machine executable instructions then performs the assay to determine analyte concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0098">In yet another embodiment, the machine executable instructions may also comprise calibration data, such as but not limited to, calibration curve data, internal standard data and the like. For example, the calibration data may be written into the machine executable instructions such that there is not a need for the end-user to acquire blank and standard measurement data. The machine executable instructions may thus allow the device to be calibrated prior to the first use of an end-user. And the machine executable instructions may also allow the device to be entirely &#x201c;calibration free&#x201d; in relation to the end-user.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0099">In another embodiment the device monitors and quantifies multiple analytes in the same sample by, for example, labeling analytes with different dyes and then exciting and/or filtering emission spectra at particular wavelengths such that the dye/analyte of interest can be distinctly monitored in the presence of other dyes/analytes. Accordingly, a particular embodiment of the present invention provides for simultaneous monitoring of multiple analytes, such as by concomitant detection of multiple dyes/analytes in a single sample.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0100">The devices of the present invention are designed to measure the quantity of multiple analytes in a sample. The devices may be designed to measure the multiple analytes simultaneously, or the devices may be configured to measure the analytes &#x201c;one at a time.&#x201d; The analytes to be quantified may be any analyte, provided the device is configured to measure the specific analyte desired. As used herein, an analyte is a chemical, composition or an organism in a sample that is to be analyzed. Examples of analytes to be quantified include, but are not limited to nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, proteolipids, lipoproteins, metal ions, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and viral particles. In one specific embodiment, the device is capable of quantifying DNA, RNA, eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, and protein.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0101">In one embodiment the selected analyte is measured using a reporter molecule.

The term &#x201c;chromophore&#x201d; as used herein refers to a label that emits and/or reflects light in the visible spectra that can be observed without the aid of instrumentation. The term &#x201c;fluorophore&#x201d; as used herein refers to a composition that is inherently fluorescent or demonstrates a change in fluorescence upon binding to a biological compound, i.e. can be fluorogenic or the intensity can be diminished by quenching. Fluorophores may contain substitutents that alter the solubility, spectral properties or physical properties of the fluorophore. Numerous fluorophores are known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to coumarin, cyanine, benzofuran, a quinoline, a quinazolinone, an indole, a benzazole, a borapolyazaindacene and xanthenes including fluoroscein, rhodamine and rhodol as well as other fluorophores described in RICHARD P.

<p id="p-0087" num="0102">Numerous fluorogenic and colorimetric enzyme substrates exist for the amplification of a signal as well as substrates used to directly detect the function of an anlyte, e.g. enzymes that cleave the substrate resulting in a detectable signal. Both are included in the present invention for the detection of a predetermined analyte. In the case of the enzyme substrate used to amplify the signal the analyte is associated with an enzyme. In the case where the enzyme substrate directly detects the ananlyte, the analyte is the enzyme.

Peroxidase substrates that are tyramides (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,196,306; 5,583,001 and 5,731,158) represent a unique class of peroxidase substrates in that they can be intrinsically detectable before action of the enzyme but are &#x201c;fixed in place&#x201d; by the action of a peroxidase in the process described as tyramide signal amplification (TSA). These substrates are extensively utilized to label targets in samples that are cells, tissues or arrays for their subsequent detection by microscopy, flow cytometry, optical scanning and fluorometry.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0107">Enzymes and their appropriate substrates that produce chemiluminescence are preferred for some assays. These include, but are not limited to, natural and recombinant forms of luciferases and aequorins. Chemiluminescence-producing substrates for phosphatases, glycosidases and oxidases such as those containing stable dioxetanes, luminol, isoluminol and acridinium esters are additionally useful.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0108">In addition to enzymes, haptens such as biotin are also preferred labels. Biotin is useful because it can function in an enzyme system to further amplify the detectable signal, and it can function as a tag to be used in affinity chromatography for isolation purposes. For detection purposes, an enzyme conjugate that has affinity for biotin is used, such as avidin-HRP. Subsequently a peroxidase substrate is added to produce a detectable signal.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0109">Haptens also include hormones, naturally occurring and synthetic drugs, pollutants, allergens, affector molecules, growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, lymphokines, amino acids, peptides, chemical intermediates, nucleotides and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0110">In a separate embodiment the reporter molecule is a dye or label that is conjugated to a specific binding partner, wherein the specific binding partner binds to the analyte or a molecule covalently attached to the analyte. The term &#x201c;label&#x201d; as used herein refers to a chemical moiety or protein that retains it's native properties (e.g. spectral properties, conformation and activity) when attached to a labeling reagent and used in the present methods. The label can be directly detectable (fluorophore) or indirectly detectable (hapten or enzyme). Such labels include, but are not limited to, radiolabels that can be measured with radiation-counting devices; pigments, dyes or other chromogens that can be visually observed or measured with a spectrophotometer; spin labels that can be measured with a spin label analyzer; and fluorescent labels (fluorophores), where the output signal is generated by the excitation of a suitable molecular adduct and that can be visualized by excitation with light that is absorbed by the dye or can be measured with standard fluorometers or imaging systems, for example. The label can be a chemiluminescent substance, where the output signal is generated by chemical modification of the signal compound; a metal-containing substance; or an enzyme, where there occurs an enzyme-dependent secondary generation of signal, such as the formation of a colored product from a colorless substrate. The term label can also refer to a &#x201c;tag&#x201d; or hapten that can bind selectively to a conjugated molecule such that the conjugated molecule, when added subsequently along with a substrate, is used to generate a detectable signal. For example, one can use biotin as a tag and then use an avidin or streptavidin conjugate of horseradish peroxidate (HRP) to bind to the tag, and then use a colorimetric substrate (e.g., tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)) or a fluorogenic substrate such as Amplex Red reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to detect the presence of HRP. Numerous labels are know by those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, particles, fluorophores, haptens, enzymes and their colorimetric, fluorogenic and chemiluminescent substrates and other labels that are described in RICHARD P. HAUGLAND, MOLECULAR PROBES HANDBOOK OF FLUORESCENT PROBES AND RESEARCH PRODUCTS (9<sup>th </sup>edition, CD-ROM, September 2002), supra.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0111">Typically the label would be an antibody, antigen, biotin or streptavidin, all conjugates typically used in an immunoassay. However, there is no intended limitation of the specific binding partner that can be conjugated to a label and used in the present methods to detect a target analyte.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0113">In a particular aspect the carrier molecule is an antibody fragment, such as, but not limited to, anti-Fc, an anti-Fc isotype, anti-J chain, anti-kappa light chain, anti-lambda light chain, or a single-chain fragment variable protein; or a non-antibody peptide or protein, such as, for example but not limited to, soluble Fc receptor, protein G, protein A, protein L, lectins, or a fragment thereof. In one aspect the carrier molecule is a Fab fragment specific to the Fc portion of the target-binding antibody or to an isotype of the Fc portion of the target-binding antibody (U.S. Ser. No. 10/118,204). The monovalent Fab fragments are typically produced from either murine monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies generated in a variety of animals, for example but not limited to, rabbit or goat. These fragments can be generated from any isotype such as murine IgM, IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2a</sub>, IgG<sub>2b </sub>or IgG<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0114">Alternatively, a non-antibody protein or peptide such as protein G, or other suitable proteins, can be used alone or coupled with albumin. Preferred albumins include human and bovine serum albumins or ovalbumin. Protein A, G and L are defined to include those proteins known to one skilled in the art or derivatives thereof that comprise at least one binding domain for IgG, i.e. proteins that have affinity for IgG. These proteins can be modified but do not need to be and are conjugated to a reactive label in the same manner as the other carrier molecules of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0115">In another aspect the carrier molecule is a whole intact antibody. Antibody is a term of the art denoting the soluble substance or molecule secreted or produced by an animal in response to an antigen, and which has the particular property of combining specifically with the antigen that induced its formation. Antibodies themselves also serve are antigens or immunogens because they are glycoproteins and therefore are used to generate anti-species antibodies. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are classified into five distinct classes&#x2014;IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE. The basic IgG immunoglobulin structure consists of two identical light polypeptide chains and two identical heavy polypeptide chains (linked together by disulfide bonds).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0116">When IgG is treated with the enzyme papain a monovalent antigen-binding fragment can be isolated, referred herein to as a Fab fragment. When IgG is treated with pepsin (another proteolytic enzyme), a larger fragment is produced, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>. This fragment can be split in half by treating with a mild reducing buffer that results in the monovalent Fab&#x2032; fragment. The Fab&#x2032; fragment is slightly larger than the Fab and contains one or more free sulfhydryls from the hinge region (which are not found in the smaller Fab fragment). The term &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; is used herein to define the Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>and Fab portions of the antibody. It is well known in the art to treat antibody molecules with pepsin and papain in order to produce antibody fragments (Gorevic et al., Methods of Enzyol., 116:3 (1985)).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0117">The monovalent Fab fragments of the present invention are produced from either murine monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies generated in a variety of animals that have been immunized with a foreign antibody or fragment thereof, U.S. Pat. No. 4,196,265 discloses a method of producing monoclonal antibodies. Typically, secondary antibodies are derived from a polyclonal antibody that has been produced in a rabbit or goat but any animal known to one skilled in the art to produce polyclonal antibodies can be used to generate anti-species antibodies. The term &#x201c;primary antibody&#x201d; describes an antibody that binds directly to the antigen as opposed to a &#x201c;secondary antibody&#x201d; that binds to a region of the primary antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are equal, and in some cases, preferred over polyclonal antibodies provided that the ligand-binding antibody is compatible with the monoclonal antibodies that are typically produced from murine hybridoma cell lines using methods well known to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0118">In one aspect the antibodies are generated against only the Fc region of a foreign antibody. Essentially, the animal is immunized with only the Fc region fragment of a foreign antibody, such as murine. The polyclonal antibodies are collected from subsequent bleeds, digested with an enzyme, pepsin or papain, to produce monovalent fragments. The fragments are then affinity purified on a column comprising whole immunoglobulin protein that the animal was immunized against or just the Fc fragments.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0119">The labels of the present invention include any directly or indirectly detectable label known by one skilled in the art that can be covalently attached to a specific binding partner. Labels include, without limitation, a chromophore, a fluorophore, a fluorescent protein, a phosphorescent dye, a tandem dye, a particle, a hapten, an enzyme and a radioisotope. Preferred labels include fluorophores, fluorescent proteins, haptens, and enzymes.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0120">A fluorophore of the present invention is any chemical moiety that exhibits an absorption maximum beyond 280 nm, and when covalently attached to a labeling reagent retains its spectral properties. Fluorophores of the present invention include, without limitation; a pyrene (including any of the corresponding derivative compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,132,432), an anthracene, a naphthalene, an acridine, a stilbene, an indole or benzindole, an oxazole or benzoxazole, a thiazole or benzothiazole, a 4-amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD), a cyanine (including any corresponding compounds in U.S. Ser.

Nos. 4,774,339; 5,187,288; 5,248,782; 5,274,113; and 5,433,896), a xanthene (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,931; 6,130,101; 6,229,055; 6,339,392; 5,451,343 and U.S. Ser. No. 09/922,333), an oxazine (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,714,763) or a benzoxazine, a carbazine (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,810,636), a phenalenone, a coumarin (including an corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,696,157; 5,459,276; 5,501,980 and 5,830,912), a benzofuran (including an corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,603,209 and 4,849,362) and benzphenalenone (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,812,409) and derivatives thereof. As used herein, oxazines include resorufins (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,242,805), aminooxazinones, diaminooxazines, and their benzo-substituted analogs.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0121">When the fluorophore is a xanthene, the fluorophore is optionally a fluorescein, a rhodol (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,487 and 5,442,045), or a rhodamine (including any corresponding compounds in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,798,276; 5,846,737; U.S. Ser. No. 09/129,015). As used herein, fluorescein includes benzo- or dibenzofluoresceins, seminaphthofluoresceins, or naphthofluoresceins. Similarly, as used herein rhodol includes seminaphthorhodafluors (including any corresponding compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,171). Alternatively, the fluorophore is a xanthene that is bound via a linkage that is a single covalent bond at the 9-position of the xanthene. Preferred xanthenes include derivatives of 3H-xanthen-6-ol-3-one attached at the 9-position, derivatives of 6-amino-3H-xanthen-3-one attached at the 9-position, or derivatives of 6-amino-3H-xanthen-3-imine attached at the 9-position.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0122">Preferred fluorophores of the invention include xanthene (rhodol, rhodamine, fluorescein and derivatives thereof) coumarin, cyanine, pyrene, oxazine and borapolyazaindacene. Most preferred are sulfonated xanthenes, fluorinated xanthenes, sulfonated coumarins, fluorinated coumarins and sulfonated cyanines. The choice of the fluorophore attached to the specific binding partner will determine the absorption and fluorescence emission properties of the reporter molecule and subsequent selection of the ASE. Physical properties of a fluorophore label include spectral characteristics (absorption, emission and stokes shift), fluorescence intensity, lifetime, polarization and photo-bleaching rate all of which can be used to distinguish one fluorophore from another.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0123">Typically the fluorophore contains one or more aromatic or heteroaromatic rings, that are optionally substituted one or more times by a variety of substituents, including without limitation, halogen, nitro, cyano, alkyl, perfluoroalkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, arylalkyl, acyl, aryl or heteroaryl ring system, benzo, or other substituents typically present on fluorophores known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0124">In one aspect of the invention, the fluorophore has an absorption maximum beyond 480 nm. In a particularly useful embodiment, the fluorophore absorbs at or near 488 nm to 514 nm (particularly suitable for excitation by the output of the argon-ion laser excitation source) or near 546 nm (particularly suitable for excitation by a mercury arc lamp).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0125">Many of fluorophores can also function as chromophores and thus the described fluorophores are also preferred chromophores of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0126">Fluorescent proteins may also find use as labels in the present invention. Examples of fluorescent proteins include green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the phycobiliproteins and the derivatives thereof. The fluorescent proteins, especially phycobiliprotein, are particularly useful for creating tandem dye labeled labeling reagents. These tandem dyes comprise a fluorescent protein and a fluorophore for the purposes of obtaining a larger stokes shift wherein the emission spectra is farther shifted from the wavelength of the fluorescent protein's absorption spectra. This is particularly advantageous for detecting a low quantity of a target in a sample wherein the emitted fluorescent light is maximally optimized, in other words little to none of the emitted light is reabsorbed by the fluorescent protein. For this to work, the fluorescent protein and fluorophore function as an energy transfer pair wherein the fluorescent protein emits at the wavelength that the fluorophore absorbs at and the fluorphore then emits at a wavelength farther from the fluorescent proteins than could have been obtained with only the fluorescent protein. A particularly useful combination is the phycobiliproteins disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,520,110; 4,859,582; 5,055,556, and the sulforhodamine fluorophores disclosed in 5,798,276, or the sulfonated cyanine fluorophores disclosed in U.S. Ser. Nos. 09/968,401 and 09/969,853; or the sulfonated xanthene derivatives disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,101, and those combinations disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,542,104. Alternatively, the fluorophore functions as the energy donor and the fluorescent protein is the energy acceptor.</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0172">AIDS Diagnostic Test Device</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0173">Recent advances in CD4 diagnostic assays allow 2 simple reagents for use in identifying and counting two cell populations in whole blood, which is compatible with a simple fluorometer with 2 channels. The use of simple separations mechanism, such as a hand-crank centrifuge, simple cell filters or magnetic beads, separates the cells to be counted from the reagents. These 3 components comprise the AIDS Diagnostic Platform for Use in Remote Areas (ADPURA).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0174">The key biochemical reagents for this application are the anti-CD4 antibody and the anti-CD45 antibody. These two antibodies are the basis for the PLG method (Glencross et al (2002) CD45 assisted panleucogating for accurate, cost effective dual platform CD4+ T cell enumeration, Cytometry Clinical Cytometry, Special Issue: CD4: 20 years and counting: 50 (2) 69-77) measures CD4+ cells using CD45-expressing cells (all white blood cells) for normalization. Using the two antibodies together (anti-CD4 antibody and anti-CD45 antibody) makes the CD4 count as simple as taking the ratio between CD4-expressing cells and CD45 expressing cells.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0175">In one embodiment of the present invention, the following components are used together:
<ul id="ul0021" list-style="none">

        <li id="ul0022-0001" num="0176">a) A fluorometer having 2 detection channels, each comprised of an LED, an emission filter and a photodiode detector. The fluorometer has a user-interface and data analysis on a CPU (central processing unit) on a printed circuit board. The body is robust and can withstand environments with wind, sand and water present, different LEDs and emission filters, a streamlined user interface and fewer buttons. In addition, the fluorometer may work off of either a battery, handcrank or other power source not requiring a plug into an electric grid infrastructure. The fluorometer is designed for one purpose only, in which case the user-interface is simplified to express the result of the reading and one button only would be needed to activate the instrument to perform a reading. Alternatively, multiple diagnostic applications can be performed, with new applications capable of being loaded onto the instrument using a &#x201c;thumb drive&#x201d; with a USB connection.</li>
        <li id="ul0022-0002" num="0177">b) A reagent kit, which includes CD4 antibodies, labeled with a fluorescent dye, such as AlexaFluor 488 dye and CD45 antibodies, labeled with a fluorescent dye spectrally distinct from the CD4 label, such as Alexa Fluor 647 dye. The antibodies would ideally be stabilized for transport in hot or cold conditions, perhaps lyophilized, or perhaps an azide. Some alternate antibody-stabilization technology exists, which could be employed. The antibodies would be at the appropriate concentrations and in the appropriate containers to allow simple addition to the sample by person with little scientific training.</li>

The centrifuge would be similar in principle to current hand-crank centrifuges on the market, but modified to use 500-uL plastic tubes, to be enclosed for operator safety as well as sample integrity, to be of a size similar to current tabletop &#x201c;picofuges,&#x201d; and to be compatible with field conditions.</li>

        <li id="ul0025-0003" num="0187">c. Third, a separation method will be employed to remove the free labeled antibodies from the labeled cells.

            <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0188">i. If this method uses the magnetic beads, a magnet will be used to remove the CD4+ and CD45+ cells from the sample.

The beads will then be removed, for example, by using DetachaBead technology, applying the magnet to pull out the beads, leaving the labeled cells in the supernatant.</li>
            <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0189">ii. If the method uses a centrifuge, the sample will be spun in the centrifuge to pellet the labeled cells. The supernatant containing free labeled antibodies will be discarded and the cells resuspended in buffer.</li>
            <li id="ul0026-0003" num="0190">iii. If the method uses a filter, the sample will be applied to the filter, which will trap the labeled cells. The flow-through will be discarded and the labeled cells resuspended in buffer.</li>

        </li>
        <li id="ul0025-0004" num="0191">d. Fourth, the sample will be read using the fluorometer. The labeled cells from step c will be transferred to a 500 uL clear PCR tube and read in the fluorometer.

<p id="p-0140" num="0192">In another embodiment the calibrators may be analytes at a known concentration.

Nos. 6,214,560; 6,586,193 and 6,714,299]. These fluorescent nanocrystals can be semiconductor nanocrystals or doped metal oxide nanocrystals. Nanocrystals typically are comprised of a core comprised of at least one of a Group II-VI semiconductor material (of which ZnS, and CdSe are illustrative examples), or a Group III-V semiconductor material (of which GaAs is an illustrative example), a Group IV semiconductor material, or a combination thereof. The core can be passivated with a semiconductor overlayering (&#x201c;shell&#x201d;) uniformly deposited thereon. For example, a Group II-VI semiconductor core may be passivated with a Group II-VI semiconductor shell (e.g., a ZnS or CdSe core may be passivated with a shell comprised of YZ wherein Y is Cd or Zn, and Z is S, or Se). Nanocrystals can be soluble in an aqueous-based environment. An attractive feature of semiconductor nanocrystals is that the spectral range of emission can be changed by varying the size of the semiconductor core.</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0227">In one particular embodiment, the machine executable instructions perform a method of calculating the quantity of an analyte in a sample by generating a fluorescence standard curve and correlating the fluorescence intensity of the sample to a quantity of analyte using this fluorescence standard curve. In a more particular embodiment, the fluorescence standard curve can be generated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of a &#x201c;blank&#x201d; sample, i.e., a sample known to be without the analyte, (g) and measuring the fluorescence intensity of only one standard containing a known amount of the analyte (v). Of course, the fluorescence standard curve could be generated using more than one standard containing a known amount of the analyte. Once the fluorescence value of the blank and standard have been measured, the machine executable instructions can then generate the fluorescence standard curve. The fluorescence standard curve may have a predetermined degree of sigmoidicity (n) and curvature (k), prior to the measuring the blank and standard(s), and the machine executable instructions may possess these (k) and (n) values as part of the algorithm for generating the fluorescence standard curve. Once the machine executable instructions generate the fluorescence standard curve, the fluorescence intensity of a sample (y) can be measured and the (y) value can be correlated to an analyte quantity using the fluorescence standard curve.</p>
