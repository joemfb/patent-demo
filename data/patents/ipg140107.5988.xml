<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/694,541 filed on Jan. 27, 2010 incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following relates generally to protecting sensitive information stored on a mobile device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As mobile devices become more prevalent, it has become increasingly important to protect sensitive information stored on these devices. Many mobile devices can be configured to operate in a locked mode in which most or all of the applications and data on the mobile device are inaccessible through the user interface. Typically, a mobile device can be configured to enter locked mode automatically after a designated period of inactivity and/or by a manual prompt from the user. The mobile device can then only be unlocked using a secret password known only to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, even when a mobile device is locked, the data stored on the device may still be accessible by an interloper by physically extracting the relevant hardware from the device and using a separate computer to retrieve the data stored on the hardware. To address this problem, some mobile devices can be configured to encrypt the data stored on the device, so that even if the interloper is able to retrieve the data from the locked mobile device, the interloper will not be able to decrypt the data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In such applications, the data on the device is typically encrypted using a content protection key. For example, the content protection key can be a symmetric key stored on the device and used to encrypt and decrypt data on the device. When the device enters locked mode, a temporary symmetric key is generated from the user's password and is used to encrypt the content protection key. The temporary key is then destroyed. Therefore, an interloper is unable to decrypt encrypted data extracted from the device unless the interloper can first decrypt the content protection key. However, decrypting the content protection key requires the temporary symmetric key, which is directly derived from the user's password and can therefore only be created by the user supplying his password.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On some mobile devices, an asymmetric private/public key pair is used to protect data received by the mobile device while the mobile device is locked. Specifically, a public key is used to encrypt the received data, which can be subsequently decrypted using the corresponding private key. In mobile devices having this functionality, the private key is also encrypted using the temporary symmetric key generated from the user's password, thereby also preventing an interloper from decrypting the received data encrypted using the public key.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The security of the above techniques depends on the secrecy of the user's password. If the user divulges the password to the interloper (by force or by accident), or if the user is forced by the interloper to input his password, the interloper will be able to access the sensitive information on the device, even if it is encrypted using the techniques explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is desired to provide enhanced protection of sensitive information stored on a mobile device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, where considered appropriate, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art and having the benefit of the present disclosure that the embodiments described herein may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein. Also, the description is not to be considered as limiting the scope of the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It will also be appreciated that that any module, component, or device exemplified herein that executes instructions may include or otherwise have access to computer readable media such as storage media, computer storage media, or data storage devices (removable and/or non-removable) such as, for example, magnetic disks, optical disks, or tape. Computer storage media may include volatile and non-volatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Examples of computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by an application, module, or both. Any such computer storage media may be part of the device or accessible or connectable thereto. Any application or module herein described may be implemented using computer readable/executable instructions that may be stored or otherwise held by such computer readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be explained in detail below, in one embodiment, the mobile device includes a data protection module to receive a transmission including a secret key and utilize the secret key in encrypting data on the device. In an exemplary implementation of this embodiment, the secret key is transmitted from a trusted party to the mobile device in a secure transmission. After the secret key is used in encrypting the data, it is deleted by the data protection module. The secret key is unknown to the user, and in this way, the encrypted data cannot be decrypted, even using secret information possessed by the user, such as the user's password. Subsequent to an event detectable to the mobile device, for example, after a specified period of time or after an event that indicates that the mobile device is in an area safe from interlopers, the secret key is again received by the mobile device and is used in decrypting the encrypted data.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, in another embodiment, the secret key is combined with secret information provided by the user (e.g. the user's secret password) to form a new key, which is used in encrypting the data on the device. The secret key may instead be combined with a pre-existing data string stored on the device to form the new key. Once the data is encrypted, the new key and the secret key are both deleted. Afterwards, once the mobile device is in an area safe from interlopers, the secret key is again received by the mobile device. The secret password provided by the user (or alternatively the pre-existing string stored on the device) is again combined with the secret key to derive the new key, which is then used to decrypt the data on the device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The data may be one or more content protection key(s) used in encrypting and decrypting sensitive information on the device, or may be the sensitive information itself.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As will also be explained in more detail below, in another embodiment, the secret key is an asymmetric private key, and therefore the data protection module instead uses the corresponding public key to encrypt the data. Then, subsequent to the event detectable to the mobile device, for example, once the mobile device is in an area safe from interlopers, the asymmetric private key is transmitted to the data protection module and is used to decrypt the encrypted data. Advantageously, the public key may be combined with secret information provided by a user, or by a pre-existing data string stored on the device, to form a new public key, in which case the corresponding private key would need to be similarly modified by the data protection module to correspond to the new public key.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments will now be described with reference to the figures. In the following embodiments, the mobile device is considered to be a two-way communication device with advanced data communication capabilities including the capability to communicate with other mobile devices or computer systems through a network of transceiver stations. Examples of applicable mobile devices include pagers, cellular phones, cellular smart-phones, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants, computers, laptops, handheld wireless communication devices, wirelessly enabled notebook computers and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an example system diagram showing the redirection of user data items (such as message A or C) from a corporate enterprise computer system (host system) <b>250</b> to a mobile device <b>100</b> via a wireless router <b>26</b>. The wireless router <b>26</b> provides the wireless connectivity functionality as it acts to both abstract most of the wireless network's <b>200</b> complexities, and it also implements features necessary to support pushing data to the mobile device <b>100</b>. Although not shown, a plurality of mobile devices may access data from the host system <b>250</b>. In this example, message A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents an internal message sent from, e.g. a desktop computer within the host system <b>250</b>, to any number of server computers in the corporate network (e.g. LAN), which may, in general, include a database server, a calendar server, an E-mail server or a voice-mail server.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Message C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represents an external message from a sender that is not directly connected to the host system <b>250</b>, such as the user's mobile device <b>100</b>, some other user's mobile device (not shown), or any user connected to the public or private network <b>224</b> (e.g. the Internet). Message C could be e-mail, voice-mail, calendar information, database updates, web-page updates or could even represent a command message from the user's mobile device <b>100</b> to the host system <b>250</b>. The host system <b>250</b> may comprise, along with the typical communication links, hardware and software associated with a corporate enterprise computer network system, one or more wireless mobility agents, a TCP/IP connection, a collection of datastores, (for example a data store for e-mail could be an off-the-shelf mail server like Microsoft Exchange&#xae; Server or Lotus Notes&#xae; Server), all within and behind a corporate firewall.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mobile device <b>100</b> may be adapted for communication within wireless network <b>200</b> via wireless links, as required by each wireless network <b>200</b> being used. As an illustrative example of the operation for a wireless router <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, consider a data item A, repackaged in outer envelope B (the packaged data item A now referred to as &#x201c;data item (A)&#x201d;) and sent to the mobile device <b>100</b> from an Application Service Provider (ASP) in the host system <b>250</b>. Within the ASP is a computer program, similar to a wireless mobility agent, running on any computer in the ASP's environment that is sending requested data items from a data store to a mobile device <b>100</b>. The mobile-destined data item (A) is routed through the network <b>224</b>, and through a firewall protecting the wireless router <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the above describes the host system <b>250</b> as being used within a corporate enterprise network environment, this is just one embodiment of one type of host service that offers push-based messages for a handheld wireless device that is capable of notifying and preferably presenting the data to the user in real-time at the mobile device when data arrives at the host system.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">By offering a wireless router <b>26</b> (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;relay&#x201d;), there are a number of advantages to both the host system <b>250</b> and the wireless network <b>200</b>. The host system <b>250</b> in general runs a host service that is considered to be any computer program that is running on one or more computer systems. The host service is said to be running on a host system <b>250</b>, and one host system <b>250</b> can support any number of host services. A host service may or may not be aware of the fact that information is being channelled to mobile devices <b>100</b>. For example an e-mail or message program <b>138</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) might be receiving and processing e-mail while an associated program (e.g. an e-mail wireless mobility agent) is also monitoring the mailbox for the user and forwarding or pushing the same e-mail to a wireless device <b>100</b>. A host service might also be modified to prepare and exchange information with mobile devices <b>100</b> via the wireless router <b>26</b>, like customer relationship management software. In a third example, there might be a common access to a range of host services. For example a mobility agent might offer a Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) connection to several databases.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The host system <b>250</b> shown herein has many methods when establishing a communication link to the wireless router <b>26</b>. For one skilled in the art of data communications the host system <b>250</b> could use connection protocols like TCP/IP, X.25, Frame Relay, ISDN, ATM or many other protocols to establish a point-to-point connection. Over this connection there are several tunneling methods available to package and send the data, some of these include: HTTP/HTML, HTTP/XML, HTTP/Proprietary, FTP, SMTP or some other proprietary data exchange protocol. The type of host systems <b>250</b> that might employ the wireless router <b>26</b> to perform push could include: field service applications, e-mail services, stock quote services, banking services, stock trading services, field sales applications, advertising messages and many others. This wireless network <b>200</b> abstraction is made possible by the wireless router <b>26</b>, which implements this routing and push functionality. The type of user-selected data items being exchanged by the host could include: E-mail messages, calendar events, meeting notifications, address entries, journal entries, personal alerts, alarms, warnings, stock quotes, news bulletins, bank account transactions, field service updates, stock trades, heart-monitoring information, vending machine stock levels, meter reading data, GPS data, etc., but could, alternatively, include any other type of message that is transmitted to the host system <b>250</b>, or that the host system <b>250</b> acquires through the use of intelligent agents, such as data that is received after the host system <b>250</b> initiates a search of a database or a website or a bulletin board.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wireless router <b>26</b> provides a range of services to make creating a push-based host service possible. Examples of wireless networks protocols for communicating between mobile device <b>100</b> and wireless router <b>26</b> include: (1) Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), (2) the Groupe Special Mobile or the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and (3) the upcoming third-generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) network protocols like EDGE, UMTS and HSDPA, LTE, Wi-Max etc. Some older examples of data-centric networks include, but are not limited to: (1) the Mobitex Radio Network (&#x201c;Mobitex&#x201d;) and (2) the DataTAC Radio Network (&#x201c;DataTAC&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To be effective in providing push services for host systems <b>250</b>, the wireless router <b>26</b> may implement a set of defined functions. It can be appreciated that one could select many different hardware configurations for the wireless router <b>26</b>, however, many of the same or similar set of features would likely be present in the different configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown therein is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a mobile device <b>100</b>. The mobile device <b>100</b> comprises a number of components such as a main processor <b>102</b> that controls the overall operation of the mobile device <b>100</b>. Communication functions, including data and voice communications, are performed through a communication subsystem <b>104</b>. The communication subsystem <b>104</b> receives messages from and sends messages to each wireless network <b>200</b>. Each wireless link connecting the communication subsystem <b>104</b> with each wireless network <b>200</b> represents one or more different Radio Frequency (RF) channels, operating according to defined protocols specified for the particular network.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The main processor <b>102</b> also interacts with additional subsystems such as a Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>106</b>, a flash memory <b>108</b>, a display <b>110</b>, an auxiliary input/output (I/O) subsystem <b>112</b>, a data port <b>114</b>, a keyboard <b>116</b>, a speaker <b>118</b>, a microphone <b>120</b>, a GPS receiver <b>121</b>, short-range communications <b>122</b>, and other device subsystems <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some of the subsystems of the mobile device <b>100</b> perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide &#x201c;resident&#x201d; or on-device functions. By way of example, the display <b>110</b> and the keyboard <b>116</b> may be used for both communication-related functions, such as entering a text message for transmission over a network <b>200</b>, and device-resident functions such as a calculator or task list.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The mobile device <b>100</b> can send and receive communication signals over a wireless network <b>200</b> after required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Network access is associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device <b>100</b>. To identify a subscriber, the mobile device <b>100</b> may use a subscriber module component or &#x201c;smart card&#x201d; <b>126</b>, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), a Removable User Identity Module (RUIM) or a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM). In the example shown, a SIM/RUIM/USIM <b>126</b> is to be inserted into a SIM/RUIM/USIM interface <b>128</b> in order to communicate with a network. Without the component <b>126</b>, the mobile device <b>100</b> is not fully operational for communication with the associated wireless network <b>200</b>. Once the SIM/RUIM/USIM <b>126</b> is inserted into the SIM/RUIM/USIM interface <b>128</b>, it is coupled to the main processor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mobile device <b>100</b> is a battery-powered device and therefore includes a battery interface <b>132</b> for receiving one or more rechargeable batteries <b>130</b>. In at least some embodiments, the battery <b>130</b> can be a smart battery with an embedded microprocessor. The battery interface <b>132</b> is coupled to a regulator (not shown), which assists the battery <b>130</b> in providing power V+ to the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The mobile device <b>100</b> also includes an operating system <b>134</b> and software components, such as <b>136</b> to <b>146</b>, which are described in more detail below. The operating system <b>134</b> and the software components <b>136</b> to <b>146</b> that are executed by the main processor <b>102</b> are typically stored in a persistent store such as the flash memory <b>108</b>, which may alternatively be a read-only memory (ROM) or similar storage element (not shown). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that portions of the operating system <b>134</b> and the software components <b>136</b> to <b>146</b>, such as specific device applications, or parts thereof, may be temporarily loaded into a volatile store such as the RAM <b>106</b>. Other software components can also be included, as is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The subset of software applications <b>136</b> that control basic device operations, including data and voice communication applications, may be installed on the mobile device <b>100</b> during its manufacture. Software applications may include a message application <b>138</b>, a device state module <b>142</b>, a Personal Information Manager (PIM) <b>143</b>, a connect module <b>144</b> and an IT policy module <b>146</b>. A message application <b>138</b> can be any suitable software program that allows a user of the mobile device <b>100</b> to send and receive electronic messages, wherein messages are typically stored in the flash memory <b>108</b> of the mobile device <b>100</b>. A device state module <b>142</b> provides persistence, i.e. the device state module <b>142</b> ensures that important device data is stored in persistent memory, such as the flash memory <b>108</b>, so that the data is not lost when the mobile device <b>100</b> is turned off or loses power. A PIM <b>143</b> includes functionality for organizing and managing data items of interest to the user, such as, but not limited to, e-mail, text messages, instant messages, contacts, calendar events, and voice mails, and may interact with the wireless network <b>200</b>. A connect module <b>144</b> implements the communication protocols that are required for the mobile device <b>100</b> to communicate with the wireless infrastructure and any host system <b>250</b>, such as an enterprise system, that the mobile device <b>100</b> is authorized to interface with. An IT policy module <b>146</b> receives IT policy data that encodes the IT policy, and may be responsible for organizing and securing rules such as the &#x201c;Set Maximum Password Attempts&#x201d; IT policy.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other types of software applications or components <b>139</b> can also be installed on the mobile device <b>100</b>. These software applications <b>139</b> can be pre-installed applications or third party applications, which are added after the manufacture of the mobile device <b>100</b>. Examples of third party applications include games, calculators, utilities, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The additional applications <b>139</b> can be loaded onto the mobile device <b>100</b> through at least one of a wireless network <b>200</b>, the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>112</b>, the data port <b>114</b>, the short-range communications subsystem <b>122</b>, or any other suitable device subsystem <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The data port <b>114</b> can be any suitable port that enables data communication between the mobile device <b>100</b> and another computing device. The data port <b>114</b> can be a serial or a parallel port. In some instances, the data port <b>114</b> can be a USB port that includes data lines for data transfer and a supply line that can provide a charging current to charge the battery <b>130</b> of the mobile device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For voice communications, received signals are output to the speaker <b>118</b>, and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone <b>120</b>. Although voice or audio signal output is accomplished primarily through the speaker <b>118</b>, the display <b>110</b> can also be used to provide additional information such as the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For composing data items, such as e-mail messages, for example, a user or subscriber could use the touch-sensitive overlay <b>34</b> on the display <b>32</b> that are part of the touch screen display <b>28</b>, in addition to possibly the auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>112</b>. The auxiliary I/O subsystem <b>112</b> may include devices such as: a mouse, track ball, infrared fingerprint detector, or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. A composed item may be transmitted over a wireless network <b>200</b> through the communication subsystem <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The subset of software applications <b>136</b> also includes a data protection unit or Data Protection Module <b>140</b>. As explained earlier, in one embodiment, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> is configured to receive a secret key, for example, from a trusted party remote from the mobile device <b>100</b>, and use this secret key in encrypting data on the device <b>100</b>. The secret key is preferably transmitted from the trusted party to the mobile device <b>100</b> in a secure transmission, for example, using encryption over the wireless channel <b>200</b>. However, in other embodiments, such as in embodiments in which the communication link cannot be secured using encryption, it is contemplated that the secret key can instead be sent as part of a message in plaintext, preferably using methods of hiding the key in the message, such as by spreading the key over a plurality of bytes that appear unrelated, but that are retrievable by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b>. Once the secret key is used in encrypting the data, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> deletes the secret key. After an event detectable by the mobile device <b>100</b>, for example, after a specified period of time or after an event that indicates that the mobile device <b>100</b> is in an area safe from interlopers, the secret key is again received by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> and is used in decrypting the data.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an alternative embodiment, the secret key is an asymmetrical private key having a corresponding public key, and therefore the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> instead uses the public key to encrypt the data. Subsequent to the detectable event, the asymmetric private key corresponding to the public key is received by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> and is used to decrypt the encrypted data.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Exemplary embodiments of this functionality will now be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A first embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, mobile device <b>100</b> includes a Data Protection Module <b>140</b>, which communicates with a trusted party <b>210</b> over the wireless network <b>200</b>. As will be explained below, in alternative embodiments, it is contemplated that the trusted party <b>210</b> can be within host system <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The trusted party <b>210</b> has stored in its memory <b>216</b> a secret key k<sub>s</sub>. The secret key k<sub>s </sub>is private to the trusted party <b>210</b>. As an example, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>may be randomly generated by the trusted party <b>210</b> using a random number generator (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mobile device <b>100</b> is configured to encrypt and decrypt using a content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>, which is stored in memory <b>212</b> on the mobile device <b>100</b>. The content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>is a symmetric key used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information on the mobile device. For example, the content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>can be a 256 bit AES symmetric key. The Data Protection Module <b>140</b> is able to access the content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>, as well as user input <b>214</b>, for example, in the form of typed data using key board <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mobile device <b>100</b> is configured to enter into locked mode by a manual prompt from the user using keyboard <b>116</b>, automatically after a period of inactivity, by a change in location, or by some other detectable event. As explained earlier, when the mobile device <b>100</b> is in locked mode, a user is prevented from accessing most, if not all, of the applications and information on the mobile device <b>100</b> through the user interface. For example, the mobile device <b>100</b> may prevent access to all applications except the ability to make emergency calls. As another example, during locked mode the mobile device may instead only allow the user to use the smart phone as a &#x201c;dumb&#x201d; phone, or limit certain applications, such as date books or other PIM applications.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once the device <b>100</b> is in locked mode, in normal operation it can only be unlocked using secret information provided by the user through a user interface, which is typically a password known only by the user and typed in using keyboard <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As the user carries the mobile device <b>100</b> during his or her travels, the mobile device <b>100</b> may be transported into an unsafe area in which there is a risk that an interloper could gain possession of the device <b>100</b> and extract from the user the user's password. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> advantageously provides enhanced protection of data stored on the mobile device <b>100</b> by using the secret key k<sub>s </sub>from the trusted party <b>210</b> in encrypting the data, such that the data cannot be accessed by the interloper, even with knowledge of the user's password.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As explained earlier, all devices exemplified herein that execute operations may include or otherwise have access to computer readable media such as storage media, computer storage media, or data storage devices. Therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can comprise a set of computer readable instructions stored on the mobile device <b>100</b> and executed by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">First, in step <b>402</b>, the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> requests that the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> encrypt sensitive information on the device using enhanced protection to ensure that the sensitive information cannot be decrypted by an interloper having knowledge of the user's secret password. The request is made through a user interface via user input <b>214</b>. As an example, a menu on the display <b>28</b> of the mobile device <b>100</b> can provide such an option and be selected by the user (not shown). The user also specifies, using keyboard <b>116</b>, a period of time in which the data is to remain encrypted in this manner. This period of time may equal, for example, the duration of time the mobile device <b>100</b> will remain in an area in which an interloper may gain access to the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, in step <b>404</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> sends a message to the trusted party <b>210</b> over wireless network <b>200</b> requesting the secret key k<sub>s </sub>stored in the memory <b>216</b> of the trusted party <b>210</b>. The trusted party <b>210</b> transmits the secret key k<sub>s </sub>to the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> over wireless network <b>200</b> using encryption to ensure the transmission is secure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>406</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> uses the content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>to encrypt sensitive information on the device.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, in step <b>408</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> combines the secret key k<sub>s </sub>with the user's password to derive a new key k<sub>new</sub>. The Data Protection Module <b>140</b> can retrieve the user's password by prompting the user to provide the password via the user interface or by accessing the user's password from memory. The user's secret password and the secret key k<sub>s </sub>provided by the trusted party <b>210</b> are combined by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to derive the new key k<sub>new</sub>. In an alternative embodiment, it is contemplated that instead, k<sub>new </sub>can be generated by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> by combining the secret key k<sub>s </sub>with a data string stored in memory of the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step <b>410</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> then uses the new key k<sub>new </sub>to encrypt both the content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>The new key k<sub>new </sub>and the secret key k<sub>s </sub>are then deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Then, in step <b>412</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> instructs the device <b>100</b> to go into a modified locked mode in which the user cannot unlock the device, even if the user inputs his or her secret password. The modified locked mode may still allow the user to access certain applications on the mobile device <b>100</b>, for example, the ability to make and receive calls.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Upon the completion of step <b>412</b>, the device <b>100</b> is therefore locked, the sensitive information is encrypted, and the content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>required to decrypt the sensitive information is encrypted by new key k<sub>new</sub>, which the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> has deleted. The user cannot unlock the device <b>100</b>, and even if an interloper steals or confiscates the device <b>100</b> and forces the user to divulge the user's secret password, the user's secret password cannot be used to decrypt content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>. Knowledge of the secret key k<sub>s </sub>is required to decrypt content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>, but secret key k<sub>s </sub>is only known by the trusted party <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The mobile device <b>100</b> remains in this mode of operation until the expiry of the period of time indicated by the user in step <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Upon the expiry of this period of time, in step <b>414</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> requests from the trusted party <b>210</b> another copy of the secret key k<sub>s</sub>, which is sent from the trusted party <b>210</b> to the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> in a secure transmission. In step <b>416</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> then instructs the mobile device <b>100</b> to return to regular locked mode, and the user is prompted to unlock the device <b>100</b> by supplying the user's secret password. When the user supplies the user's secret password to unlock the device <b>100</b>, the secret password and the secret key k<sub>s </sub>are then combined to obtain the new key k<sub>new</sub>, and the content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>is decrypted using the new key k<sub>new</sub>. Alternatively, if the new key k<sub>new </sub>was created by combining the secret key k<sub>s </sub>with a data string from memory, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> again combines the secret key k<sub>s </sub>with the data string to obtain k<sub>new</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Finally, in step <b>418</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> decrypts the sensitive information stored on the mobile device <b>100</b> using decrypted content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>. It is contemplated that in some embodiments the sensitive information remains encrypted subsequent to step <b>416</b>, and is only decrypted upon a request from the user or from another application operating on the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As can be seen from the above embodiment, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> can therefore provide enhanced protection of sensitive information stored on the device <b>100</b> by using a secret key k<sub>s </sub>known only to the trusted party <b>210</b> to encrypt the content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>, and then deleting this secret key k<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the mobile device <b>100</b> may also have stored thereon an asymmetric private/public key pair (k, K) for performing additional data protection. For example, the mobile device may have a public key K used to encrypt sensitive information received when the device is locked, and a corresponding private key k for subsequently decrypting this encrypted information. In such embodiments, the private key k is also encrypted using key k<sub>new </sub>along with the content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>, and private key k is subsequently decrypted using k<sub>new </sub>along with the content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>. Additionally, the device may have stored thereon one or more file keys for encrypting and decrypting information on external memory devices on the mobile device <b>100</b>. In such embodiments, these file keys are also encrypted using key k<sub>new </sub>along with the content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>, and subsequently decrypted using k<sub>new </sub>along with the content protection key k<sub>cp</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one implementation of the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the trusted party <b>210</b> is located in the host system <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the trusted party <b>210</b> comprises a server <b>218</b> and a system administrator <b>220</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The system administrator <b>220</b> interprets messages transmitted from the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> and instructs the server <b>218</b> to securely transmit the secret key k<sub>s </sub>when required. In such a system, it is contemplated that the same server <b>218</b>, system administrator <b>220</b>, and (if desired) same secret key k<sub>s </sub>could be used to implement the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in a plurality of mobile devices in the wireless network <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the embodiments described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> initiates the enhanced protection mode in step <b>402</b> based on a request from the user at the user interface, and in step <b>414</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> initiates exiting the enhanced protection mode after the expiry of a specified period of time. The request from the user in step <b>402</b> and the expiry of a specified period of time in step <b>414</b> are examples of events detectable by the mobile device <b>100</b>. To this end, it will be appreciated that more generally the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> is configured to enter and exit the enhanced protection mode based on events detectable by the device <b>100</b>. For example, detectable events that may cause the mobile device to initiate step <b>402</b> include, but are not limited to: a request from the user via the user interface; a change in location of the mobile device; loss or re-engagement of a near-field communication (NFC) connection, or loss or detection of any particular network, as represented, for example, by a network ID; and/or a request from the trusted party <b>210</b>. Detectable events that may cause the mobile device to initiate step <b>414</b> include, but are not limited to: the expiry of a specified period of time; a change in location of the mobile device; loss or re-engagement of a near-field communication (NFC) connection, or loss or detection of any particular network, as represented, for example, by a network ID; and/or a request from the trusted party <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> describes a variant of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in which the trusted party <b>210</b> prompts the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to enter and exit the enhanced protection mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can comprise a set of computer readable instructions executed by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> and the trusted party <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First, in step <b>602</b>, upon the occurrence of an event detectable by the trusted party <b>210</b>, the trusted party <b>210</b> sends a secure transmission to the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> that includes the secret key k<sub>s</sub>, as well as a request specifying that the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> encrypt sensitive information on the device <b>100</b> using enhanced protection. Examples of events detectable by the trusted party <b>210</b> include, but are not limited to: the receipt of a message by the trusted party <b>210</b> from the mobile device <b>100</b> including GPS data indicating that the mobile device <b>100</b> has entered an area that the trusted party <b>210</b> detects as being unsafe; a request from the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to enter enhanced protection mode; a request from the user of the mobile device <b>100</b> to enter enhanced protection mode; and/or a message indicating that the mobile device <b>100</b> has lost or detected a particular network.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Upon receiving the secure transmission from the trusted party <b>210</b>, in step <b>604</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> executes steps <b>406</b> to <b>412</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Upon the completion of step <b>412</b>, the mobile device <b>100</b> is locked, the sensitive information is encrypted, and the content protection key k<sub>cp </sub>required to decrypt the sensitive information is encrypted by new key k<sub>new</sub>, which the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> has deleted.

The device <b>100</b> remains in this mode and waits for a subsequent message from the trusted party <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Upon the occurrence of another event detectable by the trusted party <b>210</b>, in step <b>606</b>, the trusted party <b>210</b> sends another secure transmission to the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> comprising another copy of the secret key k<sub>s</sub>, as well as a request specifying that the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> cease the enhanced protection mode. Examples of such detectable events include, but are not limited to: the expiry of a period of time determined by the by the trusted party <b>210</b>; the receipt of a message by the trusted party <b>210</b> from the mobile device <b>100</b> including GPS data indicating that the mobile device <b>100</b> has entered an area that the trusted party <b>210</b> detects as being safe; a request from the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to exit enhanced protection mode; a message from a user indicating that the mobile device has entered an area that the trusted party <b>210</b> detects as being safe; and/or a message indicating that the mobile device <b>100</b> has lost or detected a particular network.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Upon receiving the secure transmission from the trusted party <b>210</b>, in step <b>608</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> executes steps <b>416</b> to <b>418</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the embodiment described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the trusted party <b>210</b> instructs the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to enter and exit the enhanced protection mode. In one implementation of this embodiment, the trusted party <b>210</b> can make this decision by tracking the location of the mobile device <b>100</b> using GPS data transmitted to the trusted party <b>210</b> from the mobile device <b>100</b>. The GPS data is indicative of whether or not the device <b>100</b> is in a safe area. If the trusted party <b>210</b> determines that the mobile device <b>100</b> has entered an unsafe area, the trusted party <b>210</b> can instruct the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to encrypt its sensitive information using enhanced protection. Once the trusted party <b>210</b> determines that the mobile device <b>100</b> has returned to a safe area, the trusted party <b>210</b> can subsequently instruct the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> to exit the enhanced protection mode. In another implementation of this embodiment, the user instead sends a communication to the trusted party <b>210</b> specifying when the mobile device <b>100</b> is in an unsafe area and when the mobile device <b>100</b> has returned to a safe area. The message could be, for example, a call to the trusted party <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The embodiments described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> are specific to a mobile device <b>100</b> that implements encryption and decryption of sensitive information stored thereon using a content protection key K<sub>cp</sub>. In these embodiments, the user's secret password, or a data string from the memory of the device <b>100</b>, is combined with the secret key k<sub>s </sub>from the trusted party <b>210</b> to derive the new key k<sub>new</sub>. It will be appreciated that these embodiments can be generalized as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Turning therefore to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a mobile device <b>100</b> is shown having a Data Protection Module <b>140</b>, which communicates with a trusted party <b>210</b> over a wireless network <b>200</b>. The trusted party <b>210</b> has stored in its memory <b>216</b> a secret key k<sub>s</sub>. The secret key k<sub>s </sub>is private to the trusted party <b>210</b> and is not known to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As the user carries the mobile device <b>100</b> during his or her travels, the mobile device <b>100</b> may be transported into an unsafe area in which there is a risk that an interloper could gain possession of the device <b>100</b> and extract sensitive information stored on the device <b>100</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> advantageously provides enhanced protection of data stored on the mobile device <b>100</b> by using the secret key k<sub>s </sub>from the trusted party <b>210</b> in encrypting and decrypting the data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can comprise a set of computer readable instructions stored on the mobile device <b>100</b> and executed by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, in step <b>802</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> receives from the trusted party <b>210</b> a transmission over the wireless network <b>200</b> which includes the secret key k<sub>s</sub>. The transmission may be made secure through encryption, or the channel itself may be secure, thereby rendering the transmission secure. If the channel cannot be made secure, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>can instead be sent as part of a message in plaintext, preferably using methods of hiding the key in the message, such as by spreading the key over a plurality of bytes that appear unrelated, but that are retrievable by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b>. As explained earlier, the transmission of secret key k<sub>s </sub>in step <b>802</b> is initiated by a detectable event.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, in step <b>804</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> uses the secret key k<sub>s </sub>in encrypting data on the device. For example, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>may be used directly as a symmetric key to encrypt data. Alternatively, as described earlier, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>may be combined with a data string in the memory of the device <b>100</b>, or by secret information provided by the user (e.g. the user's secret password) to derive a new key, which is instead used to encrypt the data on the device <b>100</b>. The advantage of combining the secret key k<sub>s </sub>with secret information provided by the user is that more robust protection is achieved since both the secret key k<sub>s </sub>and the user's secret information must be known to generate the new key.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The data encrypted can be, for example, one or more content protection keys used in encrypting sensitive information (as in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>). Alternatively, the data could be the sensitive information itself, thereby bypassing the step of using a content protection key.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, in step <b>806</b>, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>used in encrypting the data is deleted by the Data Protection Module <b>140</b>. Any other key(s) derived using the secret key k<sub>s </sub>(e.g. the new key k<sub>new</sub>) is/are also deleted, if applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Upon the completion of step <b>806</b>, the data stored on the device is encrypted in a manner such that it is not possible for an interloper to decrypt the data using the secret information known by the user. This is because the secret key k<sub>s </sub>has been used in encrypting the data. The secret key k<sub>s </sub>is unknown to the user and has been deleted from the temporary memory of the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a preferred embodiment, the device <b>100</b> locks during and subsequent to step <b>806</b> to prevent access to applications on the device <b>100</b> by a user. The device locks in a modified manner such that it cannot be unlocked by a user, even if the user inputs the user's secret password. The display <b>28</b> informs the user that the device <b>100</b> is in this locked mode. While in the locked mode, it is contemplated that the user is still able to access certain basic applications on the device <b>100</b>, e.g., the ability to send and receive telephone calls.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After a subsequent detectable event, in step <b>808</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> receives from the trusted party <b>210</b> another transmission which includes another copy of the secret key k<sub>s </sub>from the memory <b>216</b> of the trusted party <b>210</b>. It is contemplated that this detectable event corresponds to an indication that the device <b>100</b> has returned to an area safe from interlopers.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Then, in step <b>810</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> uses the secret key k<sub>s </sub>in decrypting the data. As described earlier, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>may be combined with secret information provided by the user or by a data string stored in the memory of the device <b>100</b> to derive a new key. In an embodiment in which the device <b>100</b> is locked, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> instructs the device <b>100</b> to enter into regular locked mode such that when the user inputs the user's secret password, the device <b>100</b> will unlock.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Using the above-described method, sensitive information stored on the device <b>100</b> can be protected from interlopers in situations in which the device <b>100</b> is being transported through a hostile area. The sensitive information is protected in a manner that prevents the interloper from being able to decrypt the sensitive information using information divulged by the user. Since the user does not possesses the secret key k<sub>s</sub>, the interloper can never obtain the value of this key from the user. Advantageously, once the device <b>100</b> has left the hostile area, the sensitive information can be decrypted and again accessed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In a variation of the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the secret key k<sub>s </sub>is an asymmetric private key having a corresponding public key K<sub>s</sub>. The public key K<sub>s </sub>is stored in memory on the device <b>100</b>. For example, K<sub>s </sub>may have been previously loaded onto the device <b>100</b> or previously transmitted to the device <b>100</b> during operation. Therefore, in steps <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, instead of the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> receiving from the trusted party <b>210</b> the secret key k<sub>s </sub>and using this secret key in encrypting data on the device, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> instead encrypts data on the device <b>100</b> using the public key K<sub>s</sub>. The public key K<sub>s </sub>may encrypt the data directly or instead be combined with a data string in the memory of the device <b>100</b> or with secret information provided by the user (e.g. the user's secret password) to derive a new key, which is instead used to encrypt the data on the device <b>100</b>. Subsequently, in step <b>808</b>, the Data Protection Module <b>140</b> receives from the trusted party <b>210</b> the corresponding secret private key k<sub>s</sub>, and uses the secret key k<sub>s </sub>in decrypting the data in step <b>810</b>. This embodiment is particularly advantageous in applications in which the mobile device <b>100</b> is required to initiate the enhanced protection mode, but the mobile device <b>100</b> is unable to communicate with the trusted party <b>210</b>, for example if a network connection has failed or is non-existent.</p>
