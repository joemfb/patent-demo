<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates generally to a power electronics system and more specifically to a flexible power connector for effecting a power connection between power conducting units.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Transmission of power through an electric circuit results in energy losses such as conductive losses and inductive losses. Conductive losses typically include heat loss that is mainly due to the resistance of conductors and electrical connectors between the conductors. Similarly, inductive losses may be due to a change in the voltage and the inductance of the circuit. Moreover, the inductive losses may be proportional to a frequency of the voltage change and the inductance of the circuit. The inductance of the circuit may be influenced by the geometry of the circuit itself or by the geometry of the electrical connector.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The nature of power transmitted through electric circuits is continuously changing. For example, in switched circuits, the speed at which the voltage may change is constantly increasing with the onset of more advanced high switching speed semiconductors. Consequently, inductive losses are proportional to the speed of the voltage change and are related to the geometry of the circuit. Accordingly, increased attention must be paid to the geometry of electrical connectors in order to minimize inductive losses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the high power electronics industry, conventional power connectors are rarely designed to support advanced high switching speed semiconductors. Typically, the conventional power connectors are designed with two mating components, such as a male component and a female component. Generally, the male component is a two pole male component. Further, when this two pole male component mates with the female component, the female component has inherent wide gaps between the poles of the male component. These inherent wide gaps further result in inductive losses, such as parasitic inductance and conductive losses and contact resistance losses in the power connector. Particularly, these losses are very high when it is desirable for the power connector to handle a current in the range of hundreds of amperes and a switching frequency in a range of hundreds of kilohertz. In addition, since the power connectors include two mating components and especially, the male component is an expensive two-pole component, there is a substantial increase in the cost and complexity of the power connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore desirable to develop a design of a power connector that reduces electrical losses in the power electronics system. Particularly, it is desirable to develop a low cost, rugged, and cost effective single component connector having low inductive and conductive losses.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly in accordance with one aspect of the technique, a flexible power connector is presented. The flexible power connector includes a stacked structure having one or more insulating strips alternatingly arranged with a plurality of conducting strips, wherein the one or more insulating strips are interposed between the plurality of conducting strips to insulate each conducting strip from the other conducting strip in the stacked structure, and wherein the plurality of conducting strips is disposed parallel and proximate to each other to reduce electrical losses in the stacked structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a further aspect of the present technique, a method for forming a power connector is presented. The method includes alternatingly disposing one or more insulating strips between a plurality of conducting strips to form a stacked structure, wherein the plurality of conducting strips are disposed parallel and proximate to each other. The method further includes disposing at least one peripheral insulating layer on a portion of the stacked structure such that a first portion of the stacked structure at a first end of the stacked structure having the conducting strips and the insulating strips protrude beyond the at least one peripheral layer and a second portion of the stacked structure at a second end of the stacked structure having the conducting strips and the insulating strips protrude beyond the at least one peripheral layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another aspect of the present technique, a system is presented. The system includes one or more flexible power connectors, wherein each of the one or more flexible power connectors includes a stacked structure having one or more insulating strips alternatingly arranged with a plurality of conducting strips, wherein the one or more insulating strips are interposed between the plurality of conducting strips to insulate each conducting strip from the other conducting strip in the stacked structure, and wherein the plurality of conducting strips is disposed parallel and proximate to each other. The one or more flexible power connectors further includes at least one peripheral insulating layer disposed on a portion of the stacked structure such that at least a portion of the stacked structure protrudes beyond the at least one peripheral layer at the first end and the second end of the stacked structure, wherein the at least one peripheral layer is configured to insulate the stacked conducting layers from at least one external conducting material. The system also includes a first conducting unit coupled to a first end of the one or more flexible power connectors, and a second conducting unit coupled to a second end of the one or more flexible power connectors.</p>

More specifically, the composite stacked structure <b>101</b> includes an arrangement where one or more layers of insulating strips are alternatingly arranged with a plurality of layers of conducting strips. In one embodiment, a single insulating layer may be disposed or sandwiched between two consecutive conducting strips. Moreover, in certain embodiments, the single insulating layer may include two or more insulating strips, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, in certain other embodiments, only one insulating strip may be sandwiched between two consecutive conducting strips. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the insulating layer includes two insulating strips.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the composite stacked structure <b>101</b> is depicted as including a first conducting strip <b>102</b> and a second conducting strip <b>106</b> that are alternatingly stacked with a pair of insulating strips such as the first insulating strip <b>104</b> and the second insulating strip <b>105</b>. It may be noted that, in one embodiment, the first insulating strip <b>104</b> and the second insulating strip <b>105</b> may be coupled to each other to form a single insulating layer and this single insulating layer may be sandwiched between the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>. By way of example, the first insulating strip <b>104</b> may be glued to the second insulating strip <b>105</b> to form the single insulating layer. These strips <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are substantially planar strips that are disposed parallel and proximate to each other, in certain embodiments. Particularly, in the stacked structure <b>101</b>, the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> are disposed in close proximity to each other with a pair of relatively thin insulators, such as the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> disposed between the two conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>. As previously noted, in one embodiment, only one insulator, such as the insulating strip <b>104</b> may be sandwiched between the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>. Also in certain embodiments, the strips <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are flexible. This flexibility of the strips allows the connector <b>100</b> to be manipulated into any desired shape or structure. It may be noted that there may be any number of conducting strips and insulating strips in the stacked structure <b>101</b> and is not limited to the number of strips shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, in accordance with exemplary aspects of the present technique, the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> are interposed between the first conducting strip <b>102</b> and the second conducting strip <b>106</b> to insulate the first conducting strip <b>102</b> from the second conducting strip <b>106</b>. As previously noted, the insulating layer between the first conducting strip <b>102</b> and the second conducting strip <b>106</b> is not limited to two insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>. Accordingly, there may be any number of insulating strips interposed between the first conducting strip <b>102</b> and the second conducting strip <b>106</b>. The insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> may be formed using any insulating material having a thickness in a range from about 0.5 mil to about 10 mil. In one embodiment, the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> may be a polyimide film with a thickness of about 1 mil</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, in one embodiment, the first conducting strip <b>102</b> and the second conducting strip <b>106</b> are stiff bars that are formed using high strength and high conductivity material, such as, but not limited to, beryllium copper, phosphor bronze, and/or silicon bronze. These stiffening bars are planar in structure and may have a thickness in a range from about 10 mil to about 60 mil</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As will be appreciated, in a conventional power connector, there is an inherent wide air gap between the mating conducting components. This inherent wide air gap increases the inductive loop/path in the connector, which results in very large parasitic inductance in the connector. These shortcomings of the currently available connectors may be circumvented via use of the exemplary connector <b>100</b>. Particularly, in accordance with aspects of the present technique, the first conducting strip <b>102</b> and the second conducting strip <b>106</b> are disposed parallel and proximate to each other. Disposing the two conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> proximate to one another advantageously reduces the separation between the two conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>. For example, the two conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> may be separated by a distance in a range from about 0.5 mil to about 10 mil. By reducing the separation between the two conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>, the inductive loop/path in the connector <b>100</b> is minimized, which in turn reduces inductive losses, such as parasitic inductance in the connector <b>100</b>.</p>

It may be noted that the terms peripheral insulating layer and peripheral layer may be used interchangeably. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the connector <b>100</b> includes a first peripheral layer <b>108</b> and a second peripheral layer <b>110</b>. The first peripheral layer <b>108</b> is disposed on a portion of a bottom surface of the stacked structure <b>101</b>, while a second peripheral layer <b>110</b> is disposed on a portion of a top surface of the stacked structure <b>101</b>.

In one embodiment, the curved section <b>124</b> of the second set of protruding conducting strips <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>may have a radius in a range from about 1 mm to about 10 mm</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As noted hereinabove, the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> are positioned in close proximity to each other. Disposing the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> in close proximity to each other advantageously minimizes the area of an inductive loop, which in turn reduces the inductive losses in the connector <b>100</b>. In addition, since the connector <b>100</b> is soldered at the first end <b>118</b> to the first conducting unit <b>306</b> and face bolted at the second end <b>122</b> to the second conducting unit <b>318</b>, the contact resistance between the connector <b>100</b> and the conducting units <b>306</b>, <b>318</b> is substantially minimized, which in turn reduces resistive losses in the connector <b>100</b>. Moreover, since the connector <b>100</b> is flexible, the connector <b>100</b> can be bent and used to connect the conducting units <b>306</b>, <b>318</b> disposed at any position and/or location.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagrammatical representation <b>400</b> of a method for forming the power connector <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. It may be noted that the method for forming the connector <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The different layers of the stacked structure <b>101</b> are planar in structure and are disposed parallel and proximate to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with aspects of the present technique, one or more layers of insulating strips may be alternatingly arranged with a plurality of layers of conducting strips to form the stacked structure <b>101</b>, as depicted by step <b>418</b>. Particularly, in one embodiment, the stacked structure <b>101</b> is formed by disposing a first conducting strip, such as the first conducting strip <b>102</b>, as a bottom layer of the stacked structure <b>101</b>. The first conducting strip <b>102</b> includes strain relief apertures <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> that may subsequently be aligned with the strain relief apertures of other strips. The first conducting strip <b>102</b> may be formed using copper to aid in conducting power between the first and second conducting units <b>306</b>, <b>318</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Subsequently, one or more insulating strips, such as the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> are disposed over the first conducting strip <b>102</b>. The insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> may be formed using polyimide film. In one embodiment, if more than one insulating strip is employed, then the insulating strips may be joined together by placing an adhesive material between them. Particularly, the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> are joined together at the first end <b>118</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b>. However, at the second end <b>122</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b>, and more specifically at the curved section <b>124</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> are separated and bent away from each other. Also, the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> include strain relief apertures <b>410</b>, <b>412</b> that are respectively aligned with strain relief apertures <b>406</b>, <b>408</b> of the first conducting strip <b>102</b> to facilitate crimping of the stacked structure <b>101</b> to the first conducting unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, a second conducting strip, such as the second conducting strip <b>106</b>, is disposed over the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b>. The second conducting strip <b>106</b> is substantially similar to the first conducting strip <b>102</b>. However, in one embodiment, the second conducting strip <b>106</b> is formed without any strain relief apertures. The strain relief apertures are eliminated from the second conducting strip <b>106</b> to prevent any direct electrical contact with the first conducting strip <b>102</b>, especially while crimping the stacked structure <b>101</b> with a metal nut or screw in the strain relief apertures. The second conducting strip <b>106</b> may be formed using copper to help in conducting power between the first and second conducting units <b>306</b>, <b>318</b>. The stacking of the first and second conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> and disposing the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> therebetween result in the formation of the exemplary stacked structure <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thereafter, the first peripheral layer <b>108</b> and the second peripheral layer <b>110</b> are disposed on a portion of the stacked structure <b>101</b>, as indicated by steps <b>420</b> and <b>422</b>. Particularly, the first peripheral layer <b>108</b> is disposed at the bottom of the stacked structure <b>101</b> to insulate the stacked structure <b>101</b> from any external conducting surfaces. More specifically, the first peripheral layer <b>108</b> is disposed on a portion of an outer surface of the first conducting strip <b>102</b> to insulate the first conducting strip <b>102</b> from any external conducting surfaces. Furthermore, the first peripheral layer <b>108</b> is disposed on the outer surface of the first conducting strip <b>102</b>, such that a portion of the stacked structure <b>101</b> extends or protrudes beyond the first peripheral layer <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the first peripheral layer <b>108</b> may be a polyimide layer. The first peripheral layer <b>108</b> also includes strain relief apertures <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> that are used to crimp the first peripheral layer <b>108</b> along with other layers in the stacked structure <b>101</b> to the first conducting unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a similar manner, the second peripheral layer <b>110</b> is disposed on a portion of a top surface of the second conducting strip <b>106</b>, for example. Particularly, the second peripheral layer <b>108</b> is disposed on the outer surface of the second conducting strip <b>106</b>, such that a portion of the stacked structure <b>101</b> extends or protrudes beyond the second peripheral layer <b>110</b>. The second peripheral layer <b>110</b> insulates the second conducting strip <b>106</b> from any external conducting surfaces disposed proximate to the stacked structure <b>101</b>. The second peripheral layer <b>110</b> also includes strain relief apertures <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> using which the stacked structure <b>101</b> is crimped to the first conducting unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, the first and second peripheral layers <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are disposed on the stacked structure <b>101</b> in such a way that the first conducting strip <b>102</b> protrudes beyond the first peripheral layer <b>108</b>, while the second conducting strip <b>106</b> protrudes beyond the second peripheral layer <b>110</b>. In addition, the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> may be protruded beyond the first conducting strip <b>102</b> but within the second conducting strip <b>106</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Further, the protruding first portion <b>112</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b> is configured to aid in coupling the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> to corresponding terminals on the first conducting unit <b>306</b>. In certain embodiments, the protruding first portion <b>112</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b> is etched to form a tap structure, such as the tap structures <b>204</b>, <b>216</b>. The tap structures <b>204</b>, <b>216</b> aid in coupling the connector <b>100</b> to the first conducting unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Similarly, at the second end <b>122</b>, the second protruding portion <b>120</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b> includes the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> and the insulating strips <b>104</b>, <b>105</b> that extend or protrude beyond the first peripheral and second peripheral layers <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. Particularly, at the second end <b>122</b>, the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> are bent away from each other to aid in face bolting each of the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> to respective terminals in the second conducting unit <b>318</b>. More specifically, the second portion <b>120</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b> includes apertures, such as the bolting apertures <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>, that aid in face bolting the connector <b>100</b> to the second conducting unit <b>318</b>. In one embodiment, the second conducting unit <b>318</b> may include bus bars with apertures such as the apertures <b>324</b>, <b>326</b> to face bolt the second conducting unit <b>318</b> to the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> in the stacked structure <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, the stacked structure <b>101</b> may have a length in a range from about 35 mm to about 100 mm and a width in a range from about 25 mm to about 55 mm, in certain embodiments. Also, the stacked structure <b>101</b> may have a thickness in a range from about 0.25 mm to about 3 mm, in one embodiment. In addition, the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> in the stacked structure <b>101</b> are separated by a distance in a range from about 0.01 mm to about 0.2 mm, for example. Consequent to arranging the stacked structure <b>101</b> as described hereinabove, the width of the stacked structure <b>101</b> is substantially increased relative to the distance between the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> of the stacked structure <b>101</b>. This increase in the width of the stacked structure <b>101</b> relative to the distance between the conducting strips <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> advantageously minimizes the inductance in the stacked structure <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view <b>500</b> of another embodiment of a power connector <b>501</b>, in accordance with aspects of the present technique, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a top view <b>600</b> of the power connector <b>501</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The power connector <b>501</b> includes a plurality of layers of conducting strips arranged with alternating layers of insulating strips to form the stacked structure. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> are planar conductors which are disposed in close proximity to each other with a thin insulator, such as an insulating strip <b>504</b> disposed between the conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the power connector <b>501</b> includes at least one peripheral layer that is disposed on at least a portion of the stacked structure. Particularly, the power connector <b>501</b> includes a first peripheral layer <b>508</b> that is disposed on a portion of a bottom surface of the stacked structure to prevent or insulate the first conducting strip <b>502</b> from any external conducting surfaces and/or materials. Similarly, the power connector <b>501</b> includes a second peripheral layer <b>510</b> that is disposed on a portion of a top surface of the stacked structure to insulate the second conducting strip <b>506</b> from any external conducting surfaces and/or materials.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> at a first end <b>512</b> of the stacked structure may be coupled to a first conducting unit, such as the first conducting unit <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Particularly, in accordance with exemplary aspects of the present technique, the conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> are arranged in a step structure, where the insulating strip <b>504</b> protrudes beyond the first conducting strip <b>502</b> and the second conducting strip <b>506</b> protrudes beyond the insulating strip <b>504</b>. This kind of step arrangement aids in separating the first conducting strip <b>502</b> and the second conducting strip <b>506</b>, especially while soldering the conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> to the first conducting unit <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the connector <b>501</b> further includes one or more strain relief bars <b>514</b>. These strain relief bars <b>514</b> enable the flexible power connector <b>501</b> to withstand vibrations and other strains. In certain embodiments, the strain relief bar <b>514</b> includes at least two bars, wherein the first strain relief bar <b>516</b> is disposed on a top surface of the power connector <b>501</b>, and a second strain relief bar <b>518</b> is disposed on a bottom surface of the power connector <b>501</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The first strain relief bar <b>516</b> and the second strain relief bar <b>518</b> are disposed parallel to each other, thereby allowing the two strain relief bars <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> to be coupled by inserting a screw or a nut through strain apertures <b>520</b> and <b>522</b> in the bars <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>. For example, a bolt may be inserted through the strain aperture <b>520</b> of the bars <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> and the bolt may be tightened by using a nut, for example. Similarly, the other end of the bars <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> are also tightened by inserting another bolt in the strain aperture <b>522</b> of the bars <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> and the bolt may be tightened by using a nut, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, at a second end <b>524</b> of the stacked structure <b>501</b>, the power connector <b>501</b> may also include one or more shims coupled to corresponding conducting strips. Particularly, in one embodiment, the connector <b>501</b> includes a first shim <b>528</b> and a second shim <b>530</b>. The first shim <b>528</b> is coupled to the first conducting strip <b>502</b> and insulated from the second conducting strip <b>506</b>. Similarly, the second shim <b>530</b> is coupled to the second conducting strip <b>506</b> and insulated from the first conducting strip <b>502</b>. The coupling of the shims <b>528</b>, <b>530</b> to their respective conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> are depicted in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, the first shim <b>528</b> and the second shim <b>530</b> are configured to aid in face bolting their corresponding conducting strips <b>502</b>, <b>506</b> to a second conducting unit, such as the second conducting unit <b>318</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The second conducting unit <b>318</b> may be a bus bar, power module, or any other electrical circuit that consumes power. In one example, the shims <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> may be copper berilium shims that are bolted to the bus bar. Also, in one embodiment, the stacked structure may be flexible. This flexibility of the stacked structure of the connector <b>501</b> allows bending of the connector <b>501</b> upwards or downwards to face bolt the shims <b>528</b>, <b>530</b> to the second conducting unit <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a perspective view <b>700</b> of the power connectors of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> coupled between power module <b>710</b> and bus bar <b>712</b>, in accordance with aspects of the present technique is depicted. It may be noted that the power module <b>710</b> may include one or more first conducting units <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, while the bus bar <b>712</b> may include one or more second conducting units <b>318</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In accordance with aspects of the present technique, the bus bar <b>712</b> include multiple layers with a mating surface <b>713</b> at a first end <b>722</b> of the bus bar <b>712</b>. The mating surface <b>713</b> is disposed substantially parallel to bent conducting strips, such as the conducting strips <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>b </i>of each of the power connectors <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>. Further, the mating surface <b>713</b> is employed to face bolt each of the power connectors <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> to the bus bar <b>712</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.

Furthermore, at a first end, such as the first end <b>118</b>, each of the power connectors <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> is coupled to their respective power module <b>710</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Accordingly, the power connectors <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> may be employed to couple the power module <b>710</b> to the bus bar <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The power connectors and the method of forming the power connector described hereinabove aid in reducing the electrical losses in the connector. Also, the flexible nature of power connector allows manipulation of the connector to any shape, which further aids in coupling conducting units placed in any position and/or location. In addition, since the stacked arrangement of conducting strips substantially reduces the inductive loop in the connector, the connector is capable of operating with high current power modules at high switching frequencies. Moreover, the power connector described hereinabove is a low cost, rugged and cost affective single component connector, as opposed to the currently available expensive two-component connector. Further, since the power connector employs planar conducting strips, parasitic inductance in the connector may be substantially minimized Additionally, use of the planar low inductance strips substantially reduces the cost and complexity of the power connector. Also, such a power connector can be fabricated using a low cost batch process.</p>
