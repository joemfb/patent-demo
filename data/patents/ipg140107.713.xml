<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will now be made in detail to the specific embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a front view of a cloth treating apparatus in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, with a door <b>14</b> opened state.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Though the present invention describes a refresher which supplies heated air to cloth for refreshing the cloth, the present invention is not limited to this, but is applicable to other devices which are provided with heat pumps. The refresh may mean a process for providing air, heated air, water, mist and steam toward the cloth for removing wrinkles from the cloth, deodorizing the cloth, sanitizing the cloth, preventing static electricity, or warming the cloth. Moreover, the cloth mentioned in the specification includes, not only objects a person may wear, such as clothes, and apparel, but also shoes, socks, gloves, a headgear, and a muffler, but also objects a person may use, such as a doll, a handkerchief, and blanket, i.e., all objects which require washing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b> includes a cabinet <b>10</b> which forms a housing space <b>12</b> for housing cloth therein. The cabinet <b>10</b> houses the cloth and forms an exterior appearance of the cloth treating apparatus. The cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b> includes a water supply unit (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for spraying water, mist, or steam (Hereafter will be called as &#x2018;steam&#x2019;, collectively) to the housing space <b>12</b>. And, the cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b> may also include an air supply unit <b>22</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) for supplying air or heated air to the housing space <b>12</b>. And, the cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b> may also include a control unit (Not shown) for controlling the water supply unit <b>30</b> and the air supply unit <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cabinet <b>19</b> has various elements which will be described later provided thereto, and the housing space <b>12</b> provided therein. The housing space <b>12</b> is in communication with an outside of the cabinet <b>10</b> by a door <b>14</b> selectively. Moreover, the housing space <b>12</b> has various kinds of supporters <b>16</b> provided thereto for hanging the cloth therefrom. The supporter <b>16</b> may be provided such that the cloth maintains a stationary state, or a secured state, without movement. In the meantime, as described later, the supporter may be configured to apply a predetermined movement to the cloth if the air, the heated air, or the steam is supplied to the cloth, which will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a front view of a cloth treating apparatus in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. In comparison to the first embodiment, the cloth treating apparatus of another preferred embodiment is different in that the cloth treating apparatus of another preferred embodiment includes a movable hanger. The cloth treating apparatus of another preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described focused on the difference.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is the movable hanger <b>50</b> provided in the housing space <b>12</b> for hanging the cloth therefrom. The movable hanger <b>50</b> is configured to apply predetermined movement to the cloth. If the predetermined movement is applied to the cloth in a case the air, the heated air, or the steam is supplied to the cloth, a refresh effect of the cloth will be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a movable hanger <b>50</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of the movable hanger <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the movable hanger <b>50</b> includes a hanger bar <b>250</b> for supporting a cloth hanger <b>200</b> having the cloth hung therefrom, and a supporter <b>280</b> for supporting both ends of the hanger bar <b>250</b>. The hanger bar <b>250</b> has a plurality of cloth hanger grooves <b>251</b> provided therein for positioning the cloth hanger <b>200</b> when the cloth hanger <b>200</b> is placed thereon. The supporter <b>280</b> is connected to, and supported by, a movable hanger frame <b>213</b> provided to an upper side of an inside of ceiling of the cabinet <b>10</b> to be invisible from an outside of the cabinet <b>10</b>. The hanger bar <b>250</b> has both ends provided with supporter ribs <b>254</b> to surround, and to be connected to, the supporter <b>280</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, since the cloth treating apparatus of the embodiment has the cloth placed therein hung from the cloth hanger, the cloth treating apparatus has effects much better than the related art cloth treating apparatus, not only in refreshing, but also in drying efficiency of the cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the meantime, the movable hanger <b>50</b> includes a motor <b>230</b>, a power converter <b>260</b> for converting rotating movement from the motor <b>230</b> to a horizontal linear movement of the hanger bar <b>250</b>, and a power transmitter <b>240</b> for transmission of the power from the motor <b>230</b> to the power converter <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power transmitter <b>240</b> may include a driving pulley <b>241</b> provided to the motor <b>230</b>, a driven pulley <b>242</b> connected to the driving pulley <b>241</b> with a belt <b>243</b>, and a rotating shaft <b>244</b> coupled to a center of the driven pulley <b>242</b>. The rotating shaft <b>244</b> is rotatably mounted in a bearing housing <b>270</b> provided to the movable hanger frame <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is preferable that the hanger bar <b>250</b> further includes a slot <b>252</b> perpendicular to a length direction of the hanger bar <b>250</b>. In detail, the hanger bar <b>250</b> has a slot housing <b>254</b> over the hanger bar <b>250</b>, with the slot <b>252</b> provided in the slot housing <b>253</b> at a center thereof, substantially. And, the power converter <b>260</b> may include a slot pin <b>263</b> placed in the slot <b>252</b>, a shaft coupler <b>261</b> coupled to the rotating shaft <b>244</b>, and a rotatable arm <b>262</b> connected between the slot pin <b>263</b> and the shaft coupler <b>261</b>. The power converter <b>260</b> is covered with a cover <b>214</b> to make the power converter <b>260</b> invisible from an outside of the movable hanger <b>50</b> provided between the movable hanger frame <b>213</b> and the slot housing <b>253</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In above configuration, if the motor <b>230</b> rotates, the driven pulley <b>242</b> rotates to rotates the rotating shaft <b>244</b> coupled to the driven pulley <b>242</b> too, such that the slot pin <b>263</b> makes a circular motion with a predetermined diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the meantime, the slot <b>252</b> is provided to the hanger bar <b>250</b> perpendicular to a length direction of the hanger bar <b>250</b>, with a length thereof longer than a rotating locus of the slot pin <b>263</b>. Therefore, even if the slot pin <b>263</b> makes the circular motion, the slot <b>252</b> makes a horizontal linear motion. According to this, the hanger bar <b>250</b> coupled to the slot <b>250</b> makes the horizontal linear motion, too.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the meantime, a machinery room <b>20</b> is provided to in the cabinet <b>10</b>, which houses the air supply unit <b>22</b> and the water supply unit <b>30</b>. Preferably, the machinery room <b>20</b> is positioned under the housing space <b>12</b>, and has the air supply unit <b>22</b> and the steam generating unit <b>32</b> of the water supply unit <b>30</b> provided therein. The machinery room <b>20</b> is positioned under the housing space <b>12</b> thus because it is preferable that the machinery room <b>20</b> positioned under the housing space <b>12</b> supplies the heated air and the steam upward by using a rising nature of the heated air and the steam being supplied to the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an inside of the machinery room <b>20</b>, schematically. In order to show the inside of the machinery room <b>20</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a frame which is a skeleton of the cabinet <b>10</b> only, for convenience of view. And, for convenience of description, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates major elements, including the air supply unit and the water supply unit <b>30</b>, but not pipelines which connect the major elements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the machinery room <b>20</b> has the water supply unit <b>30</b> provided thereto for supplying the steam to the housing space <b>12</b>, selectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The water supply unit <b>30</b> may include the steam generating unit <b>32</b> for heating the water to generate the steam, a water supply line <b>36</b> for guiding the steam from the steam generating unit <b>32</b> to the housing space <b>12</b>. Moreover, the water supply unit <b>30</b> may further include a water supply nozzle <b>40</b> at an end of the water supply line <b>36</b> for supplying the steam.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The steam generating unit <b>32</b> has a heater (Not shown) provided therein for heating the water to produce the steam to be supplied to the housing space <b>12</b>. As a water supply source for supplying the water to the steam generating unit <b>32</b>, an external water faucet may be used or a water supply tank (Not shown) provided to one side of the machinery room <b>20</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Preferably, the water supply tank may be provided to a door module detachably mounted to one side of the machinery room <b>20</b>, and the water supply tank may be detachably provided to the door module <b>60</b>. Accordingly, the user can detach the water supply tank from the machinery room <b>20</b>, fills the water supply tank with the water, and mounts the water supply tank to the machinery room <b>20</b>, again.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The steam produced from the steam generating unit <b>32</b> is supplied to the housing space <b>12</b> through the water supply line <b>36</b>. If the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> is provided, the steam may be supplied to the housing space <b>12</b> to have a direction by using the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>. In this case, in order to prevent a temperature of the steam from dropping or the steam from condensing during the steam flows along the water supply line <b>36</b>, it is favorable that the water supply line <b>36</b> is the shorter. Accordingly, if the machinery room <b>20</b> is positioned under the housing space <b>12</b>, it is preferable that the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> supplies the steam through an upper side of the machinery room <b>20</b>, i.e., an underside of the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">And, the machinery room <b>20</b> may have a circulating fan (Not shown) provided to a rear thereof. The circulating fan supplies the air to the machinery room <b>20</b> from an outside of the machinery room <b>20</b> for preventing a temperature of an inside of the machinery room <b>20</b> from rising excessively due to operation of the heat pump <b>22</b> and the water supply unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the meantime, in the machinery room <b>20</b>, there is the air supply unit <b>22</b> for supplying air or the heated air to the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the cloth treating apparatus in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a heat pump serves as the air supply unit. That is, the heat pump <b>22</b> has an evaporator <b>24</b>, a compressor <b>26</b>, a condenser <b>28</b>, and an expansion valve (Not shown) for dehumidifying and heating the air.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">That is, as the refrigerant vaporizes at the evaporator <b>24</b>, the refrigerant absorbs latent heat from surrounding air to cool down the air to condense moisture in the air, thereby removing the moisture from the air. And, if the refrigerant from the compressor <b>26</b> is introduced to, and condensed at, the condenser <b>28</b>, the refrigerant discharges the latent heat to surrounding air to heat the surrounding air. According to this, since the evaporator <b>24</b> and the condenser <b>28</b> function as heat exchangers, the air introduced to the machinery room <b>20</b> has moisture thereof removed, or is heated, and supplied to the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Though the air heated by the heat pump <b>22</b> may have a temperature more or less lower than the air heated by a related art electric heater, the heat pump <b>22</b> can remove the moisture from the air without using a dehumidifier, additionally. Therefore, the air supplied to the housing space <b>12</b> by the heat pump <b>22</b> is &#x2018;low temperature air&#x2019; relatively (In this case, the &#x2018;low temperature&#x2019; means, not an absolutely low temperature, but a relatively low temperature compared to a related art heated air, though the air is heated air). The cloth treating apparatus in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention can prevent the cloth from distorting or damaging by a high temperature if cloth refreshing or drying is performed by supplying the low temperature air. In conclusion, though the air supplied by the heat pump <b>22</b> has a temperature lower than the heated air of the related art cloth treating apparatus, since the cloth treating apparatus in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention supplies the air having the moisture removed therefrom without the dehumidifier, easy drying or refreshing of the cloth is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In detail, the machinery room <b>20</b> has an air inlet <b>21</b>A (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) formed in an upper side of a front thereof for introducing the air from the housing space <b>12</b> thereto, and an introduction duct <b>29</b>, connecting the air inlet <b>21</b>A to the evaporator <b>24</b>, the condenser <b>28</b>, and the fan <b>22</b>, forms a flow passage for flowing the air. The air introduced to the machinery room <b>20</b> through the introduction duct <b>29</b> and the air inlet <b>21</b>A has the moisture removed therefrom and heated as the air passes through the heat pump <b>22</b>, and is supplied to the housing space <b>12</b> through a discharge duct <b>33</b> and an air outlet <b>21</b>B by the fan <b>32</b>, again. In the meantime, the evaporator <b>24</b> and the condenser <b>28</b> which serve as heat exchangers in the heat pump <b>22</b> may be provided to an inside of the housing <b>23</b>, and the housing <b>23</b> may be connected to the introduction duct <b>29</b> and the discharge duct <b>33</b> to form one air flow duct. Therefore, the air introduced through the air inlet <b>21</b>A may circulate through the introduction duct <b>29</b>, the discharged duct <b>33</b>, and may be supplied to the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Though not shown, preferably, the air inlet <b>21</b>A may have a filter provided thereto. By providing the filter to the air inlet <b>21</b>A, various foreign matters may be filtered from the air introduced to the machinery room <b>20</b> from the housing space <b>12</b>, to enable to supply only fresh air to the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the meantime, in the cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b>, the water supply unit <b>30</b> supplies the steam to the housing space <b>12</b>, and the water supply unit <b>30</b> has the water supply line <b>36</b> or the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>. In this case, the water supply line <b>36</b> and/or the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> is mounted to one side of the housing space <b>12</b> for supplying the steam to the housing space <b>12</b>. That is, the water supply line <b>36</b> has one end connected to the steam generating unit <b>32</b>, and the other end connected to the housing space <b>12</b>, and, if the water supply line <b>36</b> is provided with the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>, the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> is provided to an end of the water supply line <b>36</b> and mounted to one side of the housing space <b>12</b>. In the meantime, if the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> is mounted to one side of the housing space <b>12</b>, the steam can be supplied only at the mounted position, and is difficult to move the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> in a state the steam is being supplied. Such positional restriction of the steam supply acts as a factor that limits utilization of the cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">That is, there may be necessity for supplying the steam, not only in a case the cloth is housed in the housing space <b>12</b>, but also in a case the cloth is positioned on an outside of the housing space <b>12</b>, i.e., the cloth is spaced a predetermined distance from the housing space <b>12</b> or the cabinet <b>10</b>. Moreover, there may be a case in which, since the user has no adequate time period for driving a predetermined course of the cloth treating apparatus, the user may be necessary to remove wrinkles, smells and so on from the cloth by supplying the steam for a moment before putting on the cloth. Especially, if contaminant is stuck to the cloth locally, i.e., a portion of the cloth, such as an elbow or the like, supplying the steam only to the contaminated portion intensively is effective for removing the contaminant, rather than supplying the steam throughout the cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In above case, not a configuration fixed to one side of the housing space <b>12</b> for supplying the steam, but a configuration movable freely in a state the steam is being supplied is required. This will be discussed with reference to the drawings, in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a water spray unit <b>300</b> in a cloth treating apparatus. The inventor makes it clear that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates only the water spray unit provided in the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the water spray unit <b>300</b> is provided to one side of the cabinet <b>10</b> to be movable a predetermined distance, to enable to connect the same to the water supply unit <b>30</b>, selectively. That is, if the steam supply is adequate only with the water supply unit <b>30</b>, the water spray unit <b>300</b> is not connected to the water supply unit <b>30</b>, and, for an example, if it is necessary to supply the steam to a portion of the cloth intensively, the water spray unit <b>300</b> is coupled to the water supply unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In detail, the water spray unit <b>300</b> is provided to one side of the housing space <b>12</b> to be movable a predetermined distance, to enable to connect the same to the water supply unit <b>30</b>, selectively. For this, the water spray unit <b>300</b> may be provided with a housing <b>310</b> provided to one side of the housing space <b>12</b> to be movable a predetermined distance. The housing <b>310</b> has an opened upper side to provide a housing space <b>312</b> therein. The opened upper side may be opened/closed by a cover <b>320</b>. And, the housing space <b>312</b> may house a water supply gun <b>370</b> and/or a water supply hose to be described later, therein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The housing <b>310</b> may be provided to be movable within the housing space <b>12</b> between a first position at which the housing <b>310</b> does not couple to the water supply unit <b>30</b>, and a second position at which the housing <b>310</b> couples to the water supply unit <b>30</b> to have the steam supplied thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the housing <b>310</b> may be provided to be movable adjacent to a base of the housing space <b>12</b>. This is for securing a space for placing the cloth in the housing space <b>12</b>, and moreover, for making easy connection to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> provided to the base of the housing space <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the meantime, the housing space <b>12</b> may have a guide portion for guiding movement of the housing <b>310</b> for movement of the housing <b>310</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the guide portion may have one pair of guide rails <b>330</b> provided to opposite inside walls which form the housing space <b>12</b>. The guide rails <b>330</b> may be fixedly secured to the inside walls adjacent to the base of the housing space <b>12</b> respectively, and may have grooves for guiding movement of the housing <b>310</b>. And, the housing <b>310</b> may have projections (Not shown) placed in the grooves <b>332</b> in the guide rails, respectively. Therefore, the housing <b>310</b> is provided to be movable within a locus the projections are movable along the grooves <b>330</b> in the guide rails <b>330</b>. Moreover, the guide portion may further provided with a base portion <b>313</b> for supporting the housing <b>310</b>. The base portion <b>313</b> is provided to an underside of the housing <b>310</b> to guide the movement of the housing <b>310</b> while supporting the housing <b>310</b>. For this, as shown, the base portion <b>313</b> may have both ends connected to the inside walls of the cabinet <b>10</b>, preferably to the guide rails <b>330</b> described before.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A state the housing <b>310</b> does not move along the guide rails <b>330</b> is a state the housing <b>310</b> is positioned at the first position where the housing <b>310</b> does not couple to the water supply unit <b>30</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the housing <b>310</b> moves to a rear side along the guide rails <b>330</b>, the housing <b>310</b> is positioned at the second position to position the housing <b>310</b> over the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> of the water supply unit <b>30</b>, enabling the housing <b>310</b> to be connected to the water supply unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the meantime, the water spray unit <b>300</b> may have a coupling unit <b>380</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) provided in the housing <b>310</b> for selective connection to the water supply unit <b>30</b>. The coupling unit <b>380</b> is provided on a lower side of the housing <b>310</b>, so as to be connected to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> for having the steam supplied thereto if the end of the water supply line <b>36</b> in the water supply unit <b>30</b> or the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> is ready to be connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">That is, the steam supplied to the coupling unit <b>380</b> through the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> as the coupling unit <b>380</b> is connected to the end of the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> is supplied to the water supply gun <b>370</b> to be described later through the coupling unit <b>380</b>. The coupling unit <b>380</b> may be provided in a form of enclosing the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> such that the coupling unit <b>380</b> is able to receive the steam being supplied from the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>. For an example, the coupling unit <b>380</b> may be provided to enclose a front of the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>, through which the steam is supplied.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the meantime, the coupling unit <b>380</b> may be connected to the water supply unit <b>30</b> as the housing <b>310</b> moves and/or acts. That is, in order to couple the coupling unit <b>380</b> to the water supply unit <b>30</b>, the user moves, not the coupling unit <b>380</b> itself, but other element, for an example, the housing <b>310</b> which acts or moves to make the coupling unit <b>380</b> to couple to the water supply unit <b>30</b>. Thus, if the coupling unit <b>380</b> couples to the water supply unit <b>30</b> interlocked to the action of the housing <b>310</b>, the user can connect the coupling unit <b>380</b> to the water supply unit <b>30</b> conveniently by manipulating the housing <b>310</b> without necessity for moving the elements including the coupling unit, one by one.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiment, the coupling unit <b>380</b> can be coupled to the water supply unit <b>30</b> by two stages of movement and action of the housing <b>310</b>. That is, if the housing <b>310</b> moves to the second position, the coupling unit <b>380</b> is positioned over the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> such that the coupling unit <b>380</b> can be connected to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> (First movement and action). Then, if the user opens the cover <b>320</b> of the housing <b>310</b> (Second movement and action), the coupling unit <b>380</b> is connected to the water supply unit <b>30</b> interlocked with opening of the cover <b>320</b>. Therefore, the water spray unit <b>300</b> may have a connection unit <b>341</b> which couples the coupling unit <b>380</b> to the water supply unit <b>30</b>, specifically, to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> interlocked with opening of the cover <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the connection unit <b>341</b> may include a plurality of links. That is, the connection unit <b>341</b> connects the cover <b>320</b> to the coupling unit <b>380</b>, to couple the coupling unit <b>380</b> to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> by an opening action of the cover <b>320</b>, and to decouple the coupling unit <b>380</b> from the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> by a closing action of the cover <b>320</b>. The connection unit <b>341</b> has a first link unit <b>340</b> and a second link unit <b>350</b> symmetric to each other. A structure of the link unit will be described in detail, with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the first link unit <b>340</b> and the frame <b>314</b> when the cover <b>320</b> is closed, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the first link unit <b>340</b> and the frame <b>314</b> when the cover <b>320</b> is opened. The first link unit <b>340</b> will be described in detail, while omitting description of the second link unit <b>350</b> which is similar to the first link unit in configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In detail, the housing <b>310</b> may have a frame <b>314</b> connected to the first link unit <b>340</b> and the second link unit <b>350</b> described before. The frame <b>314</b> is provided to an inside of the housing <b>310</b>. The frame <b>314</b> may be formed as one unit with the housing <b>310</b>. The embodiment suggests providing the frame <b>314</b> on a bottom of the housing <b>310</b>. The frame may include a post <b>315</b> projected upward from the bottom of the housing <b>310</b>, and an extension <b>317</b> provided to one end of the post <b>315</b>. The extension <b>317</b> may be perpendicular to the post <b>317</b>, and may have a first opening <b>316</b> to be described later formed therein. A connection part between the post <b>315</b> and the extension <b>317</b> has a recess <b>319</b> receiving the water supply hose <b>360</b>. Namely, the water supply hose <b>360</b> is received between a bottom surface of the extension <b>317</b> and one side of the post <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first link unit <b>340</b> includes a first link <b>342</b> rotatably connected to the cover <b>320</b> and the frame <b>314</b>, respectively. The first link <b>342</b> has one end rotatably connected to the cover <b>320</b>, and the other end rotatably connected to one side of the frame <b>314</b>. The first link unit <b>340</b> may further include a second link <b>344</b> connected to the cover <b>320</b> and the frame <b>314</b>. The second link <b>344</b> has one end rotatably connected to a rotation connection <b>322</b> at the cover <b>320</b>, and the other end provided movable along the first opening <b>316</b> in the frame <b>314</b>. The first opening <b>316</b> may be a rectangular slot. As the cover <b>320</b> is opening and closing, the other end of the second link <b>344</b> moves along the second opening <b>318</b> in the frame <b>314</b>. The first link unit <b>340</b> may also include a third link <b>346</b> connected to the frame <b>314</b> and the coupling unit <b>380</b>, respectively. In this case, the third link <b>346</b> has one end provided to be movable along the first opening in the frame <b>314</b>, and the other end connected to the coupling unit <b>380</b>. Moreover, the third link <b>346</b> and the second link <b>344</b> are connected to each other through the first opening <b>316</b> in the frame <b>314</b>. At the end, the opening and closing of the cover <b>320</b> makes the other end of the second link unit <b>344</b> and one end of the third link <b>346</b> to move along the first opening <b>316</b>. An action of the first link unit <b>340</b> which is interlocked with an action of the cover <b>320</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the cover <b>320</b> is in a closed state, the first link <b>342</b> and the second link <b>344</b> are positioned opposite to each other with respect to the rotation connection <b>322</b>. That is, since the other end of the first link <b>342</b> is connected in a rotatable but immovable state, the first link <b>342</b> rotates toward the first opening <b>316</b> along an arrow mark A as the cover <b>320</b> is closed. And, since the second link <b>344</b> rotates in an arrow direction B as the cover <b>320</b> is closed, the other end of the second link <b>344</b> moves along the first opening <b>316</b> in the frame <b>314</b>. At the end, the first link <b>342</b> and the second link <b>344</b> are put in a state in which the first link <b>342</b> and the second link <b>344</b> are unfolded in opposite directions.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the meantime, since one end of the third link <b>346</b> is connected to the other end of the second link <b>344</b>, the one end of the third link <b>346</b> also moves along the first opening <b>316</b>. In this case, since the one end of the third link <b>346</b> and the other end of the second link <b>344</b> are rotatably connected to each other, if there is no other element, the other end (The end the coupling unit <b>380</b> is coupled thereto) of the third link <b>346</b> maintains a hang down state perpendicular to the first opening <b>316</b>. If the third link <b>346</b> maintains such a state, the coupling unit <b>380</b> connected to the other end of the third link <b>346</b> is not housed in the housing <b>310</b>, but positioned on an outside of the housing <b>310</b>, not only resulting in a poor appearance, but also occupying a large space. Therefore, the frame <b>314</b> may further include the second opening <b>318</b> for guiding movement of the third link <b>346</b>, and the third link <b>346</b> may have a projection <b>347</b> matched to the second opening <b>318</b>. Though the drawing shows that the second opening <b>318</b> is configured to be in communication with the first opening <b>316</b>, the configuration is not limited to this, but, for an example, it is also possible that the first opening <b>316</b> and the second opening <b>318</b> may not be in communication with each other in the frame <b>314</b>, but the first opening <b>316</b> and the second opening <b>318</b> are provided, individually. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the cover <b>320</b> is closed, since the projection <b>347</b> moves along the second opening <b>318</b>, the third link <b>346</b> moves along an arrow mark C, making the coupling unit <b>380</b> to be housed in the housing <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the meantime, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a cover <b>320</b> opened state.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, since the first link <b>342</b> has both ends connected to the cover <b>320</b> and the frame <b>314</b>, if the cover <b>320</b> is opened, one end of the first link <b>342</b> rotates upward from the frame <b>314</b>. In the meantime, since the second link <b>344</b> also has one end connected to the cover <b>320</b>, the one end of the second link <b>344</b> moves upward and the other end of the second link <b>344</b> moves along the first opening <b>316</b>. At the end, the second link <b>344</b> moves to an upper side of the frame <b>314</b> perpendicular to the first link <b>316</b>, substantially.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">And, the one end of the third link <b>346</b> moves along the first opening <b>316</b> interlocked with movement of the second link <b>344</b>. And, if the third link <b>346</b> moves, since the projection <b>347</b> moves along the second opening <b>318</b>, at the end, the third link <b>346</b> rotates in an arrow mark D direction toward a lower side of the frame <b>314</b> perpendicular to the first opening <b>316</b>, substantially. In this case, the coupling unit <b>380</b> connected to the other end of the third link <b>346</b> heads downward to the lower side of the frame <b>314</b> to move beyond the bottom of the housing <b>310</b> through an opening <b>311</b> in the bottom of the housing <b>310</b>, and is connected to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the meantime, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> again, the water spray unit <b>300</b> may further includes a water supply gun <b>370</b> to be connected to the coupling unit <b>380</b> for supplying the steam from the coupling unit <b>380</b> toward the cloth. In detail, the water supply gun <b>370</b> may be connected to the coupling unit with the water supply hose <b>360</b>. The water supply hose <b>360</b> may be fabricated at a predetermined length appropriately. And, in order to enable the user to handle water supply gun <b>370</b> easily if the user holds the water supply gun <b>370</b> and supplies the steam, the water supply hose may be formed of a flexible material.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The water supply gun <b>370</b> and the water supply hose <b>360</b> described before may be housed in the housing space <b>312</b> of the housing <b>310</b>. If the water supply gun <b>370</b> and the water supply hose <b>360</b> are provided to one side of the cabinet <b>10</b>, not only storage thereof is not easy, but also appearance thereof is not good. Therefore, it is preferable that the housing space <b>312</b> is provided in the housing <b>310</b>, for housing the water supply gun <b>370</b> and the water supply hose <b>360</b> therein. In the meantime, if the water supply gun <b>370</b> and the water supply hose <b>360</b> are housed in the housing <b>310</b>, a hose fastening portion <b>362</b> for fastening the water supply hose <b>360</b> thereto, and a supply gun fastening portion <b>372</b> for fastening the water supply gun <b>370</b> thereto may be provided. That is, if the water spray unit <b>300</b> is not used, the user may dispose the water supply hose <b>360</b> along the hose fastening portion <b>362</b>, and moreover, fastens the water supply gun <b>370</b> to the supply gun fastening portion <b>372</b>, to re-arrange an inside of the housing <b>310</b>. In the meantime, in order prevent the water supply hose <b>360</b> from interfering with the frame <b>314</b> if the water supply hose <b>360</b> is disposed in the housing <b>310</b>, the frame <b>314</b> may have a recess <b>319</b> (referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The water supply gun <b>370</b> for supplying the steam will be described, hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a front view of the water supply gun <b>370</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a side view of the water supply gun <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the water supply gun <b>370</b> may include a body <b>372</b> to be connected to the water supply hose <b>360</b>, and a supply portion <b>374</b> provided to an end of the body <b>372</b> for supplying the steam. Though the supply unit <b>374</b> may be formed as one unit with the body <b>372</b>, the supply unit <b>374</b> and the body <b>372</b> may be provided individually in view of easy fabrication as shown in the drawings. The supply portion <b>374</b> may have a supply area <b>376</b> at a front thereof with a plurality of steam supply holes for supplying the steam. And, the supply portion <b>374</b> may have a foreign matter removal portion <b>375</b> at the front thereof for removing foreign matter, such as lint, stuck to the cloth.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the steam supply area <b>376</b> and the foreign matter removal portion <b>375</b> at the front of the supply portion <b>374</b> may be provided to have predetermined angles. If both the steam supply area <b>376</b> and the foreign matter removal portion <b>375</b> are formed at the supply portion <b>374</b> a front of which is formed flat, and if the foreign matter removal portion <b>375</b> is brought into close contact to the cloth to remove the foreign matter from the cloths, the steam supply area <b>376</b> will also be brought into close contact to the cloth in the same fashion. If the steam supply area <b>376</b> is in close contact to the cloth for supplying the steam to the cloth thus, making direct contact of the comparatively high temperature steam to the cloth, the steam may wet the cloth, on the contrary. Accordingly, the front of the supply portion <b>374</b> is divided into two regions to have predetermined angles for providing the steam supply area <b>376</b> and the foreign matter removal portion <b>375</b>, individually. In a case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, even if the foreign matter removal portion <b>375</b> is brought into close contact to the cloth, the steam supply area <b>376</b> is not in close contact to the cloth, but is able to maintain a predetermined gap.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the meantime, in order to prevent a user's hand or the like from exposing to the steam directly if the user uses the water supply gun <b>370</b>, the water supply gun <b>370</b> may further include a protector <b>378</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the protector <b>378</b> may be provided extended from a lower side of the supply portion <b>374</b> to surround at least a portion of the body <b>372</b>, and in order to secure a space the user's hand is to be placed therein, the protector <b>378</b> may be provided to form a predetermined space from the body <b>372</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the meantime, the foregoing description describes a case the steam from the steam generating unit <b>32</b> in the water supply unit <b>30</b> is supplied through the water spray unit <b>300</b>. However, a case the steam is generated by operating the heater in the steam generating unit <b>32</b> may be set in a variety of modes.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For an example, a control panel (Not shown) may be provided to a predetermined portion, for an example, to a front of the door <b>14</b>, of the cloth treating apparatus, and the control panel may be provided with at least one course. By manipulating the control panel, the user may select a steam supply course and drives the cloth treating apparatus, to supply the steam through the water spray unit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another case, a predetermined manipulator <b>379</b> may be provided to the water supply gun <b>370</b> described before. In this case, the manipulator <b>379</b> may be provided with, for an example, a steam supply button and a steam supply cutoff button which are able to communicate with the control unit in the cloth treating apparatus with wire or wirelessly. Accordingly, if the user draws out the water supply gun <b>370</b> and manipulates the manipulator <b>379</b> of the water supply gun <b>370</b>, the manipulator <b>379</b> transmits an order to the control unit to drive the steam generating unit <b>32</b> to supply the steam to the water spray unit <b>300</b>. This case is advantageous in that the steam can be supplied at once by manipulating the water supply gun <b>370</b> without manipulation of the control panel on the cloth treating apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The operation of the water spray unit <b>300</b> having above configuration will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 16</figref> illustrate movements of the water spray unit <b>300</b>, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a state the housing <b>310</b> of the water spray unit <b>300</b> is placed at the first position, showing the cloth treating apparatus partially, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a state the housing <b>310</b> of the water spray unit <b>300</b> is placed at the second position, showing the cloth treating apparatus partially, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a state the coupling unit <b>380</b> is connected to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b> as the cover <b>320</b> is opened, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, if steam supply from the water supply unit <b>30</b> is adequate, the user does not move the water spray unit <b>300</b> from the first position. Therefore, the water spray unit <b>300</b> stays at the first position, and the housing <b>310</b> maintains a predetermined space above the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Then, if the user intends to supply the steam with the water spray unit <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the user pushes the housing <b>310</b> along the guide rails <b>330</b> to place the housing <b>310</b> at the second position. In this case, the housing <b>310</b> is pushed backward as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to position the opening <b>311</b> in a lower side of the housing <b>310</b> over the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the user opens the cover <b>320</b> on the housing <b>310</b>, moving the coupling unit <b>380</b> to the lower side of the housing <b>310</b> owing to the connection unit <b>341</b> interlocked with the opening action of the cover <b>320</b> such that the coupling unit <b>380</b> is connected to the water supply nozzle <b>40</b>. The user may take out the water supply gun <b>370</b> and the water supply hose <b>360</b> from an inside of the housing <b>310</b>, and may supply the steam to a portion the user intends to supply, intensively.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
