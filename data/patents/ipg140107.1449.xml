<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to fiber optic interfaces for electronic devices, and in particular relates to small-form-factor fiber optic interface assemblies for electronic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Consumer electronic devices are increasingly being provided with optical communication capability. Such capability requires the use of integrated optical engines (also called integrated photonic modules) that have optical transmit and receive functions based on converting electrical signals to outgoing optical signals and incoming optical signals to electrical signals. The outgoing and incoming (transmit and receive) optical signals are typically carried from and to the device by respective transmit and receive optical waveguides, e.g., optical fibers of a fiber optic cable. A dual-fiber fiber optic cable configuration allows for fast, bi-directional communication between the device and an external device. A fiber optic interface assembly is used to convert the incoming (&#x201c;receive&#x201d;) optical signals into corresponding electrical signals, and to convert the outgoing electrical signals into corresponding &#x201c;transmit&#x201d; optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The preferred fiber optic cable is configured so that it can be readily connected to and disconnected from the electronic device. This can be accomplished using a fiber optic plug configured to readily mate and unmate with a receptacle built in to the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, as consumer electronic devices shrink in size, the usual configurations for the fiber optic plug and receptacle becomes increasingly more difficult to implement. Accordingly, there is a need for fiber optic interface devices and assemblies more suitable for use with increasingly smaller electronic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aspect of the disclosure is a fiber optic interface assembly for an electronic device having a circuit board and for interfacing with an external fiber optic cable having a plug. The assembly includes an integrated optical engine configured to transmit and receive respective transmit and receive optical signals. The assembly also includes a receptacle integrally formed with the integrated optical engine and having a receptacle aperture configured to receive the plug of the external fiber optic cable. The receptacle aperture having at least one transverse dimension between about 2 mm and 4 mm. The receptacle is supported by a flexible mount which is supported by the circuit board. The flexible mount is configured to absorb a mechanical force when the plug is mated to the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the disclosure is a fiber optic interface assembly for an electronic device for interfacing with a plug of a fiber optic cable. The assembly includes a circuit board having an end with an enclosure support area formed therein, the enclosure support area having opposite edges and a back end. The assembly also has an optical transmitter and an optical receiver operably disposed on the circuit board and respectively configured to transmit and receive respective transmit and receive optical signals.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Reference is now made in detail to example embodiments of the disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Whenever possible, like reference numbers or symbols are used to refer to like components or parts.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the description below, the term electronic device includes a device that has optical transmission and receiving capability via a fiber optic interface assembly that includes a fiber optic interface device such as a receptacle, and that has electrical, optical or both electrical and optical functionality as enabled at least in part by electronic, optical or a combination of optical and electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Cartesian coordinates are provided in some of the Figures to provide a reference frame for different views.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Electronic Device System</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an elevated isometric view of an example electronic device system <b>6</b> that includes a relatively small (e.g., hand-held) electronic device (&#x201c;device&#x201d;) <b>100</b>, and an external fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> operably connected thereto. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and shows external fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> disconnected from device <b>100</b>. Fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> includes a fiber optic interface device <b>20</b> operably connected to a fiber optic cable <b>40</b>. As fiber optic interface device <b>20</b> is in the form of a plug, it is referred to hereinbelow as plug <b>20</b> as a shorthand way of distinguishing between other fiber optic interface devices discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Device <b>100</b> has a device enclosure <b>110</b> with an interior <b>111</b> and a side <b>112</b> where fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> is operably connected at a fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b>, which is described in greater detail below. The fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> includes an optical fiber interface device <b>120</b> located at device enclosure side <b>112</b> and configured to matingly receive and engage plug <b>20</b>. Thus, optical fiber interface device <b>120</b> is referred to below as receptacle <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Receptacle <b>120</b> of fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> is intended to have a small form factor to make it suitable for small electronic devices <b>100</b>. Receptacle <b>120</b> includes an interior <b>122</b> with an aperture <b>123</b>. Receptacle interior <b>122</b> is defined by inner side walls <b>124</b> and an inner rear wall <b>125</b>. In an example, at least one of inner side walls <b>124</b> includes a receptacle keying feature <b>126</b>R. Receptacle <b>120</b> is shown in the close-up inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> with aperture <b>123</b> having a lengthwise dimension L in the long direction of device <b>100</b> and a width dimension W in the short direction of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The form factor of receptacle <b>120</b> is defined by dimensions L and W. Example values for length dimension L that define a small form factor can be from about 2 mm to about 15 mm, and example widths W that define a small form factor can be from about 2 mm to about 4 mm. An example square small-form-factor receptacle <b>120</b> has aperture dimensions about 2 mm&#xd7;2 mm, while an example rectangular receptacle <b>120</b> has small-form-factor dimensions (W&#xd7;L) of 2 mm&#xd7;13 mm. In an example, a small-form-factor receptacle <b>120</b> has a transverse dimension (L or W) of between about 2 mm and 4 mm. A square receptacle aperture <b>123</b> is shown in the pertinent Figures and discussed below by way of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Receptacle <b>120</b> is described herein as having a receptacle function for the sake of illustration. In other examples, receptacle <b>120</b> can be configured to have a plug function and the plug <b>20</b> can be configured as a receptacle.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Plug</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a close-up, top-down view of the plug end of an example fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b>. Plug <b>20</b> includes a plug housing <b>22</b> with a front end <b>24</b>, a rear end <b>26</b> and an interior <b>27</b> that contains an optional optical fiber guide <b>28</b>. Optical fiber guide <b>28</b> is configured to support and guide a pair of optical fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R within plug <b>20</b>, and can be in the form of a unitary member or can be an assembly comprising a number of different parts. In other embodiments of plug <b>20</b>, plug housing <b>22</b> is formed by overmolding and does not require the use of optical fiber guide <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Plug <b>20</b> also includes a plug ferrule <b>30</b> having a ferrule body <b>31</b> with a front end <b>32</b> and a rear end <b>34</b>. In an example, plug ferrule body <b>31</b> has an upper surface <b>36</b>U that supports at least a portion of an upper electrical contact <b>38</b>U and a lower surface <b>36</b>L that supports at least a portion of a lower electrical contact <b>38</b>L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). Plug ferrule <b>30</b> is connected at ferrule body rear end <b>34</b> to plug housing front end <b>24</b>. Fiber optic cable <b>40</b> is operably connected to plug <b>20</b> at plug housing rear end <b>26</b>. Fiber optic cable <b>40</b> supports at least a transmit optical fiber <b>42</b>T and a receive optical fiber <b>42</b>R, which are supported and guided within plug housing interior <b>27</b> by the aforementioned optional optical fiber guide <b>28</b>. Plug ferrule <b>30</b> has a cross-sectional shape that corresponds to the shape of receptacle aperture <b>123</b> so that the plug ferrule can mate with receptacle <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Transmit and received optical fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R run from the fiber optic cable <b>40</b> to plug housing interior <b>27</b>, where they are supported by optical fiber guide <b>28</b>. Transmit and received optical fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R then run to plug ferrule <b>30</b>, where they are supported by plug ferrule body <b>31</b> in respective transmit and receive optical pathways <b>39</b>T and <b>39</b>R (e.g., bores) formed therein (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, introduced and discussed below). Transmit and receive optical fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R terminate at respective optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R within plug ferrule body <b>31</b>. Transmit and receive fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R carry transmit and receive optical signals ST and SR.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a close-up, cross-sectional view in the Y-Z plane of an example end configuration for plug ferrule <b>30</b> at ferrule body front end <b>32</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a front-on view of plug ferrule <b>30</b>, and illustrates an example where the ferrule includes a plug keying feature <b>126</b>P configured to engage with a receptacle keying feature <b>126</b>R (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Plug ferrule <b>30</b> includes optical pathways <b>39</b>T and <b>39</b>R that respectively terminate at transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R formed in plug ferrule body <b>31</b> adjacent ferrule body front end <b>32</b>. Transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R are aligned with transmit and received fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an example, transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R can be merged to form a single gap, and two separate gaps are shown by way of illustration. Transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R are defined in part by respective gap back walls <b>35</b>T, <b>35</b>R and respective gap front walls <b>37</b>T, <b>37</b>R. Transmit and receive optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R are respectively arranged at or adjacent back walls <b>35</b>T and <b>35</b>R, i.e., at or adjacent respective ends of transmit and receive optical pathways <b>39</b>T and <b>39</b>R. In an example embodiment, transmit and receive optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R can extend beyond respective back walls <b>35</b>T and <b>35</b>R and into respective transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Plug ferrule body front end <b>32</b> includes transmit and receive convex surfaces CST and CSR that, together with gap front walls <b>37</b>T and <b>37</b>R, respectively define plug transmit and plug receive lenses LTP and LRP. In the discussion below and in the relevant Figures, transmit and receive plug lenses LTP and LRP are sometimes identified by the aforementioned transmit and receive convex surfaces CST and CSR for ease of illustration and discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Plug transmit and receive lenses LTP and LRP are arranged spaced apart from and in line with transmit and receive optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R residing within plug ferrule <b>30</b>. In an example, convex surfaces CST and CSR are aspherical. In an example, plug transmit and receive lenses LTP and LRP each have a focal length FP, and transmit and receive optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R are arranged at a distance of about one focal length FP away from the transmit and receive lenses. Generally, plug transmit and receive lenses LTP and LRP are arranged at an operable distance from respective transmit and receive optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R, wherein the operable distance is such that transmit and receive light <b>50</b>T and <b>50</b>R is either effectively focused or collimated, depending on the direction of light travel.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The embodiment of plug ferrule <b>31</b> having transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R (or a single merged gap) allows for gap front walls <b>37</b>T and <b>37</b>R to be a refracting surface since the adjacent medium within the gaps can be air, fluid, etc., with a refractive index different from the material making up plug ferrule body <b>31</b>. Moreover, front walls <b>37</b>T and <b>37</b>R represent an extra degree of freedom in the optical design of plug transmit and receive lenses LTP and LRP, i.e., these walls need not be planar as shown but can be curved to contribute to the optical performance of the transmit and receive lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> represents another example embodiment where there are no substantial transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R. In this example, single lens surfaces CST and CSR define plug transmit and receive lenses LTP and LRP. Also in an example, optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R of transmit and receive optical fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R are slightly recessed within their respective optical pathways <b>39</b>T and <b>39</b>R to avoid being damaged. The resulting spaces represent small transmit and receive gaps <b>33</b>T and <b>33</b>R, but the proximity of the corresponding gap front walls <b>37</b>T and <b>37</b>R to optical fiber ends <b>44</b>T and <b>44</b>R requires that substantially all of the optical power reside at transmit and receive lens surfaces CST and CSR.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, in the operation of optical fiber cable assembly <b>10</b>, light <b>50</b>R (&#x201c;receive light&#x201d;) traveling in receive optical fiber <b>42</b>R towards its optical fiber end <b>44</b>R diverges as it exits the optical fiber end. This divergent receive light <b>50</b>R travels to plug receive lens LRP, either through receive gap <b>33</b>R or through the corresponding portion of plug ferrule body <b>31</b>. Plug receive lens LRP collimates divergent receive light <b>50</b>R to form collimated receive light <b>50</b>RC.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Likewise, collimated transmit light <b>50</b>TC transmitted by device <b>100</b> (as described below) is received by plug transmit lens LTP, which focuses the collimated transmit light (either through transmit gap <b>33</b>T or through the corresponding portion of plug ferrule body <b>31</b>) onto optical fiber end <b>44</b>T, thereby causing transmit light <b>50</b>T to travel down transmit optical fiber <b>42</b>T.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Note that plug transmit and receive light <b>50</b>T and <b>50</b>R travels through plug ferrule body <b>31</b>. Plug ferrule body <b>31</b> is thus made of a substantially transparent material at the wavelength of plug transmit and receive light <b>50</b>T and <b>50</b>R, which wavelength can be in the range from 850 nm to 1550 nm. Example materials for plug ferrule body <b>31</b> include transparent resin, such as unfilled Polyetherimide (PEI), sold by the General Electric Company under the trademarked name ULTEM&#xae; 1010.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an example, the form factor of plug <b>20</b> is defined by transverse dimensions L&#x2032; and W&#x2032; of plug ferrule <b>30</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Example values for length dimension L&#x2032; that define a small form factor can be from about 2 mm to about 15 mm and example widths W&#x2032; that define a small form factor can be from about 2 mm to about 4 mm. An example square small-form-factor plug <b>20</b> has a plug ferrule <b>30</b> with transverse dimensions about 2 mm&#xd7;2 mm, while an example rectangular plug <b>20</b> has small-form-factor dimensions (W&#x2032;&#xd7;L&#x2032;) of 2 mm&#xd7;13 mm. In an example, a small-form-factor plug <b>20</b> has a transverse dimension (L&#x2032; or W&#x2032;) of between about 2 mm and 4 mm. A square cross-sectioned plug ferrule <b>30</b> is shown in the pertinent Figures by way of illustration.</p>

The example fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> includes an integrated optical engine <b>200</b> with receptacle <b>120</b> integrally formed therewith. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a partial cut-away close-up view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, showing the internal structure of fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b>.

Circuit board <b>150</b> includes an upper surface <b>152</b> and a front end <b>154</b>. Circuit board <b>150</b> includes an enclosure support area <b>156</b> that is selected from one of a slot, recess, offset, aperture, and relief zone, so that an enclosure <b>214</b> further described below, is aligned with or is recessed slightly with respect to the printed circuit board. For purposes of illustration, an embodiment employing a slot <b>156</b> at circuit board front end <b>154</b> is further described. Circuit board slot <b>156</b> has sides <b>157</b> and a rear end <b>158</b> defined by circuit board <b>150</b>. Circuit board slot <b>156</b> is configured to accommodate a portion of integrated optical engine <b>200</b>, as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Integrated optical engine <b>200</b> includes a housing <b>210</b> with a central enclosure <b>214</b>.

The configuration where receptacle <b>120</b> resides at least in part within enclosure support area <b>156</b> of circuit board <b>150</b> rather than merely atop the circuit board allows for the receptacle to make the full use of the limited height HH available within electronic device housing <b>110</b>. In an example, about half of central enclosure <b>214</b> resides above the plane of circuit board <b>150</b> and half resides below the plane. Central enclosure <b>214</b> has a height HE.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also shows a component <b>190</b> operably supported by circuit board <b>150</b> on circuit board upper surface <b>152</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, upper surface <b>152</b> of circuit board <b>150</b> includes electrically conducting lines <b>160</b>, some of which have contact pads <b>162</b>. Power-conducting wires <b>164</b> are electrically contacted to select contact pads <b>162</b> and to integrated optical engine <b>200</b> at respective upper and lower electrical contacts <b>201</b>U and <b>201</b>L disposed at least partially within receptacle interior <b>122</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Power-conducting wires <b>164</b> are used to provide electrical power to integrated optical engine <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Circuit board <b>150</b> also includes signal-conducting wires <b>170</b> for carrying signals to and from integrated optical engine <b>200</b>, and in particular to and from a transmitter-receiver module <b>250</b> that includes an optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and an optical receiver <b>260</b>R (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Signal-conducting wires <b>170</b> include a transmit signal wire <b>170</b>T that carries transmit signals ST to optical transmitter <b>260</b>T from a transmit component (not shown) on circuit board <b>150</b>, and a receive signal wire <b>170</b>R that carries receive signals SR to a receive component (not shown) on the circuit board (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an example, optical transmitter <b>260</b>T includes a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and optical receiver <b>260</b>R includes a PIN photodiode. In an example, transmitter-receiver module <b>250</b> includes a transmitter optical sub-assembly (TOSA) and a receiver optical sub-assembly (ROSA).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, central enclosure <b>214</b> includes in rear end <b>218</b> a cut-out <b>282</b> that accommodates optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and optical receiver <b>260</b>R, which places the optical transmitter and optical receiver within inner rear wall <b>125</b> of receptacle <b>120</b>. Inner rear wall <b>125</b> includes respective receptacle transmit and receive lenses LTR and LRR (LTR not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that are respectively aligned optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and optical receiver <b>260</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an example embodiment such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and optical receiver <b>260</b>R are arranged immediately adjacent central enclosure rear end <b>218</b>. Central enclosure <b>214</b> is thus made of a material (e.g., the aforementioned Ultem&#xae; transparent resin) that is substantially transparent to plug transmit light <b>50</b>T emitted by optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and receive light <b>50</b>R received by optical receiver <b>260</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an example, receptacle transmit and receive lenses LTR and LRR each have a focal length FR, and optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and optical receiver <b>260</b>R are arranged at a distance of about one focal length FR away from the transmit and receive lenses. Generally, receptacle transmit and receive lenses LTR and LRR are respectively arranged at operable distances from optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and optical receiver <b>260</b>R, wherein the operable distance is such that transmit and receive light is either effectively focused or collimated, depending on the direction of light travel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a front elevated view of fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b> in front of fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b>, and includes a close-up view of integrated optical engine <b>200</b> supported by circuit board <b>150</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is similar to the close-up inset view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but is more from the forward direction, and shows receptacle transmit and receive lenses LTR and LRR.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an example, fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> is formed with integrated optical engine <b>200</b>, and receptacle <b>120</b> formed as an integrated monolithic structure, as opposed to having the receptacle separated from the integrated optical engine. This kind of integrated configuration could lead to mating and unmating forces causing optical misalignments. The optical misalignments can occur between optical transmitter <b>260</b>T of integrated optical engine <b>200</b> and transmit optical fiber <b>42</b>T of fiber optic cable assembly <b>10</b>, and between optical receiver <b>260</b>R of the integrated optical engine and receive optical fiber <b>42</b>R of the fiber optic cable assembly. Such misalignment can adversely impact the performance of fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> with respect to the transmission and reception of optical information between external optical fiber cable assembly <b>10</b> and device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The configuration of integrated optical engine <b>200</b> and receptacle <b>120</b> disclosed herein avoids the aforementioned potential optical misalignment issues on fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> by flexibly supporting central enclosure <b>214</b> in circuit board slot <b>156</b> so that it floats therein. When mating and unmating plug <b>20</b> at receptacle <b>120</b>, the attendant forces are redirected to the circuit board <b>150</b> through the outboard support members <b>230</b> via flexible members <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, flexible members <b>240</b> of flexible mount <b>228</b> are configured to flex in response to the applied forces, thereby at least partially attenuating the applied forces. Power-conducting wires <b>164</b> and signal-conducting wires <b>170</b> are preferably provided with some slack to accommodate movement of central enclosure <b>214</b> within circuit board slot <b>156</b> so that no substantial resistance force is presented to the central enclosure by these wires.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An example configuration for flexible members <b>240</b> for flexible mount <b>228</b> includes one or more corrugations <b>241</b> designed to permit the flexing of the flexible members when subjected to the kind of forces associated with mating and unmating of optical fiber connectors. A single corrugation <b>241</b> is shown in the relevant Figures by way of illustration. Other configurations for flexible members <b>240</b> can be employed, such as thin flexures, resilient members such as springs, flexible materials such as dense foam, rubber, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an example, central enclosure <b>214</b>, flexible members <b>240</b> and outboard members <b>230</b> are formed as a monolithic structure, e.g., are molded or milled from a single body. In another example, integrated optical engine central enclosure <b>214</b> and flexible mount <b>228</b> (e.g., flexible members <b>240</b> and outboard members <b>230</b>) are assembled from different parts. Example materials for integrated optical engine central enclosure <b>214</b>, flexible members <b>240</b> and outboard members <b>230</b> include plastic and a thermoplastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Thus, in one example, fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> is flexibly mounted to circuit board <b>150</b> and within electronic device enclosure <b>110</b> so that receptacle <b>120</b> is accessible, for example, at device enclosure side <b>112</b>. The arrangement of central enclosure <b>214</b> within circuit board slot <b>156</b> conserves space within electronic device enclosure <b>110</b>, which is another important attribute for small electronic devices <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Central enclosure <b>214</b> also includes top and bottom flanges <b>430</b> and <b>432</b> configured for mounting the central enclosure to device enclosure <b>110</b> of device <b>100</b>, as illustrated in front-on view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>. Such mounting provides fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> with mechanical strength so that the mating and unmating forces associated with plug <b>20</b> and receptacle <b>120</b> cannot substantially alter the optical alignment between optical transmitter <b>260</b>T and optical receiver <b>260</b>R of the fiber optic interface assembly <b>180</b> and the transmit and receive optical fibers <b>42</b>T and <b>42</b>R of plug <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).
