<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A deck deployment system is adapted to facilitate transfer of personnel between spaced elevations. The deck deployment system includes a deck defining a substantially flat and continuous deck surface for supporting personnel. A convertible stairway is hinged to the deck and adapted for movement between a stowed condition and a deployed condition. The convertible stairway includes an adjustable frame assembly and a series of articulating horizontally-disposed foot treads carried by the frame assembly. The foot treads remain substantially horizontal upon movement of the stairway between the stowed condition and the deployed condition. When the stairway is in the stowed condition, the foot treads integrate with the deck to form a substantially flat and continuous portion of the deck surface. When the stairway is in the deployed condition, the foot treads cooperate to form steps extending from the deck to an elevation spaced from the deck surface.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, the deck deployment system <b>10</b> includes a vehicle-mount frame assembly <b>15</b> incorporating front and rear vertical supports <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B and opposing horizontal side beams <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B. Each side beam <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B may comprise a single integrally-formed structural element or a series of elements bolted or welded together (or otherwise attached) end-to-end between a cooperating pair of front and rear vertical supports <b>16</b>A, <b>17</b>A and <b>16</b>B, <b>17</b>B. The side beams <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B may attach to respective pairs of vertical supports <b>16</b>A, <b>17</b>A and <b>16</b>B, <b>17</b>B by bolts, rivets, welding, or other suitable means. The front vertical supports <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B may attach to a front of the vehicle &#x201c;V&#x201d; using, for example, mounting brackets, plates and other hardware. The rear vertical supports <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B mount to a step assembly <b>19</b> attached to the vehicle chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An elevated personnel deck <b>20</b> is carried by the vehicle-mount frame assembly <b>15</b>, and defines a substantially flat and continuous deck surface <b>21</b> for supporting personnel. In one embodiment, the elevated deck <b>20</b> extends from the front to the rear of the vehicle &#x201c;V&#x201d;, and may comprise a cantilevered adjustable front ramp <b>22</b> and pivoted deck section <b>23</b> (or main ramp) designed to elevate via one or more hydraulic actuators (not shown). One example of an adjustable front end ramp system applicable for use in the present vehicle is described in Applicant's prior issued patent, U.S. Pat. No. 6,832,667. The complete disclosure of this prior patent is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the exemplary embodiment shown, a convertible hinged stairway <b>25</b> is located at a rear section of the deck <b>20</b> in an area generally above the vehicle bed <b>14</b>. The vehicle bed <b>14</b> may be formed by (or include) a separately attached base platform <b>26</b> vertically spaced from the deck <b>20</b> at an elevation closer to the road or ground surface. As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the convertible stairway <b>25</b> is designed to pivot between a deployed condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), wherein the stairway <b>25</b> extends from the elevated deck <b>20</b> to the platform <b>26</b>, and a stowed condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the convertible stairway <b>25</b> is constructed of an adjustable frame assembly <b>30</b> and a series of articulating horizontally-disposed foot treads <b>31</b> carried by the frame assembly <b>30</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, each foot tread <b>31</b> defines a substantially planar and continuous rectangular surface <b>32</b> including opposing front and back ends <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> and opposing side ends <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>. The top surface <b>32</b> of each foot tread <b>31</b> may be perforated and/or textured. The adjustable frame assembly <b>30</b> includes cooperating pairs of laterally-spaced tread support rails <b>41</b>A, <b>41</b>B and tread adjustment rails <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B. Each of the foot treads <b>31</b> may be pivotably connected to the tread support rails <b>41</b>A, <b>41</b>B at opposite side ends <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> of the foot tread <b>31</b> proximate the back end <b>34</b>, and to the tread adjustment rails <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B at opposite side ends <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> proximate the front end <b>33</b> of the foot tread <b>31</b>. The tread support and adjustment rails <b>41</b>A, <b>41</b>B, <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B are each pivotably attached to respective stairway mount channels <b>45</b>A, <b>45</b>B affixed to the elevated deck <b>20</b>. Each stairway mount channel <b>45</b>A, <b>45</b>B defines two spaced connecting points <b>46</b> and <b>47</b>&#x2014;one for pivotably attaching the tread support rail <b>41</b> and the other for pivotably attaching the tread adjustment rail <b>42</b>. Stabilizing feet <b>48</b>A, <b>48</b>B may be located at respective free ends of the tread adjustment rails <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B for engaging the platform <b>26</b> and further stabilizing the stairway <b>25</b> in the deployed condition.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one exemplary implementation, the foot treads <b>31</b> remain substantially horizontal upon pivoting movement of the stairway <b>25</b> between the stowed and deployed conditions. As such, when the stairway <b>25</b> is in the stowed condition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the foot treads <b>31</b> integrate with the deck <b>20</b> to form a substantially flat and continuous portion <b>21</b>A of the deck surface <b>21</b>. The stairway <b>25</b> may be secured in this condition by removable pins (e.g., pin <b>49</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) passed through respective pin holes <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> formed with the tread support rails <b>41</b>A, <b>41</b>B and through mounting plates (e.g., plate <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) fixed to the deck <b>20</b>. To convert the stairway <b>25</b>, the pins <b>49</b> are removed and one or more gas springs (not shown) operate to lower the stairway <b>25</b> in a controlled manner to the deployed condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. When the stairway <b>25</b> is deployed, the foot treads <b>31</b> cooperate to form steps &#x201c;S&#x201d;, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, extending from the elevated deck <b>20</b> to the platform <b>26</b>. In this condition, the convertible stairway <b>25</b> forms a central or core deployment passage <b>60</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the deck <b>20</b>. The deployment passage <b>60</b> may be entirely or partially surrounded by the deck surface <b>21</b>. Additionally, one or more handrails <b>61</b> (or safety rails) may be located at a perimeter of the elevated deck <b>20</b> adjacent the deployment passage <b>60</b>. As a further means of transferring personnel to and from the elevated deck <b>20</b>, the vehicle &#x201c;V&#x201d; may include a pair of rear stationary (fixed) ladders <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b> demonstrate simultaneous articulation of the foot treads <b>31</b> upon movement of the convertible stairway <b>25</b> between the stowed and deployed conditions. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in the stowed condition, the foot treads <b>31</b> of the stairway <b>25</b> cooperate to define a substantially flat, continuous, and integrated portion <b>21</b>A of the deck surface <b>21</b>, as previous described. As the stairway <b>25</b> is gradually lowered, the tread adjustment rails <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B pivot the foot treads <b>31</b> in unison relative to the tread support rails <b>41</b>A, <b>41</b>B, thereby maintaining each foot tread <b>31</b> in a substantially horizontal orientation. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The offset spacing of pivot connecting points <b>46</b>, <b>47</b> enable substantially precise angular adjustment of each foot tread <b>31</b> as the stairway <b>25</b> continues to lower from the deck surface <b>21</b> to a deployed condition, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this implementation, the stairway <b>25</b> may be lowered to rest at any selected angle relative to the platform <b>26</b> or other support carried on the platform <b>26</b>, while the series of foot treads <b>31</b> remain horizontal. As such, the vertical distance between the deck <b>20</b> and platform <b>26</b> (or other support carried on the platform) may be modified as desired without sacrificing any advantages of a horizontally-treaded stairway <b>25</b> for transferring personnel between elevations.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In alternative exemplary embodiments, the convertible stairway may be designed to mechanically lift from the elevated deck surface to a higher elevation, or may be mounted to the platform and designed to mechanically lift to the elevated deck. Additionally, the present deck deployment system may be utilized separate and apart from the tactical vehicle as a means to facilitate transfer of personnel between any spaced elevations. All components and assemblies of the vehicle and system described herein may be interconnected using any suitable hardware, such as pivot pins, bolts, nuts, brackets, screws, or the like, and other means, such as welding and self-locking joints.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described above. No element, act, or instruction used in this description should be construed as important, necessary, critical, or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Although only a view of the exemplary embodiments have been described in detail herein, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in these exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the claims, any means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. Unless the exact language &#x201c;means for&#x201d; (performing a particular function or step) is recited in the claims, a construction under &#xa7;112, 6th paragraph is not intended. Additionally, it is not intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found herein that does not explicitly appear in the claim itself.</p>
