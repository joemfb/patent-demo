<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a safety controller having a configurable safety control, as well as methods for configuring a safety controller.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Safety controllers serve, amongst other things, to react in an error-free manner in a predefined way when a danger signal is present. A typical application of the safety technology is the protection of dangerous machines, such as presses or robots which have to be switched off immediately or have to be secured when operating personal approaches this in an unallowed manner. For this reason a sensor is provided, such as a light grid or a safety camera which recognizes the approach. Should such a sensor recognize a danger, then a safety control connected to the sensor has to generate a switch-off signal in an absolutely reliable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In practice not only an individual sensor monitors an individual machine, but generally a whole series of danger sources have to be monitored. The corresponding plurality of associated sensors, which can respectively define a switching event, and suitable measures for the elimination of dangers must then be configured and switched in the safety controller.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This programming of the safety controller is supported by professional graphical user interfaces, which are typically delivered with the safety controller. The norm IEC 61131 for programming of control systems describes the graphical programming by means of functional components in IEC 61131-3, as well as an input/output interface description in physical technical values in IEC 61131-2. The configuration of the input switching and the output switching and their interfaces to sensors and to actuators are, however, not standardized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The programming is a two-step process. Initially the requirements of the apparatus are specified by a control expert at a desk and are input and connected at the graphical user interface as logic blocks or similar functional blocks. In a second step the computer, preferably a laptop or a different portable device, on which the graphical user interface is implemented, is brought into the machine hall. The control program generated with the aid of the graphical user interface is transferred to the safety controller by means of a cable connected to the safety controller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the control expert is frequently no longer available following the initial installation. If a safety controller now fails or has to be changed in its configuration, then the maintenance technician frequently does not have the knowledge of the control expert, nor does he have the computer having the graphical user interface at his disposal. The situation is even more difficult when, in the case of an OEM manufacturer, a plurality of like apparatuses are to be generated and a factory worker without in-depth technical training is entrusted with the configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A common approach for the prevention of these disadvantages is the application of a rotary switch at the safety controller which can be operated by means of a screwdriver. Each rotary switch is associated with a certain control program. The service technician is taught which rotary position is to be selected for which control application by means of the accompanying documents or a flash program at the safety controller. This configuration is, however, neither particularly comfortable nor intuitive, as the only plausible connection between the rotary switch position and the control program is provided in the accompanying documents. Further-more, the rotary switch only allows a very small selection of different control programs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For this reason the object of the invention is to provide a configuration possibility for safety controllers which require less expert knowledge and less constructional demands from an apparatus aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is satisfied by a safety apparatus having a configurable safety controller and a configuration means, wherein the safety controller has at least one input for the connection of a sensor, at least one output for the connection of an actuator, as well as a control unit which is configured to carry out a control program which generates a control signal at the outputs in dependence on input signals at the inputs by means of logic rules, wherein the logic rules are settable by means of the configuration means, wherein in the configuration means a number code can be generated representing the logic rules and wherein the safety controller includes an interface for the input of the number code and wherein the control unit is configured to carry out a control program with the logic rules represented by the number code.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for configuring a safety controller which, by means of a control program, generates a control signal with reference to logic rules at at least one output for actuators in dependence on input signals of sensors at at least one input for sensors, wherein during the configuration the logic rules of the control program are set. The logic rules are set in that logic rules are initially selected in a configuration means and are transformed into a number code representing the logic rules, subsequently the number code is input into the safety controller via an interface and then a control program having the logic rules represented by the number code is carried out by the safety controller.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this respect the invention starts from the basic idea that the result of a programming by means of a graphical user interface is to be combined into compact easily transferable information. In that a number code is automatically generated which represents the logic rules and thus finally the control program, the flexibility and the comfort of the graphical user interface is maintained and at the same time the actual programming of the safety controller is reduced to the input of this number code.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention has the advantage that the generation of the logic rules is decoupled from the configuration of the safety controller. Thus a control expert can generate the number code with the known support by means of graphical programming and thus effectively and flexibly generates the required program with, at the same time, the programming of the safety control itself no longer requiring a specific qualification. The control expert does not even have to come within the proximity of the safety control and can, for example provide the required number code also by means of telephone or by using different communication channels. Also the necessity of a connection between specific configuration software and the safety controller can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The number code is preferably multi-digit and, in particular has at least 2 to 10 decimal points. Such a number code is still easily handable and at the same time allows a flexibility which is sufficient for many applications in the codeable logic rules. Although number codes with up to 20 or more decimal points are also plausible, the threshold is soon exceeded at which a number code can still be transferred and checked easily.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The interface is preferably configured for the connection of a mobile memory module. The number code can thereby be comfortably transferred without the input being a possible source of error.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The interface preferably has a key field for the counting up and counting down of a number code, in particular a button for the selection of the respective key to be set. The input principle in this respect is similar to the setting of times of a digital clock. Also multi-digit number codes can thereby be quickly and easily input with very few cost-effective manufacturable setting elements.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The safety controller preferably has a plurality of connection modules connected to a series each connection module having at least one input for the connection of a sensor and/or at least having one output for the connection of an actuator. By means of the connection modules a safety controller can be assembled which provides the required number of inputs and outputs in a simple manner.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally even more preferably a head module is provided in which the control unit is stored. The control unit can alternatively be provided in one of the connection modules, alternatively the head module has inputs and outputs like a connection module.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageously one of the connection modules has an interface for the input of a number code. Alternatively the interface is part of the head module. The number code is valid in most cases for a control program which is valid for all connection modules connected as a common safety controller. However, it is also plausible to provide a plurality of interfaces in several connection modules and to individually configure these for each of the parts of the control task in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The configuration means is preferably configured to generate the number code with a checksum, wherein the safety controller is configured to check the checksum of a number code input at the interface. The term &#x201c;checksum&#x201d; in this respect should include any arbitrary coding which allows the verification of the integrity of any number code. In this manner an accidental error input of the number code is avoided at the interface. A very simple example is to provide the number code with an additional digit which includes the digit sum of the remaining digits.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The safety controller preferably has a display for number codes and the control unit is configured to carry out a control program, with the logic rules represented by a number code input at the interface only then when a confirmation of a displayed number code occurs. The number code is visually checked before the confirmation occurs, for example, by means of a certain time frame and series of a key operation. Also the input of a further specific number code for the authentication is plausible.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the number code a first bit block is preferably provided which is a logic function, a second bit block is provided which represents a connection table of the logic block and a third bit block is also provided which codes the specific type of a logic block at an input. Logic functions can, for example be a simple AND link and/or a simple OR link. The connection table determines how the inputs, the logic functions and the outputs are connected to one another. Finally, in particular one channel or two channels as well as tested or non-tested inputs can be considered as a type of input. Through this coding the most important elements of the graphical programming are imaged in the number code.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The configuration means is preferably configured to determine logic rules by means of a graphical user interface by selection of logic blocks, inputs of logic blocks and connections between logic blocks. A graphical user interface simplifies the designing and checking of the logic rules in a considerable manner. The logic rules represented in a number code can vice versa be graphically illustrated. In this manner the code of a current configuration can be transformed back into a graphical program to modify the program or to have the program checked by means of a control expert.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The configuration means is preferably configured for a consistency test of the logic rules, in particular to test whether all inputs and outputs of logic blocks are connected. Consistency tests can prevent, at least in many cases, implausible or insecure control programs from arising. The inputs and outputs of a logic block mentioned here are not allowed to be confused with the inputs and the outputs of the safety controller.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method in accordance with the invention can be furthered in a similar manner and in this respect has similar advantages. Such advantageous features are described in the claims dependent on the independent claims in an exemplary but not conclusive manner.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The two main steps of the method namely, the generation of a number code with the aid of a configuration means and the programming of the safety controller through the input of the number code can take place separate from one another both in space and time. For example, it is plausible that one or more configurations are designed by a control expert and transferred in the form of an operative command, an operation manual or during training. A service employee without in-depth technical knowledge can configure and/or program a safety controller at a different position and at a different time by inputting the number code.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a modular safety controller <b>10</b> having a control module <b>12</b>, which has a secure control unit <b>14</b>, i.e. for example a microprocessor or a different logic component. Four connection modules <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are sequentially connected to the control module <b>12</b>. Inputs <b>18</b> for the connection of sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and outputs <b>22</b> for the connection of actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are provided in the connection module <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In contrast to the illustration the connection modules <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can vary in their type and the number of their connections can be different and they can only have inputs, only have outputs as well as a mixture of different numbers of both. Also the arrangement and the physical realization of the connection clamps <b>18</b>, <b>22</b> can be adapted and through the choice of a certain connection module <b>16</b> can be adapted to different plug types, cable sizes and signal types. Finally, the modules <b>12</b>, <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are illustrated in a simplified manner and can have further elements, for example each can have an LED for each connection in a clear arrangement which optically emphasizes the arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The safety controller has the task of ensuring a secure operation of the sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and, in particular the actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, i.e. to ensure that the actuators are switched off in a safety-related manner (the output <b>22</b> is then an OSSD, Output Switching Signal Device), to carry out an emergency stop of the plant in a reliable manner, to confirm an arbitrary control of an actuator <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, especially a switching on or a restart of the plant, to release actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and such like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A light grid <b>20</b><i>b</i>, a safety camera <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and a switch <b>20</b><i>c </i>are examples of safety relevant sensors or inputs which can deliver a signal, as a reaction to which a safety related switch off occurs. This can be an interruption of the light beams of the light grid <b>20</b><i>b </i>by a body part, the recognition of an unallowed interference into a safety region by the safety camera <b>20</b><i>a </i>or an actuation of the switch <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Further safety sensors of arbitrary kind, such as a laser scanner, 3D cameras, switching mats or capacitive sensors can be connected at the inputs <b>18</b>, however, also different sensors, such as sensors for the reception of measurement data or simple switches such as an emergency stop switch can be connected. All such signal transmitters are described here and in the following as sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For certain applications, sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are also connected to outputs <b>22</b> and actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are connected to inputs <b>18</b>, for example to transmit a test signal, to temporarily switch a sensor <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>mute, to blank out partial regions from the monitoring zone of the sensor <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or because an actuator <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>also includes, beside an input for controlling, signal outputs with which an actuator <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can monitor itself at least partially.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A robot <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a press break <b>24</b><i>b </i>are connected to outputs <b>22</b> preferably in a two-channeled manner, which illustrate examples of dangerous actuators for operating personal on an unallowed interference. These actuators (in the form of a robot <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a press break <b>24</b><i>b</i>) can thus receive a switch-off command from the safety controller <b>10</b> to switch these actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>off on recognition of a danger or an unallowed interference by the safety sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>or to convey actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>into a safe state on recognition of a danger or an unallowed interference by the safety sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In this respect the light grid <b>20</b><i>b </i>can serve for the monitoring of the press break <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the safety camera <b>20</b><i>a </i>can serve for the monitoring of the robot <b>24</b><i>a </i>so that sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>associated with one another in a functional manner can also be respectively connected to a module <b>16</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>16</b><i>b</i>. However, the functional association occurs via the control unit <b>14</b> so that such an imaging of the plant is indeed clear, but is by no means required. Further actuators <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>than the ones illustrated are plausible and indeed also those are plausible which generate a danger region, and also others, such as a warning lamp, a siren or a display and such like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A so-called serial communication connection <b>26</b> is provided as a backplane between the control unit <b>14</b> and the input <b>18</b> and/or the output <b>22</b> which backplane is, in particular a bus based on a serial standard, a field bus standard, such as an IO link, a profibus, a CAN bus or can also be based on a proprietary standard and additionally be configured as fail-safe. As an alternative to a bus also a direct connection, a parallel connection or any other type of connection <b>26</b> can be provided to correspondingly communicate the data amount and the required switching times. The modules <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>have their own control <b>28</b>, to participate with the bus communication. For this reason a microprocessor, an FPGA, an ASIC, a programmable logic or a similar digital component can be provided. The controls <b>28</b> can also carry out evaluation tasks or commonly carry out different evaluations together with the control unit <b>14</b> which can range from the simplest Boolean linkings up to complex evaluations, such as a three-dimensional safety camera <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The modules <b>12</b>, <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are each stored in a uniform housing and are connected mechanically and electrically to one another by connection pieces. Thereby the control module <b>12</b> forms the head of a module series.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Safety controller <b>14</b>, inputs <b>18</b>, outputs <b>22</b> and bus <b>26</b> are configured in a fail-safe manner, i.e. by measures such as a two channel adaptation, through diverse evaluations, redundant evaluations, self-check evaluations or other secure evaluations and self-tests. Corresponding safety requirements for the safety controller are specified in the norm EN 954-1 and/or ISO 13849 (performance level). The thereby possible safety level and the further safety requirements on an application are defined in the norm EN 61508 and/or EN 62061.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with the invention the actuator <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>is provided to carry out the configuration and programming of the safety controller <b>10</b> via an interface <b>30</b> by means of a number code as will now be explained in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a simplified block illustration of a safety controller <b>10</b> which in this case is not configured modularly, or alternatively <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>can also be understood as an illustration of only one of the connection modules <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. In this respect the same reference numerals refer to features having the same or similar function here and in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The interface <b>30</b> has operating elements <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>to input a multi-digit number code which is illustrated at a display <b>32</b>. The current digit to be input is selected by the input element <b>30</b><i>a </i>while one can count a selected digit up and/or down using the two other input elements <b>30</b><i>b</i>-<i>c</i>. To complete an input, whose correctness can be checked via the display <b>32</b>, a specific combination of the operating elements <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is actuated. This combination is only known from training or from the handbook and thus ensures at least a certain protection with respect to unwanted and non-authorized changes or inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an alternative embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the interface <b>30</b> is designed for the reception of a mobile memory module <b>31</b>, for example as a USB interface, as an SD card slot or such like. If a matching memory module <b>30</b> is inserted with a number code, then the number code is automatically transferred to the safety controller <b>10</b> and illustrated at the display <b>32</b>. Similar to the other embodiments the user confirms whether this is the desired number code and confirms the number code by actuating the specific combination of the operating elements <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The number code corresponds to logic rules and thus specifies a control program which is activated for the further operation through the input of the number code in the safety controller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The generation of a number code representing a control program will now be explained with reference to the graphic illustration of an exemplary graphic illustration of logic rules in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such an illustration is the result of a graphical programming using a configurator, which is implemented for example on a PC, a notebook, a PDA or a mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Three inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are provided in the example and are referred to as &#x201c;door A&#x201d; to &#x201c;door C&#x201d;. These are connected to one another via the logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and are thus calculated to an output <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Simple AND gates and/or OR gates are the plurality of the logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>required in the safety technical application. More complex logic blocks, such as muting or bypass are less frequent. The invention initially aims to provide simpler logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>as these can be coded in a very short number code and still allow even more flexibility than, for example a common rotary switch. Principally, however, also complex logic blocks are plausible.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The user selects the required inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and determines their type, i.e. whether they are one-channeled or two-channeled and whether they are tested or not, in the graphic programming. The inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are linked to one another via suitable logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The user thereby obtains a large flexibility in the generated control program.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the user wants to conclude the graphical programming, a compiling function is initiated which transforms the inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, the logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and their connections into a multi-digit number code. Prior to the compilation also plausibility test of the graphic program is still plausible in which, for example, the user is alerted when inputs or outputs of logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are not used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an exemplary coding 3 bits are respectively provided for the type of a logic block <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, so that eight different logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If n logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are provided then they correspondingly use 3n bit. For simplification each logic block <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>has exactly two inputs and an output in the internal representation. This restriction can be hidden from the user in that, for example, on compiling an AND block with three inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is replaced by means of a suitable serial linking of two AND blocks each having two inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. Further bits are required to specify the connections between the logic blocks. For example, a number series is generated whose i-th number denotes the target of the output of the i-th logic block <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The four mentioned possible input types finally require that each logic block <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>has two inputs <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, 2*4 possibilities or each have 3 bits, i.e. a total of 3n bit.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Thus in a 24 bit number code which has seven decimal points three logic blocks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be coded. Naturally also other coding schemes and different code lengths are possible for an arbitrary type of graphical programming of logic rules. The number code can be provided with a safe guard, for example a checksum to avoid input errors.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The thereby calculated number code is displayed or stored in a mobile memory module <b>31</b> and transferred at a later point in time to the safety controller <b>10</b> via the interface <b>30</b> which then uses the associated control program. Following a configuration in the safety technology a functional test is typically carried out in which the sensors <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are specifically tested with examining bodies with respect to their correct cut-off behavior.</p>
