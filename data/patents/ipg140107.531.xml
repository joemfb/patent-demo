<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/380,299 filed Feb. 26, 2009, now abandoned.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to furniture glides, and more particularly to furniture glides having a renewable glide surface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furniture glides are available in a variety of styles and constructions, but an essential purpose is to provide an upper portion for receiving a furniture leg and a lower portion defining a sliding surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,974, &#x201c;Swivelling Furniture Glide&#x201d;, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,154,923, &#x201c;High Hold Furniture Glide&#x201d;, and U.S. Publication US2002/0088082A1 describe glides of the type having a three main components: (1) a ferrule including a bottom wall, an upstanding cylindrical side wall extending from the bottom wall and defining a socket for receiving a furniture leg, and clip means within the socket, for engaging a received furniture leg, (2) a swivelable glide support shell affixed to the bottom wall of the ferrule, and (3) a glide base affixed to the support shell and defining a substantially flat sliding surface for contacting the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,405,982, &#x201c;Self-Attaching Sliding Support for Articles of Furniture&#x201d;, describes another type of glide that does not have a ferrule or swivel capability, but rather consists of a generally cup-shaped, unitary body of a resilient element for gripping the legs and an integrated slidable base element for contact with the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In these and other known furniture glides, the sliding surface for contacting the floor is of a material specifically chosen for surface on which the furniture glide will rest. Typical base element materials include steel (usually selected for carpeted floors), hard plastics such as nylon or polyethylene (typically selected for tile floors and older vinyl flooring products containing asbestos), or soft plastics (typically selected for vinyl flooring products that do not contain asbestos and wood floors). The sliding surfaces composed of soft plastics are subject to wear.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A renewable furniture glide for use with a tubular furniture legs comprises a foot including a base portion having a bottom surface for contacting a floor and a sleeve portion for receiving a lower end of the furniture leg. The glide also comprises a ferrule including a central web, a set of arm segments, and a set of leg segments. The arm segments extend radially outward from the web to engage the inner surface of the furniture leg. The leg segments extend radially outward and axially downward from the web to a foot portion that extends radially outward axially upward to an outer edge. The outer edge engages the inner surface of the foot sleeve portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The ferrule leg segments have an outside diameter that is greater than the inside diameter of the furniture leg. The ferrule arm segments have an outside diameter that is greater than the outside diameter of the furniture leg and the inside diameter of the foot sleeve portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The outer edges of the ferrule leg segments may penetrate or elastically deform the inner surface of the foot sleeve portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The ferrule may be a unitary, monolithic component, with the arm segments disposed intermediate the leg segments.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The base portion also has an upper surface which may have an annular ring extending axially upward from therefrom. The ring and the inner surface of the sleeve portion form an annular trough, where the foot portions of the leg segments are disposed in the annular trough.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foot portion of each of the leg segments has an upper surface contacted by the lower end of the furniture leg. The furniture leg biases the outer edge of the foot portion against the inner surface of sleeve portion.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a first embodiment of a renewable furniture glide <b>10</b> in accordance with the disclosure includes a foot <b>12</b> that may be replaced as it nears the end of it's useful life or if the installed foot is not appropriate for the surface on which the furniture will be placed. A ferrule <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;, <b>14</b>&#x2033; mounts the foot <b>12</b> to the lower end <b>16</b> of a furniture leg <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the foot <b>12</b> comprises a shell having a base portion <b>20</b> for engaging a floor surface and a sleeve portion <b>22</b> for receiving the lower end <b>16</b> of the furniture leg <b>18</b>. The foot <b>12</b> may be a unitary or singular component molded from of a resilient material, such as a polymer material. The inside diameter <b>24</b> of the sleeve portion <b>22</b> may be slightly greater than, equal to, or slightly less than the outside diameter <b>26</b> of the leg <b>18</b>, so long as inside diameter <b>24</b> is less than the outside diameter of the foot engagement section <b>28</b> as explained in greater detail below. As defined herein the term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; means a line segment having end points that lie on the opposite sides of the inner surface (for inside diameter) or the outer surface (for outside diameter) of an object. The bottom surface <b>30</b> of the base portion <b>20</b> may have an arcuate-shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, a plow base configuration as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

The upper arm member <b>60</b> includes arm segments <b>68</b> that extend radially outward and axially downward to define a diameter <b>70</b> greater than the inside diameter <b>46</b> of the tubular furniture leg <b>18</b>. The arm segments <b>68</b> are resiliently deformable whereby as the upper arm member <b>60</b> is inserted into the furniture leg <b>18</b>, they resiliently deform inwardly to the smaller inside diameter <b>46</b> of the furniture leg <b>18</b>.
