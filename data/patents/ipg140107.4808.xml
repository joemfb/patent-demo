<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs, an electronic equipment, and a related computer-readable medium, and more particularly, to a method for dynamically adjusting the waiting time of handwriting inputs according to at least a writing speed (or an air speed) of an handwriting input, an electronic equipment, and a related computer-readable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In today's consumer electronics markets, portable electronic products such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, and PDA phones have already adopted a touch panel as their interface tool for data communication. Currently, the electronic products are usually designed with the trend of light weight and small size, and hence there is no enough space to accommodate conventional input devices such as keyboards or mice. Especially with the demands for human nature design in Tablet PCs, display devices equipped with a touch panel are becoming an important component of a variety of electronic products.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Handwriting input features provided by an electronic product currently on the market may set a default waiting time for the handwriting input itself or may provide a selection function to user for manually selecting the desired waiting time. When a waiting-for-input time after the electronic product receives a handwriting input exceeds the waiting time of the electronic product (such as, the default waiting time or the manually-selected waiting time from the user), it will perform a handwriting recognition upon the handwriting input. However, regardless of the default waiting time or the manually-selected waiting time from the user, the values are fixed (e.g., 3 seconds) after setting. But the writing speed of the handwriting input for the users is not fixed, and it varies from individual to individual or varies with time. In other words, the writing speeds of different users are different, even if the writing speeds of the same user will vary at different times. When the user performs the handwriting input with a faster writing speed, the default waiting time or the originally-selected waiting time has not expired yet at this time, such that the user must waste a long time upon waiting completion of the handwriting recognition. When the user performs the handwriting input with a slower writing speed, the default waiting time or the originally-selected waiting time has already ended at this time. As a result, the handwriting input process will be interrupted and correct handwriting recognition cannot be performed upon the handwriting input, which causes the user inconvenience and complications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is one of the objectives of the claimed invention to provide a method for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs, an electronic equipment, and a related computer-readable medium to solve the abovementioned problems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one example, a method for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs, which is applied to an electronic equipment having a handwriting input device, is provided. The electronic equipment performs a handwriting recognition upon a handwriting input so as to display a candidate word list when a waiting-for-input time after the handwriting input device receives the handwriting input exceeds a waiting time of the electronic equipment. The method includes the following steps: receiving the handwriting input; generating a writing speed according to the handwriting input; and setting the waiting time of the electronic equipment according to the writing speed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another example, a computer-readable medium is provided. The computer-readable medium stores a computer program having instructions for executing a method for dynamically adjusting waiting time of handwriting inputs of an electronic equipment having a handwriting input device, which cause the equipment the following steps: receiving a handwriting input; generating a writing speed according to the handwriting input; and setting the waiting time of the electronic equipment according to the writing speed. Herein when a waiting-for-input time after the handwriting input device receives the handwriting input exceeds the waiting time of the electronic equipment, the electronic equipment performs a handwriting recognition upon the handwriting input so as to display a candidate word list.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another example, an electronic equipment is provided. The electronic equipment includes a handwriting input device, a display screen, a handwriting recognition unit, a speed generating unit, and a waiting time setting unit. The handwriting input device has a writable area for receiving a handwriting input. The handwriting recognition unit is coupled to the handwriting input device and the display screen. When a waiting-for-input time after the handwriting input device receives a handwriting input exceeds a waiting time of the electronic equipment, the handwriting recognition unit performs a handwriting recognition upon the handwriting input so as to display a candidate word list on the display screen. The speed generating unit is coupled to the handwriting input device, for generating a writing speed according to the handwriting input. The waiting time setting unit is coupled to the speed generating unit, for setting the waiting time of the electronic equipment according to the writing speed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an electronic equipment <b>100</b> for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs according to an example of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of the electronic equipment <b>100</b> according to a first example of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electronic equipment <b>100</b> may include a handwriting input device <b>110</b> and a display screen <b>120</b>. In this example, the handwriting input device <b>110</b> as well as the display screen <b>120</b> are implemented by a touch screen. In other examples of the present invention, the handwriting input device <b>110</b> and the display screen <b>120</b> can be two separate devices, respectively. As an illustration, the handwriting input device <b>110</b> may be a touch panel, and the display screen <b>120</b> may be an LCD monitor. The handwriting input device <b>110</b> has a writable area WA, such as the dotted area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for receiving a handwriting input HIN, wherein the handwriting input HIN may have at least one stroke. For example, the character &#x201c;A&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a first stroke a<b>1</b>, a second stroke a<b>2</b>, and a third stroke a<b>3</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts, the electronic equipment <b>100</b> may further include a handwriting recognition unit <b>130</b> coupled to the handwriting input device <b>110</b> and the display screen <b>120</b>. When a waiting-for-input time Tin after the handwriting input device <b>110</b> receives the handwriting input HIN exceeds a waiting time Twait of the electronic equipment <b>100</b>, the handwriting recognition unit <b>130</b> performs a handwriting recognition upon the handwriting input HIN so as to display a candidate wordlist (such as: the symbol CL shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on the display screen <b>120</b>. Be noted that the aforementioned waiting-for-input time Tin means a timing that the handwriting input device <b>110</b> waits for receiving the next stroke of the handwriting input HIN after it receives the last stroke (e.g., the third stroke a<b>3</b>) of the handwriting input HIN.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Please note that the electronic equipment <b>100</b> may be a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a PDA phone, a smart phone, a laptop, a digital camera, a music player, or a game device. But the present invention is not limited to this only, and it can be any type of electronic equipments equipped with a handwriting input device, such as a personal computer or a car PC.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> again. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except for the handwriting input device <b>110</b>, the display screen <b>120</b>, and the handwriting recognition unit <b>130</b>, the electronic equipment <b>100</b> may further include a speed generating unit <b>140</b> and a waiting time setting unit <b>150</b>. The speed generating unit <b>140</b> may be coupled to the handwriting input device <b>110</b>, for generating a writing speed Vwrite according to the handwriting input HIN. The waiting time setting unit <b>150</b> may be coupled to the speed generating unit <b>140</b>, for setting the waiting time Twait of the electronic equipment <b>100</b> according to the writing speed Vwrite. As an illustration, when a user performs the handwriting input HIN with a faster writing speed Vwrite, the electronic equipment <b>100</b> can set a shorter waiting time Twait (e.g., 1 second), such that it can prevent the user from wasting too much time upon waiting completion of the handwriting recognition. When the user performs the handwriting input HIN with a slower writing speed Vwrite, the electronic equipment <b>100</b> can set a longer waiting time Twait (e.g., 5 seconds). As a result, even if the writing speed Vwrite of the handwriting input HIN varies from individual to individual or varies with time, the waiting time Twait of the electronic equipment <b>100</b> can be dynamically adjusted depending on the writing speed Vwrite of the handwriting input HIN. Therefore, it can prevent the user from wasting too much time upon waiting beginning of the handwriting recognition after the handwriting input is completed, or it can prevent the handwriting input process from being interrupted by the handwriting recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Please note that the abovementioned speed generating unit <b>140</b> generates the writing speed Vwrite according to the handwriting input HIN. In one example, the speed generating unit <b>140</b> calculates the writing speed Vwrite according to a last stroke or several last strokes of the handwriting input HIN. For example, the speed generating unit <b>140</b> can generate the writing speed Vwrite according to the last one stroke of the character &#x201c;A&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, namely the third stroke a<b>3</b>; or it can generate the writing speed Vwrite according to the last two strokes of the character &#x201c;A&#x201d;, namely the second stroke a<b>2</b> together with the third stroke a<b>3</b>. In another example, the speed generating unit <b>140</b> can generate the writing speed Vwrite according to all strokes of the handwriting input HIN. Continuing with the example above, it can generate the writing speed Vwrite according to all strokes of the character &#x201c;A&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, namely the strokes a<b>1</b>, a<b>2</b>, and a<b>3</b>. Be noted that those skilled in the art should appreciate that various modifications to the way how the speed generating unit <b>140</b> calculates the writing speed Vwrite may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention, which also belongs to the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an electronic equipment <b>300</b> for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs according to a second example of the present invention.

In addition, the speed generating unit <b>340</b> as well as the waiting time setting unit <b>350</b> of the electronic equipment <b>300</b> are slightly different from the speed generating unit <b>140</b> as well as the waiting time setting unit <b>150</b> of the electronic equipment <b>100</b>. In this example, the speed generating unit <b>340</b> may be further used for determining an air speed Vair according to the writing speed Vwrite; and the waiting time setting unit <b>350</b> may be further used for setting the waiting time Twait of the electronic equipment <b>300</b> according to the air speed Vair as well as the air moving distance Dair. As an illustration, the aforementioned air speed Vair, the air moving distance Dair, and the waiting time Twait can conform to the following equation:

</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As can be known from the equation (1), the waiting time Twait of the electronic equipment <b>300</b> can be set as a quotient obtained from dividing the air moving distance Dair by the air speed Vair. But the abovementioned examples are presented merely for describing the present invention, and in no way should be considered as limitations of the present invention. As one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that any method for generating the waiting time Twait by means of the air speed Vair (or the writing speed Vwrite) and the air moving distance Dair should belong to the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the following descriptions, several examples are cited for illustrating how the speed generating unit <b>340</b> of the electronic equipment <b>300</b> determines the air speed Vair according to the writing speed Vwrite.

For this reason, in one example, the speed generating unit <b>340</b> may determine the air speed Vair to be a designated proportion of the writing speed Vwrite, wherein the designated proportion can be adjusted depending upon actual design requirements. As an illustration, the designated proportion can be set as 90%, 100%, or 110%, wherein the writing speed Vwrite can be generated by means of the handwriting input HIN based on the aforementioned method.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another example, the speed generating unit <b>340</b> may directly generate the air speed Vair according to the writing speed of a last stroke, several last strokes, or all strokes of the handwriting input HIN.

When the handwriting input device <b>110</b> has received the first stroke a<b>1</b> of the character &#x201c;A&#x201d; and has not received the next stroke yet, the speed generating unit <b>340</b> may determine a first air speed Vair<b>1</b>, which is moved from the end of the first stroke a<b>1</b> to the beginning of the next stroke, to be a writing speed Vwrite<b>1</b> or to be any proportion of the writing speed Vwrite<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the following descriptions, several examples are cited for illustrating how the distance determining unit <b>360</b> of the electronic equipment <b>300</b> determines the air moving distance Dair.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In still another example, the air moving distance Dair is determined by estimating an input font size of the handwriting input HIN. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram of an electronic equipment <b>700</b> for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs according to a third example of the present invention.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The abovementioned examples are presented merely for describing the features of the present invention, and in no way should be considered to be limitations of the scope of the present invention. In summary, the present invention provides a method for dynamically adjusting a waiting time of handwriting inputs, a computer-readable medium, and a related electronic equipment. The mechanism for dynamically adjusting the waiting time of handwriting inputs disclosed in the present invention employs the writing speed Vwrite of the handwriting input to dynamically set the waiting time Twait of the electronic equipment. That is to say, when the user performs the handwriting input with a faster writing speed Vwrite, the electronic equipment can set a shorter waiting time Twait (e.g., 1 second), such that is can prevent the user from wasting too much time upon waiting completion of the handwriting recognition. When the user performs the handwriting input with a slower writing speed Vwrite, the electronic equipment can set a longer waiting time Twait (e.g., 5 seconds). As a result, it can prevent the handwriting input process from being interrupted, such that correct handwriting recognition cannot be performed upon the handwriting input. Be noted that the writing speed Vwrite can be generated according to at least a last stroke or all strokes of the handwriting input. Furthermore, the air moving distance Dair can be determined by estimating an input font size of the handwriting input (i.e., the actual writing area) or by reference to a size of the writable area of the handwriting input device, and then the waiting time Twait can be further set according to the air speed Vair (or the writing speed Vwrite) as well as the air moving distance Dair, which also belongs to the scope of the present invention.</p>
