<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-014279, filed on Jan. 26, 2011; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a semiconductor element.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An element using the wide-band-gap semiconductor attracts attention as a circuit element such as switching power supply and an inverter. Such an element includes a hetero-junction field effect transistor (HFET) having a hetero-structure of aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN)/gallium nitride (GaN), for example, as a device easily to have a low ON-resistance. The HFET realizes the low ON-resistance by a high mobility in a hetero-interface channel and a high electron density generated by piezo-polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when a high voltage is applied between a gate and a drain of the HFET, electric field concentration occurs at an edge part of the gate electrode. Electrons accelerated by this electric filed concentration jump into a passivation film or an AlGaN layer. As a result, the electrons are trapped in the passivation film or the AlGaN layer. It is difficult to release the trapped electrons even when the HFET comes to have an ON-state and the applied voltage across the gate and the drain is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electron trapping depletes the hetero-interface channel partially. As a result, there is a possibility that the ON-resistance is increased in the HFET. Such a phenomenon is referred to as a current collapse phenomenon. To suppress the current collapse phenomenon realizes the low ON-resistance effectively. Furthermore, when the electrons jump into the passivation film or the AlGaN layer, defects are generated in the passivation film or the AlGaN layer. Thereby, the variation in HFET characteristics, that is, reliability deterioration is caused.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A measure to reduce the electric filed at the edge part of the gate electrode includes employment of a field plate (FP) structure. For example, a substrate FP electrode is formed by way of using a conductive substrate as a support substrate and connecting the conductive substrate to the source electrode. However, when the substrate FP electrode is employed, a high voltage is applied also across a semiconductor layer between the support substrate and the drain electrode. Accordingly, for realizing a high breakdown voltage, it is necessary to increase the thickness of a semiconductor layer between the support substrate and the drain electrode. Therefore, a spatial distance is increased between the support substrate and the gate electrode and a shield effect of the substrate FP electrode becomes weak. That is, in the HFET, when the electric filed at the edge part of the gate electrode is increased, there is a possibility that the low ON-resistance and the high reliability are not obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The semiconductor element <b>1</b>A is a HFET element. In the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, semiconductor layers are stacked on a support substrate <b>10</b> which is a semi-insulating substrate. Each of the semiconductor layers is formed by an epitaxial growth method, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, a p-type layer <b>11</b> of a first first-conductivity-type layer is provided selectively on the surface of the support substrate <b>10</b>. The p-type layer <b>11</b> also may be called a p-type embedded layer or a p-type doped layer. A buffer layer <b>12</b> is provided on the support substrate <b>10</b> and the p-type layer <b>11</b>. A channel layer <b>15</b> of a first semiconductor layer is provided on the buffer layer <b>12</b>. A barrier layer <b>16</b> of a second semiconductor layer is provided on the channel layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A source electrode <b>20</b> of a first major electrode is connected to the barrier layer <b>16</b>. A drain electrode <b>21</b> of a second major electrode is connected to the barrier layer <b>16</b>. A gate electrode <b>30</b> of a control electrode is provided on the barrier layer <b>16</b> between the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>. The p-type layer <b>11</b> is provided under the gate electrode <b>30</b>. An edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b> is not positioned directly under the drain electrode <b>21</b>. For example, in the X-X&#x2032; cross section, the edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b> on the drain electrode <b>21</b> side is positioned directly under an edge <b>30</b><i>e </i>of the gate electrode <b>30</b> on the drain electrode <b>21</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The gate electrode <b>30</b> is connected to the barrier layer <b>16</b> with a Schottky junction. The p-type layer <b>11</b> electrically connected to the source electrode <b>20</b> via a contact layer <b>40</b>. The source electrode <b>20</b> and the contact layer <b>40</b> are not always formed as different members from each other and the contact layer <b>40</b> may be included in the source electrode <b>20</b> to be formed as one major electrode. This is the same in the embodiments shown below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b> has a stripe shape in the plane of the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A. The gate electrode <b>30</b> has a stripe shape in the plane of the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A. The gate electrode <b>30</b> extends in the same direction as the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The support substrate <b>10</b> is a semi-insulating substrate. The material of the support substrate <b>10</b> contains silicon carbide (SiC), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The material of the buffer layer <b>12</b> contains aluminum nitride (AlN), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The material of the channel layer <b>15</b> contains non-doped aluminum gallium nitride (Al<sub>X</sub>Ga<sub>1-X</sub>N (0&#x2266;X&#x3c;1)), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The material of the barrier layer <b>16</b> contains non-doped or n-type aluminum gallium nitride (Al<sub>Y</sub>Ga1<sub>1-Y</sub>N (0&#x3c;Y&#x2266;1 and X&#x3c;Y)), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The material of the p-type layer <b>11</b> contains p-type silicon carbide (SiC), for example. The p-type layer <b>11</b> is formed by ion implantation into the support substrate <b>10</b>, for example. The impurity concentration in the p-type layer <b>11</b> is not lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>(atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), for example. A metal layer or an n-type layer such as one which does not cause electron leak may be disposed at the p-type layer part instead of the p-type layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A foundation for the growth of the buffer layer <b>12</b> (i.e., support substrate <b>10</b> or p-type layer <b>11</b>) is required to have a high flatness and constituent uniformity. Accordingly, in the support substrate <b>10</b>, the p-type layer <b>11</b> may be provided inside the support substrate <b>10</b> and a non-doped silicon carbide layer may be exposed on the side of the buffer layer <b>12</b>. The position of the p-type layer <b>11</b> in the depth direction is adjusted by the control of ion acceleration energy in the ion implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Successively, an advantage of the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A will be explained. Before the advantage of the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A is explained, an operation of a semiconductor element <b>100</b> according to a reference example will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are schematic views of semiconductor elements according to the reference example and the embodiment, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows a cross section of the relevant part of the semiconductor element according to the reference example, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a cross section of the relevant part of the semiconductor element according to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The p-type layer <b>11</b> or the contact layer <b>40</b> is not provided in the semiconductor element <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. When a high voltage is applied between a source electrode <b>20</b> and a drain electrode <b>21</b> of the semiconductor element <b>100</b>, a high electric field is generated also between a gate electrode <b>30</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>. Thereby, an electric field is concentrated at an edge part of the gate electrode <b>30</b>. For example, the drawing illustrates a plurality of electric force lines <b>100</b><i>e </i>directed from the drain electrode <b>21</b> to the edge <b>30</b><i>e </i>of the gate electrode <b>30</b>. The edge part of the gate electrode <b>30</b> indicates the edge <b>30</b><i>e </i>or a part near this edge <b>30</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Electrons are accelerated by this high electric field in a hetero-interface channel between a barrier layer <b>16</b> and a channel layer <b>15</b>. Then, the electrons are trapped by crystal defects on the surface of the barrier layer <b>16</b>, in the barrier layer <b>16</b>, and in the channel layer <b>15</b>. Thereby, the current collapse phenomenon easily occurs in the semiconductor element <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the semiconductor element <b>100</b>, since the high energy electrons jump into an insulating film (not shown in the drawing) provided on the barrier layer <b>16</b>, insulation deterioration of the insulating film is caused easily. Furthermore, since the high energy electrons jump into the barrier layer <b>16</b> and the channel layer <b>15</b>, there is a possibility that a new crystal defect is generated in the barrier layer <b>16</b> and the channel layer <b>15</b>. Thereby, the reliability of the semiconductor element <b>100</b> is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In contrast, in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the p-type layer <b>11</b> is provided selectively on the surface of the support substrate <b>10</b> under the gate electrode <b>30</b>. When a high voltage is applied between the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b> of the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A in such a state, an electric field is concentrated also at an edge part of the p-type layer <b>11</b> on the side of the drain electrode <b>21</b> not limited to the edge part of the gate electrode <b>30</b> near the drain electrode <b>21</b>. For, example, the drawing illustrates a plurality of electric force lines <b>1</b><i>e </i>directed from the drain electrode <b>21</b> to the edge <b>30</b><i>e </i>of the gate electrode <b>30</b> or the edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b>. The edge part of the p-type layer <b>11</b> indicates the edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>or a part near this edge <b>11</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">That is, when the high electric field is applied between the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>, the electric field is dispersed by the edge part of the gate electrode <b>30</b> and the edge part of the p-type layer <b>11</b>. Furthermore, since the support substrate <b>10</b> is a semi-insulating substrate, the electric field from the drain electrode <b>21</b> can be dispersed into the support substrate <b>10</b>. Thereby, in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, the electric field near the hetero-interface is suppressed as compared with the semiconductor element <b>100</b>. As a result, the electron acceleration is slowed down in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A as compared with the semiconductor element <b>100</b>. That is, in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, the current collapse phenomenon does not occur easily as compared with the semiconductor element <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, the electrons do not jump easily into the insulating film provided on the barrier layer <b>16</b>, the barrier layer <b>16</b>, and the channel layer as compared with the semiconductor element <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A has a higher reliability than the semiconductor element <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, the electric field concentration can be reduced at the edge part of the gate electrode <b>30</b> by way of using a conductive substrate as the support substrate <b>10</b> and connecting this conductive substrate to the source electrode <b>20</b> (field plate effect (FP effect)). The current collapse phenomenon is suppressed by such a structure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, in such a structure, a high voltage is applied between the conductive substrate and the drain electrode <b>21</b> which face each other. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the channel layer <b>15</b> and the like for obtaining a high breakdown voltage. As the channel layer <b>15</b> is made thicker, the distance between the support substrate <b>10</b> and the gate electrode <b>30</b> is increased and the field plate effect is reduced. Furthermore, when the semiconductor layer such as the channel layer <b>15</b> and the like has a larger thickness, the semiconductor element <b>100</b> is bended and invites cost increase.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In contrast, when an insulating substrate is used as the support substrate <b>10</b>, the electric field concentration is not reduced at the edge part of the gate electrode <b>30</b> and there is a possibility that the current collapse phenomenon occurs easily, while the high breakdown voltage is maintained. That is, there arises a trade-off when the conductive substrate or the insulating substrate is used as the support substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A according to the embodiment, this trade-off can be dissolved through the use of the semi-insulating support substrate <b>10</b> provided with the p-type layer <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">That is, in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A, the p-type layer <b>11</b> is formed on the surface of the support substrate <b>10</b>. Therefore, the high breakdown voltage can be maintained without the thickness increase in at least any one of the buffer layer <b>12</b>, the channel layer <b>15</b>, and the barrier layer <b>16</b>. Furthermore, it is not necessary to increase the thickness in at least any one of the buffer layer <b>12</b>, the channel layer <b>15</b>, and the barrier layer <b>16</b>. As a result, the distance between a two-dimensional electron gas channel and the support substrate <b>10</b> is reduced and thermal resistance is also reduced. Thereby, the temperature rise of the element becomes difficult to occur. As a result, the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A easily realizes a high current operation and a high temperature operation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, since the p-type layer <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>20</b>, holes generated at the time of avalanche breakdown can be ejected to the source electrode <b>20</b> via the p-type layer <b>11</b>. Thereby, the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A can realize a high avalanche withstand capability.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the semiconductor element <b>1</b>B, the p-type layer <b>11</b> extends from the gate electrode <b>30</b> to the drain electrode <b>21</b> side. In the semiconductor element <b>1</b>B, the edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b> on the drain electrode <b>21</b> side is positioned between the gate electrode <b>30</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b> when viewed in the direction perpendicular to a major surface of the support substrate <b>10</b>. That is, the edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b> in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>B is positioned closer to the drain electrode <b>21</b> side than the edge <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b> in the semiconductor element <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In such a structure, when a high voltage is applied between the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>, the electric field is concentrated preferentially at the edge part of the p-type layer <b>11</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The p-type layer <b>11</b> is positioned between the support substrate <b>10</b> and the buffer layer <b>12</b>, and thus the electric field is stronger within the semiconductor layer than on the element surface.

For example, the p-type layer <b>11</b> has a convex part <b>11</b><i>t </i>and the concave part <b>11</b><i>c </i>when viewed in the direction perpendicular to the major surface of the support substrate <b>10</b>. A planar shape of the convex part lit (or concave part <b>11</b><i>c</i>) is rectangular. The convex parts <b>11</b><i>t </i>(or concave parts <b>11</b><i>c</i>) are disposed periodically in a direction approximately perpendicular to the direction from the source electrode <b>20</b> to the drain electrode <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Therefore, the positions of the electric field concentration are dispersed the same as in the case of providing a plurality of field plate electrodes and the case of changing the length of the field plate electrode. For example, when a high voltage is applied between the source electrode <b>20</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>, the electric field is dispersed into a plurality of corners <b>11</b><i>b </i>each formed by the convex part <b>11</b><i>t </i>and the concave part <b>11</b><i>c</i>. Furthermore, the positions of the electric field concentration are dispersed also when the convex part <b>11</b><i>t </i>of the p-type layer <b>11</b> is positioned near to the drain electrode <b>21</b>, and thus the semiconductor element <b>3</b>A maintains a high breakdown voltage. As a result, in the semiconductor element <b>3</b>A, the ON-resistance increase due to the current collapse and the reliability deterioration are suppressed even when the element surface does not have the field plate structure.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each of the HFET elements explained above is provided with a gate electrode through the use of the Schottky junction. This structure has a structure similar to a lateral-type Schottky barrier diode (SBD) between the gate and the drain.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The semiconductor element <b>5</b>A uses a Si substrate <b>17</b> as the support substrate. A major component of the Si substrate is silicon (Si). Preferably, in the Si substrate <b>17</b>, a low-concentration layer <b>18</b> has a doping concentration not higher than 1&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>in order to have a high resistance.

Furthermore, the n-type layer <b>19</b> is connected with a rear-side electrode <b>25</b>. The n-type layer <b>19</b> is connected to the drain electrode <b>21</b> via the rear-side electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Silicon (Si) has a smaller critical electric field than gallium nitride (GaN).

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, in the semiconductor element <b>5</b>A, a high breakdown voltage is realized by way of increasing the distance between the p-type layer <b>11</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b>.
