<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An intelligent lookup service for a network is provided for clients of a network requesting services of the network that intelligently determines, based on a service requirement of the requested service, optimal service endpoint(s) for providing the requested service. The intelligent lookup service can incorporate predetermined mapping policy and traffic measurements into the determination. In addition, a feedback loop is provided from clients and/or service endpoints to the lookup service concerning measurements about prior connections in the network. The lookup service can include a set of beacons distributed in the network and against which measurements about the network are recorded. A client receives, from the lookup service in response to a request for a network address, a set of candidate service endpoints that pertain to the requested network address and the client connects to one of the candidate service endpoints based on policy or context.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject disclosure relates to an intelligent address lookup service for networked devices for improved delivery of services.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">By way of background concerning conventional systems, the Domain Name System (DNS) associates addressing and other information with &#x201c;domain names&#x201d; for use in connection with the Internet. By analogy, DNS serves as a simple phone book for the Internet that translates human-readable computer hostnames (analogous to names of people), e.g., www.yahoo.com, into the IP addresses (analogous to phone numbers), e.g., 192.210.0.12, that networking equipment needs for delivering information. In providing a worldwide keyword-based directory service, DNS is an engrained component of contemporary Internet use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are also other uses of DNS besides translating names to IP addresses. For instance, Mail transfer agents use DNS to find out where to deliver e-mail for a particular address. DNS also stores other information, such as a list of mail exchange servers that accept e-mail for a given domain.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At a higher level, DNS makes it possible to assign Internet destinations to human organizations or concerns they represent, independently of the physical routing hierarchy represented by the numerical IP address. Because of this, hyperlinks and Internet contact information can remain the same, whereas routing arrangements change dynamically, and can take a human-readable form, such as &#x201c;www.expedia.com&#x201d;, which is easier to remember than an IP address, such as 66.230.200.100. People take advantage of this by using meaningful URLs and e-mail addresses without caring how the machine will actually resolve or locate them.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">DNS also distributes the responsibility for assigning domain names and mapping them to IP networks by allowing an authoritative server for each domain to keep track of its own changes, avoiding the need for a central registrar to be continually consulted and updated. Without going into too much detail, the domain name space consists of a tree of domain names. Each node or leaf in the tree has one or more resource records, which hold information associated with the domain name. The tree sub-divides into zones. A zone consists of a collection of connected nodes authoritatively served by an authoritative DNS nameserver.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To provide resilience in the event of computer failure, multiple DNS servers provide coverage of each domain, i.e., multiple servers contain the complete database of domain names and IP addresses. In particular, more than thirteen root servers exist worldwide. DNS programs or operating systems have the IP addresses of these servers built in. All other DNS servers are installed at lower levels of the DNS hierarchy and maintain only certain pieces of the overall database.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The lowest level DNS servers are typically owned by businesses or Internet Service Providers (ISPs). For example, Google maintains various DNS servers around the world that manage the google.com, google.co.uk, and other domains. ISPs also maintain DNS servers to facilitate connecting to the Internet from client desktops, laptops, home networks, portable devices, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">DNS networking is thus based on a client/server architecture. When accessing the Internet, a Web browser functions as a DNS client that uses a local DNS resolver, and issues requests to ISP or company DNS servers when navigating Web sites. When the DNS server receives a request for an address not in its database, such as an address for a rarely visited Web site, the local DNS server functions as a DNS client and automatically passes the request to another DNS server, possibly up to the next higher level in the DNS hierarchy, as needed. Eventually the request arrives at a DNS server that has the matching name and IP address in its database, and the response flows back through the chain of DNS servers to the client. In this respect, a request can go all the way to the root level, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With DNS, hostnames and IP addresses do not necessarily match on a one-to-one basis. Many hostnames can correspond to a single IP address allowing a single machine to serve many web sites. Alternatively, a single hostname can correspond to many IP addresses. Such flexibility can facilitate fault tolerance and load distribution, and allows a host to seamlessly change its IP address, e.g., due to physical relocation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The very seamlessness of readdressing a host, however, also leads to a basic problem, which is that DNS is not very smart about its decision-making. For instance, today, if a client's local DNS server is in Ohio where a client engages an ISP, but the client is physically located in Washington, e.g., as part of a business trip, DNS makes routing choices for the client in Washington based on the location of the local DNS server in Ohio. In other words, the designers of DNS originally contemplated computers that remained relatively fixed in position, and near their local DNS server, an assumption that has been significantly challenged with the advent of laptops, portable devices, handheld devices, mobile phones, etc. Thus, as devices move around, they may or may not be near their local DNS server and, as a result, DNS can make some poor choices concerning the path that traffic takes. Thus, DNS is clearly limited in its capabilities and more intelligent path selection is desired for Internet traffic than can be provided by DNS today.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another basic problem today pertains to delivering services via the Internet, i.e., &#x201c;cloud services.&#x201d; In this regard, no system today enables mapping of a client to a service access point to meet reliability and performance goals for the client. For instance, as a simple example, suppose a company offers a &#x201c;real-time&#x201d; service for information that demands the fastest computational resources available via servers today and suppose a corresponding service is also offered that does not deliver in real-time. For the non real-time service, a request by a client can be satisfied with inexpensive servers with slower processors, etc. Thus, it would be desirable to be able to distinguish between requests from clients that have the real-time service requirements and those that do not so that traffic can be routed to the high end server resources or low end server resources, respectively. Today, there is no way with DNS to achieve such service awareness. DNS traffic routing instead is handled in the same limited way described above. Thus, better ways of mapping network node requests for services are desired.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For the avoidance of doubt, the terms &#x201c;network service&#x201d; or &#x201c;service&#x201d; are used herein to refer a network service that can be provided to a requesting client, such as but not limited to email services, search services, content services, etc., i.e., by service endpoints in the network. It is also noted that DNS is itself a service, but this does not disturb the general understanding of the term network service as used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, with DNS, any one of many geographically distributed service access points (e.g., server IP addresses) might be returned by DNS (per a DNS lookup request) to handle a service request to a given service, without regard for how to optimize delivery of the service. In this respect, it is left up to DNS to blindly select a candidate. DNS may be configured for round robin assignment among a set of candidate servers, e.g., Yahoo1.com, Yahoo2.com, Yahoo3.com, for example, which might be helpful for load balancing for Yahoo's servers, but does not optimize the choice of candidate unique to the context of a service request.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved network address lookup service for intelligent provision of services in a network, such as the Internet. The above-described deficiencies of DNS are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments of the invention may become further apparent upon review of the following description.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As discussed in the background, among other things, DNS does not include the capability to map clients to candidate service access or end points based on client context, service endpoint context, or based on reliability and performance goals of the clients. Conventional DNS based systems are limited to imperfect attempts to direct clients requesting services to the closest server of a set of candidate servers based on heuristics of the local DNS server providing lookup services for the client.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, approximating location of the client with heuristics based on the local DNS server, which is independent of client location, results in poor performance where the underlying assumptions of such heuristics are incorrect. In addition, such techniques do little to map service requests to servers based on an awareness of the service to be provided. Moreover, independent of the service being requested, such techniques inherently ignore client context, which can be important to choosing an optimal service access point, instead focusing only on the local DNS server.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Based in part on consideration of the need for an endpoint context aware and/or service aware lookup service for clients making requests for network resources or services, intelligent mapping services are provided. In one embodiment, a service aware lookup service is provided with which clients can communicate to determine a set of candidates for service access points, or an optimal service access point, for the provision of services to a client from a set of available service access points. For instance, predetermined policy, client context, service endpoint context, network metrics, and/or any other information that is helpful to determine an optimal mapping can be taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Similar to the use of the term &#x201c;service&#x201d; generally, &#x201c;service aware&#x201d; as used herein refers to an awareness of characteristic(s) of a requested service of a service endpoint in a network, whereas &#x201c;lookup service&#x201d;, while a service, refers to a component herein that performs intelligent mapping between such service endpoints and requesting network clients.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition to maintaining an awareness of services and having the ability to distinguish among different service requests, the mapping service can also make decisions based on client context and policy. Furthermore, to aid the mapping service in converging on an ideal lookup service based on actual experiences in the network, clients and/or service access points can share the results of their actual communication experiences in the network as well as measurements with respect to common entities, such as known beacons distributed throughout the network.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this regard, intelligence about the client and about the network &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; can be extracted and analyzed. Among other things, this can facilitate &#x201c;software as a service&#x201d; technological solutions, by enabling optimal resources to be matched to requests for services. Instead of making guesses based on assumptions as with DNS, the service aware mapping service presents choices to the requesting client based on a variety of information available to the mapping service, i.e., based on intelligence known for a given service request, or based on knowledge that can be inferred.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Service Aware Lookup Services</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned, in various non-limiting embodiments, a service aware mapping service intelligently maps clients to services based on service level requirements for the services, predetermined policy, network measurements, and/or information provided by endpoints in the network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, an intelligent mapping service <b>110</b> is provided with which clients <b>100</b> can communicate to determine a set of candidates for service access points, or an optimal service access point, for the provision of a service to a client from a set of available service access points <b>120</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>_N for the service. Accordingly, when a client <b>100</b> makes a request for a service <b>105</b>, the mapping service <b>110</b> analyzes the service being requested, and based on policy, endpoint context, network measurements, and/or performance requirements for the service, the mapping service <b>110</b> determines a set of optimal candidate servers, or an optimal server, <b>125</b> for satisfaction of the request <b>105</b>. For the avoidance of doubt, multiple optimal candidate servers or multiple best, good or satisfactory candidates may exist for a given service request by a client <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a client <b>200</b> may specify, as part of a request for hosts that can provide one or more network services, a service requirement <b>205</b>, or multiple service requirements. Advantageously, this allows an application or process of client <b>200</b> to specify the level of care needed for provision of the service as part of the lookup process with a service aware mapping service <b>210</b>. Then, based on the service requirement <b>205</b> and intelligent mapping information available to the lookup process, identifiers for a set of optimal candidates <b>225</b> are transmitted to the client <b>200</b> from the universe of identifiers for service endpoints <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Representative, but non-limiting, service requirements <b>205</b> that may be specified by a client include specifying a service based on a quality of service (QoS) requirement, such as real-time requirements for hi-definition video streaming applications or a cost requirement specified by the client for the requested service where optimization may result in a set of endpoints <b>225</b> that are slow, but free. Other non-limiting examples of service requirements <b>205</b> include a bandwidth requirement for the requested service or a tolerance level to error rate for the requested service.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in another embodiment of a mapping service <b>215</b>, client <b>200</b> can make a request <b>212</b> for a service to the intelligent mapping service <b>215</b>, e.g., a request for the names of hosts that can best provide the service. The request <b>212</b> can include client context <b>202</b>, so that mapping service <b>215</b> in turn can analyze the service being requested in the context <b>202</b> of the client <b>200</b>. As a result, the intelligent mapping service <b>215</b> provides a candidate set of service access points <b>226</b> in response, which can be a set of service access points that satisfy the request, or a subset of them that are most likely to fulfill the request, or a single endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At <b>228</b>, the client in turn can make a decision about which of the candidate service access points <b>226</b> the client wishes to engage. As mentioned, this decision can include an analysis of client context <b>202</b>, and can be explicitly or implicitly specified by a user of the client <b>200</b>, or automatically decided based on policy and/or client context <b>202</b>. For instance, in the example shown, client <b>200</b> selects server <b>237</b> from the candidates <b>226</b> to satisfy request <b>212</b>. In one embodiment, a connection is made to a candidate service access point by default until a more optimal service access point is determined at <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">After being presented with a set of candidate service access points by the lookup service for a requested service, and choosing a candidate based on policy and/or client context, the client can cooperate to provide feedback to the lookup service. The provision of feedback is generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Based on actual experience with a service endpoint, client <b>300</b> provides client feedback <b>305</b> to the mapping service <b>310</b> to improve the knowledge on which service <b>310</b> predicates its presentation of candidate service points. Feedback <b>305</b> can be based on how well a selected service access point has performed for client <b>300</b> in the past. In one embodiment, feedback <b>305</b> is in the form of measurements recorded by client <b>300</b> and provided to the lookup service <b>310</b>. Feedback <b>305</b> can include, for instance, a series of measurements with respect to round trip time communications with a prior endpoint, or whether the performance met the client's requirements for high definition bandwidth. Feedback <b>305</b> can also include any other helpful client context that can inform the mapping process how to optimally provide service endpoints to the client, such as client browser cookie objects, calendar objects, or local clock settings. Thus, feedback <b>305</b> can be used by the lookup service <b>310</b> to improve its mappings based on actual experiences by the clients.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, where entities of the service infrastructure <b>320</b>, i.e., the infrastructure of various disparate kinds of endpoints in a network that can service client needs for services, are willing to cooperate, service infrastructure feedback <b>325</b> can also improve the ecosystem of knowledge possessed by mapping service <b>310</b> so that mappings can be made based on the actual quality of service delivered by different service access points. Network infrastructure entities include but are not limited to content delivery networks (CDNs), Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) data, data centers, etc., any one or more of which can also cooperate with the lookup service <b>310</b> to enable better feedback for more intelligent mappings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For instance, when the maintenance schedule for a server endpoint is made known to the service <b>310</b>, the service <b>310</b> will not map requests to the endpoint when the server endpoint is down or off-line for maintenance. For another example, servers can make their own network performance measurements with respect to client connections as clients connect and disconnect. This explicit feedback <b>325</b> from service endpoints to the mapping service <b>310</b> about client connections to the servers provides an additional level of information from which mapping service <b>310</b> can make intelligent decisions for future client requests for endpoint identifiers for a given service. In another aspect, mapping service <b>310</b> can include a trust layer <b>312</b> that protects against malicious nodes making inappropriate use of feedback mechanisms or otherwise attempting to disrupt the integrity of the mapping service <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, improved lookup methods are provided in various non-limiting embodiments for network interactions among networked devices that can include application of predetermined policy, application of intelligence extracted from the client device, application of intelligence extracted from the service endpoints, or application of intelligence extracted from performance information available in the network.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In various embodiments, any one or more of service-awareness, performance, availability and/or policy can be taken into account when choosing service access point(s), and accordingly, the client request can be optimally mapped to an IP address using the selected service access point(s). The lookup service can make the choice, or the client can make the choice, or the lookup service and the client can divide responsibility for the choice. An optimal choice is particularly important when the communication with the service access point involves several round trips, e.g., authentication, synchronization, login services, etc., or when the service session is long lived, e.g., with hosted e-mail exchange services.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, in one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, clients <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>b</i>, <b>410</b><i>c</i>, and so on, track proximities and other service metrics with respect to a set of beacons B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, . . . , BN, distributed around network cloud <b>400</b>. In addition, any of the service access points <b>420</b><i>a</i>, <b>420</b><i>b</i>, <b>420</b><i>c</i>, and so on, can also track these metrics with respect to the beacons B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, . . . , BN, and report these metrics back to the clients in response to lookup requests. In one non-limiting embodiment, by logging into the network cloud <b>400</b>, the client thereby subscribes to data from the beacons B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, . . . , BN. A variety of heuristics can optionally be applied to minimize the impact of any lag resulting from registering.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, lookup service <b>510</b> is an ecosystem of evolving current information about clients <b>500</b> and service endpoints <b>520</b> with respect to a set of beacons <b>505</b> for which location is known. Clients <b>500</b> know their own position, e.g., latency measurements, with respect to beacons <b>505</b> and service endpoints <b>520</b> know their own position, e.g., latency measurements, with respect to the Beacons. Latency measurements provide a form of relative position of nodes through triangulation techniques. As a result of a collective measurements that can be gathered about relative positioning of nodes across the network, an approximation of the network topology of nodes can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this respect, any machine can serve as a beacon, since any machine knows or can learn its own location in a network topology, and can gather metrics from both clients <b>500</b> and endpoints <b>520</b> for purposes of facilitating an intelligent match for a request for services. For practical reasons, however, it may be desirable to have a set of anchor beacons, which are stable and provided at fixed locations, since end user machines, and even server connectivity, can come and go. The more reliably a beacon maintains and continues to update its data store of information about provision of services by various service endpoints <b>520</b>, the more reliable the lookup service <b>510</b> will be.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Based on the choices of service access points that are candidates for provision of associated services, the client then makes an informed choice of service access point based on an analysis of metrics between client and beacons and/or metrics between service access points and beacons. This is illustrated generally in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the selection of a service endpoint by a client from a set of candidate service endpoints returned from a lookup service. As shown, a client <b>500</b><i>a </i>makes a lookup request for service <b>515</b>, which is received by a lookup service <b>510</b>. As described elsewhere, the lookup service <b>510</b> examines the request, and determines a set of candidate service endpoints to send back to client <b>500</b><i>a </i>at <b>525</b>. At <b>530</b>, client <b>500</b><i>a </i>makes an informed choice of service endpoint <b>530</b>. Next, at <b>535</b>, the client is connected to the selected service endpoint <b>520</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Policy can be applied at each of the three steps. Information and policy can be enhanced, for example, if a user of a client <b>500</b><i>a </i>registers for a service, e.g., logs in to check email or logs in to a personalized web page.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With respect to distance measurements, any measurements that help to optimize delivery of a service by various service endpoints can be used. In an exemplary, non-limiting implementation, coordinate systems are derived from latency measurements to predict internet network distances, though for the avoidance of doubt, this is just one optional implementation. For instance, coordinates-based mechanisms can be used in a peer-to-peer architecture to predict Internet network distance, i.e., round-trip propagation and transmission delay.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A triangulated heuristic, which is based on relative coordinates, is one technique that can be used based on the distances from a host to specialized network nodes. Another mechanism that can be used is Global Network Positioning (GNP), which is based on absolute coordinates computed from modeling the Internet as a geometric space. Since end hosts maintain their own coordinates, these approaches allow end hosts to compute their inter-host distances as soon as they discover each other. Moreover coordinates are very efficient in summarizing inter-host distances, making these approaches very scalable. Thus, using measured Internet distance data, coordinates-based schemes can help inform choices of service access points by clients.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A variety of service load and availability information can also be incorporated into the decision of service access point. In addition, policy, e.g., customer type&#x2014;higher or lower paying, service level agreement (SLA), content delivery cost, knowledge of maintenance windows, etc. can be incorporated into the decision-making as well. Regarding cost considerations, for example, a response to a request for service can return service access points where the path between client and service involves delivery of content via links to peers as opposed to links to paid transit to third party CDNs or network service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Unlike conventional systems based on DNS, where DNS makes an uninformed decision, the client can thus perform the mapping decision. This is illustrated generally in the process flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For instance, at <b>600</b>, a client requests a network address of a network or host name via a lookup service. At <b>610</b>, a set of candidate service endpoints are determined or received by the lookup service and sent to the client. At <b>620</b>, the client (not the lookup service) selects one of the candidate service endpoints as an optimal endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described elsewhere, a host of client context information and information about the candidate service endpoints can inform the decision of which candidate to select by the client. This decision can be made by the lookup service, the client or a combination of the lookup service and the client. Where the client participates in the decision making for the optimal service endpoint(s), the client is provided with some or all of the host of information available to the lookup service. In some instances, a client will have additional information not possessed by the lookup service as part of its local context, which can be used when making the decision. At <b>630</b>, the client connects to the optimal service endpoint. In one embodiment, while the determination of optimal service endpoint occurs, a default service endpoint can be selected immediately, e.g., based on a past service endpoint that provided the same or similar service satisfactorily. Then, the optimal service endpoint is used only if it satisfies the client's requirements better than the default service endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a feedback loop process in accordance with a lookup service. At <b>700</b>, the lookup service receives a request for a network address of a network. At <b>710</b>, the lookup service analyzes any feedback that has been received from clients cooperating with the lookup service regarding network measurement data from prior connections to the network. Similarly, at <b>720</b>, the lookup service analyzes any feedback that has been received from service endpoints cooperating with the lookup service regarding network measurement data from prior connections to the network. At <b>730</b>, a set of service endpoint(s) are determined that can potentially satisfy the client's request for the network address. As discussed above, the client can then select an optimal service endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, a set of anchor beacons can be distributed throughout the network. In addition, clients may also organize into a peer to peer (p2p) beacon service, a form of lightweight beacon service in contrast to the anchored beacons. The amount of proving, i.e., potentially n squared, can be mitigated with appropriate security mechanisms to thwart information poisoning. In this regard, more beacons will lead to better results.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Practical Internet Coordinates (PIC) have been proposed for distance estimations between nodes in a network. PIC maps each node to a point in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. When a node n joins the system, it computes the coordinates of its corresponding point. It probes the network distance to each element of a set of landmarks, L, where L must have at least d+1 members. Then it obtains the coordinates of each landmark, and uses a multidimensional global optimization algorithm, e.g., a simplex method for function minimization, to compute its coordinates such that the errors in the |L| predicted distances between n and each node in L are minimized. The errors are computed using the measured and estimated distances. The probe could use Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), application-level round-trip time, or number of Internet Protocol (IP) hops. This is similar to GNP described above, except GNP uses a fixed set L for all the nodes that join the system. In PIC, the joining node can pick any node whose coordinates have already been computed to be a landmark.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this regard, PIC can include a security mechanism as follows. Let N be the set of nodes whose coordinates have already been computed. When a node n joins the system, it can select any set L that is a subset of N with size |L|&#x3e;d. Three different strategies can be used to choose L: (1) random: pick the elements of L randomly with uniform probability from N, (2) closest: pick the elements of L to be the elements of N closest to n in the network topology and (3) hybrid: pick some elements as in random and others as in closest.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">L is defined for a node n to be the union of two sets L<sub>r </sub>and L<sub>c</sub>. The elements in L<sub>r </sub>are chosen randomly from N, whilst the elements in L<sub>c </sub>are the |L<sub>c</sub>| members of N which are closest to node n in the network. When bootstrapping the behavior of the system is slightly different. If |N|&#x3c;|L|, n selects all the nodes in N. Then it obtains the measured distances between all pairs of nodes in N (a |N|&#xd7;|N| matrix). In this case, the global optimization algorithm computes new coordinates for all the nodes in N by minimizing the error in the predicted distances between all pairs of nodes in N &#x222a;{n}.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a security test can be applied to guard against malicious nodes providing information into beacon network <b>810</b> of the lookup service. At a high level, for instance, triangulation can be used as a bound on maliciously provided measurements. For instance, if measurements M<b>1</b> are provided to only one beacon of beacons <b>810</b> from a possibly malicious node <b>800</b>, it is difficult to tell if the measurements M<b>1</b> can be trusted. However, once measurements M<b>2</b> are also made to another beacon of beacons <b>810</b>, triangulation principles can be used to test whether the measurements M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are truthful, since measurements M<b>3</b> between the associated beacons are known to be truthful. In this regard, the positions of beacons <b>810</b> are all known, and thus the measurements M<b>3</b> act as a check against the legitimacy of measurements M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In more detail, to eliminate malicious nodes from the set of landmarks chosen to compute the coordinates of each node n, a security test can be applied. The test relies on the observation that the triangle inequality holds for most triples of nodes in the Internet. Since the accuracy of PIC and the other distance estimation proposals relies on this condition, it is a reasonable assumption for a security test. Therefore, for most triples of nodes a, b, c, d<sub>a,b</sub>+d<sub>b,c</sub>&#x2267;d<sub>a,c</sub>, where d<sub>i,j </sub>denotes either the measured network distance between i and j or the predicted distance.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The intuition behind the security test is as follows. An attacker that lies about its coordinates or its distance to the joining node is likely to violate triangle inequality. The joining node uses the distances it measured to each landmark node and the coordinates of the landmarks to check for violations of the triangle inequality. It then removes from L the nodes that most violate the triangle inequality.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Such a security test scales well because it does not rely on infrastructure nodes; any node whose coordinates have already been computed can act as a landmark. Therefore, communication and computation load can be distributed evenly over all the nodes in a system. Additionally, coordinates are computed efficiently and landmark nodes are selected in a way that predicts distances as accurately as GNP. Finally, PIC can compute accurate coordinates even when some peers are malicious.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, various embodiments for an intelligent lookup service are described herein that performs intelligent mapping based on information available about clients, network measurements and service endpoints. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> illustrate some example scenarios of using the lookup service. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> depicts a block diagram of client <b>900</b><i>a </i>located in Region <b>1</b>, in this case, the United States. As mentioned in the background, a significant problem with DNS today is that it does not make an intelligent determination of optimal servers for use. For instance, with DNS, when client <b>900</b><i>a </i>goes to Region <b>2</b>, e.g., South Korea, DNS will continue to direct client <b>900</b><i>a </i>to mail server MS<b>1</b> located in North America, but through South Korea server MS<b>4</b>, which can introduce significant lags and delays in retrieval and sending of data from and to the mail server MS<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For instance, a mail server MS for a company may comprise globally situatied mail servers MS<b>1</b>, MS<b>2</b>, MS<b>3</b> and MS<b>4</b>. Today, when a company employee from the United States travels to South Korea with his or her laptop, and then performs a DNS lookup for his or her company's mail server MS, the South Korea server MS<b>4</b> does not have the user's mail information readily available. As a result, through the DNS protocol described in the background, the South Korea server must communicate with the US server MS<b>1</b> on the user's behalf, introducing lag and delay from too many servers MS<b>1</b> and MS<b>4</b> communicating on behalf of the user for a simple mail request.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With various embodiments described herein, however, client context <b>902</b><i>a </i>can inform the lookup service <b>910</b> to make an intelligent mapping to a more appropriate mail server for the request for MS. For instance, client context <b>902</b><i>a </i>might include a client calendar item that indicates the user traveled to South Korea two days ago for a one week trip. Or, client context <b>902</b><i>a </i>may include a local clock time that indicates a South Korea time zone in which the user is present. Accordingly, based on an intelligent policy implemented by lookup service <b>910</b>, client <b>900</b><i>a </i>can convey client context <b>902</b><i>a </i>to the lookup service <b>910</b>, which determines based on the client context <b>902</b><i>a </i>that the user is from USA, and so instead of redirecting through South Korea mail server MS<b>4</b> as with DNS, the intelligent lookup service <b>910</b> sends the client <b>900</b><i>a </i>directly to the USA server MS<b>1</b>. As a result, this avoids the South Korea server MS<b>4</b> as an intermediary, thereby reducing network delays and overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As another example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, service <b>910</b> service is able to determine from the user's calendar represented in client context <b>902</b><i>b</i>_t<b>1</b> (at a first time) that the user, e.g., owner of client <b>900</b><i>b</i>, will be traveling to South Korea soon. In such case, all or a portion of the user's mail can be migrated or copied to the South Korea server MS<b>4</b> at the first time. Then, after the user of client <b>900</b><i>b </i>has traveled, at t<b>2</b> (a second time) and the user performs a lookup request for mail server MS including client context <b>902</b><i>b</i>_t<b>2</b>, the analysis of intelligent mapping service <b>910</b> will determine (a) that the user is from the USA and (b) that the mail has already been migrated. As a result, instead of communicating with the North America server MS<b>1</b>, the lookup service <b>910</b> directs client <b>900</b><i>b </i>to the local South Korea server, and user will have fast experience. Thus, intelligence about the mapping process can come from a variety of sources for endpoint context, i.e., any piece of information available that can inform the process of selecting an optimal endpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The network interaction and utilization becomes more efficient for the user <b>900</b> in a seamless fashion. When the network interactions for each client are made more efficient due to the intelligent mapping services provided in accordance with the invention, the whole network benefits since in effect, reducing inefficient transactions in the network by providing faster, shorter, etc. connections, increases overall bandwidth for additional clients.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this regard, as described in various non-limiting embodiments above, the systems and methods of the invention extract and analyze intelligence on the client and in the network &#x201c;cloud.&#x201d; Among other things, the invention thus facilitates &#x201c;software as a service&#x201d; business models and technological solutions.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Exemplary Networked and Distributed Environments</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the invention can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device, which can be deployed as part of a computer network, or in a distributed computing environment, connected to any kind of data store.

The present invention may apply to an environment with server computers and client computers deployed in a network environment or a distributed computing environment, having remote or local storage.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information, cache storage and disk storage for objects, such as files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity, allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard, a variety of devices may have applications, objects or resources that may request the lookup services of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> provides a schematic diagram of an exemplary networked or distributed computing environment. The distributed computing environment comprises computing objects <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, etc. and computing objects or devices <b>1020</b><i>a</i>, <b>1020</b><i>b</i>, <b>1020</b><i>c</i>, <b>1020</b><i>d</i>, <b>1020</b><i>e</i>, etc. These objects may comprise programs, methods, data stores, programmable logic, etc. The objects may comprise portions of the same or different devices such as PDAs, audio/video devices, MP3 players, personal computers, etc. Each object can communicate with another object by way of the communications network <b>1040</b>. This network may itself comprise other computing objects and computing devices that provide services to the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and may itself represent multiple interconnected networks. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, each object <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, etc. or <b>1020</b><i>a</i>, <b>1020</b><i>b</i>, <b>1020</b><i>c</i>, <b>1020</b><i>d</i>, <b>1020</b><i>e</i>, etc. may contain an application that might make use of an API, or other object, software, firmware and/or hardware, suitable for communication with lookup services provided in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many of the networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any of the infrastructures may be used for exemplary communications made incident to the lookup services of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Thus, the network infrastructure enables a host of network topologies such as client/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures. The &#x201c;client&#x201d; is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. Thus, in computing, a client is a process, i.e., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to &#x201c;know&#x201d; any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, as an example, computers <b>1020</b><i>a</i>, <b>1020</b><i>b</i>, <b>1020</b><i>c</i>, <b>1020</b><i>d</i>, <b>1020</b><i>e</i>, etc. can be thought of as clients and computers <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, etc. can be thought of as servers where servers <b>1010</b><i>a</i>, <b>1010</b><i>b</i>, etc. maintain the data that is then replicated to client computers <b>1020</b><i>a</i>, <b>1020</b><i>b</i>, <b>1020</b><i>c</i>, <b>1020</b><i>d</i>, <b>1020</b><i>e</i>, etc., although any computer can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances. Any of these computing devices may be processing data, recording measurements or requesting services or tasks that may implicate the lookup services in accordance with the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet or wireless network infrastructures. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects utilized pursuant to the techniques for performing intelligent mappings to network address of the invention may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.</p>
