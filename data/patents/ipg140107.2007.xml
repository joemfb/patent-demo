<heading id="h-0001" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to display systems. More particularly, embodiments relate to an apparatus and system for an electrophoretic display.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flexible displays made with a technology known as electronic ink or E-ink&#x2122; are in the process of commercial development. While the early versions are expected to resemble simple displays that might sit by the side of a highway to warn of trouble ahead or might advertise specials at a convenience store, later versions are expected to lead to electronic books with paper-like pages and illustrations that move, newspapers that update themselves, reusable paper displays for cellular phones, disposable TV screens, and even electronic wallpaper.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flexible displays may be divided into two classes. Generally, an encapsulated electrophoretic display includes one or more species of particles that either absorb or scatter light. One example is a system in which the capsules contain electrophoretically mobile particles dispersed in an opaque suspending medium. The electrophoretically mobile particles generally have a color that contrasts the opaque suspending medium. Another example is a system where each capsule contains two separate species of particles having contrasting colors and suspended in a clear suspending fluid. For example, one of the species of particles can absorbs light (black), while the other species of particles scatters light (white). Other extensions are possible, including more than two species of particles, with or without a dye, etc. The particles are commonly solid pigments, dyed particles, or pigment/polymer composites.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are two general types of particle displays; the first is often referred to as a suspended particle display (SPD). In SPDs the orientation of the particles is selectively controlled to produce the optical contrast required for a display. In an electrophoretic image display (EPID), the distribution of a particle population is selectively controlled in order to produce the optical contrast required for a display. In both cases an electric field is used to control the particles. It should be noted that particles in both display types are suspended in a liquid medium, and in one case the response to the electric field is with respect to orientation, and in the other with respect to distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">SPDs are attractive due to their wide viewing angle, high optical transmission and ease of fabrication. With SPDs, light valve action is obtained when sub-micron sized particles with an asymmetric, plate-like shape align with an externally-applied electric field, and thus permit light to pass through (the &#x201c;light&#x201d; state). This alignment occurs because the external field induces a dipole moment in the molecules of the particles. In the absence of the external field, the particles orient randomly due to Brownian motion, and consequently block light (the &#x201c;dark&#x201d; state).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, crystals of iodoquinine sulfate or related compounds may be dispersed in an organic liquid, and because the crystals are dichroic, there is a large difference between the absorption in the unaligned state in comparison to the aligned state. In the absence of an applied field, the random orientation produces a bluish-black appearance, and in the aligned state there is very little absorption and good contrast can be obtained with a white background. A significant disadvantage of SPDs is that the light areas of the display must be continuously energized with the external electric field to maintain the display, thus consuming energy even when the image on the display is static. SPDs also typically lack a clear voltage threshold (threshold), and require active-matrix addressing for high resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In EPIDs, the particles (or ink capsules) used in the display are electrically charged and may either have a color that contrasts with the liquid used to suspend them, for example white particles in a dark blue dye, or may be divided into particles of two contrasting colors with opposite charge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates conventional particles in a typical EPID. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>depicts an ink capsule <b>605</b> comprised of charged pigment particles <b>610</b> of one color. The ink capsule <b>605</b> may also contain a fluid <b>615</b> of a second color. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>depicts an ink capsule <b>605</b> with two charged pigments: charged pigment particles of one color <b>610</b> and charged pigment particles of a second color <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a conventional display system <b>700</b> with ink capsules <b>720</b> suspended in an opaque liquid, where the ink capsules contain charged pigment particles <b>725</b> of a first color. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the display system <b>700</b> includes two electrodes <b>705</b>, <b>710</b>, respectively, and a substrate <b>715</b> (e.g., a flexible supporting film) embedded with ink capsules <b>720</b>. When an electric field is applied, the charged pigment particles <b>725</b> in the ink capsules <b>720</b> migrate to the electrode with the polarity opposite of the charge of the pigment particles <b>725</b>, producing either a light or dark region when viewed from the front (e.g., the top of the substrate <b>715</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), depending on whether the particles <b>725</b> are attracted to electrode <b>705</b> or <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a conventional display system <b>800</b> with ink capsules of two colors suspended in a clear liquid. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the display system <b>800</b> includes two electrodes <b>805</b>, <b>810</b>, respectively, and a substrate <b>815</b> embedded with ink capsules <b>820</b>, where the ink capsules <b>820</b> comprise two types of charged pigment particles <b>825</b>, <b>830</b>. The first type of pigment particle <b>825</b> has a charge opposite to the second type of pigment particle <b>830</b>. When the electric field is applied, the pigment particles in the capsules <b>820</b> move in the direction of the electrode <b>805</b> or <b>810</b> with the polarity opposite of the charged pigment particles <b>825</b>, <b>830</b> in the capsules <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The EPID generally operates by reflection and absorption as opposed to transmission. Although EPIDs have some inherent memory, this memory is due to the viscosity of the liquid medium and therefore decays with time. And because there is no voltage threshold, making multiplexed displays is difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another problem associated with conventional EPIDs is that they do not display gray levels. Rather, they are essentially ON/OFF type displays where the pigment particles either provide a light state or a dark state.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the need exists for a particle display that is able to retain a displayed image without an applied external field. There is also a need for a particle display that has a voltage threshold that enables multiplexing. Moreover, a need exists to provide a display that is able to display gray levels.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An embodiment generally relates to a system for electronic paper. The system for electronic paper can include an electret substrate and a first plurality of capsules embedded in the electret substrate. The first plurality of capsules can comprise a first housing having a first permittivity. The system can further include a second plurality of capsules embedded in the electret substrate. The second plurality of capsules can comprise a second housing having a second permittivity different than the first permittivity. Each of the first plurality of capsules and the second plurality of capsules further comprise a first plurality of charged pigment particles suspended within a fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to various other embodiments, an apparatus for an electrophoresis display is provided. The apparatus can have an electret substrate including a first family of capsules, each capsule in the first family of capsules having a first threshold and each capsule in the first family capsules comprising a plurality of charged pigments, and a second family of capsules, each capsule in the second family of capsules having a second threshold and each capsule in the second family of capsules comprising a plurality of charged pigments.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present invention are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, various types of electrophoresis display systems, and that any such variations are contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Moreover, all ranges disclosed herein are to be understood to encompass any and all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of &#x201c;less than 10&#x201d; can include any and all sub-ranges between (and including) the minimum value of zero and the maximum value of 10, that is, any and all sub-ranges having a minimum value of equal to or greater than zero and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10, e.g., 1 to 5.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments generally relate to an electrophoretic display system. More particularly, the electrophoretic display system may include a clear electret dielectric substrate. An electrically conductive film may be placed on both sides of the electret dielectric substrate configured to operate as electrodes. The electrically conductive film may be programmable, for example, able to change the amplitude and polarity on a pixel-by-pixel basis. To achieve gray levels, the electret dielectric may be embedded with a plurality of electronic ink capsule families, with each family of capsules having a different threshold voltage (threshold) level. According to various embodiments, different thresholds may be achieved using capsules with size dependent thresholds. It is contemplated, however, that any method of obtaining thresholds for different families of capsules can be used. As such, when a certain voltage level is applied across the film, only capsules with threshold values below the applied voltage will toggle, while the rest of the capsules, those with thresholds above the applied voltage, stay put.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The electronic ink capsules may include a plurality of charged pigments of one color (i.e., ink pigments, ink particles, ink particle pigments, etc.) in a fluid of a second color. In various embodiments, the fluid can be clear. The fluid and pigment particles can be encased in a dielectric housing. According to various embodiments, the housing can be formed of an insulating material. In various other embodiments, the housing can have an electric permittivity from about 1 to about 3.5 or greater. In still other embodiments, the electric permittivity of the housing can be adjusted so as to control the threshold of the capsule by, for example, varying the size, shape, and/or material of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The housing can have a spherically asymmetric but cylindrically symmetric shape. The clear electret dielectric substrate may be charged with electrical charge opposite in sign of the charge of the pigment particles in the electronic ink capsules. In some embodiments, the combined charge of the electret dielectric substrate may be substantially the same as the total charge of the particle pigments in the ink capsules.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When a predetermined electric field is applied, the charged pigment particles in the electronic ink capsules move either in the direction of the electric field or in a direction opposite to the electric field depending on the threshold level of the capsules, and/or the polarity of the charge of the pigment particles. However, when the electric field is removed or when no electric field is applied, the charged pigment particles within the ink capsules maintain their position. The local electric field between the electret dielectric substrate and the charged pigments prevent movement of the pigments within the ink capsule when no electric field is applied. The local field is not homogeneous because of the asymmetry of the capsule housing and peaks when the pigment is either in the front or back of the capsule. Accordingly, each electronic ink capsule may have a bi-stable characteristic. Moreover, to change a status of a pixel, the voltage applied across the corresponding electrodes has to exceed the potential barrier of the local field. As a result, this makes multiplexing large numbers of pixels not only possible but also very simple and therefore inexpensive.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate exemplary electronic ink capsules <b>100</b> in accordance with various embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, capsule <b>100</b> may include charged pigment particles <b>105</b> (or charged ink pigments, charged ink particles, etc.) and a fluid <b>110</b>, which are encased by a housing <b>115</b>. The charged pigments <b>105</b> can be a first color and the fluid <b>110</b> can be opaque. In various other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, capsule <b>100</b> may include charged pigment particles <b>105</b>, charged pigment particles <b>106</b>, and clear fluid <b>110</b>, all of which are encased by a housing <b>115</b>. Charged pigment particles <b>105</b> can have a color that contrasts with a color of charged pigment particles <b>106</b>. For example, if the color of particles <b>105</b> is black, the color of particles <b>106</b> would be preferably white. Accordingly, other color schemes with great contrast are contemplated for other embodiments. Moreover, the charge of particles <b>105</b> can be opposite to the charge of particles <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For illustrative purposes only, the electronic ink capsule <b>100</b> is depicted with a reference plane <b>120</b> and an axis <b>130</b>. The reference plane <b>120</b> generally surrounds the &#x201c;equator&#x201d; of the electronic ink capsule <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The housing <b>115</b> of ink capsules <b>100</b> may be implemented with a low permittivity dielectric material such as Teflon&#x2122; (polytetrafloroethylene), polyethylene or other similar material. Moreover, the housing <b>115</b> may be formed in a cylindrically symmetric shape. In some embodiments, housing <b>115</b> may be spherically asymmetric and cylindrically symmetric around axis <b>130</b>. In other embodiments, the housing <b>115</b> may be implemented as part of an electret that is not charged. More particularly, the ink capsule <b>100</b> may be embedded in a charged electret. However, a region of uncharged electret may be formed around the equator of the reference plane <b>120</b> of the ink capsule <b>100</b>. The housing <b>115</b> of the ink capsule <b>100</b> may be implemented with low permittivity material for these embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to various embodiments, the permittivity of the housing <b>115</b> may be related to the shape, size, and permittivity of the housing material used to make housing <b>115</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More particularly, the thickness of the dielectric is the greatest proximate the reference plane <b>120</b> of the housing <b>115</b>. Similarly, the thickness of the housing <b>115</b> is the smallest proximate the poles of the axis <b>130</b> of the housing <b>115</b>. Exemplary housing materials can include, for example, materials that are good insulators. In various embodiments, no housing is required as the electret can serve as a virtual wall. Further, the diameter of the capsules can range in size from about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another embodiment of an exemplary electronic ink capsule <b>100</b>&#x2032; with a high permittivity dielectric housing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, capsule <b>100</b>&#x2032; may include charged pigments <b>105</b>&#x2032; and an opaque fluid <b>110</b>&#x2032;, which are encased by a housing <b>115</b>&#x2032;. The charged pigments <b>105</b>&#x2032; may be a first color and the opaque fluid <b>110</b>&#x2032; may contrast the first color.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For illustrative purposes only, electronic ink capsule <b>100</b>&#x2032; is depicted with a reference plane <b>130</b>&#x2032; and an axis <b>120</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The housing <b>115</b>&#x2032; of capsule <b>100</b>&#x2032; may be implemented with a dielectric material, the electric permittivity of which can be selected as desired. Moreover, the housing <b>115</b>&#x2032; may be formed in a cylindrically symmetric shape. In some embodiments, housing <b>115</b>&#x2032; may be spherically asymmetric and cylindrically symmetric around axis <b>120</b>&#x2032;. For this embodiment, a high permittivity dielectric material may be used to implement the housing <b>115</b>&#x2032;, where the thickness of the housing <b>115</b>&#x2032; is greatest around the poles of the axis <b>120</b>&#x2032; and thinnest around the equator of the reference plane <b>130</b>&#x2032;. In other embodiments, the housing <b>115</b>&#x2032; may be implemented as part of an electret that is not charged. More particularly, the ink capsule <b>100</b>&#x2032; with a high permittivity housing <b>115</b>&#x2032; may be eventually embedded in a charged electret. However, an uncharged area surrounding the ink capsule <b>100</b>&#x2032; may be formed to become a housing that is similar to housing <b>115</b> with the same orientation. Similarly, as with the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for enhanced stability, the combined charge of the electret should be substantially equal to the total charge of the pigments <b>105</b>&#x2032; contain in the capsules <b>100</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate exemplary systems <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032;, respectively. For matters of simplicity, systems <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; are depicted with a single ink capsule <b>305</b>. It should be understood, however, that it is well within the scope of the embodiments that each system <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; contain multiple ink capsules.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the components of systems <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; are identical. More particularly, each system <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; may comprise an ink capsule <b>305</b> embedded in a charged electret substrate <b>310</b>. The ink capsule <b>305</b> comprises a plurality of charged pigment particles <b>307</b>. Electrode <b>325</b>A may be interfaced with one side of the charged electret substrate <b>310</b> and electrode <b>325</b>B may be interface with the second side of the charged electret substrate <b>310</b>. Systems <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032; may also include a power supply <b>330</b>. System <b>300</b> depicts a voltage applied scenario <b>315</b> where the electric field is in one direction and system <b>300</b>&#x2032; depicts a voltage applied scenario <b>315</b> where the electric field is reversed from system <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>for system <b>300</b>, when a voltage source <b>330</b> is applied to the electrodes <b>325</b>, the electrode <b>325</b>A develops a positive polarity and the electrode <b>325</b>B develops a negative polarity. In system <b>300</b>&#x2032;, the electrode <b>325</b>A develops a negative polarity and the electrode <b>325</b>B develops a positive polarity because the power supply has been reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, an electric field <b>335</b> is developed across the electret substrate <b>310</b>, which is greater than the local electric field between the charged pigments in the ink capsule <b>305</b> and the charged electret substrate <b>310</b>. As a result, the charged pigments <b>307</b> within the ink capsule <b>305</b> move toward the electrode <b>325</b>B with the negative polarity in system <b>300</b> and toward the electrode <b>325</b>A with negative polarity in system <b>300</b>&#x2032;. As shown in systems <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>&#x2032;, the pigments <b>307</b> move with the electric field <b>335</b> because the charge of the pigment particles <b>307</b> in the ink capsule <b>305</b> is positive. It is contemplated, however, that the charge of the pigment particles <b>307</b> can be negative.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the no voltage scenario <b>320</b> where the electric field <b>335</b> is removed, the pigment particles <b>307</b> within the ink capsule <b>305</b> can maintain their position. The anchoring effect may be due to the local electric field <b>340</b> established between the charged pigments <b>307</b> in the capsule <b>305</b> and the oppositely charged electret <b>310</b>. The local electric field <b>340</b> is not homogeneous because of the asymmetry of the housing of the capsule <b>305</b>. Rather, it peaks when the pigment is either in the front shown in system <b>300</b> or back as shown in system <b>300</b>&#x2032;. More particularly, when no external field across the electret substrate <b>310</b>, the electric field generated around the thicker part of the low permittivity housing is smaller than the electric field generated around the thinner portions of the housing. Accordingly, this results in a net field going from the thicker portions of the housing to the thinner portions of the housing, which is illustrated by the field arrows of the local electric field <b>340</b>. This property of the electric field may also give each capsule its bi-stable character.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary system <b>400</b> and system <b>400</b>&#x2032; with an ink capsule comprising high-permittivity housing.

It should be understood as within the scope of the embodiments, however, that each system <b>400</b> and <b>400</b>&#x2032; may contain multiple ink capsules.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrated another exemplary system <b>500</b> in accordance with yet another embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the system <b>500</b> includes capsules <b>505</b>, electret film <b>510</b> and a standard X-Y Indium Tin Oxide (&#x201c;ITO&#x201d;) array <b>515</b>, which is a transparent and electrically conductive coating used to address LCD pixels. The capsules <b>505</b> are embedded in the electret film <b>510</b> and the capsules <b>505</b> are loosely aligned. An example of the electret film <b>510</b> may be Teflon&#x2122; (polytetrafloroethylene). Electret film can be formed of materials that are good insulators. The ITO array <b>515</b> can be configured to provide control of the capsules <b>505</b> on a pixel basis. In some embodiments, conductive polymers can be used to address areas of the electret substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A-9F</figref> illustrate another exemplary system <b>900</b> in accordance with yet another embodiment capable of achieving gray levels. For matters of simplicity, system <b>900</b> shows three ink capsules, each having a different threshold. It is well within the scope of the embodiments that the system <b>900</b> can contain multiple families of ink capsules, where each family comprises multiple capsules and where each family of ink capsules has a different threshold. In system <b>900</b>, the different thresholds can be obtained using capsules with size dependent thresholds. According to various embodiments, the thresholds can range from about 1.0 volt to about 2.0 volts. In various other embodiments, the thresholds can range from about 0.5 volts to bout 1.5 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, there are three capsules <b>905</b>, <b>907</b>, and <b>909</b>, with size dependent thresholds embedded in a charged electret substrate <b>910</b>. The smallest size capsule <b>905</b> has the lowest threshold, the largest capsule <b>909</b> has the highest threshold, and the medium size capsule <b>907</b> has a threshold between that of smallest capsule <b>905</b> and largest capsule <b>909</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A more complete representation of the operation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>e</i>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows a system <b>1000</b> comprising plurality of families of capsules, where of the capsules in each family have the same or similar threshold. For example, the smallest capsules <b>1005</b> have the same or similar thresholds, the medium capsules <b>1007</b> have the same or similar thresholds, and the largest capsules <b>1009</b> have the same or similar thresholds. Electrode <b>1025</b>A may be interfaced with one side of an electret substrate <b>1010</b> and electrode <b>1025</b>B may be interfaced with the second side of electret substrate <b>1010</b>.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to various embodiments, electrodes <b>1025</b>A and <b>1025</b>B can comprise X-Y Indium Tin Oxide (&#x201c;ITO&#x201d;) arrays, which include a transparent and electrically conductive coating used to address LCD pixels. Similarly, conductive polymers can also be used to address the electret substrate. The capsules <b>1005</b>, <b>1007</b>, and <b>1009</b> are embedded in the electret film <b>1010</b> and the capsules <b>1005</b>, <b>1007</b>, and <b>1009</b> can be loosely aligned.

The condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>represents a first level of gray for a display in accordance with the present teachings. The condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is where the field is removed, or a voltage below the threshold of the smallest capsules <b>1005</b> is applied. Because the applied voltage is less than the threshold of the smallest capsules <b>1005</b>, the ink <b>1012</b> stays pushed towards the negative electrode <b>1025</b>B, and the appearance of the display remains similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> shows a condition where a field above the threshold of the family of capsules with the smallest size <b>1005</b> is applied.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates another exemplary system <b>1100</b> in accordance with yet another embodiment capable of achieving gray levels. For matters of simplicity, system <b>1100</b> shows three ink capsules, <b>1105</b>, <b>1107</b>, and <b>1109</b>, each having a different threshold. It is well within the scope of the embodiments that the system <b>1100</b> can contain multiple families of ink capsules, where each family comprises multiple capsules and where each family of ink capsules has a different threshold, with the threshold of each capsule within a family being the same or similar. In system <b>1100</b>, the different thresholds can be obtained using capsules having housings <b>1115</b>, <b>1117</b>, and <b>1119</b>, having different electric permittivities, or where the capsules <b>1105</b>, <b>1107</b>, <b>1109</b> are coated with different materials having different electric permittivity. For example, capsule <b>1105</b> can have a housing or a coating providing a permittivity of &#x2208;<sub>1</sub>, capsule <b>1107</b> can have a housing or a coating providing a permittivity of &#x2208;<sub>2</sub>, and capsule <b>1109</b> can have a housing or a coating providing a permittivity of &#x2208;<sub>3</sub>. According to various embodiments, &#x2208;<sub>1</sub>&#x2260;&#x2208;<sub>2</sub>&#x2260;&#x2208;<sub>3</sub>. In some embodiments the capsules <b>1105</b>, <b>1107</b>, and <b>1109</b> can have similar sizes, while in other embodiments, the capsules can have different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, there are three capsules <b>1105</b>, <b>1107</b>, and <b>1109</b>, with permittivity dependent thresholds embedded in a charged electret substrate <b>1110</b> in a similar arrangement as described above. For illustrative purposes, the capsule <b>1105</b> with permittivity &#x2208;<sub>1 </sub>may have the lowest threshold, the capsule <b>1109</b> with permittivity &#x2208;<sub>3 </sub>may have the highest threshold, and the capsule <b>1107</b> with permittivity &#x2208;<sub>2 </sub>may have a threshold between that of capsule <b>1105</b> and capsule <b>1109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts three ink capsules for ease of illustration. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that more than three ink capsules are envisioned. For example, in another exemplary embodiment gray levels can be achieved by a plurality of capsules having a range of thresholds. The exemplary embodiment can include an electret substrate and a plurality of capsules embedded in the electret substrate. Each capsule of the plurality of capsules can include a housing and a plurality of charged pigment particles suspended within a fluid. Moreover, each capsule of the plurality of capsules can have a different threshold such that the thresholds form a range of thresholds. The range of thresholds can be achieved by, for example, changing the geometry of the housing or by changing the permittivity of the capsules.</p>
