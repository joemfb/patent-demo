<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an allergen inactivating agent (hereinbelow, frequently and simply referred to as &#x201c;inactivating agent&#x201d;). Particularly, the present invention relates to an allergen inactivating agent for preventing allergic manifestations and alleviating allergic symptoms by reducing antigenicity of an allergen through contact with the allergen.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As is well known, a substance that is a factor for causing an allergic symptom is called allergen or antigen. Pollen and house dust, such as mold, mold spore, mite body, and mite feces, can be mentioned as allergen. Normally, an immunologic reaction (self-defense reaction) works advantageously for protecting the human body from these foreign substances, but allergic symptom is resulted when the immunologic reaction works disadvantageously. When leading a stressful life, i.e., becoming extremely nervous in social and daily lives, one could gradually disrupt the function of autonomic nerves and lose hormonal balance. This is believed to be a state in which allergy is likely to manifest. In addition, as another factor which is likely to cause an allergic symptom, there can be mentioned a closed living environment in which an amount of house dust as a predominant allergen is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the measurements against allergy (such as pollen allergy) to this day, the exposure to pollen has been suppressed to minimum, by using a mask or goggle with high sealing effect for blocking pollen or a dust collector or air purification device for removing pollen. When allergic symptom is manifested, nose or eyes has been washed, and therapeutic medicine for alleviating a symptom has been administered. Use of therapeutic medicine is merely a temporal suppression of the symptom, and it should be administered every time the symptom appears, and thus there is concern that a side effect might occur.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, as a method for preventing pollen allergy, there has been proposed a method in which the pollen allergy allergen is treated with alkali, acid and protease under heated conditions (see Patent Document 1).

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">An embodiment of the present invention will be described below, but the present invention should not be limited to this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">The present invention is an allergen inactivating agent for preventing allergic manifestations or alleviating symptoms by reducing antigenicity of an allergen through contact with the allergen, which includes chlorine dioxide as an active ingredient.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Allergen</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">Examples of the allergen to be treated with the inactivating agent of the present invention include those of cedar pollen (e.g., Cry j1, Cry j2), Japanese cypress pollen (e.g., Cha o1, Cha o2), ragweed pollen (e.g., Amb a1), buckwheat pollen, and house dust (such as mold, mold spore, mite (e.g., Der fII) body, and mite feces).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">It should be noted that, for example a cedar pollen allergy is caused by extraneous cedar pollen attached to a mucous membrane of nose, eye or throat. To be precise, pollen itself is not an antigen, but a pollen allergy allergen Cry j1 present on the surface of the pollen, or a pollen allergy allergen Cry j2 present inside the pollen, are allergens. The allergen inactivating agent of the present invention reduces the antigenicity of these allergens.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Preparative Example of Chlorine Dioxide Solution</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">The allergen inactivating agent of the present invention includes dissolved chlorine dioxide (e.g., chlorine dioxide solution) as an active ingredient. It is preferable that a chlorite and a pH adjuster (e.g., an acid or a salt thereof having a buffering property) are added, in order to improve the preservation stability.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">For the chlorite, for example, salts of alkali metal chlorite and salts of alkali earth metal chlorite can be mentioned. Examples of the salt of alkali metal chlorite include sodium chlorite, potassium chlorite and lithium chlorite. Examples of the salt of alkali earth metal chlorite include calcium chlorite, magnesium chlorite and barium chlorite.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Especially, not only from the viewpoint of availability, but also from the viewpoint of long-term (e.g., excellent) preservation stability of dissolved chlorine dioxide, sodium chlorite and potassium chlorite are preferable, and sodium chlorite is most preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">For the pH adjuster, an acid (e.g., inorganic acid and organic acid) or a salt thereof, having a buffering property which gives a pH of 2.5 to 6.8 as a 5% aqueous solution at 25&#xb0; C., is preferable. When the pH is below 2.5 or above 6.8, the preservation stability of the dissolved chlorine dioxide is reduced, and a change in a liquid property (e.g., pH) of the chlorine dioxide solution during preservation becomes large. It is preferable to use an acid (e.g., inorganic acid and organic acid) or a salt thereof having a buffering property which gives a pH of 3.5 to 6.0 as a 5% aqueous solution at 25&#xb0; C., and it is more preferable to use one giving a pH of 4.0 to 5.5.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">Examples of the pH adjuster include phosphoric acid, boric acid, metaphosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid, sulfamic acid and acetic acid. Examples of the salt thereof include sodium dihydrogenphosphate and a mixture of sodium dihydrogenphosphate with disodium hydrogenphosphate.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">Especially, phosphoric acid or a salt thereof is preferred, and sodium dihydrogenphosphate is more preferred, since the preservation stability is excellent and a change in the liquid property (e.g., pH) during preservation is suppressed to a minimum, leading to excellent action of reducing the antigenicity.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">It should be noted that one kind of the pH adjuster may be used alone or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. The final pure chlorine dioxide solution has a pH of preferably 4.5 to 6.5, more preferably 5.5 to 6.0, since the preservation stability is excellent for a long term, and a pH change during preservation is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">It should also be noted that, the expression &#x201c;pure chlorine dioxide solution&#x201d; herein means that chlorine dioxide is present in a form of chlorine dioxide gas.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">For the concentration of chlorine dioxide that reduces the antigenicity of the allergen, from 0.05 ppm to 1 ppm is preferable, from 0.1 ppm to 1 ppm is more preferable, and from 0.1 ppm to 0.6 ppm is still more preferable. When the concentration is above 1 ppm, a safety problem may occur, and when below 0.05 ppm, effects as expected may not be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">Example of the forms of application include a nasal lavage fluid, collyrium, eye-drop, nasal solution (e.g., nasal spray), spray for throat, liniment for throat, and gargle. Specifically, it is possible to prevent allergic manifestations and alleviate allergic symptoms, by inactivating the allergen with the dissolved chlorine dioxide and washing down the allergen with the agent as wash solution, and thus by suppressing the amount of the allergen to a threshold or less. For example, an appropriate amount of the dissolved chlorine dioxide (e.g., aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide) having the concentration of from 0.1 ppm to 0.6 ppm may be applied externally as the nasal lavage fluid, collyrium, gargle or the like, 3 to 6 times per day.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">Chlorine dioxide gas generated by the conventional method can be used as the allergen inactivating agent of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">Since the manifestation of allergy is often triggered by inhaling airborne allergens, the inactivating agent of the present invention can be used for the purpose of improving living environment. Specifically, allergic manifestations and allergic symptoms which may otherwise be caused in a person in such a environment can be prevented or alleviated, by spraying the dissolved chlorine dioxide solution in a form of mist inside a building or a room, or by diffusing the chlorine dioxide gas in the living environment. For spraying in a form of mist, the conventional methods can be used, and examples include a method using an atomizing device utilizing ultrasonic, a method using a centrifugal atomizing device, e.g., a method of atomization using a centrifugal force of a motor, a method using an aerosol propellant, and a method using air fog, e.g., a method for spraying the solution together with compressed air, in which atomization is made using a compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">When the allergen inactivating agent of the present invention includes the chlorite and the pH adjuster (e.g., an inorganic acid or a salt thereof having a buffering property), excellent preservation stability can be obtained. For example, the dissolved chlorine dioxide concentration can be maintained constant for a long term, and even when chlorine dioxide is continuously released by portions as gas from the inactivating agent or even when chlorine dioxide gas is aggressively kept released, the chlorine dioxide concentration in the inactivating agent can be held in an approximately constant range.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">The expression &#x201c;continuously released by portions as gas&#x201d; herein means that, for example, during transportation or preservation, even though a lid of a container is closed, chlorine dioxide dissipates as gas in the course of nature, and the expression &#x201c;chlorine dioxide gas is aggressively kept released&#x201d; herein means that gas dissolved in the solution is diffused in an atmosphere with an expectation of obtaining action of reducing the antigenicity of the allergen.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">When phosphoric acid or a salt thereof is used as an inorganic acid or a salt thereof having a buffering property, as compared with other inorganic acids or organic acids, the preservation stability is further improved (e.g., period with the preservation stability is further extended), and fluctuation or change in a liquid property (e.g., pH) over time during preservation is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">Moreover, by selecting sodium dihydrogenphosphate or the mixture of sodium dihydrogenphosphate with disodium hydrogenphosphate from among numerous inorganic acids or salts thereof, and by combining this with sodium chlorite, an excessive progression of a reaction in which sodium chlorite turns into chlorine dioxide hardly occurs. Therefore, a gas equilibration state is retained by replenishing chlorite ion from sodium chlorite that compensates only chlorine dioxide that is lost by natural decomposition or that dissipates from a lid portion or walls of the container. As described above, the present invention is suitable in that unnecessary consumption of sodium chlorite is suppressed and sodium chlorite is efficiently consumed, leading to further improvement in the preservation stability (e.g., period with the preservation stability is further extended), and to further suppression of fluctuation or change in the chlorine dioxide concentration over time during preservation (e.g., both the decrease and increase in the concentration can be suppressed).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">In addition, a mechanism of the inactivating agent for replenishing chlorine dioxide from sodium chlorite for a long term is exerted even in a space or on a subject, to which the inactivating agent is applied, sprayed or diffused. This provides an excellent sustained effect, i.e. lasting allergen inactivation action or action of reducing the antigenicity after application, spraying or diffusion of the inactivating agent, further providing a great merit upon its use.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">Hereinbelow, an example of the present invention will be described, but the present invention should not be limited to the following example.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Preparation Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">An aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide was obtained by a conventional method. Specifically, chlorine dioxide gas generated using an acid is extracted and dissolved in water (by a bubbling method, for example), to thereby obtain 1,000 ml of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Preparation Example</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">In the following manner, an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide was prepared. Specifically, to 250 ml of water in which 2,000 ppm of chlorine dioxide gas had been dissolved were added 680 ml of water and 80 ml of a 25% solution of sodium chlorite, and stirred. Subsequently, to the solution was added sodium dihydrogenphosphate in such an amount that the pH of the solution became 5.5 to 6.0 and stirred, to thereby obtain 1,000 ml of an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide including chlorine dioxide gas dissolved therein, sodium chlorite, and sodium dihydrogenphosphate.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Experiment on Cedar Pollen Allergen (Cry j1)</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide each obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 were diluted by a conventional method to various concentrations (for Preparative Example 1, five different concentrations, 0.1 ppm, 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 5 ppm, and 10 ppm, and for Preparative Example 2, five different concentrations, 0.1 ppm, 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 5 ppm, and 10 ppm), and using these dilutions, effects on Cry j1, which is one type of the cedar pollen allergen, were examined. Distilled water was used as a control.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Experiment Description and Result</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">In order to establish a procedure of quantification of cedar pollen antigen, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) was used to create a standard curve for quantification of cedar pollen Cry j1 available from Hayashibara Biochemical Labs., Inc. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there was a linear relationship (R=0.999) between the Cry j1 concentration and the absorbance.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">Next, the purified Cry j1 was reacted with each of various concentrations of the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 for 10 minutes, and for each case measurement was made using ELISA. As a result, in both cases of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 1 and the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 2 (concentration: 0.1 ppm), the antigenicity of Cry j1 was significantly reduced, as compared with the case of distilled water as a control. In addition, Cry j1 was reacted with each of aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 (concentration: 0.5 ppm), and change in the antigenicity of Cry j1 over time was examined. As a result, in both cases of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 1 and the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 2 (concentration: 0.5 ppm), the antigenicity of Cry j1 was reduced below the detection limit, 15 seconds after the addition. On the other hand, the effect exerted by tap water was very low. The details will be described below.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Experimental Method and Result</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">In order to examine efficacy of chlorine dioxide on Cry j1, a quantification of Cry j1 was established by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-Cry j1 mouse monoclonal antibody No. 013 (anti-Cry j1 mAb 013 available from Hayashibara Biochemical Labs., Inc.) and an enzyme-labeled anti-Cry j1 mouse monoclonal antibody No. 053 (Peroxidase conjugated anti-Cry j1 mAb053 available from Hayashibara Biochemical Labs., Inc.).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">First, the antibody (anti-Cry j1 mAb 013) for a solid phase was diluted with PBS to 10 &#x3bc;g/ml, and 100 &#x3bc;l of the dilution was added to each well of a 96-well microplate available from Nunc Immuno Plate, Maxisorp F96 CERT, Nunc Co., and the plate was allowed to stand still at room temperature for 2.5&#xb1;0.5 hours. After that time period, the solid phase antibody solution was removed, 250 &#x3bc;l of 0.1% BSA-containing PBS was added to each well, and the plate was allowed to stand still at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. The PBS containing 0.1% BSA (SIGMA) was removed from the plate, 100 &#x3bc;l of the prepared standard solution and 100 &#x3bc;l of a test liquid were added to each well, and the plate was allowed to stand still at room temperature for 1.5&#xb1;0.5 hours. After that time period, the standard solution and the test liquid were removed from the plate, and each well was washed with 250 &#x3bc;l of Tween 20-containing PBS 3 times. Subsequently, the enzyme-labeled antibody (peroxidase conjugated anti-Cry j1 mAb 053) was diluted 1,000 fold with 0.1% BSA-containing PBS, 100 &#x3bc;l of the dilution was added to each well, and the plate was allowed to stand still at room temperature for 2.0&#xb1;0.5 hours. The enzyme-labeled antibody was removed from the plate, and each well was washed with Tween 20-containing PBS 3 times. A substrate solution was prepared by adding 5 mg of o-phenylenediamine and 10 &#x3bc;L of 30% hydrogen peroxide water to 10 ml of a 0.1 M citric acid-phosphoric acid buffer solution having a pH of 5.0 (0.1 M citric acid-phosphoric acid buffer solution had been prepared by adding water to 7.0 g of citric acid monohydrate and 23.9 g of disodium hydrogenphosphate dodecahydrate to obtain a solution, adjusting its pH to 5.0 with HCL, adding water to the total volume of 1,000 ml, and sterilizing the solution by filtration), 100 &#x3bc;l thereof was added to each well, and the plate was allowed to stand still for 3 to 5 minutes. To each well was added 100 &#x3bc;l of 2N sulfuric acid to terminate the enzymatic reaction, and within 30 minutes after the addition of sulfuric acid, an absorbance of A492 was measured using a plate reader.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">Each of the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 having various concentrations was reacted with the purified Cry j1 (Japanese cedar pollen allergen Cry j1, purified) having the final concentration of 5 &#x3bc;g/ml. To Cry j1 was added each of the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 1 having concentrations from 0.1 ppm to 10 ppm, the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 2 having concentrations of 0.1 ppm to 10 ppm, and tap water from four cities (Suita City, Osaka City, Toyonaka City, and Kyoto City), and 10 minutes later, an aqueous solution of 0.1M sodium thiosulfate was added to each mixture to neutralize the mixture. Each of the reaction solutions was diluted with 0.1% BSA-containing PBS to approximately 16.0 ng/ml, and the resultant dilution was used as a test liquid. Distilled water was used as a control.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing effect of dissolved chlorine dioxide on Cry j1 antigenicity, in a case where an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 1 was used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing effect of dissolved chlorine dioxide on Cry j1 antigenicity, in a case where an aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 2 was used. As is apparent from these figures, in the case where 5 &#x3bc;g/ml of Cry j1 was reacted with each of the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 having concentrations from 0.1 ppm to 10 ppm, the addition of 0.5 ppm of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide remarkably reduced the antigenicity of Cry j1, as compared with the case of distilled water as a control. The addition of 0.1 ppm of the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 significantly reduced the antigenicity. On the other hand, the effect exerted by tap water from four cities was very low.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">In addition, effect in terms of time of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide on the antigenicity of Cry j1 was examined. Five &#x3bc;g/ml of Cry j1 was reacted with each of the aqueous solutions of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Examples 1 and 2 (concentration: 0.5 ppm) and tap water from four cities (Suita City, Osaka City, Toyonaka City, and Kyoto City), the reaction solution was diluted to 16.0 ng/ml, and the resultant dilution was used as a test liquid. Distilled water was used as a control.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in both of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 1 and the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide obtained in Preparative Example 2, the antigenicity of Cry j1 was remarkably reduced immediately after the addition, as compared with distilled water. In the water quality management target criterion in accordance with Water Supply Law, it is defined that the chlorine dioxide concentration should be 0.6 mg/L (ppm) or less, and therefore if efficacy of chlorine dioxide is shown with a value within this range, it is considered that the equivalent level of safety to that of tap water is obtained. On the other hand, if the recent ordinary tap water itself is capable of reducing the antigenicity to the same extent as 0.5 ppm of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide does, it is considered that chlorine dioxide has no usefulness. Accordingly, chlorinated tap water from four cities (Suita City, Osaka City, Toyonaka City, and Kyoto City) was examined in substantially the same manner. However, the effects thereof were very low.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">From the results above, it was elucidated that 0.1 ppm of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide satisfactorily reduces the antigenicity of Cry j1, and 0.5 ppm of the aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide instantly reduces the antigenicity of Cry j1, and that such an effect cannot be obtained with water.</p>
