Specifically, the blower <b>15</b> is configured to take in air from the duct <b>15</b><i>a </i>and blow out the air toward the apertures <b>14</b> as indicated by the arrow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, so that the air is led to the fins <b>2</b> for cooling, thereby cooling the charger <b>1</b> through the fins <b>2</b>. At this time, the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> that support the charger <b>1</b> function as the right and left walls at the position where the cooling air flows, and encourage the air having flowed through the fins <b>2</b> for cooling to equally flow rearward of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">As described above, in the installation structure for electrical equipment in a rear vehicle body according to the embodiment of the present invention, the hook member <b>7</b>, which extends in the longitudinal direction and has a hat-shaped cross section with the flanges <b>7</b><i>a </i>on the right and left sides thereof, is provided onto the lower face of the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b>, and the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b>, which are liner and have a hat-shaped cross section with the flanges <b>9</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>a </i>on the right and left sides thereof, are provided onto the upper face of the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> with a certain distance therebetween. The flanges <b>10</b><i>a </i>on the right and left sides of the second bracket <b>10</b> and the flanges <b>7</b><i>a </i>on the right and left sides of the hook member <b>7</b> are joined in three layers to each other via the spare tire housing <b>6</b> therebetween, thereby enhancing the face rigidity by reinforcing the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b>. According to the installation structure of the present embodiment, the charger <b>1</b> having a large capacity and being heavy in weight weight is clamped with the bolts onto the upper faces <b>9</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> through the attachment pieces <b>11</b>, thereby suppressing vibrations generated during the vehicle driving operation to be transferred to the charger <b>1</b> even if the charger <b>1</b> is installed in the spare tire housing <b>6</b>. In addition, it is possible to prevent the charger <b>1</b> from deforming and becoming damaged even if the spare tire hose <b>6</b> is deformed by load applied from the rear of the vehicle so that the spare tire hose <b>6</b> moves frontward of the vehicle. Such a configuration reduces problems caused by placing the charger <b>1</b> having heavy weight by utilizing space in the spare tire housing <b>6</b> whose bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>is a flat surface with insufficient rigidity. For example, it is possible to reduce the following problems: (1) vibrations are transferred to the charger <b>1</b> from the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> in the vibration deformation mode during the vehicle driving operation; (2) inertial force of the charger <b>1</b> in the vertical direction deforms the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> due to vertical oscillations during the vehicle driving operation; (3) the spare tire housing <b>6</b> is deformed due to load applied from the rear of the vehicle so that the wall portion or the like of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> comes in contact with the charger <b>1</b>; and (4) the spare tire housing <b>6</b> is significantly deformed due to load applied from the rear of the vehicle, so that large load is applied to the charger <b>1</b>. These problems can be prevented by using a spare tire having relatively light unit weight and preventing harmful effects of transferred vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">In the installation structure of the present embodiment, the charger <b>1</b> is placed on the upper faces <b>9</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b>, and the blower <b>15</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the aperture <b>14</b> surrounded by the charger <b>1</b>, the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b>; accordingly it is possible to efficiently lead the air blown out of the blower <b>15</b> downward to the fins <b>2</b> for cooling, so as to effectively cool the charger <b>1</b> without using a special component.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the rear vehicle body to which the installation structure for electrical equipment according to another embodiment of the present invention is applied. In the installation structure of the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are disposed in the vehicle width direction vertical to the hook member <b>7</b>, and the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are disposed so as to be partially overlapped with the hook member <b>7</b>. At the position W where the flanges <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are overlapped with the flanges <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the hook member <b>7</b>, the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are joined together with the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> to one another in three layers by welding. The blower <b>15</b> or other components are disposed so as to be opposite to the fins <b>2</b> for cooling in accordance with the installation direction of the charger <b>1</b> in the case of replacing the charger <b>1</b>. Other configurations are the same as the above embodiment, and the same components are designated by the same reference numbers, and description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">In the installation structure for electrical equipment in a rear vehicle body according to another embodiment of the present invention, the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are disposed in the direction vertical to the hook member <b>7</b>, and the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are disposed so as to be partially overlapped with the hook member <b>7</b>, and at the position where the flanges <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are overlapped with the flanges <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the hook member <b>7</b>, the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> are joined together with the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> to one another in three layers, so as to be in a grid shape in the plane view, thereby enhancing rigidity of the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> through the entire region in the longitudinal and width directions of the vehicle. The other operational effects are the same as those in the above described embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">Although the embodiments of the present invention has been described above, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments, and various change and modifications may be applicable based on the technical concept of the present invention.</p>

Either flange <b>9</b><i>a </i>on the right and left sides of the first bracket <b>9</b> or the second bracket <b>10</b> and either flange <b>7</b><i>a </i>on the right and left sides of the hook member <b>7</b> may be overlapped with and joined to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">Instead of the first bracket <b>9</b> and the second bracket <b>10</b> in the above-described embodiments, the linear first bead <b>9</b> and the linear second bead <b>10</b> so formed integrally as to project upward on the upper face of the bottom <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the spare tire housing <b>6</b> may be used, and at least one of the first bead <b>9</b> and the second bead <b>10</b> may be so disposed as to be overlapped with the hook member <b>7</b>.
