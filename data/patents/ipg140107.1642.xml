<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/859,194, entitled &#x201c;COMPREHENSIVE SINGLE PAGE VIEW OF USER'S GAMING ACHIEVEMENTS,&#x201d; filed Sep. 21, 2007, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Gaming systems have evolved from those which provided an isolated gaming experience to networked systems providing a rich, interactive experience which may be shared in real time between friends and other gamers. With Microsoft's Xbox&#xae; video game system and Xbox Live&#xae; online game service, users can now easily communicate with each other while playing to share the gaming experience. Moreover, when not playing in tandem, current gaming systems allow friends to track others' gaming experiences and accomplishments.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One way in which users track their and their friends' progress through different games is through the concept of game scores and achievements. As gamers progress through a game and complete game-specific challenges, such as getting to a new level or amassing a specified number of wins against other players, the Xbox Live service keeps track of these achievements for Xbox Live service subscribers. Where once a gamer's achievements were only seen by him or her, gamers are now able to see the current progress and achievements of others, either while logged on to the Xbox Live service via an Xbox game console or online. Thus, achievements have become a highly visible measure associated with users, and the keeping and posting of achievement data has evolved into a strong selling point for the Xbox platform and games. Friends and users now compete with each other for the most achievements and new achievements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another innovation in current gaming systems is the ability to quickly and easily download games. For example, Microsoft introduced a gaming disc known as Microsoft Arcade which is able to connect to a server through the Internet when the gaming console is connected to the Internet. From the server site, the Arcade gaming disc is able to enumerate full version games which are available for download to the user's hard disc drive on the XBox console. In the past, when a user learned of a game through a friend or otherwise, the user either had to go to a store to purchase the game media, or have the media delivered after an online purchase. With the passage of time and difficulty involved in the purchase, users often lost interest and did not follow through with the purchase. However, platforms such as Microsoft Arcade allow users to obtain games as soon as they learn about them.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While achievement scores have increased interest and sales in gaming platforms, conventional systems have no easy way of providing a comprehensive view of a user's achievements for a particular game. In conventional gaming systems, a user may access achievements through a system graphical user interface (GUI), which then provides a menu system allowing a user to drill down into particular achievements. However, there is no single screen providing a comprehensive view of a user's achievements. A user may access individual achievements, and even when accessing a particular achievement, a user still is required to drill down into successive additional screens to find out all information regarding that achievement. As such, there is room for an improved system which provides a user a comprehensive view of all of the achievement data for a game in a single, easy to use and efficient GUI.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present system relate to a method of providing comprehensive information of all game achievements on a single GUI of a gaming and media system. During a game, a user may access an achievements GUI which displays icons for each of the achievements possible within the game. It may be that the user has accomplished some of the achievements in the game and not others. The achievements GUI lists all game achievements, and may visually differentiate achievements which have been accomplished (i.e., unlocked), from those which have not yet been accomplished. In embodiments, the locked achievements may be displayed with a degree of transparency, while the unlocked achievements may be displayed opaquely.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A user may select a particular achievement, locked or unlocked, by placing focus on the achievement via the game controller. Once a user selects an achievement, information relating to that achievement may be displayed on the same GUI, in an achievement descriptor area beside the area listing the achievements. The information displayed within the descriptor area may include a name of the achievement, a score associated with unlocking the achievement, a status of the achievement as either locked or unlocked and a description of the achievement. The description may vary depending on whether the achievement is locked or unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, according to the present system, a user may see all achievements and receive a description of all achievements on a single, comprehensive screen. Additionally, a user is provided information about all achievements, even those which have not yet been unlocked. A user may also quickly and easily discern on the achievements GUI which achievements have been accomplished and which remain to be accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary gaming and media system <b>100</b>. The following discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable environment in which concepts presented herein may be implemented. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, gaming and media system <b>100</b> includes a game and media console (hereinafter &#x201c;console&#x201d;) <b>102</b>. In general, console <b>102</b> is one type of computing system, as will be further described below. Console <b>102</b> is configured to accommodate one or more wireless controllers, as represented by controllers <b>104</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>104</b>(<b>2</b>). Console <b>102</b> is equipped with an internal hard disk drive (not shown) and a portable media drive <b>106</b> that support various forms of portable storage media, as represented by optical storage disc <b>108</b>. Examples of suitable portable storage media include DVD, CD-ROM, game discs, and so forth. Console <b>102</b> also includes two memory unit card receptacles <b>125</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>125</b>(<b>2</b>), for receiving removable flash-type memory units <b>140</b>. A command button <b>135</b> on console <b>102</b> enables and disables wireless peripheral support.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, console <b>102</b> also includes an optical port <b>130</b> for communicating wirelessly with one or more devices and two USB (Universal Serial Bus) ports <b>110</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>) to support a wired connection for additional controllers, or other peripherals. In some implementations, the number and arrangement of additional ports may be modified. A power button <b>112</b> and an eject button <b>114</b> are also positioned on the front face of game console <b>102</b>. Power button <b>112</b> is selected to apply power to the game console, and can also provide access to other features and controls, and eject button <b>114</b> alternately opens and closes the tray of a portable media drive <b>106</b> to enable insertion and extraction of a storage disc <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Console <b>102</b> connects to a television or other display (such as monitor <b>150</b>) via A/V interfacing cables <b>120</b>. In one implementation, console <b>102</b> is equipped with a dedicated A/V port (not shown) configured for content-secured digital communication using A/V cables <b>120</b> (e.g., A/V cables suitable for coupling to a High Definition Multimedia Interface &#x201c;HDMI&#x201d; port on a high definition monitor <b>150</b> or other display device). A power cable <b>122</b> provides power to the game console. Console <b>102</b> may be further configured with broadband capabilities, as represented by a cable or modem connector <b>124</b> to facilitate access to a network, such as the Internet. The broadband capabilities can also be provided wirelessly, through a broadband network such as a wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) network.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each controller <b>104</b> is coupled to console <b>102</b> via a wired or wireless interface. In the illustrated implementation, the controllers <b>104</b> are USB-compatible and are coupled to console <b>102</b> via a wireless or USB port <b>110</b>. Console <b>102</b> may be equipped with any of a wide variety of user interaction mechanisms. In an example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each controller <b>104</b> is equipped with two thumbsticks <b>132</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>132</b>(<b>2</b>), a D-pad <b>134</b>, buttons <b>136</b>, and two triggers <b>138</b>. These controllers are merely representative, and other known gaming controllers may be substituted for, or added to, those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one implementation, a memory unit (MU) <b>140</b> may also be inserted into controller <b>104</b> to provide additional and portable storage. Portable MUs enable users to store game parameters for use when playing on other consoles.

<p id="p-0024" num="0026">During operation, console <b>102</b> is configured to receive input from controllers <b>104</b> and display information on display <b>150</b>. For example, console <b>102</b> can display a user interface on display <b>150</b> to allow a user to select a game using controller <b>104</b> and display achievement information as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a functional block diagram of gaming and media system <b>100</b> and shows functional components of gaming and media system <b>100</b> in more detail. Console <b>102</b> has a central processing unit (CPU) <b>200</b>, and a memory controller <b>202</b> that facilitates processor access to various types of memory, including a flash Read Only Memory (ROM) <b>204</b>, a Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>206</b>, a hard disk drive <b>208</b>, and portable media drive <b>106</b>. In one implementation, CPU <b>200</b> includes a level 1 cache <b>210</b> and a level 2 cache <b>212</b>, to temporarily store data and hence reduce the number of memory access cycles made to the hard drive <b>208</b>, thereby improving processing speed and throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">CPU <b>200</b>, memory controller <b>202</b>, and various memory devices are interconnected via one or more buses (not shown). The details of the bus that is used in this implementation are not particularly relevant to understanding the subject matter of interest being discussed herein. However, it will be understood that such a bus might include one or more of serial and parallel buses, a memory bus, a peripheral bus, and a processor or local bus, using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, such architectures can include an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, an Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, a Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and a Peripheral Component Interconnects (PCI) bus also known as a Mezzanine bus.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">In one implementation, CPU <b>200</b>, memory controller <b>202</b>, ROM <b>204</b>, and RAM <b>206</b> are integrated onto a common module <b>214</b>. In this implementation, ROM <b>204</b> is configured as a flash ROM that is connected to memory controller <b>202</b> via a PCI bus and a ROM bus (neither of which are shown). RAM <b>206</b> is configured as multiple Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic RAM (DDR SDRAM) modules that are independently controlled by memory controller <b>202</b> via separate buses (not shown). Hard disk drive <b>208</b> and portable media drive <b>106</b> are shown connected to the memory controller <b>202</b> via the PCI bus and an AT Attachment (ATA) bus <b>216</b>. However, in other implementations, dedicated data bus structures of different types can also be applied in the alternative.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">A three-dimensional graphics processing unit <b>220</b> and a video encoder <b>222</b> form a video processing pipeline for high speed and high resolution (e.g., High Definition) graphics processing. Data are carried from graphics processing unit <b>220</b> to video encoder <b>222</b> via a digital video bus (not shown). An audio processing unit <b>224</b> and an audio codec (coder/decoder) <b>226</b> form a corresponding audio processing pipeline for multi-channel audio processing of various digital audio formats. Audio data are carried between audio processing unit <b>224</b> and audio codec <b>226</b> via a communication link (not shown). The video and audio processing pipelines output data to an A/V (audio/video) port <b>228</b> for transmission to a television or other display. In the illustrated implementation, video and audio processing components <b>220</b>-<b>228</b> are mounted on module <b>214</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0036">Gaming and media system <b>100</b> may be operated as a standalone system by simply connecting the system to monitor <b>150</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), a television, a video projector, or other display device. In this standalone mode, gaming and media system <b>100</b> enables one or more players to play games, or enjoy digital media, e.g., by watching movies, or liing to music. However, with the integration of broadband connectivity made available through network interface <b>232</b>, gaming and media system <b>100</b> may further be operated as a participant in a larger network gaming community, as discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a block diagram of multiple consoles <b>300</b>A-<b>300</b>N networked with a console service <b>302</b> having one or more servers <b>304</b> through a network <b>306</b>. In one embodiment, network <b>306</b> comprises the Internet, though other networks such as LAN or WAN are contemplated. Server(s) <b>304</b> include a communication component capable of receiving information from and transmitting information to consoles <b>300</b>A-N and provide a collection of services that applications running on consoles <b>300</b>A-N may invoke and utilize.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">For example, consoles <b>300</b>A-N may invoke user login service <b>308</b>, which is used to authenticate a user on consoles <b>300</b>A-N. During login, login service <b>308</b> obtains a gamer tag (a unique identifier associated with the user) and a password from the user as well as a console identifier that uniquely identifies the console that the user is using and a network path to the console. The gamer tag and password are authenticated by comparing them to user records <b>310</b> in a database <b>312</b>, which may be located on the same server as user login service <b>308</b> or may be distributed on a different server or a collection of different servers. Once authenticated, user login service <b>308</b> stores the console identifier and the network path in user records <b>310</b> so that messages and information may be sent to the console.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">User records <b>310</b> can include additional information about the user such as game records <b>314</b> and friends list <b>316</b>. Game records <b>314</b> include information for a user identified by a gamer tag and can include statistics for a particular game, achievements acquired for a particular game and/or other game specific information as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">Friends list <b>316</b> includes an indication of friends of a user that are also connected to or otherwise have user account records with console service <b>302</b>. Friends list <b>316</b> can be used to create a sense of community of users of console service <b>302</b>. Users can select other users to be added to their friends list and view information about their friends such as game performance, current online status, friends list, etc. Friends list <b>316</b> can be used to assemble and display achievement information to a user as explained below such that the user can compare the user's score and achievements with those of other users on friends list <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0041">User records <b>310</b> also include additional information about the user including games that have been downloaded by the user and licensing packages that have been issued for those downloaded games, including the permissions associated with each licensing package. Portions of user records <b>310</b> can be stored on an individual console, in database <b>312</b> or on both. If an individual console retains game records <b>314</b> and/or friends list <b>316</b>, this information can be provided to console service <b>302</b> through network <b>306</b>. Additionally, the console has the ability to display information associated with game records <b>314</b> and/or friends list <b>316</b> without having a connection to console service <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">Server(s) <b>304</b> also include message service <b>320</b> which permits one console, such as console <b>300</b>A, to send a message to another console, such as console <b>300</b>B. Such messages can include text messages, voice messages, and specialized in text messages known as invites, in which a user playing the game on one console invites a user on another console to play in the same game while using network <b>306</b> to pass gaming data between the two consoles so that the two users are playing from the same session of the game. Friends list <b>316</b> can also be used in conjunction with message service <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of a method <b>400</b> for displaying achievement information associated with a user's game on a single, easy to access and easy to use user interface. At step <b>402</b>, a user provides the operating system of the game console an indication of a game to be played. In one example, this selection can be made by a user by operating controller <b>104</b> through a graphical user interface displayed on monitor <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When a highlighted portion of the user interface indicates a particular game, that game can be identified as being selected. Thus, a user of the console can select from a list of games on a user interface instead of inserting a disk or other memory device into the console for game selection.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0044">Once a game is selected, in addition to launching the game, service database <b>312</b>, discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is accessed. Once the user is authenticated via user account records <b>310</b>, the user's game records <b>314</b>, including in particular all achievements accomplished by the user for that game, are cached in step <b>404</b>, for example within RAM <b>206</b> within the game console <b>102</b>. Alternatively or additionally, achievement information may be pulled from local memory (permanent or portable) of the user's game console <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0045">The caching of all achievement information is an improvement over prior art gaming systems with respect to the treatment of achievements. Given the way achievements were handled and organized in prior art systems, a particular achievement was only downloaded from service <b>302</b> when information regarding that particular achievement was accessed by a user. This often resulted in delays, especially on systems making use of slower network connections to console service <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0046">In step <b>406</b>, a user could then opt to view their achievements for the game they are playing. Those of skill in the art will appreciate a wide variety of methods for providing this indication. In one embodiment, a border of the screen in the game GUI may have an option for &#x201c;View Achievements.&#x201d; The option may alternatively be for a menu which, when selected, has an option for &#x201c;View Achievements.&#x201d; Alternatively, a button may be provided on controller <b>104</b> which, when selected, takes the user to a GUI for Viewing Achievements, or a menu which includes an option for &#x201c;View Achievements.&#x201d; Other possibilities are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0047">Once a user selects the option for View Achievements, the user may be presented in step <b>410</b> with a GUI screen <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The GUI <b>500</b> includes a border area <b>502</b> including the name <b>522</b> of the game, an achievement listing area <b>504</b> including an iconic list of all achievements for the game, a descriptor area <b>508</b> for including descriptions of selected achievements, and a navigation area <b>510</b> including navigation buttons. In the example of FIG. <b>5</b>, the arcade game displayed is &#x201c;Soltrio Solitaire,&#x201d; and the achievements displayed on GUI <b>500</b> would therefore be tailored to that game. It is understood that each different game being played may have different achievements and descriptions which would be displayed on GUI <b>500</b> when GUI <b>500</b> was accessed during the game.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0048">Achievement listing area <b>504</b> lists all of the achievements available for the current player game. When a user accesses the achievement GUI <b>500</b>, the game application program retrieves all of the achievement information from memory, including the icons which represent the respective achievements and the accompanying descriptions for each achievement. This achievement information is created by the game developer. The icons <b>512</b> representing each retrieved achievement is displayed in achievement listing area <b>504</b> in step <b>410</b>. In prior systems, a user needed to drill down through several different menu items and different display screens in order to retrieve and display all achievements for a game. The present system addresses this shortcoming by providing a single, comprehensive view in GUI <b>500</b> showing all of the achievements existing for a given game.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0049">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, some of the icons <b>512</b> are displayed with a degree of transparency (icons <b>512</b><i>a</i>), while others are displayed solidly or opaquely (icons <b>512</b><i>b</i>). The icons <b>512</b><i>a </i>having a degree of transparency are those achievements which remain locked, i.e., the user has not yet accomplished these achievements. The solid icons <b>512</b><i>b </i>are those achievements which the user has unlocked and completed. As explained below, the descriptions for a given icon <b>512</b> will differ depending on whether the user has accomplished an achievement or not.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0050">Referring now to step <b>412</b>, a user may place focus on an icon <b>512</b> for example by using controller <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in order to select it. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if a user places focus on a particular icon <b>512</b>, then that icon may be highlighted, and the achievement and descriptive information for that achievement may be displayed in the descriptor area <b>508</b> of GUI <b>500</b>. As indicated above, the description of an achievement will vary depending on whether a user has accomplished, or unlocked, an achievement. The data as to which achievements have been unlocked by a user were downloaded to cache in step <b>404</b>. Accordingly, the game application program checks in step <b>418</b> whether the achievement for a selected icon is locked or unlocked. If an achievement has been unlocked, then the achievement and appropriate description for the unlocked achievement are provided in step <b>420</b> in descriptor area <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0051">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a user has selected the achievement called &#x201c;Minute Man,&#x201d; by placing focus on the icon for that achievement. The descriptor area <b>508</b> includes the name <b>524</b> of the achievement, a picture (icon) <b>526</b> of the achievement, the points <b>528</b> (referred to as &#x201c;gamerpoints&#x201d; in embodiments) gained from unlocking the achievement and also a status <b>530</b> of the achievement as being either &#x201c;locked&#x201d; or &#x201c;unlocked.&#x201d; As the user has accomplished the selected achievement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the status of &#x201c;unlocked&#x201d; is provided. The descriptor area <b>508</b> further includes a description <b>532</b> of the achievement. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the description included is, &#x201c;You have unlocked this Achievement by winning at Klondike within one minute.&#x201d; However, it is understood that this description may vary in length and content, in general describing what the user has achieved with the achievement. In embodiments, the description preferably fits within the window provided for the descriptor area <b>508</b>. However, it is contemplated that the size of the description may exceed the boundaries of the descriptor area, and graphical scroll bars may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0052">If the user places focus on an icon for an achievement that has not yet been accomplished, then the achievement and appropriate description for the locked achievement are provided in step <b>422</b> in descriptor area <b>508</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a user has selected the achievement called &#x201c;Solitaire Voyager,&#x201d; by placing focus on the icon for that achievement. The descriptor area <b>508</b> includes the name of the achievement, a picture (icon) of the achievement, the points to be gained from unlocking the achievement and also a status of the achievement as being either &#x201c;locked&#x201d; or &#x201c;unlocked.&#x201d; As the user has not yet accomplished the selected achievement, the status of &#x201c;locked&#x201d; is provided, and the descriptor area <b>508</b> includes a description of what must be done to unlock the achievement. In the embodiment shown, the description included is, &#x201c;Finish traveling all around in the Voyager mode.&#x201d; However, it is understood that this description may vary in length and content, in general providing a hint or describing what the user must do to unlock the achievement. In embodiments, the description preferably fits within the window provided for the descriptor area <b>508</b>. However, it is contemplated that the size of the description may exceed the boundaries of the descriptor area, and graphical scroll bars be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0053">Thus, according to the present system, a user may see all achievements and receive a description of all achievements on a single, comprehensive screen. Such a user interface is not found in the prior art. Additionally, a user is provided information about all achievements, even those which have not yet been accomplished. A user may also quickly and easily discern from GUI <b>500</b> which achievements have been accomplished and which remain to be accomplished. Each of these features is again an improvement over prior art systems, which only showed achievements which have been accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">A further advantage of GUI <b>500</b> is that it may be dynamically expandable. That is, as more achievements become available in a game, they may be added to GUI <b>500</b>, along with an associated description.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0055">Referring again to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at any time during the display of GUI <b>500</b>, such as for example before a particular icon is selected, or after an icon is selected and the associated information displayed, a user may opt in step <b>414</b> to leave the achievements GUI <b>500</b> and return to playing the game in step <b>426</b>. Those of skill in the art will appreciate a wide variety of schemes for closing GUI <b>500</b> and returning to the game, including for example a back button <b>534</b> in navigation area <b>510</b>. Alternatively, a user may simply select a graphical tab on the GUI <b>500</b> which returns the user to the game playing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0056">The foregoing detailed description of the inventive system has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the inventive system to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching.
