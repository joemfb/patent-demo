<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A cutting apparatus configured for aligned with a gate of an injection molding part, includes a bottom board, a main adjustable mechanism attached to the bottom board, and a cutting mechanism. The main adjustable mechanism includes a driving device, a mounting member attached to the driving device, and a rotatable member rotatably attached to the mounting member. The rotatable member can be rotatable relative to the mounting member between a first position, where an acute angle is formed between the rotatable member and the mounting member, and a second position, where the rotatable member parallel to and abuts the mounting member.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to cutting apparatuses, and particularly to a cutting apparatus for automatically aligning with a gate of an injection molding part.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A gate is located an end of an injection molding part. When the injection molding part is completed, the gate should be broken off. An automatic cutting device can be used to automatically cut the gate. However, the gate is often deformable when cooling, so that the gate does not aligned with the automatic cutting device.</p>
