<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to devices for the detection of analytes. More particularly, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a detection device having one or more small wells each surrounded by, or in close proximity to, an NMR micro coil, each well containing a liquid sample with magnetic nanoparticles that self-assemble or disperse in the presence of a target analyte, thereby altering the measured NMR properties of the liquid sample.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Biocompatible magnetic nanosensors have been designed to detect molecular interactions in biological media. Upon target binding, these nanosensors cause changes in the spin-spin relaxation times of neighboring water molecules (or any solvent molecule with free hydrogens) of a sample, which can be detected by classical magnetic resonance (NMR/MRI) techniques. Thus, by using these nanosensors in a liquid sample, it is possible to detect the presence of an analyte at very low concentration&#x2014;for example, small molecules, specific DNA, RNA, proteins, carbohydrates, organisms, and pathogens (e.g. viruses)&#x2014;with sensitivity in the low femtomole range (from about 0.5 to about 30 fmol).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, magnetic nanosensors are superparamagnetic nanoparticles that bind or otherwise link to their intended molecular target to form clusters (aggregates) or nanoassemblies. It is thought that when superparamagnetic nanoparticles assemble into clusters and the effective cross sectional area becomes larger, the nanoassembly becomes more efficient at dephasing the spins of surrounding water (or other solvent) protons, leading to an enhancement of the measured relaxation rates (1/T<b>2</b>). Additionally, nanoassembly formation can be designed to be reversible (e.g., by temperature shift, chemical cleavage, pH shift, etc.) so that &#x201c;forward&#x201d; or &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; assays can be developed for detection of specific analytes. Forward (clustering) and reverse (declustering) types of assays can be used to detect a wide variety of biologically relevant materials. Furthermore, the spin-lattice relaxation time (T<b>1</b>) is considered independent of nanoparticle assembly formation and can be used to measure concentration in both nano-assembled and dispersed states within the same solution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of magnetic nanosensors are described in Perez et al., &#x201c;Use of Magnetic Nanoparticles as Nanosensors to Probe for Molecular Interactions,&#x201d; <i>ChemBioChem, </i>2004, 5, 261-264, and in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2003/0092029 (Josephson et al.), the texts of which are incorporated by reference herein, in their entirety. Examples of magnetic nanosensors include monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles from about 3 to about 5 nm in diameter surrounded with a dextran coating approximately 10 nm thick such that the average resulting particle size is from about 25 to about 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">More stably coated and amino-functionalized nanosensors can be prepared, for example, by cross-linking the dextran coating of the metal oxide particle core with epichlorohydrin, then treating with ammonia to provide functional amino groups. Aminated cross-linked iron oxide nanoparticles (amino-CLIO) have been made with 40 amino groups per particle, with an average particle size from about 40 to about 50 nm. These particles can withstand harsh treatment, such as incubation at 120&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, without a change in size or loss of their dextran coat. Amino groups in amino-CLIO can react by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) based bifunctional cross-linking, allowing attachment of a range of sulfhydryl-bearing biomolecules. This gives rise to biomolecule-nanoparticle conjugates with unique biological properties. In addition to their use as sensors, the resultant superparamagnetic nanoparticles are valuable for imaging specific molecular targets, and as reagents for cell labeling and tracking.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current diagnostic systems involve, for example, microarray technology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization, antibody-based immunoassays (e.g. enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays), chemiluminescence, nephelometry, and/or photometry. These systems cannot perform the diversity of assays at high sensitivity that is possible with an NMR-based nanosensor system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various non-NMR-based point of care bio-assays have been developed, such as portable blood glucose meters that operate using test strips impregnated with glucose oxidase. However, these systems are generally not as reliable as central hospital assays because they lack the sensitivity, calibration, and maintenance that a laboratory setting provides. These portable systems also lack the sensitivity that is possible with NMR-based nanosensor systems, and they cannot be easily adapted for multiple analyte detection.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above-cited Josephson et al. and Perez et al. documents describe application of classical NMR relaxation methods with nanosensors using off-the-shelf relaxometers and MRI units. However, these units require large NMR RF coils and large magnets and are bulky, expensive, and are not tailored for use with magnetic nanosensors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a need for a less expensive, commercially-realizable NMR-based analyte detection device suitable for use with magnetic nanosensors.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention provides a small, integrated NMR-based analyte detection device with superparamagnetic nanosensors which can be customized for detection of any of a wide variety of analytes. The device may be used, for example, as a portable unit for point of care diagnosis and/or field use, or the device may be implanted for continuous or intermittent monitoring of one or more biological species of interest in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one configuration, the device contains an array of many small wells (e.g. 100, 1000, 10,000, or more &#x201c;micro wells&#x201d;) for containing a liquid sample, each well surrounded by a tiny radio frequency (RF) coil that detects an echo response produced by exposing the liquid sample in the well to a bias magnetic field and RF excitation. The magnetic field is created using one or more magnets which may be part of the device itself, or may be external to the device. As used herein, &#x201c;well&#x201d; means any localizer of a liquid sample, for example, an indentation, a container, a support, a channel, a reservoir, a sunken volume, a compartment, a recessed area, an enclosure with or without an opening, a tube, a trough, a semipermeable membrane, an interface between two phases (e.g. an organic-inorganic interface, a hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface, an oligophilic-oligophobic interface, and the like), and/or an interface between two fluids (gases and/or liquids).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are pre-deposited onto/into the micro wells before introduction of the liquid sample, or, alternatively, the nanoparticles may be introduced into the wells along with the liquid sample. The nanoparticles have binding moieties on their surfaces, which are operative to bind to (i) an analyte, (ii) another of the binding moieties, and/or (iii) an aggregation-inducing molecule in the liquid sample. These binding moieties may be customized such that aggregation or disaggregation of the nanoparticles occurs in the presence of one or more analyte(s) to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The superparamagnetic character of the nanoparticles enhances water (or other solvent with free hydrogens) relaxation rates, an enhancement that is altered by the aggregation or disaggregation of the particles. The presence and/or concentration(s) of the analyte(s) of interest can be detected via NMR relaxation methods, even at extremely low concentrations, for example, 100 femto-molar and below. This increased sensitivity can be achieved because of the effect of the analyte on aggregation, coupled with the effect of the state of aggregation on T<b>2</b> relaxation times.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In preferred embodiments, the devices offer a number of technological advancements geared toward increasing sensitivity of analyte detection. These include, for example: (i) the use of a plurality of micro wells; (ii) the use of a well whose cross section varies spatially; (iii) the design of well/coil pairs with high filling factor; (iv) the positioning of an electrical element for echo signal conditioning in close proximity to the RF sensing coil; (v) the use of RF sensing coils with high Q factor; (vi) the use of one or more rare earth magnets for producing the bias magnetic field; (vii) the positioning of the magnet(s) in close proximity to the liquid sample; and (viii) the reduction in bandwidth made possible by customization of the coated nanoparticles and well/coil geometry for detection of a specific analyte. Embodiments of the invention may make use of one or more of these technological advancements in any combination.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The use of a plurality of micro wells further enhances detection sensitivity, repeatability, and precision. Duplicate sampling wells allow multiple, substantially simultaneous measurements of analyte(s). Furthermore, the binding moieties on the surfaces of the nanoparticles used in the wells can be customized to provide greater sensitivity and precision. For example, the concentration of nanoparticles and/or binding moieties, and/or the types of binding moieties used in the different wells can be varied, allowing for more sensitive detection and/or more precise concentration measurement of the target analyte(s). Also, built-in self-calibration is enabled by the presence of one or more wells reserved for calibration. For example, one or more wells having a known NMR relaxation characteristic that is substantially unaffected by the analyte can be dedicated for calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition to the use of an array of well/coil pairs, another technological feature improving analyte detection sensitivity of the devices is the use of a well whose cross section varies spatially to concentrate the analyte in the magnetic field. For example, each well may have a portion of larger cross-sectional area and a portion of smaller cross-sectional area. Superparamagentic nanoparticles coated with binding moieties differentially move analyte-containing aggregations in the intense magnetic field. A bias magnetic field moves target analyte trapped in the aggregation of the magnetic nanoparticles in the direction of the field from the large cross-section area of the well into the small cross-section area of the well. In this way, the analyte is concentrated in the small cross-sectional area of the well. The small cross-sectional area of the well is surrounded by an RF coil for sensing the echo response of the solution. In this way, the analyte may be concentrated, for example, by a factor of about 1000, thereby increasing sensitivity of the device about 1000 fold. The magnet(s) and/or magnetic field used to evoke an NMR relaxation response is synergistically used to concentrate the target analyte for improved detection sensitivity. The device may include an array of many micro wells and tiny RF coils surrounding the narrow portions of these wells.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Yet another technological feature improving analyte detection sensitivity of the devices is the use of a well and RF coil configured to provide a high filling factor. Filling factor, as used herein, is the volume of liquid sample in a well divided by the volume circumscribed by the RF coil. Improved analyte detection sensitivity can be achieved by using a well and RF coil with a filling factor of at least about 0.1, preferably at least about 0.7, and more preferably about 1. For example, in one embodiment, the device contains an array of micro wells surrounded by tiny RF coils, where each well/coil combination has a filling factor of about 1.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Still another technological feature improving analyte detection sensitivity is the positioning of an electrical element for echo signal conditioning in close proximity to the RF coil. The small size of the wells facilitates placement of signal conditioning electronics within 1 millimeter, for example, of the corresponding RF coil. The echo signal conditioning performed by the electrical element may include, for example, amplification, rectification, and/or digitization of the echo signal. The electrical element (as the term is used herein in the singular) may include one or more discrete electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further technological feature improving analyte detection sensitivity is the use of RF sensing coils with high Q factor. Quality factor, or Q factor, of an RF coil is a measure of its efficiency as an inductor, and is defined herein as the ratio of the inductive reactance of the RF coil to its resistance at a given frequency, for example, the Larmor frequency. Using coils having high Q factor improves the sensitivity of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another technological feature enhancing analyte detection sensitivity is the use of rare earth magnets to create the bias magnetic field. Examples of rare earth magnets include, for example, neodymium magnets such as Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B (neodymium-iron-boron), and samarium cobalt magnets such as SmCO<sub>5</sub>. This helps to maximize the strength of the magnetic field and improves sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another technological feature of the device is the positioning of the magnet(s), for example, rare earth magnet(s), used to produce the bias magnetic field in close proximity to the liquid sample, for example, within 1 millimeter. This allows the generation of a bias magnetic field with strength, for example, from about 1 to about 2 Tesla, as compared with commercial units that operate at 0.5 Tesla. The close proximity of the magnet to the liquid sample is facilitated by the micro design of the system and the integrated nature of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Sensitivity of the device is also improved by the ability to use narrow bandwidth. Bandwidth in this sense is the amplitude roll off of the signal processing chain. The wider the bandwidth, the flatter the roll off with frequency. A wider bandwidth must be used when it is not clear what frequency is to be detected; however increased bandwidth results in increased noise. Use of a narrower bandwidth results in less noise (and increased signal-to-noise ratio, S/N), but may not be possible unless the frequency to be detected is precisely known. The device makes possible the use of a reduced bandwidth, because the analyte to be detected in each well is known and typically pre-determined, and the coated nanoparticles and/or the well/coil geometry can be specifically customized for detection of the specific analyte. Multiple analytes may still be detected, since different wells can be customized for detection of different analytes, for example, by use of different binding moieties on the nanoparticles in the different wells.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further customization of the electronics is possible. For example, the electronics for a given well may be tuned to a specific, determinable frequency characteristic based at least in part on the type of analyte/nanoparticle combination in the well and/or the concentration of the analyte and/or nanoparticle in the well. Furthermore, the use of one or more pulse sequences may be developed for optimum detection sensitivity/accuracy for a given analyte of interest, and/or for a given nanosensor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In preferred embodiments, the device uses low power and is able to operate in magnetic fields of less strength than current NMR systems, for example, less than about 7T, less than about 5T, less than about 4T, less than about 3T, less than about 2T, at about 1T, or less than about 1T. In general, higher magnetic field strength could be used for assays requiring greater sensitivity, while lower magnetic field strength (for example, below 1T) could be used for assays requiring less sensitivity. The power source may be any power source, for example, a battery or any electrical power source. An example power source would be a lithium ion battery, such as (or similar to) a lithium ion battery used in cellular telephones.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Aggregation of the nanoparticles is an equilibrium process. Nanoparticles may aggregate for a specific period of time (e.g. sufficient time for measurement to take place), then return to a nonaggregated condition. Thus, the nanoparticles, localized in the wells, may be reused and would not need to be replaced following each test. This enhances the convenience and low cost of the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Because of the adaptability of the nanoparticles (and binding moieties linked thereto), the device may perform numerous bio-diagnostic functions. The device may be customized to perform a specific function, or adapted to perform more than one function, e.g. via changeable cartridges containing arrays of micro wells with customized, lyophilized nanoparticles deposited thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The device may be used to perform bio-diagnostics rapidly, with high sensitivity, and at low cost. The device can be made portable and may include a chip, module, or cartridge containing the sample wells, as well as a handheld reader (remote or attached), making the unit useful in the field by paramedics, emergency room personnel, or other medical personnel for emergency medical care. Applications of the device include use by paramedics (e.g. in an ambulance or in the field), emergency room personnel, or other military or civilian medical personnel. The device may also be suitable for pediatric or adult home health care, for example, for the monitoring of glucose levels in the treatment of diabetes. Home diagnostics may reduce the need for doctor and hospital visits. Implantable versions of the device may provide continuous monitoring of species of interest, for example, glucose, coumadin, bacteria (e.g., post surgery), and/or drugs (e.g. for controlled dosing), to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The device may be used to detect a very wide range of biologically active substances, as well as other analytes. Of current methods (e.g. chemiluminescence, nephelometry, photometry, and/or other optical/spectroscopic methods), no single approach can achieve the diversity of analysis that is possible with NMR, even without the sensitivity improvements made possible by embodiments described herein. The sensitivity improvements provided by embodiments of the invention described herein allow further breadth and adaptability of analysis over current NMR techniques. For example, embodiments of the invention may be used or adapted for detection, for example, of any protein (e.g., biomarkers for cancer, serum proteins, cell surface proteins, protein fragments, modified proteins), any infectious disease (e.g., bacterial based on surface or secreted molecules, virus based on core nucleic acids, cell surface modifications, and the like), as well as a wide range of gases and/or small molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A wider range of drugs may be developed, due to the improved ability to detect and maintain appropriate dosages using the NMR device described herein. Drugs may be administered either manually or automatically (e.g. via automatic drug metering equipment), and may be monitored intermittently or continuously using the device. Dosage may therefore be more accurately controlled, and drugs may be more accurately maintained within therapeutic ranges, avoiding toxic concentrations in the body. Thus, drugs whose toxicity currently prevents their use may become approved for therapeutic use when monitored with the device described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Medical conditions that may be rapidly diagnosed by the device for proper triaging and/or treatment include, for example, pain, fever, infection, cardiac conditions (e.g. stroke, thrombosis, and/or heart attack), gastrointestinal disorders, renal and urinary tract disorders, skin disorders, blood disorders, and/or cancers. Tests for infectious disease and cancer biomarkers for diseases not yet diagnosable by current tests may be developed and performed using the NMR device described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device may be used for detection of chemical and/or biological weapons in the field, for example, nerve agents, blood agents, blister agents, plumonary agents, incapacitating agents (e.g. lachrymatory agents), anthrax, ebola, bubonic plague, cholera, tularemia, brucellosis, Q fever, typhus, encephalitis, smallpox, ricin, SEB, botulism toxin, saxitoxin, mycotoxin, and/or other toxins.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Because the devices are adaptable for detection of multiple analytes, a unit may be used to perform many ICU tests (including, e.g., PICU, SICU, NICU, CCU, and PACU) quickly and with a single blood draw. The tests may also be performed in the emergency room, in the physician's office, in field medicine (e.g. ambulances, military medical units, and the like), in the home, on the hospital floor, and/or in clinical labs. The multiplexing capability of the devices also makes them a valuable tool in the drug discovery process, for example, by performing target validation diagnostics.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Measurements for one or more analytes may be made, for example, based on a single draw, temporary draws, an intermittent feed, a semi-continuous feed, a continuous feed, serial exposures, and/or continuous exposures. Measurements may include a detection of the presence of the one or more analytes and/or a measurement of the concentration of one or more analytes present in the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Where the device is used as an implantable unit, one embodiment includes a semi-permeable pouch containing the nanoparticles and a set of bias field permanent magnets. The implantable unit may be small, for example, about 2 mm diameter and about 5 mm long, and may be implanted in the arm.

<p id="p-0125" num="0131">The following headers are provided as a general organizational guide and do not serve to limit support for any given element of the invention to a particular section of the Description.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Nanoparticles</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0132">The nanoparticles described herein include those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2003/0092029, the text of which is incorporated herein by reference. The nanoparticles may be in the form of conjugates, that is, a magnetic nanoparticle with one or more binding moieties (e.g. an oligonucleotide, nucleic acid, polypeptide, or polysaccharide) linked thereto. The binding moiety causes a specific interaction with a target analyte (or an aggregation-inducing molecule, such as avidin). The binding moiety specifically binds to a selected target analyte, for example, a nucleic acid, polypeptide, or polysaccharide, or the binding moiety can be designed to bind to another binding moiety to form an aggregate that is cleaved by the target molecule. Binding causes aggregation of the conjugates, resulting in a decrease of the spin-spin relaxation time (T<b>2</b>) of adjacent water protons in an aqueous solution (or free protons in a non-aqueous solvent). Cleavage causes dispersal of the aggregate into separate conjugates, resulting in an increase of the spin-spin relaxation time (T<b>2</b>) of adjacent water protons in an aqueous solution (or free protons in a non-aqueous solvent).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0133">The conjugates have high relaxivity owing to the superparamagnetism of their iron or metal oxide. The conjugates have an R1 relaxivity from about 5 to about 30 mM<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, e.g., 10, 15, 20, or 25 mM<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The conjugates have an R2 relaxivity between about 15 and 100 mM<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, e.g., 25, 50, 75, or 90 mM<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>sec<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The conjugates generally have a ratio of R2 to R1 from about 1.5 to about 4, e.g., about 2, 2.5, or 3. The conjugates generally have an iron oxide content that is greater than about 10% of the total mass of the particle, e.g., greater than 15, 20, 25 or 30 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0134">The nanoparticles can be monodisperse (a single crystal of a magnetic material, e.g., metal oxide, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide, per nanoparticle) or polydisperse (a plurality of crystals, e.g., 2, 3, or 4, per nanoparticle). The magnetic metal oxide can also comprise cobalt, magnesium, zinc, or mixtures of these metals with iron. The term &#x201c;magnetic&#x201d; as used herein means materials of high positive magnetic susceptibility such as paramagnetic compounds, superparamagnetic compounds, and magnetite, gamma ferric oxide, or metallic iron. Important features and elements of nanoparticles that are useful to produce conjugates include: (i) a high relaxivity, i.e., strong effect on water (or other solvent) relaxation, (ii) a functional group to which the binding moiety can be covalently attached, (iii) a low non-specific binding of interactive moieties to the nanoparticle, and/or (iv) stability in solution, i.e., the nanoparticles do not precipitate.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0135">The nanoparticles may be linked to the binding moieties via functional groups. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles are associated with a polymer that includes the functional groups, and that also serves to keep the metal oxides dispersed from each other. The polymer can be a synthetic polymer, such as, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol or silane, natural polymers, or derivatives of either synthetic or natural polymers or a combination of these. The polymer may be hydrophilic. In some embodiments, the polymer &#x201c;coating&#x201d; is not a continuous film around the magnetic metal oxide, but is a &#x201c;mesh&#x201d; or &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; of extended polymer chains attached to and surrounding the metal oxide. The polymer can comprise polysaccharides and derivatives, including dextran, pullanan, carboxydextran, carboxmethyl dextran, and/or reduced carboxymethyl dextran. The metal oxide can be a collection of one or more crystals that contact each other, or that are individually entrapped or surrounded by the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0136">In other embodiments, the nanoparticles are associated with non-polymeric functional group compositions. Methods of synthesizing stabilized, functionalized nanoparticles without associated polymers are described, for example, in Halbreich et al., Biochimie, 80 (5-6):379-90, 1998.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0137">The nanoparticles may have an overall size of less than about 1-100 nm. The metal oxides may be in the form of crystals about 1-25 nm, e.g., about 3-10 nm, or about 5 nm in diameter. The polymer component in some embodiments can be in the form of a coating, e.g., about 5 to 20 nm thick or more. The overall size of the nanoparticles is about 15 to 200 nm, e.g., about 20 to 100 nm, about 40 to 60 nm; or about 50 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0138">The nanoparticles may be prepared in a variety of ways. It is preferred that the nanoparticle have functional groups that link the nanoparticle to the binding moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0139">Carboxy functionalized nanoparticles can be made, for example, according to the method of Gorman (see WO 00/61191). In this method, reduced carboxymethyl (CM) dextran is synthesized from commercial dextran. The CM-dextran and iron salts are mixed together and are then neutralized with ammonium hydroxide. The resulting carboxy functionalized nanoparticles can be used for coupling amino functionalized oligonucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0140">Carboxy-functionalized nanoparticles can also be made from polysaccharide coated nanoparticles by reaction with bromo or chloroacetic acid in strong base to attach carboxyl groups. In addition, carboxy-functionalized particles can be made from amino-functionalized nanoparticles by converting amino to carboxy groups by the use of reagents such as succinic anhydride or maleic anhydride.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0141">Nanoparticle size can be controlled by adjusting reaction conditions, for example, by using low temperature during the neutralization of iron salts with a base as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,262,176. Uniform particle size materials can also be made by fractionating the particles using centrifugation, ultrafiltration, or gel filtration, as described, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,814.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0142">Nanoparticles can also be synthesized according to the method of Molday (Molday, R. S, and D. MacKenzie, &#x201c;Immunospecific ferromagnetic iron-dextran reagents for the labeling and magnetic separation of cells,&#x201d; J. Immunol. Methods, 1982, 52(3):353-67, and treated with periodate to form aldehyde groups. The aldehyde-containing nanoparticles can then be reacted with a diamine (e.g., ethylene diamine or hexanediamine), which will form a Schiff base, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0143">Dextran-coated nanoparticles can be made and cross-linked with epichlorohydrin. The addition of ammonia reacts with epoxy groups to generate amine groups, see Hogemann, D., et al., Improvement of MRI probes to allow efficient detection of gene expression Bioconjug. Chem. 2000, 11(6):941-6, and Josephson et al., &#x201c;High-efficiency intracellular magnetic labeling with novel superparamagnetic-Tat peptide conjugates,&#x201d; Bioconjug. Chem., 1999, 10(2):186-91. This material is known as cross-linked iron oxide or &#x201c;CLIO&#x201d; and when functionalized with amine is referred to as amine-CLIO or NH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CLIO.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0144">Carboxy-functionalized nanoparticles can be converted to amino-functionalized magnetic particles by the use of water-soluble carbodiimides and diamines such as ethylene diamine or hexane diamine.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0145">Avidin or streptavidin can be attached to nanoparticles for use with a biotinylated binding moiety, such as an oligonucleotide or polypeptide. See, e.g., Shen et al., &#x201c;Magnetically labeled secretin retains receptor affinity to pancreas acinar cells,&#x201d; Bioconjug. Chem., 1996, 7(3):311-6. Similarly, biotin can be attached to a nanoparticle for use with an avidin-labeled binding moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0146">Low molecular weight compounds can be separated from the nanoparticles by ultra-filtration, dialysis, magnetic separation, or other means. The unreacted oligonucleotides can be separated from the oligonucleotide-nanoparticle conjugates, e.g., by magnetic separation or size exclusion chromatography.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Binding Moieties</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0147">In general, a binding moiety is a molecule, synthetic or natural, that specifically binds or otherwise links to, e.g., covalently or non-covalently binds to or hybridizes with, a target molecule, or with another binding moiety (or, in certain embodiments, with an aggregation inducing molecule). For example, the binding moiety can be a synthetic oligonucleotide that hybridizes to a specific complementary nucleic acid target. The binding moiety can also be an antibody directed toward an antigen or any protein-protein interaction. Also, the binding moiety can be a polysaccharide that binds to a corresponding target. In certain embodiments, the binding moieties can be designed or selected to serve, when bound to another binding moiety, as substrates for a target molecule such as enzyme in solution.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0148">Binding moieties include, for example, oligonucleotide binding moieties, polypeptide binding moieties, antibody binding moieties, and polysaccharide binding moieties.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Oligonucleotide Binding Moieties</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0149">In certain embodiments, the binding moieties are oligonucleotides, attached/linked to the nanoparticles using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single, e.g., covalent, bond, e.g., at the 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; end to a functional group on the nanoparticle.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0150">An oligonucleotide binding moiety can be constructed using chemical synthesis. A double-stranded DNA binding moiety can be constructed by enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, a nucleic acid (e.g., an oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the complementary strands, e.g., phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used. The nucleic acid also can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0151">One method uses at least two populations of oligonucleotide magnetic nanoparticles, each with strong effects on water (or other solvent) relaxation. As the oligonucleotide-nanoparticle conjugates react with a target oligonucleotide, they form aggregates (e.g. 100-500 nm). Upon prolonged standing, e.g., overnight at room temperature, the aggregates form large clusters (micron-sized particles), which settle out of solution. Preferred embodiments use magnetic resonance to determine the relaxation properties of the solvent, which are altered when the mixture of magnetic oligonucleotide nanoparticles reacts with a target nucleic acid to form aggregates.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0152">Certain embodiments employ a mixture of at least two types of magnetic metal oxide nanoparticles, each with a specific sequence of oligonucleotide, and each with more than one copy of the oligonucleotide attached, e.g., covalently, per nanoparticle. For example, the assay protocol may involve preparing a mixture of populations of oligonucleotide-nanoparticle conjugates and reacting the mixture with a target nucleic acid. Alternatively, oligonucleotide-nanoparticle conjugates can be reacted with the target in a sequential fashion. Certain embodiments feature the use of magnetic resonance to detect the reaction of the oligonucleotide-nanoparticle conjugates with the target nucleic acid. When a target is present, the dispersed conjugates self-assemble to form small aggregates.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0153">For example, oligonucleotide binding moieties can be linked to the metal oxide through covalent attachment to a functionalized polymer or to non-polymeric surface-functionalized metal oxides. In the latter method, the nanoparticles can be synthesized according to the method of Albrecht et al., Biochimie, 80 (5-6): 379-90, 1998. Dimercapto-succinic acid is coupled to the iron oxide and provides a carboxyl functional group.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0154">In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are attached to magnetic nanoparticles via a functionalized polymer associated with the metal oxide. In some embodiments, the polymer is hydrophilic. In certain embodiments, the conjugates are made using oligonucleotides that have terminal amino, sulfhydryl, or phosphate groups, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles bearing amino or carboxy groups on a hydrophilic polymer. There are several methods for synthesizing carboxy and amino derivatized-nanoparticles.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Polypeptide Binding Moieties</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0155">In certain embodiments, the binding moiety is a polypeptide (i.e., a protein, polypeptide, or peptide), attached, using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single covalent bond in such a manner so as to not affect the biological activity of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, attachment is done through the thiol group of single reactive cysteine residue so placed that its modification does not affect the biological activity of the polypeptide. In this regard the use of linear polypeptides, with cysteine at the C-terminal or N-terminal end, provides a single thiol in a manner similar to which alkanethiol supplies a thiol group at the 3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032; end of an oligonucleotide. Similar bifunctional conjugation reagents, such as SPDP and reacting with the amino group of the nanoparticle and thiol group of the polypeptide, can be used with any thiol bearing binding moiety. The types of polypeptides used as binding moieties can be antibodies, antibody fragments, and natural and synthetic polypeptide sequences, for example. The peptide binding moieties generally have a binding partner, that is, a molecule to which they selectively bind.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0156">Use of peptides as binding moieties offers several advantages. For example, the mass per binding site is low. For example, up to twenty 2 kDa peptides can be attached to a nanoparticle, calculated assuming 2064 iron atoms per nanoparticle. With larger binding moieties like proteins (generally greater than about 30 kDa) the same mass of attached polypeptide results in only approximately 1-4 binding moieties per nanoparticle. Also, polypeptides can be engineered to have uniquely reactive residues, distal from the residues required for biological activity, for attachment to the nanoparticle. The reactive residue can be a cysteine thiol, an N-terminal amino group, a C-terminal carboxyl group or a carboxyl group of aspartate or glutamate, etc. A single reactive residue on the peptide is used to insure a unique site of attachment. These design principles can be followed with chemically synthesized peptides or biologically produced polypeptides.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0157">The binding moieties can also contain amino acid sequences from naturally occurring (wild-type) polypeptides or proteins. For example, the natural polypeptide may be a hormone, (e.g., a cytokine, a growth factor), a serum protein, a viral protein (e.g., hemagglutinin), an extracellular matrix protein, a lectin, or an ectodomain of a cell surface protein. In general, the resulting binding moiety-nanoparticle is used to measure the presence of analytes in a test media reacting with the binding moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0158">Examples of protein hormones include: platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) which binds the PDGF receptor; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (Igf) which binds the Igf receptor; nerve growth factor (NGF) which binds the NGF receptor; fibroblast growth factor (FGF) which binds the FGF receptor (e.g., aFGF and bFGF); epidermal growth factor (EGF) which binds the EGF receptor; transforming growth factor (TGF, e.g., TGF-.alpha. and TGF-.beta.) which bind the TGF receptor; erythropoietin, which binds the erythropoitin receptor; growth hormone (e.g., human growth hormone) which binds the growth hormone receptor; and proinsulin, insulin, A-chain insulin, and B-chain insulin, which all bind to the insulin receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0159">Receptor binding moieties are useful for detecting and imaging receptor clustering on the surface of a cell. Useful ectodomains include those of the Notch protein, Delta protein, integrins, cadherins, and other cell adhesion molecules.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Antibody Binding Moieties</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0160">Other polypeptide binding moieties include immunoglobulin binding moieties that include at least one immunoglobulin domain, and typically at least two such domains. An &#x201c;immunoglobulin domain&#x201d; refers to a domain of a antibody molecule, e.g., a variable or constant domain. An &#x201c;immunoglobulin superfamily domain&#x201d; refers to a domain that has a three-dimensional structure related to an immunoglobulin domain, but is from a non-immunoglobulin molecule. Immunoglobulin domains and immunoglobulin superfamily domains typically include two .beta.-sheets formed of about seven .beta.-strands, and a conserved disulphide bond (see, e.g., Williams and Barclay 1988 Ann. Rev Immunol. 6:381-405). Proteins that include domains of the Ig superfamily domains include T cell receptors, CD4, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM).</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0161">One type of immunoglobulin binding moiety is an antibody. The term &#x201c;antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a full-length, two-chain immunoglobulin molecule and an antigen-binding portion and fragments thereof, including synthetic variants. A typical antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VH), and two light (L) chain variable regions (abbreviated herein as VL). The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed &#x201c;complementarity determining regions&#x201d; (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed &#x201c;framework regions&#x201d; (FR). The extent of the framework region and CDR's has been precisely defined (see, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242, and Chothia, C. et al. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDR's and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0162">An antibody can also include a constant region as part of a light or heavy chain. Light chains can include a kappa or lambda constant region gene at the COOH-terminus (termed CL). Heavy chains can include, for example, a gamma constant region (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4; encoding about 330 amino acids). A gamma constant region can include, e.g., CH1, CH2, and CH3. The term &#x201c;full-length antibody&#x201d; refers to a protein that includes one polypeptide that includes VL and CL, and a second polypeptide that includes VH, CH1, CH2, and CH3.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0163">The term &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment&#x201d; of an antibody, as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of a full-length antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to a target. Examples of antigen-binding fragments include, but are not limited to: (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0164">In certain embodiments, the binding moiety is a polysaccharide, linked, for example, using any of a variety of chemistries, by a single bond, e.g., a covalent bond, at one of the two ends, to a functional group on the nanoparticle. The polysaccharides can be synthetic or natural. Mono-, di-, tri- and polysaccharides can be used as the binding moiety. These include, e.g., glycosides, N-glycosylamines, O-acyl derivatives, O-methyl derivatives, osazones, sugar alcohols, sugar acids, sugar phosphates when used with appropriate attachment chemistry to the nanoparticle.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0165">A method of accomplishing linking is to couple avidin to a magnetic nanoparticle and react the avidin-nanoparticle with commercially available biotinylated polysaccharides, to yield polysaccharide-nanoparticle conjugates. For example, sialyl Lewis based polysaccharides are commercially available as biotinylated reagents and will react with avidin-CLIO (see Syntesome, Gesellschaft fur medizinische Biochemie mbH.). The sialyl Lewis x tetrasaccharide (Sle<sup>X</sup>) is recognized by proteins known as selecting, which are present on the surfaces of leukocytes and function as part of the inflammatory cascade for the recruitment of leukocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0166">Still other targeting moieties include a non-proteinaceous element, e.g., a glycosyl modification (such as a Lewis antigen) or another non-proteinaceous organic molecule.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Biologically Active Substances</p>

<p id="p-0177" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram <b>100</b> of an NMR system for detection of an echo response of a liquid sample to an RF excitation, thereby detecting the presence and/or concentration of an analyte in the liquid sample. A bias magnet <b>102</b> establishes a bias magnetic field Bb <b>104</b> through a sample <b>106</b>. The nanoparticles are in a lyophilized state in the sample well (the term &#x201c;well&#x201d; as used herein includes any indentation, container, or support) <b>108</b> until introduction of the liquid sample <b>106</b> into the well <b>108</b>, or the nanoparticles can be added to the sample <b>106</b> prior to introduction of the liquid sample into the well <b>108</b>. An RF coil <b>110</b> and RF oscillator <b>112</b> provides an RF excitation at the Larmor frequency which is a linear function of the bias magnetic field Bb. The RF coil <b>110</b> is wrapped around the sample well <b>108</b>. The excitation RF creates instability in the spin of the water protons (or free protons in a non-aqueous solvent). When the RF excitation is turned off, the protons &#x201c;relax&#x201d; to their original state and emit an RF signal characteristic of the concentration of the analyte. The coil <b>110</b> acts as an RF antenna and detects an &#x201c;echo&#x201d; of the relaxation. The echo of interest is the decay in time (generally 10-300 milliseconds) and is called the T<b>2</b> signal. The RF signal from the coil <b>110</b> is amplified <b>114</b> and processed to determine the T<b>2</b> (decay time) response to the excitation in the bias field Bb.

<p id="p-0180" num="0186">The coil configuration may be chosen or adapted for specific implementation of the micro-NMR-MRS technology, since different coil configurations offer different performance characteristics. For example, each of these coil geometries has a different performance and field alignment. The planar coil <b>202</b> has an RF field perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The solenoid coil <b>200</b> has an RF field down the axis of the coil, and the Helmholtz coil <b>206</b> has an RF field transverse to the two rectangular coils <b>214</b>. The Helmholtz <b>206</b> and saddle coils <b>220</b> have transverse fields which would allow the placement of the permanent magnet bias field above and below the well. Helmholtz <b>206</b> and saddle coils <b>220</b> may be most effective for the chip design, while the solenoid coil <b>200</b> may be most effective when the sample and MRS nanoparticles are held in a micro tube.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0187">The micro-NMR devices may be fabricated by winding or printing the coils or by microelectromechanical system (MEMS) semiconductor fabrication techniques. For example, a wound or printed coil/sample well module may be about 100 &#x3bc;m in diameter, or as large as a centimeter or more. A MEMS unit or chip (thusly named since it is fabricated in a semiconductor process as a die on a wafer) may have a coil that is from about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m in characteristic dimension, for example. The wound or printed coil/sample well configuration is referenced herein as a module and the MEMS version is referenced herein as a chip. For example, the liquid sample <b>108</b> may be held in a tube (for example, a capillary, pipette, or micro tube) with the coil wound around it, or it may be held in wells on the chip with the RF coil surrounding the well.</p>

In step <b>1220</b>, the needle <b>1212</b> is removed and a test chamber <b>1222</b> is attached. The test chamber has a volume from about 10 to about 400 &#x3bc;L and includes a molecular filter <b>1224</b> at the right side of the chamber. The molecular filter <b>1224</b> may be, for example, a membrane or molecular seive made from synthetic compounds, aluminosilicate minerals, clays, porous glass, microporous charcoal, activated carbon, desiccant, lime, silica gel, and/or zeolite. Various molecular filters are available from suppliers such as the Pall Corporation, Millipore Corporation, and Chromacol, for example. The molecular filter <b>1224</b> can be used to concentrate DNA, viruses, proteins, and/or other analytes. In step <b>1230</b>, the test chamber <b>1222</b> is detached from the syringe <b>1214</b>. A plunger <b>1232</b> with an integral MEMS chip <b>1234</b> at the end having one or more RF coil/well pairs is inserted. In step <b>1240</b>, remaining fluid is pushed out through the filter <b>1224</b>. In step <b>1250</b>, the plunger <b>1232</b> is pulled back (to the left) about 1 mm to a detent, thereby drawing fluid held up in the tip <b>1252</b> back through the filter <b>1224</b> and suspending molecules and nanoparticles. The test chamber <b>1222</b> can then be inserted into the reader for NMR testing and analysis. Concentration of analyte depends upon chip size <b>1234</b> and syringe cross section. In general, because the MEMS chip is integral to the syringe plunger, the more well/coil pairs in/on the chip, the greater the diameter and the less concentration obtained. For example, where there are 40 wells, with a syringe cross section of 40 mm<sup>2 </sup>and 1 mm draw back (40 mm<sup>3 </sup>draw back volume), the concentration is 25 times. Where there are 10 wells, with a syringe cross section of 10 mm<sup>2 </sup>and 1 mm draw back volume), the concentration is 100 times. Where there is one well, with a syringe cross section of 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>and 1 mm draw back (1 mm<sup>3 </sup>draw back volume), the concentration is 1000 times.</p>

<p id="p-0198" num="0204">NMR systems with RF coils and micro wells containing nanoparticle sensors described herein may be designed for detection and/or concentration measurement of specific analyte(s) of interest by development of a model for particle aggregation phenomena and by development of an RF-NMR signal chain model. For example, experiments can be conducted for analyte/nanoparticle systems of interest by characterizing the physics of particle aggregation, including, for example, the effects of affinities, relevant dimensions, and concentrations. Also, experiments can be conducted to characterize the NMR signal(s) (T<b>2</b>, T<b>1</b>, and/or other signal characteristics) as functions of particle aggregation and magnetic particle characteristics.

An RF pulse generator <b>1404</b> provides an RF pulse at or near Larmor frequency. A single pulse may be delivered to the coil <b>1402</b>, or a series of pulses may be delivered to the coil <b>1402</b> via switches. For example, enhanced sensitivity may be achieved for T<b>2</b> relaxation measurements using multi-echo and/or spin-echo sequences. For example, Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences may achieve greater T<b>2</b> measurement sensitivity.

The signal analysis processor <b>1408</b> may alternatively be on-chip. The RF pre-amplifier is preferably in close proximity to the respective coil(s) <b>1402</b>. The signal analysis processor <b>1408</b> manages the data and performs both time domain and frequency domain analysis. Where there are multiple wells, a multiplexer could be used, for example, after conditioning by the RF pre-amplifier <b>1410</b>. In certain embodiments, the RF coil(s) <b>1402</b>, RF amplifier(s) <b>1410</b>, and/or other components shown in the diagram <b>1400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are micromachined, for example, in a BiCMOS (or BiMOS) process, as a system-on-a-chip. BiCMOS refers to the integration of bipolar junction transistors and CMOS (complementary-symmetry/metal-oxide semiconductor) technology into a single device.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0206">In order to maximize power transfer from the RF amplifier <b>1410</b>, the coil is matched to a given impedance using variable capacitors. During signal detection, the NMR signal from the coil <b>1402</b> may be amplified (e.g. by a factor of about 400) by the RF preamplifier <b>1410</b>, and then down-converted to audio-frequencies by the mixer <b>1412</b>. The intermediate frequency signal may be amplified (e.g. by a factor of about 100) and filtered for frequencies, for example, above about 30 kHz before being digitized.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0207">The NMR system may include a chip with RF coil(s) and electronics micromachined thereon. For example, the chip may be surface micromachined, such that structures are built on top of a substrate. Where the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the properties of the substrate are not as important as in bulk micromachining, and expensive silicon wafers used in bulk micromachining can be replaced by less expensive materials such as glass or plastic. Alternative embodiments, however, may include chips that are bulk micromachined. Surface micromachining generally starts with a wafer or other substrate and grows layers on top. These layers are selectively etched by photolithography and either a wet etch involving an acid or a dry etch involving an ionized gas, or plasma. Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching, or ion bombardment of the material. Surface micromachining may involve as many layers as is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0208">Where the relaxation measurement is T<b>2</b>, accuracy and repeatability (precision) will be a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), the pulse sequence for refocusing (e.g. CPMG, BIRD, Tango, and the like), as well as signal processing factors, such as signal conditioning (e.g. amplification, rectification, and/or digitization of the echo signals), time/frequency domain transformation, and signal processing algorithms used. Signal-to-noise ratio may be a function of the magnetic bias field (B), sample volume, filling factor, coil geometry, coil Q-factor, electronics bandwidth, amplifier noise, and/or temperature, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0209">An illustrative experimental protocol for design or customization of an analyte detection unit for detection of a particular analyte is described below. The illustrative protocol includes performing experiments with a single micro coil, for example, a solenoid would around a capillary tube. Experiments would be conducted to determine how T<b>2</b> changes as a function of analyte type and concentration, and NMR particle ligand and affinity. Experiments would be conducted to analyze the effect on the T<b>2</b> signal of the excitation frequency (at and around the Larmor frequency), the pulse sequence, signal conditioning, the bias field (e.g. from about 0.45 T to about 7 T), and Q factor. The effect of Q factor may be determined by performing experiments using coils made from different materials and/or performing and/or by performing experiments at different temperatures, in order to test the effect of coil resistance on the signal quality.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0210">For example, to obtain a 10-fold improvement in the 0.02 ng/mL detection limit for Troponin (10-fold increase in sensitivity), it would be necessary to discern a delta-T<b>2</b> less than about 5.6 milliseconds from a traditional (non-MRS-measured) T<b>2</b> of about 100 milliseconds. The minimum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) would need to be about 20 to detect this difference.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0211">Assuming a target sample volume of 100 nl and a solenoid 542 micron in diameter by 400 micron long, the predicted performance is shown below in Table 1 in the shaded entry. This arrangement provides a predicted robust S/N of 73 and a 0.3 microvolt signal with a 1 T field and 1000 cps bandwidth. S/N increases to a predicted 1300 and 14 microvolts signal with a 7 T field. Varying the coil design to create a higher Q may enhance the performance further. Experiments can be performed at higher magnetic field strengths, e.g. a 7T field strength provided by commercially available NMR devices, to confirm the viability of system design for achieving the 10-fold increase in the 0.02 ng/mL Troponin detection limit, or 56 femto-molar limit, with a 1T field.</p>

<claim-text>(a) administering the therapeutic agent to the patient;</claim-text>
<claim-text>(b) following step (a), obtaining a sample comprising the therapeutic agent or metabolite thereof from the patient;</claim-text>
<claim-text>(c) placing the liquid sample in a device, the device comprising a support defining a well holding a liquid sample comprising magnetic particles and the one or more analytes, the magnetic particles having binding moieties linked thereto; and an RF coil disposed about the liquid sample, the RF coil configured to detect an NMR relaxation response produced by exposing the liquid sample to a bias magnetic field created using one or more magnets and an RF excitation, wherein the RF coil has a characteristic dimension from about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m, and wherein at least one of the binding moieties is operative to bind to at least one of the following: (i) the one or more analytes; (ii) another of the binding moieties; and (iii) an aggregation-inducing molecule in the liquid sample, thereby producing an aggregate of multiply-linked magnetic particles as a function of the presence or concentration of the one or more analytes in the liquid sample;</claim-text>
<claim-text>(d) contacting the sample with the magnetic particles in the presence of the bias magnetic field;</claim-text>
<claim-text>(e) exposing the sample to an RF excitation;</claim-text>
<claim-text>(f) following step (e), detecting an NMR relaxation response produced by the sample; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>(g) on the basis of the result of step (f), determining the concentration of the therapeutic agent or metabolite thereof,</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein, if the concentration of the therapeutic agent or metabolite thereof is above the appropriate therapeutic range, the dose of the therapeutic agent being administered to the patient is reduced, and if the concentration of the therapeutic agent or metabolite thereof is below the therapeutic range, the dose of the therapeutic agent being administered to the patient is increased.</claim-text>
