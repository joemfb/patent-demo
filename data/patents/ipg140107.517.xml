<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A ramp assembly includes a ramp portion configured for reciprocating motion between a stowed position, a deployed position, and a neutral position. The ramp assembly includes a counterbalance comprising a lug associated with the ramp portion so that movement of the ramp portion toward the deployed position moves the lug along an arcuate path in a first direction, and movement of the ramp portion toward the stowed position moves the lug along the arcuate path in a second direction. A flexible line is coupled to the lug, and a restraint is fixedly located relative to the stowed position of the ramp portion. A biasing element is associated with the flexible line such that movement of the ramp portion away from the neutral position moves the biasing element compresses a spring disposed between the restraint and the biasing element.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/828,258, filed Mar. 14, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires the removal of physical obstacles to those who are physically challenged. The stated objective of this legislation has increased public awareness and concern over the requirements of the physically challenged. Consequentially, there has been more emphasis on providing systems that assist such people to access a motor vehicle, such as a bus or minivan.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common manner of providing the physically challenged with access to motor vehicles is a ramp. Various ramp operating systems for motor vehicles are known in the art. Some slide out from underneath the floor of the vehicle and tilt down. Others are stowed in a vertical position and are pivoted about a hinge, while still others are supported by booms and cable assemblies. The present disclosure is generally directed to a &#x201c;fold out&#x201d; type of ramp. Such a ramp is normally stowed in a horizontal position within a recess in the vehicle floor, and is pivoted upward and outward to a downward-sloping extended position. In the extended position, the ramp is adjustable to varying curb heights.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fold out ramps on vehicles confront a variety of technical problems. Longer ramps are desirable because the resulting slope is more gradual and more accessible by wheelchair-bound passengers. Longer ramps are, however, heavier and require more torque about the hinge to be reciprocated between deployed and stowed positions. To satisfy this torque requirement, such fold-out ramps use large electric motors, pneumatic devices, or hydraulic actuators to deploy and stow the ramp. Many of such systems cannot be moved manually in the event of failure of the power source unless the drive mechanism is first disengaged. Some existing fold-out ramps can be deployed or stowed manually, but they are difficult to operate because one must first overcome the resistance of the drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As noted above, many existing fold-out ramps are equipped with hydraulic, electric, or pneumatic actuating devices. Such devices are obtrusive and make access to and from a vehicle difficult when the ramp is stowed. Moreover, many of such fold-out ramps have no energy storage capabilities to aid the lifting of the ramp, thereby preserving the life of the drive motor or even allowing a smaller drive to be employed. Finally, operating systems for such fold-out ramps must have large power sources to overcome the torque placed on the hinge by the necessarily long moment arm of the fold-out ramp.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An exemplary embodiment of the claimed ramp assembly includes a ramp portion configured for reciprocating motion between a stowed position, a deployed position, and a neutral position. A counterbalance associated with the ramp portion comprises a lug associated with the ramp portion such that movement of the ramp portion toward the deployed position moves the lug along an arcuate path in a first direction, and movement of the ramp portion toward the stowed position moves the lug along the arcuate path in a second direction. A flexible line is coupled to the lug, and a restraint is fixedly located relative to the stowed position of the ramp portion. The counterbalance further includes a biasing element associated with the flexible line such that movement of the ramp portion away from the neutral position moving the biasing element toward the restraint. A spring is disposed between the restraint and the biasing element, wherein (1) movement of the ramp portion from the neutral position toward the stowed position compresses the spring, and (2) movement of the ramp portion from the neutral position toward the deployed position compresses the spring.</p>

This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings where like numerals correspond to like elements. The disclosed embodiments are directed to ramp assemblies, and specifically, to wheelchair ramp assemblies. In particular, described embodiments are directed to wheelchair ramp assemblies suitable for use in buses, vans, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following discussion proceeds with reference to examples of wheelchair ramp assemblies for use in vehicles having a floor, such as a bus, van, etc. While the examples provided herein have been described with reference to their association with vehicles, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that this is done for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter. Thus, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that aspects of the present disclosure may be employed with other ramp assemblies used in stationary installations, such as residential buildings and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following detailed description may use illustrative terms such as vertical, horizontal, front, rear, curbside, roadside, inboard, outboard, proximal, distal, etc. However, these terms are descriptive in nature and should not be construed as limiting. Further, it will be appreciated that embodiments of the present disclosure may employ any combination of features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a fold out ramp assembly <b>100</b> (hereinafter the &#x201c;ramp assembly <b>100</b>&#x201d;) suitable for use with the described counterbalance assemblies. The ramp assembly <b>100</b> is adapted to be mounted to a vehicle (not shown), such as a bus or a van and includes a ramp portion <b>102</b>. The ramp portion <b>102</b> is mounted to be rotatable about one end so that the ramp portion <b>102</b> is reciprocal between the stowed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and a deployed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">When a ramp assembly is installed in a vehicle, some components of the ramp assembly <b>100</b> may maintain a fixed relationship relative to the vehicle structure, while other components move relative to the vehicle structure when the ramp reciprocates between a stowed position and a deployed position. Similarly, when a ramp assembly is installed in a stationary installation, such as a residential building and the like, some components of the ramp assembly may maintain a fixed relationship relative to the building structure, while other components move relative to the building structure when the ramp reciprocates between the stowed position and a deployed position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated, the ramp assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> includes a fixed portion <b>104</b>. For such embodiments, the fixed portion <b>104</b> of the ramp assembly <b>100</b> maintains a fixed relationship to the vehicle or other structure to which the ramp assembly is mounted. It will also be appreciated that the fixed portion <b>104</b> of the ramp assembly also maintains a fixed relationship to any defined ramp position. That is, the fixed portion <b>104</b> of the ramp assembly <b>100</b> can be described as having a fixed relationship to the stowed position of the ramp portion, i.e., to the ramp portion when the ramp portion is in the stowed position. Similarly, the fixed portion <b>104</b> of the ramp assembly can be described as having a fixed relationship to the neutral position of the ramp portion, which is the position in which the center of gravity of the ramp portion <b>102</b> is positioned so that the weight of the ramp portion does not impart a moment on the ramp portion. Alternate embodiments that do not include a fixed portion are also possible. For such embodiments, the ramp portion is rotatably coupled directly to a portion of the vehicle or other structure to which the ramp assembly is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, movement of the ramp portion <b>102</b> is powered by a drive assembly <b>110</b>, which includes a motor <b>112</b> operatively coupled to the ramp portion with a transmission assembly <b>114</b>. The transmission assembly <b>114</b> includes a roadside sprocket <b>116</b> operatively coupled to a drive shaft <b>118</b> that is selectively rotated by the motor <b>112</b>. A curbside sprocket <b>120</b> is positioned along the curbside end of the ramp assembly. In the illustrated embodiment, the curbside sprocket <b>120</b> is rotatably coupled to a trunnion <b>122</b> that extends from and is fixed relative to the fixed portion <b>104</b> of the ramp assembly <b>100</b>. The curbside sprocket <b>120</b> is operatively coupled to the ramp portion <b>102</b> so that rotation of the curbside sprocket <b>120</b> in a first direction actuates the ramp portion towards the stowed position, and rotation of the curbside sprocket in a second direction actuates the ramp portion towards a deployed position. A chain <b>124</b> forms an endless loop that engages the curbside sprocket <b>120</b> and the roadside sprocket <b>116</b> so that rotation of the roadside sprocket rotates the curbside sprocket <b>120</b>, thus actuating the ramp portion <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The illustrated transmission assembly is exemplary only and should not be considered limiting. For example, although the transmission assembly <b>114</b> is described as a combination of sprockets <b>116</b> and <b>120</b> and a chain <b>124</b>, other known transmission assemblies may be utilized, including but not limited to a plurality of gears, a belt and pulleys, etc. It is also anticipated that the drive shaft of the motor can be directly coupled to the ramp portion to provide an actuating force to the ramp portion. It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that these and other variations to the transmission assembly are possible. Accordingly, such alternate embodiments should be considered within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the illustrated embodiment, the trunnion <b>122</b> serves as a pivot axis for the ramp portion <b>102</b> and the curbside sprocket <b>120</b>. That is, the central axis <b>126</b> of the trunnion <b>122</b> is coincident to the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> as the ramp portion reciprocates between the stowed position and a deployed position. It should be appreciated that the curbside sprocket <b>120</b> and the ramp portion <b>102</b> need not rotate about the same axis <b>126</b>. In this regard, the curbside sprocket <b>120</b> and the ramp portion <b>102</b> can have separate axes of rotation, wherein rotation of the curbside sprocket is transferred to the ramp portion by a suitable transmission configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref> show the ramp assembly <b>100</b> as the ramp portion <b>102</b> rotates from the stowed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) through the neutral position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to a deployed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the ramp is in the stowed position, the center of gravity (CG) of the ramp portion is positioned roadside of the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> so that the weight of the ramp portion imparts a moment M<sub>W </sub>on the ramp portion <b>102</b> that tends to rotate the ramp portion away from the neutral position and toward the stowed position. Similarly, when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is in a deployed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the CG of the ramp portion is positioned curbside of the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> so that the weight of the ramp portion imparts a moment M<sub>W </sub>on the ramp portion that tends to rotate the ramp portion away from the neutral position and toward the deployed position. The moment M<sub>W </sub>is the product of the weight W of the ramp portion <b>102</b> multiplied by moment arm d<sub>W</sub>, which is the horizontal distance between the center of rotation and the CG of the ramp portion <b>102</b>. As the ramp portion <b>102</b> moves from either the stowed position or a deployed position toward the neutral position, the moment arm d<sub>W </sub>decreases according to the cosine of the angle of the ramp portion relative to a horizontal plane. As a result, the moment M<sub>W </sub>also decreases according to the cosine of the angle of the ramp portion relative to a horizontal plane as the ramp portion <b>102</b> moves toward the neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the ramp portion <b>102</b> is in the neutral position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the CG of the ramp portion <b>102</b> is located directly over the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b>, i.e., d<sub>W</sub>=0. As a result, the weight of the ramp portion <b>102</b> does not impart any moment about the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the neutral position is depicted as occurring when the ramp is in a substantially vertical position. It should be appreciated, however, that the position of the CG can vary according to the configuration of the ramp portion <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the neutral position, i.e. the position at which the CG is located above the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b>, can also vary according to the configuration of the ramp portion <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> is shown. The counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> includes a hub <b>128</b> fixedly coupled to a forward side of the curbside sprocket <b>120</b> so that the hub rotates with the curbside sprocket. The counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> further includes a lug <b>132</b> extending radially outward from the hub <b>128</b>. The lug moves along an arcuate path in a first direction when the ramp portion <b>102</b> moves toward the stowed position and along the arcuate path in a second direction when the ramp portion <b>102</b> moves toward a deployed position. Also envisioned are embodiments wherein the drive shaft <b>118</b> that couples the motor to the roadside sprocket <b>116</b> acts as the hub, i.e., the shaft to which the lug <b>132</b> is attached. Such a configuration would allow the counterbalance assembly to be located internal to the ramp assembly <b>100</b>, i.e., under the ramp portion <b>102</b> when the ramp portion is in the stowed position. It should also be appreciated that the hub <b>128</b> can be any shaft associated with the ramp assembly <b>100</b> that rotates in a first direction when the ramp portion <b>102</b> moves toward the stowed position and in a second direction when the ramp portion moves toward a deployed position.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A chain <b>134</b> is rotatably coupled at one end to the lug <b>132</b> and extends through a guide <b>154</b>. More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, the chain <b>134</b> extends between an upper guide surface <b>156</b> and a lower guide surface <b>158</b> disposed on the guide <b>154</b>. The chain <b>134</b> can be a roller chain, a leaf chain or any other suitable force transfer element that acts as a flexible line capable of transferring a pulling force. In this regard, the chain <b>134</b> can also be a cable, a belt, or any other flexible member capable of transferring a force in tension.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A second end of the chain <b>134</b> is coupled to a spring assembly <b>140</b>A. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the spring assembly includes a rod <b>142</b>A, which is slidably coupled to a fixed portion <b>104</b> of the ramp assembly <b>100</b>. A restraint <b>144</b>A is mounted to the fixed portion <b>104</b> and is slidably associated with the rod <b>142</b>A. In the illustrated embodiment, the restraint <b>144</b>A is a C-shaped channel wherein the rod is disposed between upper and lower legs of the restraint. It should be appreciated that the illustrated restraint <b>144</b>A is exemplary only, and that alternate configurations are contemplated and should be considered within the scope if the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A spring stop <b>146</b>A is slidably coupled to a proximal end of the rod <b>142</b>A, and a biasing element <b>148</b>A is fixedly coupled to a distal end of the rod. The spring stop <b>146</b>A is positioned adjacent to the restraint <b>144</b>A, and a spring <b>150</b>A is disposed between the spring stop and the biasing element. The spring stop <b>146</b>A and biasing element <b>148</b>A are sized and configured to engage the ends of the spring <b>150</b>A. More specifically, the spring stop <b>146</b>A and biasing element <b>148</b>A are sized and configured to control the position of each end of the spring <b>150</b>A so that reciprocating movement of the ramp portion <b>102</b> between the stowed and deployed positions selectively compresses the spring. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the spring stop <b>146</b>A and biasing element <b>148</b>A are generally cylindrical fittings that engage the ends of the spring. The illustrated embodiments, however, should not be considered limiting. In this regard, the spring stop <b>146</b>A and biasing element <b>148</b>A can take any form suitable for controlling the compression of the spring <b>150</b>A as described herein. Such alternate configurations are contemplated and should be considered within the scope of the present disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated, the spring <b>150</b>A is a coil compression spring with the rod <b>142</b>A passing through the center of the coils; however, it will be appreciated that the type and position of the spring can vary. Alternate embodiments are contemplated in which the spring is a pneumatic spring or a hydraulic spring. Embodiments are also contemplated in which the spring is not aligned with the rod, but is instead offset from the rod. In this regard, the spring <b>150</b>A can be any element that provides a force that resists movement of the rod <b>142</b>A when the chain <b>124</b> pulls the rod <b>142</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, a second spring assembly <b>140</b>B is connected to the first spring assembly <b>140</b>A. The second spring assembly <b>140</b>B is similar to the previously described first spring assembly <b>140</b>A, wherein reference numbers ending with &#x201c;B&#x201d; correspond to reference numbers ending with &#x201c;A,&#x201d; e.g., rod <b>142</b>B is similar in form and function to rod <b>142</b>A. The distal end of the first rod <b>142</b>A is coupled to a proximal end of the second rod <b>142</b>B by a chain <b>152</b> or other suitable element capable of transferring a pulling force. A distal end of the second rod <b>142</b>B is slidingly associated with a guide <b>160</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the guide <b>160</b> is a bracket with a hole through which the second rod <b>142</b>B passes; however, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that alternate embodiments are possible to slidingly restrain the distal end of the second rod <b>142</b>B, and such alternate embodiments should be considered within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As previously noted, when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is in the neutral position, the CG of the ramp portion is over the center of rotation of the ramp portion, and the weight of the ramp portion imparts no moment on the ramp portion. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is so positioned, any force F applied by the counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> is applied through the central axis <b>126</b> of the trunnion <b>122</b>. As a result, the counterbalance <b>130</b> applies no moment to the ramp portion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Movement of the ramp portion <b>102</b> from the neutral position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) toward the stowed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) moves the lug <b>132</b> in a clockwise direction (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>) along an arcuate path. As a result, the lug <b>132</b> pulls the chain <b>134</b>, which in turn moves the biasing elements <b>148</b>A and <b>148</b>B toward their associated spring stops <b>146</b>A and <b>146</b>B. The spring stops <b>146</b>A and <b>146</b>B are restrained by the restraints <b>144</b>A and <b>144</b>B. As the distance between the biasing elements <b>148</b>A and <b>148</b>B and the associated spring stops <b>146</b>A and <b>146</b>B decreases, the springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B are compressed. Compression of the springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B apply a force to the biasing elements <b>148</b>A and <b>148</b>B that bias the rods <b>142</b>A and <b>142</b>B, and therefore the chain <b>134</b>, away from the trunnion <b>122</b>. As a result, the chain <b>134</b> pulls on the lug <b>132</b> with a force F. The force F creates a moment M<sub>F </sub>about the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> that tends to rotate the ramp toward the neutral position. The moment M<sub>F </sub>acts on the hub <b>128</b> to counteract the moment M<sub>W </sub>that results from the weight of the ramp portion <b>102</b>. Thus, when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is between the neutral position and the stowed position, the spring assemblies <b>140</b>A and <b>140</b>B provide a force F that biases the ramp portion toward the neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Movement of the ramp portion <b>102</b> from the neutral position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) toward the deployed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) moves the lug <b>132</b> in a counter-clockwise direction (as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>) along an arcuate path. Movement of the lug along the arcuate path compresses the springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B as described above so that the chain <b>134</b> pulls on the lug <b>132</b> with a force F. The force F creates a moment M<sub>F </sub>about the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> that tends to rotate the ramp toward the neutral position. The moment M<sub>F </sub>counteracts the moment M<sub>W </sub>that results from the weight of the ramp portion <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B of the counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> are preferably selected to minimize the difference between the force supplied by the spring and the force required to counteract the moment M<sub>W </sub>as the ramp portion <b>102</b> reciprocates between a stowed position and a deployed position. For linear springs, the spring stiffness can be selected such that the linear increase in spring resistance is a best fit of the sinusoidal increase of the moment M<sub>F</sub>. As a result, the difference between M<sub>W </sub>and M<sub>F </sub>is minimized. In other embodiments, non-linear springs are used so that the resistance supplied by the spring increases at a non-linear rate, allowing the spring resistance to match more closely the force required to resist the moment M<sub>F </sub>as the ramp portion <b>102</b> reciprocates between a stowed position and a deployed position. Non-linear springs are known in the art. For example, a spring formed with a variable coil pitch will exhibit non-linear properties. It should be understood that various known spring configurations providing linear or non-linear reactive force can be included in the counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. In addition, alternate systems can be used to provide a resistive force, such as pneumatic or hydraulic systems (springs) and other systems known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the lug <b>132</b> of the illustrated counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> is positioned on the hub <b>128</b> such that the force F supplied by the counterbalance assembly acts through the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> when the ramp portion is in the neutral position. It will be appreciated that alternate embodiments are possible wherein the lug <b>132</b> is positioned so that the force F supplied by the counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> acts through the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b> when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is in a position other than the neutral position. In this regard, it is contemplated that for certain ramp assembly configurations, the moment M<sub>F </sub>supplied by the counterbalance assembly <b>130</b> will more closely match the moment M<sub>W </sub>caused by the weight of the ramp portion if the counterbalance produces no moment, i.e., M<sub>F</sub>=0, when the ramp portion is offset from the neutral position. Such embodiments are contemplated and should be considered within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the disclosed embodiment, the springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B engage the biasing elements <b>148</b>A and <b>148</b>B and the spring stops <b>146</b>A and <b>146</b>B when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is in the neutral position. In this position, the compression springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B may be partially compressed. Because the force F is applied through the central axis <b>126</b> of the trunnion <b>122</b>, the force does not result in a moment M<sub>F </sub>about the center of rotation of the ramp portion <b>102</b>. Alternately, the springs <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B may be uncompressed when the ramp portion <b>102</b> is in the neutral position so that the springs apply no force F to the lug <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
