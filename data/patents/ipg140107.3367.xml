<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to energy conservation in appliances, and more particularly to reducing power draw of a device, such as an appliance, when in a standby or power-saving state.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The standby power state, also referred to as sleep or idle state, generally refers to a low power consumption condition for electrical and electronic devices such as appliance and computers. In a typical standby power state, certain components and/or functions of the device are put to &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; or idled, so as to reduce power consumption. These reduced power conditions can have a significant effect on electrical consumption and cost compared to leaving a device fully on and idle, or not actively used.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, even in the typical standby state, an appliance still consumes a certain amount of electricity or power. This power loss can be significant, when considered in terms of the number of appliances in use. In some cases, when an appliance is not being used for its primary purpose, there is no need for the appliance to consume any power at all. It would be advantageous to be able to determine when an appliance is in a condition in which it does not need to consume power and effectively further reduce or eliminate the power draw of the appliance in that state.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a system that addresses at least some of the problems identified above.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described herein, the exemplary embodiments overcome one or more of the above or other disadvantages known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the exemplary embodiments relates to a standby power system for an appliance having a power input coupled to a main power source. The system includes a power enabling device coupled between the main power source and power input of the appliance, a standby power state sensing device coupled to the power enabling device, and a power restore device coupled to the power enabling device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the exemplary embodiments relates to a power control system for an appliance. The system includes a power input to the appliance, an external source of electrical power, a power enabling device coupled between the external source of electrical power and the power input to the appliance, and a standby state sensing device coupled to the power enabling device configured to detect an existence of a standby state trigger and transmit a standby state activation signal to the power enabling device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other aspects and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood, however, that the drawings are designed solely for purposes of illustration and not as a definition of the limits of the invention, for which reference should be made to the appended claims. Moreover, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale and unless otherwise indicated, they are merely intended to conceptually illustrate the structures and procedures described herein. In addition, any suitable size, shape or type of elements or materials could be used.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary system <b>100</b> incorporating aspects of the disclosed embodiments. The aspects of the disclosed embodiments are generally directed to reducing and/or eliminating electrical power consumption, also referred to herein as &#x201c;power draw&#x201d;, of an appliance <b>102</b>, when the appliance <b>102</b> is not being used or at least not being used for its intended purpose. This state of the appliance <b>102</b> is generally referred to as a &#x201c;standby&#x201d; or &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; state. In this state, the appliance <b>102</b> and its corresponding functions can be switched to a standby operating state, in which the appliance <b>102</b> powered down to conserve energy.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an appliance <b>102</b> includes a power supply source or input <b>104</b>. The power supply input <b>104</b> can comprise a connection point for a power source to the appliance <b>102</b>, a power control point or a power supply for the appliance <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the power supply input <b>104</b> can be internal to the appliance <b>102</b> and can comprise, for example, a power supply that receives power from an external power source and provides the necessary electrical power to each of the various components of the appliance <b>102</b> requiring electrical power. Alternatively, the power supply input <b>104</b> can comprise a connection to a suitable external power source.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Generally, a main power feed or supply <b>108</b> is used to provide an external source of electrical energy for the appliance <b>102</b>. The power supply input <b>104</b> receives and/or converts the external source of electricity from the main power feed <b>108</b> in a suitable manner in order to power the appliance <b>102</b> according to the power requirements of the appliance <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The main power feed <b>108</b> generally comprises a connection to the electrical power supplied by the local utility, also referred to as &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In one embodiment, the main power feed <b>108</b> can comprise a wall connection into which a suitable power line or cord connected to the power supply input <b>104</b> is coupled. In alternate embodiments, the main power feed <b>108</b> can comprise any suitable source of electrical power, such as for example a battery supply, generator or other generated supply of electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also includes a standby state power enabling device <b>106</b> that is electrically connected between the main power feed <b>108</b> and the power supply input <b>104</b> to the appliance <b>102</b>. The standby state power enabling device <b>106</b> is generally configured to interrupt the flow of electrical power from the main power feed <b>108</b> to the power supply input <b>104</b> when a standby-state input signal <b>114</b> is detected. During normal operation of the appliance <b>102</b>, or when the appliance <b>102</b> is not in a standby state, the power supply input <b>104</b> is electrically coupled to the main power feed <b>108</b> in an operational manner. Although the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the standby state enabling device <b>106</b> as being external to the appliance <b>102</b>, in alternate embodiments, the standby state power enabling device <b>106</b> is integral to the appliance <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the standby state input signal <b>114</b> is provided to the standby state power enabling device <b>106</b> from a standby state sensing unit <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the standby state sensing unit <b>110</b> is configured to monitor one or more operating conditions or properties of the appliance <b>102</b>, or the environment of the appliance <b>102</b>. These monitored conditions are used to determine when the appliance <b>102</b> can be switched to the standby state without adverse consequences. Each monitored condition will have one or predetermined triggers associated therewith. When one or more of the predetermined triggers is detected, the standby state sensing unit <b>110</b> generates the standby state activation signal <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, in one embodiment, the standby state sensing unit <b>110</b> includes a proximity or motion detection device. The proximity detection device can be used to determine the presence or absence of a user in an area of the appliance. In this example, a pre-determined trigger is the lack of any activity within a certain area surrounding the appliance <b>102</b>. If no activity has been detected for a pre-determined period of time, this can indicate that the appliance <b>102</b> can be switched to the standby state.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As another example, in one embodiment, the standby state sensing unit <b>110</b> includes a clock or timer device. The clock or timer device can be used to detect an elapsed time since last use of the appliance <b>102</b>. The expiration of a pre-determined time period since last use of the appliance <b>102</b> is a pre-determined trigger, and can be used to indicate that the appliance <b>102</b> can be switched to the standby state.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Other alternative conditions or triggers that can be used to determine whether the appliance <b>102</b> is or is not in a state or condition suitable for switching to the standby state can include, for example, activity level, energy management systems and conditions (demand side management), home automation system settings, preset or user set operational conditions or parameters, lack of controller or serial bus activity, sound or other sensed physical properties such as temperature, pressure, RF energy, wind speed, wind direction, luminous intensity, sound, radio frequency activity, motor position, randomized time events (for satisfying religious practices), etc. For example, certain religious practices may restrict the use of appliances during certain time periods and/or days of the week. A suitable clock or calendaring device can be used to determine these periods and be used to provide or generate the trigger for switching the appliance <b>102</b> to the standby state. In alternate embodiments, any suitable conditions or trigger events can be used to determine whether the appliance <b>102</b> can be switched to the standby state without adverse consequences. The standby state activation signal <b>114</b> will be generated when one or more of these conditions or trigger events are satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the standby state activation signal <b>114</b> is detected by the standby state power enabling device <b>108</b>, the standby state power enabling device <b>108</b> is configured to switch the appliance to the standby operating state by disengaging or disconnecting the power supply input <b>104</b> from the main power feed <b>108</b>. In this standby state, all power to the appliance <b>102</b> is disconnected, resulting in zero power draw from the main power feed <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also includes a power restore or reset device <b>112</b>. The power reset device <b>112</b> is generally configured to cause the standby state power enabling device <b>106</b> to restore or enable restoration of electrical power to the appliance <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, restoring the electrical power to the appliance <b>102</b> comprises connecting, or re-establishing the electrical connection between the main power feed <b>108</b> and the power supply input <b>104</b>. The power reset device <b>112</b> can be configured to generate the power restore signal <b>116</b> in response to one or more triggers. For example, in one embodiment the power reset device <b>112</b> is a manual switch requiring a manual input by a user. Activation of the switch restores power to the appliance <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment, the power reset device <b>112</b> is coupled to an external power source, or includes an internal power supply, and is configured to automatically generate the power restore signal <b>116</b> based upon one or more triggers. In the example where the power reset device <b>112</b> is a switch, when the switch is activated, such as by opening the door <b>101</b> to the appliance <b>102</b> using the door opener <b>103</b> the power restore signal <b>116</b> is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As another example, in one embodiment the power reset device <b>112</b> comprises a touch sensitive device that could be included in, for example, a frame, handle or other suitable component of the appliance <b>102</b>. If contact with the appliance <b>102</b> is detected, the power reset device <b>112</b> generates the power restore signal <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The power reset device <b>112</b> could also include a proximity sensor. In this embodiment, when the appliance <b>102</b> is in the standby state and the power reset device <b>112</b> detects a presence of a user in near proximity to the appliance <b>102</b>, power restore/reset device <b>112</b> can cause the power restore signal <b>116</b> to be automatically generated. The power reset device <b>112</b> can also be configured to automatically generate the power restore signal <b>116</b> at a predetermined time, or after a predetermined time period has elapsed since the standby state activation signal <b>114</b> was received by the standby power enabling device <b>106</b> or the standby state was activated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other examples of predetermined conditions or factors that can be used to determine whether the power reset device <b>112</b> should generate the power restore signal <b>116</b> can include motion detection settings, time of day, an elapsed time period from last use, activity level, energy management systems and conditions (demand side management), home automation system settings, preset, or user set operational conditions or parameters and controller or serial bus activity, sound or other sensed physical properties such as temperature, pressure, RF energy, wind speed, wind direction, luminous intensity, sound, radio frequency activity, motor position, randomized time events (for satisfying religious practices), etc. For example, certain religious practices may restrict the use of appliances during certain time periods and/or days of the week. A suitable clock or calendaring device can be used to determine these periods and when to generate the power restore signal. In alternate embodiments, any suitable or desired condition(s) or triggers can be used as the prerequisites to cause the power reset device <b>112</b> to generate the power restore signal <b>116</b>. The power reset device <b>112</b> can be external to the appliance <b>102</b> or an integral component thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram for an exemplary standby power enabling device <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> including a power restore/reset device <b>112</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the standby power enabling device <b>206</b> is an electromechanical device, such as for example, a normally open (NO) latching bistable single pole, single throw (SPST) relay. In alternate embodiments, any suitable relay or enabling device can be used for enabling or switching an electrical connection of the main power feed <b>108</b> to the appliance power feed <b>204</b> between a closed and open state, such as for example, a TRIAC, DIAC, or Silicone-Controller Rectifier (SCR). Also, while only one relay is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in alternate embodiments, any suitable number of relays can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the normally open state of the device <b>206</b>, the main power feed <b>108</b> is electrically connected to the appliance power feed <b>204</b>. When the standby state activation signal <b>114</b> is detected, the reset side <b>205</b> of the device <b>206</b> is energized. When the reset side <b>205</b> of the device <b>206</b> is energized, the main power feed <b>108</b> is electrically disconnected from the appliance power feed <b>204</b>. This results in a zero power draw condition for the appliance <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reset side <b>205</b> of the device <b>206</b> has been energized. The relay <b>206</b> has latched to the normally closed (NC) position, resulting in the appliance feed <b>204</b> being electrically disconnected from the main power feed <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The device <b>206</b> includes a power reset device <b>112</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the power reset device <b>112</b> comprises a momentary switch <b>212</b> and a power supply unit <b>218</b>. One side of the switch <b>212</b> is electrically coupled to the main power feed and the other side of the switch is electrically coupled to the power supply unit <b>218</b>. The power supply unit <b>218</b> generates the power restore signal <b>216</b> when the switch <b>212</b> is activated, which energizes the set side <b>207</b> of the device <b>206</b>. The power supply unit <b>218</b> in this example is a 12 volt DC power supply. In alternate embodiments, any suitable power source can be utilized that will energize the set side <b>207</b> of the device <b>206</b> when the switch <b>212</b> is activated. Although the switch <b>212</b> is shown in a normally open state, in alternate embodiments the power reset device <b>112</b> can be configured for a switch in a normally closed state.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the power restore signal <b>216</b> is generated, the set side <b>207</b> of the device <b>206</b> is energized. The device <b>206</b> switches to the normally open position and this action electrically connects the main power feed <b>108</b> to the appliance power feed <b>204</b>. While certain circuit elements are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as part of or in addition to the device <b>206</b>, these elements are merely exemplary, and any suitable circuit elements can be used to set and reset the switching relay of the device <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one example of a process incorporating aspects of the disclosed embodiments. In an operational use state, the appliance <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is powered <b>302</b>, that is, the appliance power supply input <b>104</b> is electrically connected to main power supply <b>108</b>. A state or condition conducive to operation in the standby operating state is detected <b>304</b>. The standby state activation signal is generated <b>306</b> and the appliance <b>102</b> enters <b>308</b> the standby state. In the standby operating state, the main power feed <b>108</b> to the appliance <b>102</b> is electrically disconnected <b>310</b> from the power input <b>104</b> to the appliance <b>102</b>, resulting in a no power draw state.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Upon detection <b>312</b> of a power restore signal <b>116</b>, the main power feed <b>108</b> is electrically connected <b>314</b> to the power input <b>104</b> of the appliance <b>102</b>, resulting in the operational use power state <b>302</b> of the appliance <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a system <b>400</b> incorporating aspects of the invention. In this embodiment, a standby power source <b>401</b> can be used in the standby power state is used to provide electrical power for certain sensing and control devices of the appliance <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the standby power source <b>401</b> is external to the appliance <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, sensing devices that are part of, or coupled to the power restore/reset device <b>112</b> can receive power from the power source <b>401</b>. As another example, a memory of the appliance or time keeping functions can receive power from the standby power source <b>401</b> when the appliance <b>402</b> is in the standby state. Other devices can include, for example, proximity and touch sensing devices, presence lighting or other indicators and warning devices, interior and exterior lighting, displays, backlights for light emitting diode (LED) displays, vacuum fluorescent displays (VFD), and all other suitable or non-essential loads. Generally, the devices that receive power from the standby power source <b>401</b> are low power draw devices, with power requirements in the microwatts, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the standby power source <b>401</b> is an independent power source that comes on when the standby state is activated. The standby power source <b>401</b> could store energy when the appliance <b>402</b> is powered by the main power feed <b>108</b> and then use the stored energy to power certain components of the appliance <b>402</b>. Examples of standby power sources <b>401</b> can include, but are not limited to, battery(s), capacitors, solar and wind power and generators. In this fashion, essential components and/or information can be kept active or enabled, together with the sensing devices that are used to re-enable power to the appliance <b>402</b>. In one embodiment, the standby power source <b>401</b> is coupled via line <b>401</b><i>a </i>to the main power feed/supply <b>108</b>. In alternate embodiments, the standby power source <b>401</b> can receive electrical power from any suitable power source.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example a system <b>500</b> that is similar with respect to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, except that the system <b>500</b> is configured to be internal to the appliance <b>502</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the power enabling device <b>506</b> is coupled to suitable loads, controls, or other electrical power consuming components of the appliance <b>502</b>. The coupling can be direct or indirectly through a suitable controller <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is illustrative of a system <b>600</b>, similar to the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the system <b>600</b> is configured to be integral or internal to the appliance <b>602</b>. In this embodiment, the power enabling device <b>606</b> is coupled, either directly or indirectly through a controller <b>504</b>, to the suitable loads, controls and other electrical power consuming components of the appliance <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The aspects of the disclosed embodiments will reduce or eliminate the power consumption of an appliance or other equipment when in the &#x201c;standby power state.&#x201d; In one embodiment the system automatically disconnects the main power feed from the electronics or electrical components of the appliance. This results in a zero power draw situation. The main power feed can automatically reconnected when desired by activation of a sensing mechanism or realizing a pre-determined condition. In addition, a standby power source can be utilized to provide a certain amount of power in order to keep essential components active when all or some of the components of the appliance are disconnected from the main power source. This reduces the standby state power draw of the appliance.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, while there have been shown, described and pointed out, fundamental novel features of the invention as applied to the exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of devices illustrated, and in their operation, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention.
