<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Taiwan application Serial No. 97115067, filed Apr. 24, 2008, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Touch screen enables the user to input a command by touching the elements on the screen directly. Touch screen provides users with great convenience in use and has gains great popularity. In order to meet the requirement of miniaturization, portable electronic device normally has a small size, the size of touch screen is relatively reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Let the mobile phones with touch screen currently available on the market be taken for example. In a dialing mode, when the user inputs a number by pressing a dialing keypad shown on the touch screen of the portable electronic device, the records matching the inputted number are shown on the touch screen. For example, when the user inputs the number &#x201c;0920&#x201d;, the records of telephone numbers in a contact list and/or in a call history that match &#x201c;0920&#x201d; will be shown on the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the size of touch screen is reduced, only a few records can be shown on the touch screen if a dialing keypad is concurrently shown on the touch screen. For example, usually only two records can be shown on the touch screen in a mobile phone. Under such circumstances, the user has to drag down a scroll bar or presses a down-shift key or has to manually activate a press key to close the dialing keypad if the user would like to view other records covered by the dialing keypad. Thus, the efficiency of viewing these records is decreased and the inconvenience in use worsens.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective of an electronic device <b>100</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> simulates the keypad <b>113</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> being hidden. The electronic device <b>100</b>, such as a touch phone or a personal digital assistant (PDA) phone, comprises a touch screen <b>110</b> and a processing unit <b>120</b>. The touch screen <b>110</b> of the electronic device <b>100</b> is used for showing an input field <b>111</b>, a search list <b>112</b>, and a keypad <b>113</b> under a dialing mode. The keypad <b>113</b> is used for inputting an item of data Dt to the input field <b>111</b>. The search list <b>112</b> generated according to the data Dt has m records. In the present embodiment of the application, when the user inputs a number or characters, the telephone number or the contact name in the contact list and/or the call history matching with the inputted number and or the inputted characters is searched so as to generate a search list <b>112</b>. In the present embodiment of the application, m is exemplified by 5, and the search list <b>112</b> has 5 records, namely records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the input field <b>111</b>, the search list <b>112</b>, and the keypad <b>113</b> are shown on the touch screen <b>110</b> at the same time, the user can only view n records of the search list <b>112</b> on the touch screen <b>110</b>, wherein n is a positive integer smaller than m. For example, the user only can view 2 records (n=2), namely records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>). By dragging down a scroll bar <b>115</b> or using a down-shift key (not illustrated), the user can one by one view other records such as records <b>112</b>(<b>3</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Or, the user needs to touch a software or a hardware key (not illustrated) to close the keypad <b>113</b> in order to view more records such as records <b>112</b>(<b>3</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>). However, the above mentioned manners for viewing the records provide low efficiency and increase inconvenience to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A keypad automatically hiding method, an electronic device, and a digital data storage medium are provide in the application to resolve the above problems. The processing unit <b>120</b> is coupled to the touch screen <b>110</b>. Meanwhile, the processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> when an input signal for checking the search list <b>112</b>, which implies that the user would like to check the data of the search list <b>112</b>, is generated. The processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> by controlling the keypad <b>113</b> to fly out from the bottom of the touch screen <b>110</b>. Thus, the available area on the touch screen <b>110</b> for showing the search list <b>112</b> is increased, so that the user can view more records on the touch screen <b>110</b>. For example, the user can view records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) at the same time, hence increasing the efficiency of viewing the records and improving the convenience in use.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present embodiment of the application, the keypad <b>113</b> is a number keypad or an alphabetical keypad for example. Besides, the data Dt is an inputted string <b>114</b>. The inputted string <b>114</b>, for example, is a telephone number or a contact name inputted by the user by pressing the number keypad, an alphabetical keypad, or a keypad combining a number keypad and an alphabetical. The records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) are generated according to the inputted string <b>114</b>. For example, if the inputted telephone number is &#x201c;0920,&#x201d; the records are any telephone numbers in a contact list and/or a call history of the electronic device <b>100</b> that match &#x201c;0920.&#x201d; For example, if the inputted contact name is &#x201c;chen,&#x201d; the records are any contact names in a contact list and/or a call history of the electronic device <b>100</b> that match &#x201c;chen.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, when the input signal is generated in one of the records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) and is used for checking one of the records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>), the processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b>. However, in other embodiments, the processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> when the input signal for checking record is generated in a record which is not shown on the current screen unless the user drags down the scroll bar <b>115</b> or presses a down-shift key. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the touch screen <b>110</b> shows the input field <b>111</b>, the 1st to the n-th record (n=2), and the keypad <b>113</b>. The processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> when the input signal is generated in the n-th record and is moved to the (n+1)-th record (n+1=3). That is, the processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> when the input signal is generated in the record <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>) and moved to the record <b>112</b>(<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, the processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> again when an input signal for leaving the search list <b>112</b>, which implies that the user does not need to check the search list <b>112</b>, is generated. For example, when the input signal is generated in the last one record <b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) and is a downward signal by pressing a down-arrow navigation key <b>130</b>, the processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> and the input signal is moved to the input filed <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The user can generate the input signal by utilizing a navigation key <b>130</b> for example. In an embodiment of the application, the input signal can be circulatingly generated between the input field <b>111</b> and the records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) of the search list <b>112</b>. The processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> on the touch screen <b>110</b> accordingly when the input signal is generated in the input field <b>111</b>, which implies that the user would like to input data to the input field <b>111</b> by utilizing the keypad <b>113</b>. For example, when the input signal is generated in the 1st record <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>) and is an upward signal by pressing an up-arrow navigation key <b>130</b>, processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> and the input signal is moved to the input field <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment of the application, when the input signal is moved to a record of the search list <b>112</b>, the background color of the current record is different from that of other records.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, in an embodiment of the application, the touch screen <b>110</b> is further used for showing a keypad access key <b>116</b>. When the keypad access key <b>116</b> is activated, the processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> on the touch screen <b>110</b>. Thus, the user can instantly show the keypad <b>113</b> by pressing the keypad access key <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flowchart of a method for automatically hiding keypad according to an embodiment of the application. In the present embodiment of the application, the method for automatically hiding keypad uses the electronic device <b>100</b> to execute the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but the application is not limited thereto. Anyone who is skilled in the technology of the application will understand that the steps of the method for automatically hiding keypad and the order thereof can be modified or adjusted according to actual needs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Firstly, the method begins at step S<b>310</b>, the electronic device enters a dialing mode. Next, as indicated in step S<b>320</b>, an input field <b>111</b> and a keypad <b>113</b> are shown on a touch screen <b>110</b>. Next, an item of data Dt is received from the keypad <b>113</b> and inputted to the input field <b>111</b>. The input field <b>111</b> has an inputted string <b>114</b>. A search list <b>112</b> having five records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>112</b>(<b>5</b>) is shown on the touch screen <b>110</b> according to the inputted string <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Then, the method proceeds to step S<b>330</b>, the processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> when an input signal for checking the search list <b>112</b> is generated. In step S<b>330</b>, the processing unit <b>120</b> hides the keypad <b>113</b> when the input signal is generated in one of the records <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>) <b>112</b>(<b>5</b>). However, the processing unit <b>120</b> can hide the keypad <b>113</b> only when the input signal is generated in the record <b>112</b>(<b>2</b>) and moved to the record <b>112</b>(<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, the method proceeds to step S<b>340</b>, the processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> again when an input signal for leaving the search list <b>112</b>, which implies that the user does not need to check the search list <b>112</b>, is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, the method proceeds to step S<b>350</b>, the processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> on the touch screen <b>110</b> when the input signal is generated in the input field <b>111</b>, which implies that the user needs to input data again. For example, the input signal is a signal for leaving the search list <b>112</b> generated in the input field <b>111</b>. In step S<b>350</b>, the processing unit <b>120</b> shows the keypad <b>113</b> on the touch screen <b>110</b> when the input signal is a downward signal generated in the last record <b>112</b>(<b>5</b>). Furthermore, the processing unit <b>120</b> can also show the keypad <b>113</b> on the touch screen <b>110</b> when the input signal is an upward signal generated in the 1st record <b>112</b>(<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Or, the method proceeds to step S<b>360</b>, the keypad <b>113</b> is shown on the touch screen <b>110</b> when the keypad access key <b>116</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method for automatically hiding keypad can be compiled into programming codes and stored in a digital data storage medium executable on the electronic device <b>100</b>. The digital data storage medium, for example, is a secure digital (SD) card, a memory stick (MS) or a multimedia card (MMC), and has the above function of automatically hiding the keypad when executed on the electronic device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An electronic device, method for automatically hiding keypad, and a digital data storage medium are disclosed in above embodiments of the application. The processing unit hides the keypad shown on the touch screen when an input signal for checking the search list, which implies that the user would like to check the data of the search list, is generated, such as the telephone number or the contact name of the contact list and/or the call history. The keypad can be hidden when the input signal is generated in one of the many records of the search list or when the input signal is generated in a record that cannot be viewed unless the scroll bar is dragged down or the down-shift key is pressed. When the keypad is hidden, the available area on the touch screen for showing the search list is increased, and more records, such as telephone numbers and contact names, can be shown on the touch screen at the same time. Thus, the efficiency of viewing the records is increased and user's convenience in use is improved, and the user gains better experience in use and the product competiveness is increased. Furthermore, when the user does not find any useful telephone number or contact in the search list and would like to input a new item of inputted data, the input signal is generated in the input field and the keypad is shown on the touch screen to facilitate the user to input new item to the input field by utilizing the keypad. Also, the user can activate a keypad access key to show the keypad on the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the application has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the application is not limited thereto. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
