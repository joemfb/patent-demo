The second cam surface <b>642</b> selectably engages with the projections <b>58</b> or the first cam surface <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The shaft <b>70</b> extends through, in order, the receiving seat <b>20</b>, the control member <b>30</b>, the return elastic member <b>40</b>, the clutch member <b>50</b>, the follower <b>60</b>, the main elastic member <b>80</b>, and the sleeve <b>90</b>. The shaft <b>70</b> forms a first locking end <b>72</b> and a second locking end <b>74</b> at opposite ends thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sleeve <b>90</b> is a substantially hollow cylinder, and includes an open end <b>92</b> and a partially-closed end <b>94</b>. The partially-closed end <b>94</b> of the sleeve <b>90</b> defines a central hole <b>942</b>. Opposite portions of the sleeve <b>90</b> are protruded outward to from two inner lengthwise troughs <b>97</b>. The external surfaces of the troughs <b>97</b> engage with a cover section of the mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The washers <b>98</b> are respectively engaged with the first locking end <b>72</b> and the second end <b>74</b> of the shaft <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In assembly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 7</figref>, the control member <b>30</b> is received in the receiving seat <b>20</b>.

Accordingly, the hinge assembly <b>100</b> is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the mobile phone is closed, the peaks <b>6422</b> abut against the resisting surface <b>582</b> of the projections <b>58</b>. Because the control member <b>30</b> is engaged with the receiving seat <b>20</b> and the clutch member <b>50</b> is engaged with the control member <b>30</b>, the clutch member <b>50</b> cannot rotate relative to the receiving seat <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To open the mobile phone, a user presses and releases the button <b>10</b>. When pressed, the button <b>10</b> moves along an axial direction of the shaft <b>70</b>, the arms <b>122</b> of the button <b>10</b> then push the control member <b>30</b> to move away from the button <b>10</b> in the axial direction of the shaft <b>70</b>. The control member <b>30</b> moves along the axis until the extension arms <b>34</b> of the control member <b>30</b> move out of the limiting grooves <b>238</b> of the receiving seat <b>20</b>, compressing the return elastic member <b>40</b> toward the clutch member <b>50</b>. The peaks <b>6422</b> of the follower <b>60</b> rotate relative to the projections <b>58</b> until the peaks <b>6422</b> slide to the first cam surface <b>244</b>. Accordingly, the follower <b>50</b> automatically rotates relative to the receiving seat <b>20</b>. Rotation of the follower <b>60</b> causes the clutch member <b>50</b> to rotate until the projections <b>58</b> are received in the valleys <b>6424</b>. The elastic potential energy of the return elastic spring <b>40</b> then pushes the control member <b>30</b> to move toward the button <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the follower <b>60</b> rotates the sleeve <b>90</b> so that the cover section of the mobile phone is opened. When the mobile phone is closed, the cover section rotates the sleeve <b>90</b>. The second cam surface <b>642</b> rotates relative to the first cam surface <b>244</b> until contacting the projections <b>58</b> of the clutch member <b>50</b> and parting from the first cam surface <b>244</b>. Thus, the hinge assembly is completely closed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, the present embodiment provides a hinge assembly <b>100</b> for use with various portable devices, beyond the mobile phone illustrated, and/or with other devices needing a hinge assembly that facilitates the achievement of fully open and fully closed positions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is believed that the present embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that different changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being preferred or exemplary embodiments of the disclosure.</p>
