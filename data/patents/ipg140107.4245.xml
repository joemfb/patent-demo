<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A switching power supply apparatus includes a low-side switching control unit and a high-side switching control unit. The low-side switching control unit includes a low-side turn-off circuit that turns off a low-side switching element behind a delay time when reversal of the polarity of a winding voltage of a transformer is detected during a period in which a drive voltage signal is supplied to the low-side switching element. The high-side switching control unit includes a high-side turn-on delay circuit that delays a time from the time when the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer is reversed to a time when a high-side switching element is turned on. The delay time of the low-side turn-off delay circuit is set so as to be shorter than the delay time of the high-side turn-on delay circuit.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to switching power supply apparatuses and, more particularly, to a resonance-type switching power supply apparatus using resonance to perform a power conversion operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 9-308243 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-332232 each disclose a resonance-type switching power supply apparatus using resonance to perform a power conversion operation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the switching power supply apparatuses adopting current resonance converters, which use resonance for their power conversion operation, for example, switching frequencies are varied in order to control output voltages. In such a switching power supply apparatus, a resonant inductor Lr and a resonant capacitor Cr compose a first LC resonant circuit and an excitation inductor Lm of a primary winding of a transformer, the resonant inductor Lr, and the resonant capacitor Cr compose a second LC resonant circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Provided that the switching frequency is denoted by fs, the resonant frequency of the first LC resonant circuit is denoted by fr, and the resonant frequency of the second LC resonant circuit is denoted by fm, a relationship fm&#x3c;fr&#x3c;fs is established during the normal operation. The switching frequency fs is increased to decrease the output voltage in light load while the switching frequency fs is decreased to increase the output voltage in heavy load. Under the above frequency magnitude relationship, the switching power supply apparatus operates in a &#x201c;current delay phase&#x201d; in which the current flowing through the primary winding of the transformer is delayed in phase from the voltage applied to the primary winding thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the switching frequency fs is decreased with the increasing load and the switching power supply apparatus enters a state in which a resonance condition is not met (an &#x201c;out-of-resonance&#x201d; state) if fs&#x3c;fm&#x3c;fr. In other words, the relationship in which the switching frequency fs is lower than the resonant frequency corresponds to a state in which the transformer appears as a capacitive impedance from the primary side circuit and the current waveform is advanced in phase from the waveform of the voltage applied to the primary winding of the transformer. In this case, a period in which a low-side switching element and a high-side switching element are simultaneously turned on (a so-called arm short circuit) occurs and there is a problem in that excessive current flows through the two switching elements to cause heavy loss.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Specifically, in the above state in which the current waveform is advanced in phase from the voltage waveform, after the low-side switching element is turned off, the high-side switching element is turned on with a dead time sandwiched between the turn-off of the low-side switching element and the turn-on of the high-side switching element. However, when the high-side switching element is turned on in a state in which the polarity of the current flowing through the low-side switching element has already been reversed (the current flows through a body diode of the low-side switching element), the high-side switching element conducts in a state in which the body diode of the low-side switching element conducts due to delay in blocking caused by reverse recovery characteristics of the body diode to cause the arm short circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Since it is not possible to perform zero voltage switching (ZVS) (soft switching) in the state in which the current waveform is advanced in phase from the voltage waveform, there is a problem in that the switching loss is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The switching power supply apparatuses in which the &#x201c;out-of-resonance&#x201d; state is prevented are disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 9-308243 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-332232. In the above switching power supply apparatuses, the switching elements are controlled so that current flowing through the transformer or current flowing through the switching elements is detected and the value of the detected current is compared with a predetermined value to prevent the &#x201c;out-of-resonance&#x201d; state.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since it is necessary to constantly monitor the current flowing through the transformer or the current flowing through the switching elements in the switching power supply apparatuses disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 9-308243 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-332232, there are problems in that not only the loss is increased but also the power supply apparatuses are increased in size due to the circuit configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Although a method of setting the switching frequency fs to a higher value in advance in order to avoid relationship fs&#x3c;fm is available, this method does not support a case in which the input voltage is low and the output voltage is high or a case in which there is great variability among the transformer and electronic components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a compact switching power supply apparatus having no arm short circuit and no increase in loss.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a switching power supply apparatus includes a power supply voltage receiving unit that receives an input power supply voltage; a direct current voltage outputting unit that outputs a direct current voltage; a transformer that includes a primary winding and a secondary winding; a low-side switching element that is connected in series to the primary winding to apply the voltage of the power supply voltage receiving unit to the primary winding in response to turning on of the low-side switching element; a high-side switching element having a ground level that is different from that of the low-side switching element; and a switching control circuit that includes a low-side switching control unit that is programmed to control the low-side switching element and a high-side switching control unit that is programmed to control the high-side switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The low-side switching control unit includes a winding voltage polarity reversal detection circuit, a low-side turn-off circuit, and a low-side turn-off delay circuit. The winding voltage polarity reversal detection circuit detects reversal of a polarity of a winding voltage of the transformer. The low-side turn-off circuit turns off the low-side switching element when the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer is detected by the winding voltage polarity reversal detection circuit during a period in which a drive voltage signal is supplied to the low-side switching element. The low-side turn-off delay circuit determines a delay time from a time when the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer is reversed to a time when the low-side switching element is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The high-side switching control unit includes a high-side turn-on delay circuit that delays a time from the time when the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer is reversed to a time when the high-side switching element is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The delay time of the low-side turn-off delay circuit is preferably set to be shorter than the delay time of the high-side turn-on delay circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The transformer preferably includes a low-side drive winding. The winding voltage polarity reversal detection circuit preferably detects a voltage of the low-side drive winding to detect the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The winding voltage polarity reversal detection circuit preferably compares the voltage of the low-side drive winding with a predetermined reference voltage to detect the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The low-side switching control unit preferably includes a blanking control unit that is programmed to set a blanking period during which the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer is not detected after a pulse to drive the low-side switching element is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The transformer preferably includes a high-side drive winding. The high-side switching control unit is preferably controlled to supply a voltage occurring at the high-side drive winding to a control terminal of the high-side switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The high-side turn-on delay circuit preferably includes an impedance circuit connected in series to the control terminal of the high-side switching element and an input capacitance existing at the control terminal of the high-side switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The impedance circuit preferably has different impedances depending on the direction of current.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The switching control circuit preferably includes an integrated circuit including a first control unit that is programmed to generate a signal to drive the low-side switching element and a second control unit that is programmed to generate a signal to drive the high-side switching element.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer turns on the high-side switching element behind a first delay time. However, a second delay time before the low-side switching element is turned off preferably is shorter than the first delay time. Accordingly, when the polarity of the winding voltage of the transformer is reversed, the low-side switching element is forcedly turned off to cause a resonant frequency to be lower than a switching frequency. In other words, the switching frequency is prevented from being lower than the resonant frequency and the impedance of the resonant circuit is made inductive to meet the resonance condition, thereby enabling the zero voltage switching (ZVS). As a result, it is possible to prevent the arm short circuit between the high-side switching element and the low-side switching element to prevent heavy loss from occurring due to simultaneous conduction of the two switching elements.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Preferred Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exemplary circuit diagram of a switching power supply apparatus <b>101</b> according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The voltage of an input power Vi is input between input terminals PI(+) and PI(&#x2212;) of the switching power supply apparatus <b>101</b>. A certain direct current voltage Vo is supplied to a load connected between output terminals PO(+) and PO(&#x2212;) of the switching power supply apparatus <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A first series circuit is provided between the input terminals PI(+) and PI(&#x2212;). The first series circuit preferably includes a resonant capacitor Cr, a resonant inductor Lr, a primary winding np of a transformer T, and a low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> that are connected in series to each other. The resonant inductor Lr is a leakage inductance of the transformer T or an inductor connected to the primary winding np of the transformer T, separately from the leakage inductance. The low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> preferably is a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and a drain terminal of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is connected to the primary winding np of the transformer T.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A second series circuit in which a high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>, the resonant capacitor Cr, and the resonant inductor Lr are connected in series to each other is connected to both ends of the primary winding np of the transformer T.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A first rectification smoothing circuit including diodes Ds and Df and a capacitor Co is provided at the side of secondary windings ns<b>1</b> and ns<b>2</b> of the transformer T. The first rectification smoothing circuit performs full-wave rectification and smoothing to an alternating current voltage output from the secondary windings ns<b>1</b> and ns<b>2</b> and supplies the alternating current voltage subjected to the full-wave rectification and smoothing to the output terminals PO(+) and PO(&#x2212;).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The transformer T includes a low-side drive winding nb<b>1</b> and a high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b>, in addition to the primary winding np and the secondary windings ns<b>1</b> and ns<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A low-side switching control unit <b>81</b> is provided for the low-side drive winding nb<b>1</b> of the transformer T. The low-side switching control unit <b>81</b> includes a rectification smoothing circuit including a diode Db and a capacitor Cb. A direct current voltage acquired by the rectification smoothing circuit is supplied to a VCC terminal of a switching control integrated circuit (IC) <b>84</b> as a power supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The switching control IC <b>84</b> preferably is a general-purpose switching control IC that includes an IS terminal (current detection terminal) and that operates in a current mode.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A feedback circuit is provided between the output terminals PO(+) and PO(&#x2212;) and the switching control IC <b>84</b>. Only a feedback path is simply illustrated using a single line feedback in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, a feedback signal is generated by comparison between a value resulting from voltage division of the output voltage Vo between the output terminals PO(+) and PO(&#x2212;) and a reference voltage and a feedback voltage is supplied to an FB terminal of the switching control IC <b>84</b> in an insulating state. The feedback voltage supplied to the FB terminal is increased with the decreasing output voltage Vo.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A series circuit including a constant current circuit CC<b>1</b> and a capacitor Cb<b>1</b> is connected to an OUT terminal of the switching control IC <b>84</b>. The series circuit is connected so that a charging voltage of the capacitor Cb<b>1</b> is supplied the IS terminal (the current detection terminal).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The OUT terminal of the switching control IC <b>84</b> is connected to a gate terminal of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> via a resistor R<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The switching control IC <b>84</b> includes a turn-off delay circuit and a voltage polarity reversal detection circuit that detects reversal of an input voltage into a ZT terminal. The voltage polarity reversal detection circuit includes a comparator that compares a reference voltage occurring in the voltage polarity reversal detection circuit with the voltage at the ZT terminal. When the output voltage from the comparator is in a low level, the OUT terminal is set to the low level behind a delay time td<b>1</b> caused by the turn-off delay circuit. This causes the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> to be turned off. When the output voltage from the comparator is in a high level, the OUT terminal is reversed into the high level when a delay time td<b>0</b> described below elapsed. This causes the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> to be turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The constant current circuit CC<b>1</b> charges the capacitor Cb<b>1</b> with constant current in response to the voltage of the OUT terminal of the switching control IC <b>84</b>. The comparator in the switching control IC <b>84</b> compares the voltage of the capacitor Cb<b>1</b> with the voltage at the FB terminal and, if the voltage at the IS terminal exceeds the voltage at the FB terminal, changes the voltage at the OUT terminal from the high level to the low level. Accordingly, the charging time of the capacitor Cb<b>1</b> is decreased with the decreasing voltage at the FB terminal. In other words, the on time of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is decreased to make the output voltage Vo constant.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A diode D<b>9</b> defines a discharge path of the electric charge of the capacitor Cb<b>1</b>. In other words, when the output voltage from the switching control IC <b>84</b> is in the low level (the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off), the electric charge of the capacitor Cb<b>1</b> is discharged via the diode D<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A circuit preferably including the switching control IC <b>84</b>, which is the current mode IC, the constant current circuit CC<b>1</b>, and the capacitor Cb<b>1</b> operates as a voltage-time conversion circuit in the above-described manner. The voltage of the feedback signal generated by detection of the output voltage Vo and comparison between the detected output voltage Vo and the reference voltage (target voltage) is converted by the voltage-time conversion circuit and the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on during the conversion time.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A high-side switching control unit <b>61</b> is provided between the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b> of the transformer T and the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>. Specifically, a first end of the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b> of the transformer T is connected to the connection point between the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> and the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> (a source terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>), and the high-side switching control unit <b>61</b> is connected between a second end of the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b> and a gate terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The high-side switching control unit <b>61</b> preferably is a bidirectional constant current circuit including a diode bridge rectification circuit and a constant current circuit CC<b>2</b>. The diode bridge rectification circuit preferably includes four diodes D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b>, and D<b>4</b>. The constant current circuit CC<b>2</b> is connected between the connection point between the diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>3</b> and the connection point between the diodes D<b>2</b> and D<b>4</b>, which are the output ends of the diode bridge rectification circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The high-side switching control unit <b>61</b> includes a turn-on delay circuit that delays the turn-on by a delay time td<b>2</b> described below with a resistor R<b>5</b> and the input capacitance (a gate-source capacitance) of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>. The turn-on delay circuit turns on the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> when the delay time td<b>2</b> elapsed since the voltage of the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b> is reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The high-side switching control unit <b>61</b> forcedly turns off the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> when the time equal to the on time of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> elapsed since the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Since a capacitor Cb<b>2</b> is charged and discharged with the constant current having the same current value, the base-emitter voltage Vbe of the transistor Q<b>3</b> has a constant slope. Accordingly, the on-time of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is equal to the on-time of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, TQ<b>1</b>ON(<b>1</b>) is equal to TQ<b>2</b>ON(<b>1</b>) because of the above operation. Also when the on-time of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is increased to TQ<b>1</b>ON(<b>2</b>), TQ<b>1</b>ON(<b>2</b>) is equal to TQ<b>2</b>ON(<b>2</b>) because of the above operation.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The on-time of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is varied in accordance with the variation in the on-time of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> in the above manner.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, in the switching power supply apparatus <b>101</b>, the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on using the timing when the voltage of the low-side drive winding nb<b>1</b> is reversed as a trigger.

The switching power supply apparatus <b>101</b> operates in the following manner over one cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The switching control IC <b>84</b> detects the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage occurring at the low-side drive winding nb<b>1</b> of the transformer T on the basis of the input voltage into the ZT terminal and turns on the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> behind the delay time td<b>0</b> from the time when the reversal of the polarity is detected.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The switching control IC <b>84</b> turns off the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> at a time generated by a signal voltage based on the feedback signal (Feedback) to control the output voltage Vo.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the turn-off of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> causes the input capacitance (the gate-source capacitance) of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> to be charged with the winding voltage occurring at the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b>, the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on.

The waveform of the drain current during a period from t<b>0</b> to t<b>1</b> is a current waveform based on the series resonance of the resonant inductor Lr (including the leakage inductance of the primary winding np) having a relatively low inductance value and the resonant capacitor Cr. The waveform of the drain current during a period from t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b> is a current waveform based on the series resonance of the resonant inductor Lr, the excitation inductor Lm of the transformer T, and the resonant capacitor Cr.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In a situation in which the switching frequency fs is made lower than the resonant frequency fm to cause the &#x201c;out-of-resonance&#x201d; state, the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on after the drain current of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is made negative (in a state in which current flows through a body diode of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, because the current phase is advanced in the manner described above.

Specifically, the delay time td<b>1</b> and the delay time td<b>2</b> are determined so that a condition to make the delay time td<b>1</b> from the time when the reversal of the polarity of the winding voltage occurring at the low-side drive winding nb<b>1</b> is detected to the time when the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off shorter than the delay time td<b>2</b> from the time when the input capacitance into the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is charged to the time when the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on (td<b>1</b>&#x3c;td<b>2</b>) is met.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, in the out-of-resonance state, the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off before the voltage Vis reaches a value Vfb, as shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, although the output voltage is made lower than a predetermined value, the converter continues the operation to keep the supply of the output power without the arm short circuit, for example, even in a state in which the supply of the voltage of the input power Vi is blocked to make the voltage of the input power Vi lower than a predetermined voltage. As a result, it is possible to safely stop the converter without the arm short circuit even when the supply of the voltage of the input power Vi is blocked. In addition, it is possible to make the time during which the output voltage is kept long even against instantaneous power failure or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, the resonance condition is prevented from not being met because of the switching frequency fs that is made lower than the resonant frequency fm. In addition, even in a transient operational state such as startup, stop, or output short circuit, the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is not turned on before the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned off on the basis of the feedback signal even if the winding voltage of the transformer is reversed after the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is turned on. In other words, it is possible to prevent an occurrence of the arm short circuit to prevent the loss from being increased due to the breakdown of the switching power supply apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The switching control IC <b>84</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a circuit to set a blanking period. Specifically, the input into the ZT terminal is masked during a certain period (during a blanking period that is set) after a pulse to drive the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> is generated. Setting the blanking period during which the polarity of the winding voltage is not detected prevents malfunction, for example, turn-on of the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> with a noise signal from occurring during the blanking period even if the switching noise, which is a signal causing the low-side switching element Q<b>1</b> to be turned on, is input into the ZT terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The delay circuit that generates the delay time td<b>2</b> may preferably include the resistor R<b>5</b> (impedance circuit) connected in series to a control terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> and the input capacitance existing at the gate terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> to decrease the number of components, thereby reducing the switching power supply apparatus in size.</p>

A series circuit including Zener diodes ZD<b>1</b> and ZD<b>2</b> and a capacitor Cg<b>2</b> are connected between the gate and the source of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>. The remaining configuration in the high-side switching control unit is the same as in the high-side switching control unit <b>61</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The impedance circuit connected between the output of the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b> and the control terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> and the capacitor Cg<b>2</b> define a turn-on delay circuit for the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The capacitor Cg<b>2</b> is charged with the winding voltage occurring at the high-side drive winding nb<b>2</b> and the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is turned on if the voltage between the gate and the source of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> exceeds a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Since a series circuit including the diode D<b>6</b> and the resistor R<b>6</b> is connected in parallel to the resistor R<b>5</b>, the rising of the gate voltage of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> is set by the parallel impedance of the resistors R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b> and the falling thereof is dominantly set by the impedance of only the resistor R<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The capacitor Cg<b>1</b> controls the voltage value between the gate and the source of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> by capacitive voltage division with the capacitor Cg<b>2</b>. The Zener diodes ZD<b>1</b> and ZD<b>2</b> limit the maximum variation width of the voltage value between the gate and the source of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to the second preferred embodiment, since the impedance circuit, which is included in the turn-on delay circuit of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>, is varied in impedance in accordance with the direction of the current, it is possible to separately adjust the turn-on speed and the turn-off speed of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Since the impedance circuit preferably includes the series circuit including the capacitor Cg<b>1</b> and the resistors R<b>5</b> and R<b>6</b>, adjustment of the capacitance value of the capacitor Cg<b>1</b> allows the division ratio with the input capacitance existing at the gate terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b> to be adjusted to apply an appropriate control gate voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since the inductor Lg is provided in the impedance circuit, high-frequency surge current is suppressed to prevent excessive voltage from being applied to the gate terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the Zener diodes ZD<b>1</b> and ZD<b>2</b> are bidirectionally connected in parallel between the gate and the source of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>, it is possible to prevent excessive voltage from being applied to the gate terminal of the high-side switching element Q<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the configuration in which one end of the resonant capacitor Cr is connected to the input terminal PI(&#x2212;) at the negative voltage side of the input power Vi, shunting the current flowing through the resonant capacitor Cr with another capacitor Ca connected and detecting the shunt current with a resistor Ra allows an overcurrent protection circuit that performs an overcurrent protection operation in consideration of the current corresponding to the resonant current flowing through the resonant capacitor Cr to be provided. In this case, compared with a case in which a detection resistor is provided in the power conversion circuit to detect overcurrent, it is possible to eliminate the loss in the detection resistor. In other words, the detection of the sufficiently small shunt current allows the loss concerning the detection to be reduced, compared with a case in which the resonant current flowing through the power conversion circuit is directly detected. As a result, it is possible to provide an overcurrent protection circuit having small power loss to perform the overcurrent protection operation.</p>

In the sixth preferred embodiment, diodes Da<b>1</b> and Da<b>2</b> are preferably used to provide a circuit similar to a voltage doubler circuit and only the current flowing through the diode Da<b>2</b> is detected to provide the overcurrent protection circuit that performs the overcurrent protection operation.
