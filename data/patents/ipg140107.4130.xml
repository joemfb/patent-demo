<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A beam modifying unit increases both temporal pulse length and Etendue of an illumination beam. The pulse modifying unit receives an input pulse of radiation and emits one or more corresponding output pulses of radiation. A beam splitter divides the incoming pulse into a first and a second pulse portion, and directs the first pulse portion along a second optical path and the second portion along a first optical path as a portion of an output beam. The second optical path includes a divergence optical element. A first and a second mirror, each with a radius of curvature, are disposed facing each other with a predetermined separation, and receive the second pulse portion to redirect the second portion, such that the optical path of the second portion through the pulse modifier is longer than that of the first portion, and the separation is less than radius of curvature.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to lithography, and more particularly to illumination pulse modification.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lithography is widely recognized as a key process in manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) as well as other devices and/or structures. A lithographic apparatus is a machine, used during lithography, which applies a desired pattern onto a substrate, such as onto a target portion of the substrate. During manufacture of ICs with a lithographic apparatus, a patterning device, which is alternatively referred to as a mask or a reticle, can be used to generate a circuit pattern to be formed on an individual layer in an IC. This pattern can be transferred onto the target portion (e.g., comprising part of, one, or several dies) on the substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer). Transfer of the pattern is typically via imaging onto a layer of radiation-sensitive material (e.g., resist) provided on the substrate. In general, a single substrate contains a network of adjacent target portions that are successively patterned.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known lithographic apparatus include steppers, in which each target portion is irradiated by exposing an entire pattern onto the target portion at one time, and scanners, in which each target portion is irradiated by scanning the pattern through a radiation beam in a given direction (the &#x201c;scanning&#x201d; direction) while synchronously scanning the substrate parallel or anti-parallel to this direction. It is also possible to transfer the pattern from the patterning device to the substrate by imprinting the pattern onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, an excimer laser is used to supply the lithographic apparatus with radiation in the form of pulsed beams of radiation, e.g., high intensity ultraviolet pulses. Large, expensive lens elements can degrade after receiving billions of the pulses. Optical damage can increase with increasing intensity (i.e., light power (energy/time) per cm<sup>2 </sup>or mJ/ns/cm<sup>2</sup>) of the pulses. The typical pulse length from these lasers is about 20 ns, so a 5 mJ laser pulse would have a pulse power intensity of about 0.25 mJ/ns (0.25 MW). Increasing the pulse energy to 10 mJ without changing the pulse duration would result a doubling of the power of the pulses to about 0.5 mJ/ns, which can significantly shorten the usable lifetime of the lens elements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Pulse stretchers can be configured for use with a lithographic apparatus to minimize optical damage and degradation by substantially increasing the pulse length. Increased pulse length is accomplished by creating copies of the pulse, where each copy is separated in time by using an optical delay.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Using known pulse stretching units can require an initial re-calibration of the lithographic apparatus. Also, the pulse stretching units can have no ability to control the size or direction of the beam without additional periodic calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, pulse stretching units can suffer from the generation of dynamic speckle. Speckle is a function of both the pulse duration as well as the Etendue of the beam. Speckle can be caused by a finite pulse length and limited spectral linewidth of partially coherent radiation from the laser. Speckle can cause a micro non-uniformity of the dose on the wafer resulting in a local variation of the size of the imaged features, often referred to as line width roughness (LWR). Speckle can be reduced by stretching the pulse duration over a period of time or by increasing the Etendue of the beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Given the foregoing, what is needed is an improved method, apparatus, and system to provide a pulse modifier that increases both temporal pulse length and Etendue of an illumination beam.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention include a pulse modifier with an adjustable Etendue comprising a beam splitter, a divergence optical element, and a first and second curved mirror. The beam splitter receives an input pulse of radiation and divides the input pulse into a first and a second pulse portion. The beam splitter directs the first pulse portion towards a divergence optical element, which diverts the first pulse portion by an angle resulting in a divergence wherein Etendue is increased. The beam splitter directs the second pulse portion as a portion of the output beam. A first mirror and a second mirror, each with a radius of curvature, face each other with a predetermined separation and receive the diverted first pulse portion and redirect the first pulse portion along the diverted beam path. The optical path of the first pulse portion through the pulse modifier is longer than that of the second pulse portion, resulting in a delay and stretching of the input pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another embodiment of the present invention includes a pulse modifier with an adjustable Etendue comprising a beam splitter, a divergence optical element, and a first and second curved mirror where the beam splitter and divergence optical elements are combined into a single element. The divergence/beam splitter receives an input pulse of radiation and divides the input pulse into a first and a second pulse portion and diverts the first pulse portion by an angle resulting in a divergence wherein Etendue is increased. The divergence/beam splitter directs the second pulse portion as a portion of the output beam. A first mirror and a second mirror, each with a radius of curvature, face each other with a predetermined separation and receive the diverted first pulse portion and redirect the first pulse portion along a beam path. The optical path of the first pulse portion through the pulse modifier is longer than that of the second pulse portion, resulting in a delay and stretching of the input pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another embodiment of the present invention a pulse modifier comprises a first and second beam splitter, a first and second divergence optical element, and a first and second curved mirror. The first divergence/beam splitter receives an input pulse of radiation and divides the input pulse into a first and a second pulse portion, directing the second portion of the beam towards the second beam splitter. The second beam splitter passes a fourth portion of the beam as at least a portion of the output beam. The first beam splitter redirects the first portion of the beam to a first divergence optical element that diverts the first pulse portion by an angle resulting in a divergence wherein Etendue is increased. The first divergence optical element is further produces a first beam path between the first and second reflecting devices where the first portion of the beam traverses between the first and second reflecting devices more than once. The second beam splitter redirects a third portion of the beam to a second divergence optical element that diverts the third pulse portion by an angle resulting in a divergence wherein Etendue is increased. The second divergence optical element further produces a second beam path between the first and second reflecting devices where the third portion of the beam traverses between the first and second reflecting devices more than once. After traversing between the first and second reflecting devices a portion of the first portion of the beam is reflected by the first beam splitter towards the second beam splitter while another portion of the first portion of the beam is passed through the first beam splitter. After traversing between the first and second reflecting devices a portion of the third portion of the beam is reflected by the second beam splitter and exits the system as a portion of an output beam while another portion of the third portion of the beam is passed through the second beam splitter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present invention further include a lithography system with a pulse modifier. The lithography system consists of an illumination system to condition a radiation beam for illumination of a patterning device, wherein the illumination system contains a pulse modifier. The pulse modifier includes a first and second beam splitter, a first and second divergence optical element, and a first and second curved mirror where the beam splitter and divergence optical elements are combined into a single element. The first divergence/beam splitter receives an input pulse of radiation and divides the input pulse into a first and a second pulse portion, directing the second portion of the beam towards the second divergence/beam splitter. The second divergence/beam splitter passes a fourth portion of the beam as at least a portion of the output beam. The first divergence/beam splitter is also configured to tilt and redirect the first portion of the beam to produce a first beam path between the first and second reflecting devices where the first portion of the beam traverses between the first and second reflecting devices more than once. The second divergence/beam splitter tilts and redirects a third portion of the beam to produce a second beam path between the first and second reflecting devices where the third portion of the beam traverses between the first and second reflecting devices more than once. After traversing between the first and second reflecting devices a portion of the first portion of the beam is reflected by the beam splitter towards the second beam splitter while another portion of the first portion of the beam is passed through the first beam splitter. After traversing between the first and second reflecting devices a portion of the third portion of the beam is reflected by the beam splitter and exits the system as a portion of an output beam while another portion of the third portion of the beam is passed through the beam splitter.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to a pulse modifier with adjustable Etendue. This specification discloses one or more embodiments that incorporate the features of the present invention. The disclosed embodiment(s) merely exemplify the invention. The scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment(s). The invention is defined by the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The embodiment(s) described, and references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; etc., indicate that the embodiment(s) described can include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment can not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is understood that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the present invention can be implemented in hardware, firmware, software, or any combination thereof. Embodiments of the present invention can also be implemented as instructions stored on a machine-readable medium, which can be read and executed by one or more processors. A machine-readable medium can include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computing device). For example, a machine-readable medium can include the following: read-only memory (ROM); random access memory (RAM); magnetic disk storage media; optical storage media; and, flash memory devices. Further, firmware, software, routines, instructions can be described herein as performing certain actions. However, it should be appreciated that such descriptions are merely for convenience and that such actions in fact result from computing devices, processors, controllers, or other devices executing the firmware, software, routines, instructions, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of a lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032;, respectively, in which embodiments of the present invention can be implemented. Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; each include the following: an illumination system (illuminator) IL configured to condition a radiation beam B (e.g., DUV or EUV radiation); a support structure (e.g., a mask table) MT configured to support a patterning device (e.g., a mask, a reticle, or a dynamic patterning device) MA and connected to a first positioner PM configured to accurately position the patterning device MA; and, a substrate table (e.g., a wafer table) WT configured to hold a substrate (e.g., a resist coated wafer) W and connected to a second positioner PW configured to accurately position the substrate W. Lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032; also have a projection system PS configured to project a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B by patterning device MA onto a target portion (e.g., comprising one or more dies) C of the substrate W. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, the patterning device MA and the projection system PS are reflective. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032;, the patterning device MA and the projection system PS are transmissive.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The illumination system IL can include various types of optical components, such as refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, electrostatic or other types of optical components, or any combination thereof, for directing, shaping, or controlling the radiation B.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The support structure MT holds the patterning device MA in a manner that depends on the orientation of the patterning device MA, the design of the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and other conditions, such as for example whether or not the patterning device MA is held in a vacuum environment. The support structure MT can use mechanical, vacuum, electrostatic, or other clamping techniques to hold the patterning device MA. The support structure MT can be a frame or a table, for example, which can be fixed or movable, as required. The support structure MT can ensure that the patterning device is at a desired position, for example, with respect to the projection system PS.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;patterning device&#x201d; MA should be broadly interpreted as referring to any device that can be used to impart a radiation beam B with a pattern in its cross-section, such as to create a pattern in the target portion C of the substrate W. The pattern imparted to the radiation beam B can correspond to a particular functional layer in a device being created in the target portion C, such as an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The patterning device MA can be transmissive (as in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) or reflective (as in lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Examples of patterning devices MA include reticles, masks, programmable mirror arrays, and programmable LCD panels. Masks are well known in lithography, and include mask types such as binary, alternating phase shift, and attenuated phase shift, as well as various hybrid mask types. An example of a programmable mirror array employs a matrix arrangement of small mirrors, each of which can be individually tilted so as to reflect an incoming radiation beam in different directions. The tilted mirrors impart a pattern in the radiation beam B which is reflected by the mirror matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term &#x201c;projection system&#x201d; PS can encompass any type of projection system, including refractive, reflective, catadioptric, magnetic, electromagnetic and electrostatic optical systems, or any combination thereof, as appropriate for the exposure radiation being used, or for other factors, such as the use of an immersion liquid or the use of a vacuum. A vacuum environment can be used for EUV or electron beam radiation since other gases can absorb too much radiation or electrons. A vacuum environment can therefore be provided to the whole beam path with the aid of a vacuum wall and vacuum pumps.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> and/or lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be of a type having two (dual stage) or more substrate tables (and/or two or more mask tables) WT. In such &#x201c;multiple stage&#x201d; machines, the additional substrate tables WT can be used in parallel, or preparatory steps can be carried out on one or more tables while one or more other substrate tables WT are being used for exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the illuminator IL receives a radiation beam from a radiation source SO. The source SO and the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be separate entities, for example, when the source SO is an excimer laser. In such cases, the source SO is not considered to form part of the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>&#x2032;, and the radiation beam B passes from the source SO to the illuminator IL with the aid of a beam delivery system BD (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) including, for example, suitable directing mirrors and/or a beam expander. In other cases, the source SO can be an integral part of the lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b>, <b>100</b>&#x2032;&#x2014;for example when the source SO is a mercury lamp. The source SO and the illuminator IL, together with the beam delivery system BD, if required, can be referred to as a radiation system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The illuminator IL can include an adjuster AD (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) for adjusting the angular intensity distribution of the radiation beam. Generally, at least the outer and/or inner radial extent (commonly referred to as &#x201c;&#x3c3;-outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x3c3;-inner,&#x201d; respectively) of the intensity distribution in a pupil plane of the illuminator can be adjusted. In addition, the illuminator IL can comprise various other components (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), such as an integrator IN and a condenser CO. The illuminator IL can be used to condition the radiation beam B to have a desired uniformity and intensity distribution in its cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, which is held on the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT, and is patterned by the patterning device MA. In lithographic apparatus <b>100</b>, the radiation beam B is reflected from the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA. After being reflected from the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the radiation beam B onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF<b>2</b> (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder, or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately (e.g., so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B). Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor IF<b>1</b> can be used to accurately position the patterning device (e.g., mask) MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B. Patterning device (e.g., mask) MA and substrate W can be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the radiation beam B is incident on the patterning device (e.g., mask MA), which is held on the support structure (e.g., mask table MT), and is patterned by the patterning device. Having traversed the mask MA, the radiation beam B passes through the projection system PS, which focuses the beam onto a target portion C of the substrate W. With the aid of the second positioner PW and position sensor IF (e.g., an interferometric device, linear encoder, or capacitive sensor), the substrate table WT can be moved accurately (e.g., so as to position different target portions C in the path of the radiation beam B). Similarly, the first positioner PM and another position sensor (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) can be used to accurately position the mask MA with respect to the path of the radiation beam B (e.g., after mechanical retrieval from a mask library or during a scan).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In general, movement of the mask table MT can be realized with the aid of a long-stroke module (coarse positioning) and a short-stroke module (fine positioning), which form part of the first positioner PM. Similarly, movement of the substrate table WT can be realized using a long-stroke module and a short-stroke module, which form part of the second positioner PW. In the case of a stepper (as opposed to a scanner) the mask table MT can be connected to a short-stroke actuator only or can be fixed. Mask MA and substrate W can be aligned using mask alignment marks M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> and substrate alignment marks P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>. Although the substrate alignment marks (as illustrated) occupy dedicated target portions, they can be located in spaces between target portions (known as scribe-lane alignment marks). Similarly, in situations in which more than one die is provided on the mask MA, the mask alignment marks can be located between the dies.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The lithographic apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>100</b>&#x2032; can be used in at least one of the following modes:</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">1. In step mode, the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are kept essentially stationary, while an entire pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C at one time (i.e., a single static exposure). The substrate table WT is then shifted in the X and/or Y direction so that a different target portion C can be exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">2. In scan mode, the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT and the substrate table WT are scanned synchronously while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C (i.e., a single dynamic exposure). The velocity and direction of the substrate table WT relative to the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT can be determined by the (de-)magnification and image reversal characteristics of the projection system PS.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">3. In another mode, the support structure (e.g., mask table) MT is kept substantially stationary holding a programmable patterning device, and the substrate table WT is moved or scanned while a pattern imparted to the radiation beam B is projected onto a target portion C. A pulsed radiation source SO can be employed and the programmable patterning device is updated as required after each movement of the substrate table WT or in between successive radiation pulses during a scan. This mode of operation can be readily applied to maskless lithography that utilizes a programmable patterning device, such as a programmable mirror array of a type as referred to herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Combinations and/or variations on the described modes of use or entirely different modes of use can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although specific reference can be made in this text to the use of lithographic apparatus in the manufacture of ICs, it should be understood that the lithographic apparatus described herein can have other applications, such as the manufacture of integrated optical systems, guidance and detection patterns for magnetic domain memories, flat-panel displays, liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), and thin-film magnetic heads. The skilled artisan will appreciate that, in the context of such alternative applications, any use of the terms &#x201c;wafer&#x201d; or &#x201c;die&#x201d; herein can be considered as synonymous with the more general terms &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; or &#x201c;target portion,&#x201d; respectively. The substrate referred to herein can be processed, before or after exposure, in for example a track (a tool that typically applies a layer of resist to a substrate and develops the exposed resist), a metrology tool, and/or an inspection tool. Where applicable, the disclosure herein can be applied to such and other substrate processing tools. Further, the substrate can be processed more than once, for example, in order to create a multi-layer IC, so that the term substrate used herein can also refer to a substrate that already contains multiple processed layers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a further embodiment, lithographic apparatus <b>100</b> includes an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) source, which is configured to generate a beam of EUV radiation for EUV lithography. In general, the EUV source is configured in a radiation system (see below), and a corresponding illumination system is configured to condition the EUV radiation beam of the EUV source.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiments described herein, the terms &#x201c;lens&#x201d; and &#x201c;lens element,&#x201d; where the context allows, can refer to any one or combination of various types of optical components, including refractive, reflective, magnetic, electromagnetic, and electrostatic optical components.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the terms &#x201c;radiation&#x201d; and &#x201c;beam&#x201d; used herein encompass all types of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation (e.g., having a wavelength &#x3bb; of 365, 248, 193, 157 or 126 nm), extreme ultraviolet (EUV or soft X-ray) radiation (e.g., having a wavelength in the range of 5-20 nm such as, for example, 13.5 nm), or hard X-ray working at less than 5 nm, as well as particle beams, such as ion beams or electron beams. Generally, radiation having wavelengths between about 780-3000 nm (or larger) is considered IR radiation. UV refers to radiation with wavelengths of approximately 100-400 nm. Within lithography, the term &#x201c;UV&#x201d; also applies to the wavelengths that can be produced by a mercury discharge lamp: G-line 436 nm; H-line 405 nm; and/or, I-line 365 nm. Vacuum UV, or VUV (i.e., UV absorbed by air), refers to radiation having a wavelength of approximately 100-200 nm. Deep UV (DUV) generally refers to radiation having wavelengths ranging from 126 nm to 428 nm, and in an embodiment, an excimer laser can generate DUV radiation used within a lithographic apparatus. It should be appreciated that radiation having a wavelength in the range of, for example, 5-20 nm relates to radiation with a certain wavelength band, of which at least part is in the range of 5-20 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is an illustration of a beam modifier <b>200</b> (e.g., an asymmetric beam modifier with adjustable Etendue), according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, beam modifier <b>200</b> includes a beam splitter <b>210</b>, a divergence optical element <b>230</b>, and first and second curved reflecting devices <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one example, the following beam path or cycle is traversed by at least one beam of radiation entering beam modifier <b>200</b>. Input pulse <b>201</b>A enters asymmetric beam modifier <b>200</b> along beam path <b>205</b>. For example, an example waveshape is shown graphed as <b>201</b>-In Graph. Input pulse <b>201</b>A is divided by beam splitter <b>210</b> into two pulse portions including reflected pulse portion <b>201</b>B and transmitted pulse portion <b>201</b>C. Portion <b>201</b>C exits asymmetric beam modifier <b>200</b> as a portion of output beam <b>201</b>-Output. Portion <b>201</b>B travels along beam path <b>211</b> towards divergence optical element <b>230</b>. Divergence optical element <b>230</b>, e.g., an optical wedge, diverges (e.g. tilts) portion <b>201</b>B so that portion <b>201</b>B travels along beam path <b>212</b>, diverging from beam path <b>211</b> by angle <b>235</b>. An angle of divergence from path <b>211</b> depends on an angle of divergence optical element <b>230</b>. Portion <b>201</b>D reflects from mirror <b>240</b> to travel along beam path <b>213</b>. Mirror <b>242</b> reflects portion <b>201</b>D to travel along beam path <b>214</b> to first mirror <b>240</b>. Portion <b>201</b>D reflects from mirror <b>240</b> to travel along beam path <b>215</b> to mirror <b>242</b>. Portion <b>201</b>D reflects from mirror <b>242</b> and travels back to beam splitter <b>210</b> along beam path <b>216</b>. Portion <b>201</b>D is divided by beam splitter <b>210</b>. The reflected part of portion <b>201</b>D again forms part of <b>201</b>-Output.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this example, portion <b>201</b>D is delayed in time because it travels along a longer beam path than portion <b>201</b>C. Also, the reflected part of portion <b>201</b>D added to <b>201</b>-Output has lower intensity than <b>201</b>C pulse portion.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one example, the transmitted part of portion <b>201</b>D can then repeat the cycle. In each cycle pass divergence optical element <b>230</b> further tilts the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment, as there is only a single divergence optical element <b>230</b>, and therefore <b>201</b>-Output is asymmetric.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reflective surfaces of two curved mirrors <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> face each other. The curved mirrors are separated by a predetermined distance or separation, for example the distance or separation can be approximately equal to the radius of curvature of each curved mirror. For example, curved mirrors <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> form a confocal mirror with a radius of curvature of 2d, where d is the separation distance between mirrors <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>. In one example, curved mirrors <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> are configured to reimage a portion of the beam at beam splitter <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one example, beam splitter <b>210</b> can be configured to any desired ratio of reflection to transmission. For example, when using a 60R/40T (60% reflection and 40% transmissions) beam splitter <b>210</b> with negligible loss, portion <b>201</b>B represents 60% of input pulse <b>201</b>A, while portion <b>201</b>C represents 40% of input pulse <b>201</b>A. In this example, <b>201</b>-Ouput is produced from a series of time delayed, intensity reduced, and tilted series of pulses. After a first cycle, portion <b>201</b>C is about 60% of the intensity of input pulse <b>201</b>A. After an optional second cycle, <b>201</b>-Output is about 24% of the of the intensity of original input pulse <b>201</b>A. Similarly, a third cycle generates about 9.6%, a fourth cycle generates about 3.9%, and a fifth cycle generates about 1.5% of the original intensity of <b>201</b>A. Therefore, after a certain number of pulses, the intensity of <b>201</b>A can completely dissipate.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one example, a time delay between the pulses which constitute <b>201</b>-Output is based on path length of beam paths <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>216</b>. Some of the beam paths are defined by the separation between mirrors <b>240</b> and <b>242</b>. The separation can be designed to allow for overlapping, adjacent, or separated output pulses. The result of such time delays between the pulses that are used to produce <b>201</b>-Output is a increase in the temporal pulse of an illumination beam.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A relative intensity of the output pulses with respect to the input pulse and with respect to each other is influenced by the reflection/transmission ratio of beam splitter <b>210</b>. A degree of divergence is a function of the degree of tilt in the divergence optical element, which can also be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a shape of an input pulse, such as input pulse <b>201</b>A, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates a shape of a corresponding output beam, such as <b>201</b>-Output, with an asymmetrical divergence shown on the right side of the Output Pulses, according to an embodiment of the invention. In this manner, the divergence of the beam is increased without decreasing the beam size, thus increasing the Etendue.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In lithography, speckle is a function of both the pulse duration and the Etendue of the beam. Therefore, by increasing the time delay between output pulses, as well as the Etendue, as described in the above embodiment, speckle can be substantially reduced and/or eliminated by stretching the pulse duration over a period of time and/or by increasing the Etendue of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of a beam modifier <b>300</b>, according to an embodiment of the invention. For example, beam modifier <b>300</b> can be an asymmetric beam modifier with adjustable Etendue using a combined beam splitter and divergence optical element <b>325</b>. Beam modifier <b>300</b> operates similarly to beam modifier <b>200</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, a beam splitter function is combined with the divergence function through element <b>325</b>. Beam modifier <b>300</b> also includes reflecting devices <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one example, an cycle of a beam traveling through beam modifier includes input pulse <b>301</b>A traveling along beam path <b>305</b>, which is divided and diverged by element <b>325</b>. Input pulse <b>301</b>A is divided into two pulse portions consisting of diverged and reflected pulse portion <b>301</b>D and transmitted pulse portion <b>301</b>C. Element <b>325</b> tilts the reflected pulse portion of input pulse <b>301</b>A to generate a diverged and reflected portion <b>301</b>D, which is tilted by an angle <b>315</b> along beam path <b>311</b>. Portion <b>301</b>D reflects from mirror <b>340</b>, travels along beam path <b>313</b>, reflects from mirror <b>342</b>, travels along beam path <b>314</b>, reflects from mirror <b>340</b>, travels along beam path <b>315</b>, reflects from mirror <b>342</b>, and travels back to element splitter <b>325</b>. Portion <b>301</b>D is again divided by element <b>325</b>. The reflected part of portion <b>301</b>D again forms part of to <b>301</b>-Output. In one example, the transmitted part of portion <b>301</b>D repeats the cycle, and further contributes to <b>301</b>-Output.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As discussed above, as portion <b>301</b>D travels along a longer beam path than pulse portion <b>301</b>C, pulse portion <b>301</b>D is delayed in time. Also, as described above, as the reflected part of portion <b>301</b>D is again split by element <b>325</b>, the reflected part of portion <b>301</b>D that is added to <b>301</b>-Output has a lower intensity than portion <b>301</b>C. As further discussed above, after a certain number of cycles, the original energy of pulse <b>301</b>A is substantially completely dissipated.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, as there is only a single element <b>325</b>, the <b>301</b>-Output is asymmetric. These attributes will not be repeated for systems discussed below, although a skilled artisan will understand that any systems discussed below can also have these attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one example, a beam splitting functionality of element <b>325</b> can be configured to any desired ratio of reflection to transmission. If, for example, a 60R/40T (60% reflection and 40% transmissions) beam splitting characteristic is used for element <b>325</b>, and assuming negligible loss at element <b>325</b>, portion <b>301</b>D represents 60% of input pulse <b>301</b>A, while transmitted pulse portion <b>301</b>C represents 40% of input pulse <b>301</b>A. These attributes will not be repeated for systems discussed below, although a skilled artisan will understand that any systems discussed below can also have these attributes.</p>
