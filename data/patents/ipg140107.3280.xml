<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter shown and described in the present application relates to microelectronic image sensors and methods of fabricating, e.g., microelectronic image sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Solid state image sensors, e.g. charge-coupled devices, (&#x201c;CCD&#x201d;) arrays, have a myriad of applications. For instance, they may be used to capture images in digital cameras, camcorders, cameras of cell phones and the like. One or more light detecting elements on a chip, along with the necessary electronics, are used to capture a &#x201c;pixel&#x201d; or a picture element, a basic unit of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Improvements can be made to the structure of solid state image sensors and the processes used to fabricate them.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with one embodiment, a microelectronic unit may include a semiconductor element having a front surface and a rear surface remote from the front surface, and a packaging layer attached to the front surface of the semiconductor element. The semiconductor element may include a light detector, which includes a plurality of light detector elements arranged in an array, disposed adjacent to the front surface and aligned with a portion of the rear surface to receive light through the rear surface portion, and a conductive contact at the front surface connected to the light detector. The conductive contact may include a thin region having a first thickness and a thicker region having a second thickness that is thicker than the first thickness. A conductive interconnect may extend through the packaging layer to the thin region of the conductive contact, and at least a portion of the conductive interconnect is exposed at a surface of the microelectronic unit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a method of fabricating a microelectronic unit may include forming a recessed portion extending through a packaging layer attached to a front surface of a semiconductor element and terminating at a thin region of a conductive contact. The conductive contact is disposed at the front surface of the semiconductor element. The semiconductor element has a rear surface remote from the front surface and includes a light detector including a plurality of light detector elements arranged in an array. The light detector is disposed adjacent to the front surface, connected to the conductive contact and aligned with a portion of the rear surface to receive light through the rear surface portion. In addition, the conductive contact has a first thickness at the thin region and includes a thicker region having a second thickness that is thicker than the first thickness. The method further may include forming a conductive interconnect extending through the recessed portion to connect to the conductive contact at the thin region, where at least a portion of the conductive interconnect is exposed at a surface of the microelectronic unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another embodiment, a microelectronic unit may include a semiconductor element having a front surface, a rear surface remote from the front surface and a region consisting essentially of semiconductor material disposed between the front and rear surfaces. A first packaging layer may be attached to the front surface of the semiconductor element. The semiconductor element may include a light detector, which includes a plurality of light detector elements arranged in an array, disposed adjacent to the front surface and aligned with a portion of the rear surface to receive light through the rear surface portion. A conductive contact at the front surface is connected to the light detector. A packaging assembly having a second packaging layer may be attached to the rear surface of the semiconductor element. A conductive interconnect may extend through the first packaging layer, through the conductive contact and into the second packaging layer, and is connected to the conductive contact. The conductive interconnect is electrically isolated from the semiconductor region, and at least a portion of the conductive interconnect is exposed at a surface of the microelectronic unit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, an isolation region in the semiconductor element completely circumscribes the conductive contact so as to electrically isolate the conductive contact from the semiconductor region.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment of the present invention, a wafer level package assembly is disclosed having a back side illuminated image sensor. U.S. Pat. No. 6,646,289, which is hereby incorporated by reference, discloses integrated circuit devices employing a thin silicon substrate. Optronic components are formed on a surface facing away from a corresponding transparent protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As discussed in the '289 patent, the thinness of the silicon allows for the optronic components to be exposed to light impinging via the transparent protective layer. Color filters may be formed on an inner surface of the protective layer. Further, an array of microlenses may also be disposed on an inner surface of the protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method of fabricating a back side illuminated image sensor will now be described with reference to sectional views illustrating respective stages of fabrication in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-through</figref> <b>1</b>O. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in a preliminary stage of fabrication before a packaging process is performed, a semiconductor material wafer <b>10</b> is provided, and a process stop layer <b>12</b> is disposed on a surface <b>11</b> of the wafer <b>10</b>. The wafer <b>10</b> may consist essentially of silicon, and alternatively may include other semiconductor materials such as, for example, germanium (Ge), carbon (C), alloys or combinations of silicon with such material or one or more III-V compound semiconductor materials, each being a compound of a Group III element with a Group V element of the periodic table. In one embodiment, the layer <b>12</b> can have a thickness of about 1-5 &#x3bc;m and consist essentially of silicon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a semiconductor device wafer <b>14</b> made from the same or similar materials as the wafer <b>10</b> is joined with the wafer <b>10</b> at exposed surface <b>15</b> of the layer <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, after the wafers <b>10</b> and <b>14</b> are joined, the thickness of the wafer <b>14</b> is reduced, such as by grinding or smart cutting of the wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The wafer <b>14</b> includes an active semiconductor layer or an active region which can consist essentially of silicon. Although not shown in the drawings <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1O</figref>, the wafer <b>14</b> includes a plurality of adjoining dies, each constituting an image sensing region. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, each sensing region includes an image sensor <b>17</b> formed in the active region. The image sensor includes a plurality of light detector elements typically arranged in an array to form one or more picture elements (pixels) for capturing an image cast thereon via light in directions normal to front or back surfaces of the wafer <b>14</b>. In one example, the image sensor can be a charge-coupled device (&#x201c;CCD&#x201d;) array. In another example, the image sensor can be a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (&#x201c;CMOS&#x201d;) device array. Each of the sensing regions or dies of the wafer <b>14</b> will be severed from each other at a later stage of fabrication. For highlighting the features of the present invention, a portion of a single image sensing region of a microelectronic assembly <b>100</b> including the wafer <b>14</b> is shown in the drawings <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1O</figref>. Although fabrication processing of the assembly <b>100</b> is described below with respect to a single image sensing region of the assembly <b>100</b>, it is to be understood that the same fabrication processing occurs in the other image sensing regions of the assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the wafer <b>14</b> may be reduced to a final thickness that is the same as a lateral dimension of a pixel, which is formed in the sensor <b>17</b>, in a lateral direction along a surface of the wafer <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, the wafer <b>14</b> has a final thickness of about 3-5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, after the thickness of the wafer <b>14</b> is reduced, a bond pad <b>16</b> is formed on a front surface <b>19</b> of the wafer <b>14</b>. The bond pad <b>16</b> optionally may overlie a dielectric layer (not shown) disposed at the front surface <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used in this disclosure, terms such as &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, &#x201c;upward&#x201d; or &#x201c;upwardly&#x201d; and &#x201c;downward&#x201d; or &#x201c;downwardly&#x201d; refer to the frame of reference of the microelectronic element, e.g., semiconductor wafer or chip, or an assembly or unit which incorporates such wafer or chip. These terms do not refer to the normal gravitational frame of reference. For ease of reference, directions are stated in this disclosure with reference to the &#x201c;top&#x201d; or &#x201c;front&#x201d; surface <b>19</b> of the device wafer <b>14</b>. Generally, directions referred to as &#x201c;upward&#x201d; or &#x201c;rising from&#x201d; shall refer to the direction orthogonal and away from the front surface <b>19</b>. Directions referred to as &#x201c;downward&#x201d; shall refer to the directions orthogonal to the front surface <b>19</b> and opposite the upward direction. A &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; direction shall refer to a direction orthogonal to the chip front surface. The term &#x201c;above&#x201d; a reference point shall refer to a point upward of the reference point, and the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; a reference point shall refer to a point downward of the reference point. The &#x201c;top&#x201d; of any individual element shall refer to the point or points of that element which extend furthest in the upward direction, and the term &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; of any element shall refer to the point or points of that element which extend furthest in the downward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As used in this disclosure, a statement that an electrically conductive structure is &#x201c;exposed at&#x201d; a surface of a dielectric structure indicates that the electrically conductive structure is available for contact with a theoretical point moving in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the dielectric structure toward the surface of the dielectric structure from outside the dielectric structure. Thus, a terminal or other conductive structure which is exposed at a surface of a dielectric structure may project from such surface; may be flush with such surface; or may be recessed relative to such surface and exposed through a hole or depression in the dielectric.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a carrier wafer or packaging layer <b>20</b> is joined to the wafer <b>14</b> at the front surface <b>19</b> using an adhesive <b>22</b>. The adhesive <b>22</b> can be any suitable material, and can be epoxy. The adhesive <b>22</b> should have properties and a glass transition temperature T<sub>g </sub>sufficiently high to withstand the maximum heating to be encountered during subsequent thermal processing. The adhesive <b>22</b> may cover the front surface <b>19</b>. Preferably, the adhesive is homogeneously applied by spin bonding, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,980,663 and 6,646,289, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, any other suitable technique may be employed. In another embodiment, an oxide/nitride layer may be used to join the packaging layer <b>20</b> to the device wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The layer <b>20</b> may be made from materials, such as silicon, glass or ceramic, so as to have a coefficient of thermal expansion matched to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the device wafer <b>14</b>. In one example, the packaging layer <b>20</b>, when initially joined to the wafer <b>14</b>, can have a thickness of about 500-1000 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, the wafer <b>10</b> of the assembly <b>100</b> is completely removed, such as by etching and/or grinding. In one embodiment, the wafer <b>10</b> is initially mechanically ground or lapped to remove all but a few microns of thickness of the wafer <b>10</b>, and then etching is performed to remove the remaining few microns of the wafer <b>10</b>. The layer <b>12</b> of the assembly <b>100</b> can serve as an etch stop, in other words, can prevent etching (removal) of portions of the device wafer <b>14</b> containing the image sensing regions, when the wafer <b>10</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a particular embodiment, after mechanically grinding the layer <b>10</b> to a thickness of a few microns, chemical and/or mechanical polishing may be performed to remove the remaining thickness of the layer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an alternative embodiment, after the bulk layer <b>10</b> is completely removed, the layer <b>12</b> can be completely removed and then another layer of material, such as a transparent dielectric which may have a controlled thickness, can be provided on exposed back surface <b>23</b> of the device wafer <b>14</b>. In one example, the replacement transparent layer can include an anti-reflective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>, in cases in which layer <b>12</b> is not removed, an anti-reflective coating (not specifically shown) may be formed on exposed back surface <b>26</b> of the dielectric layer <b>12</b>. The anti-reflective coating can help reduce the amount of light reflected from the surface <b>23</b> of the wafer <b>14</b> and improve contrast ratio. The anti-reflective coating may include silicon dioxide, magnesium fluoride and/or indium tin oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A color filter array including color filters <b>28</b> may then be formed or laminated overlying the surface <b>26</b>. The color filters <b>28</b> can be used to separate wavelengths of light arriving thereto into different ranges of wavelengths that correspond to different ranges of color, and provide that the light separated by wavelength propagates from the color filters towards the back surface <b>23</b> of the device wafer <b>14</b>. Through use of a variety of different color filters, each aligned with a pixel or pixels of the image sensor <b>17</b> in the wafer <b>14</b>, each color filter and pixel can be used to sense only a limited predefined range of wavelengths corresponding to a particular range of colors. In such way, an array of undifferentiated light detector elements can be used with an appropriate combination of color filters geared to transmitting different colors to permit many different combinations of colors to be detected.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Sets of microlenses <b>30</b> may then be formed which overlie an exposed surface of the array of color filters <b>28</b>. The microlenses <b>30</b> include tiny bumps of refractive material arranged in an array which help to focus light on one or more pixels of the imaging sensor of the device wafer <b>14</b>. The light arriving at exposed surface <b>30</b>A of the microlenses <b>30</b> is directed primarily onto one or more corresponding pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a packaging layer <b>32</b> constituting a sidewall or standoff of a packaging assembly <b>31</b> may be attached to the back surface <b>26</b> of the dielectric layer <b>12</b> using an adhesive <b>34</b>. The sidewall <b>32</b> can be applied so as not to vertically overlie the region of the assembly <b>100</b> including the lenses <b>30</b>. The sidewall <b>32</b> can be made from dielectric material. In addition, a lid or covering wafer <b>36</b> is joined to back surface <b>35</b> of the sidewall <b>32</b>. The sidewall <b>32</b> may be attached to the layer <b>12</b>, and then the lid wafer <b>36</b> is attached to the sidewall <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the sidewall <b>32</b> and lid wafer <b>36</b> are first attached to each other, and then the sidewall <b>32</b> with the lid wafer <b>36</b> is attached to the layer <b>12</b>. The sidewall <b>32</b> and the lid wafer <b>36</b>, together, define a cavity <b>37</b> in which the filters and microlenses associated with a sensing region of the device <b>14</b> are encapsulated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lid wafer <b>36</b> is at least partially transmissive to wavelengths of interest to the light detector elements incorporated in the image sensor <b>17</b>, and may be formed from one or more various types of glass, and may include inorganic or organic materials, or a combination thereof. The cavity <b>37</b> may have a height or vertical dimension D<b>1</b> extending between the back surface <b>26</b> of the layer <b>12</b> and the opposing surface of the lid wafer <b>36</b>, where D<b>1</b> is about 35-40 &#x3bc;m. For a detailed description of a packaging assembly joined to a back side of an image sensor, see, for example, '830 application, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1I</figref>, after mounting of the lid wafer <b>36</b> to the device wafer <b>14</b>, the packaging layer <b>20</b> may be ground to a thickness of not less than about 30 &#x3bc;m. The layer <b>20</b> has a final thickness so that it has sufficient rigidity to serve as a mechanical support for the assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref>, a recess <b>40</b> may be formed in front surface <b>42</b> of the packaging layer <b>20</b>. The recess <b>40</b> extends inwardly from an outer surface <b>42</b>A of the layer <b>42</b> to an inner surface <b>43</b> of the adhesive <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, photolithography may be used to form mask patterns (not shown) overlying the front surface <b>42</b> of the layer <b>20</b>, after which the layer <b>20</b> may be etched from the front surface <b>40</b> using wet or dry etching. The adhesive <b>22</b> functions as an etch stop layer that avoids etching of the device wafer <b>14</b> when the recess <b>40</b> is formed. In an alternative embodiment, the recess <b>40</b> may be formed by laser ablation of the layer <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, the layer <b>20</b> may be sandblasted using a directed stream of particles, such as disclosed in commonly owned co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12/842,612 filed Jul. 23, 2010, incorporated by reference herein, to form the recess <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the recess <b>40</b> may be a discrete via hole or notch formed at a location that overlies only the bond pad <b>16</b>. In another alternative embodiment, the recess <b>40</b> may be in the form of a channel that extends continuously across the surface <b>43</b> of the adhesive layer <b>22</b> of the assembly <b>100</b>. See, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/072,508 filed Feb. 26, 2008, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/583,830 filed Aug. 26, 2009, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1K</figref>, a polymer or passivation layer <b>50</b> is formed over all of the exposed front surfaces of the assembly <b>100</b>, which include the front surface <b>42</b> of the packaging layer <b>20</b>, sidewall surfaces <b>44</b> of the layer <b>20</b> within the recess <b>40</b> and the exposed portion of the inner surface <b>43</b> of the adhesive <b>22</b> at the bottom of the recess <b>40</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1K</figref>, the layer <b>50</b> includes a lower portion <b>52</b> on the surface <b>43</b> of the adhesive <b>42</b> and which overlies the bond pad <b>16</b>, an upper portion <b>54</b> on the front surface <b>42</b> of the layer <b>20</b> and sidewall portions <b>56</b> on the sidewall surfaces <b>44</b> of the layer <b>20</b>. The layer <b>50</b> may be formed, for example, by spray or spin coating, electrolytic or electrophoretic deposition, oxide chemical vapor deposition or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The layer <b>50</b> may be formed with sufficient thickness to provide compliancy, or alternatively may be a non-compliant layer, such as an oxide layer. See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/583,830 filed Aug. 26, 2009, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1L</figref>, a recess <b>60</b> may be formed through the lower portion <b>52</b> of the layer <b>50</b>. The recess <b>60</b> extends vertically through the layer <b>50</b>, the underlying adhesive <b>22</b> and to and into the bond pad <b>16</b>. The recess <b>60</b> may extend only partially into the bond pad <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, a thickness of less than a micron of the bond pad <b>16</b> is removed at the front surface of the bond pad <b>16</b> when the recess <b>60</b> is formed. The recess <b>60</b> may be formed by controlled laser etching or ablation, where the pulse width, intensity, number and wavelength are suitably controlled to ablate vertically through all or some portion of the portion <b>52</b> of the layer <b>50</b>, the portion of the adhesive <b>22</b> underlying and vertically aligned with the ablated portion <b>52</b> of the layer <b>50</b> and a predetermined thickness of the bond pad <b>16</b> underlying and vertically aligned with the ablated portion of adhesive <b>22</b>. See, for example, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/221,204, filed Jul. 31, 2008, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another embodiment, the ablation depth into the bond pad <b>16</b> does not exceed ten percent of the thickness of the bond pad. In a further embodiment, the ablation depth into the bond pad may extend to fifty percent or more of the thickness of the bond pad. The ablation of the metal surface of the bond pad advantageously provides that metal free of contamination is exposed, such that a reliable and low resistance ohmic contact may be formed for an interconnect metal that is subsequently applied, as described below in connection with the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1M</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the recess <b>60</b> may extend completely through the bond pad <b>16</b> when an active component of the device wafer <b>14</b> does not underlie the bond pad <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1L and 1M</figref>, a seed metal layer <b>70</b> is selectively formed on the exposed surface of the upper portion <b>54</b> of the passivation layer <b>50</b>, and also is formed on exposed surfaces of the layer <b>50</b> within the recess <b>40</b> and the recess <b>60</b>, exposed surfaces <b>58</b> of the adhesive layer <b>22</b> within the recess <b>60</b> and the exposed surface of the bond pad <b>16</b>. The layer <b>70</b> may be formed by sputtering or blanket metallization, and followed by surface patterning using photolithography. See U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/603,935, filed Nov. 22, 2006, incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, the seed metal layer <b>70</b> may be formed by electroless plating.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1N</figref>, a masking dielectric layer <b>80</b> is formed patterned on the exposed surface of the upper portion <b>54</b> of the layer <b>50</b>, and on exposed front surface <b>72</b> of the layer <b>70</b>, to define solder bump locations <b>90</b>. In addition, the layer <b>80</b> is formed on exposed surfaces of the layer <b>70</b> within the recesses <b>40</b> and <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, the material of the layer <b>80</b> may fill the entirety of the recess <b>40</b>, as well as the recess <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1O</figref>, solder bumps <b>96</b> may be formed at the locations <b>90</b> on the layer <b>70</b> at which the solder mask <b>80</b> is not present. See, for example, '830 application, incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, a packaged image sensor unit manufactured in accordance with the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1O</figref> may be singulated into individual packaged chip assemblies <b>100</b> which constitute microelectronic units, each containing an active region, such as described, for example, in the '830 application.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment of the invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a bond pad <b>216</b> of increased thickness in relation to the bond pad <b>16</b> of the assembly <b>100</b> may be provided on a device wafer <b>14</b> of a microelectronic assembly <b>200</b>. The assembly <b>200</b>, with the exception of the bond pad <b>216</b>, has a construction similar to the construction of the assembly <b>100</b>, and like reference numerals designate the same or similar elements. The bond pad <b>216</b> includes a layer of metal <b>216</b>B that contacts the front surface <b>19</b> of the device wafer <b>14</b>, and a layer of metal <b>216</b>A disposed over the metal layer <b>216</b>B. The layers <b>216</b>A, <b>216</b>B provide that the bond pad <b>216</b> has a thickness extending away from the front surface <b>19</b> that is almost as thick as the subsequently applied adhesive <b>22</b>. The recess <b>60</b> may be formed so as to terminate within the metal layer <b>216</b>A of the bond pad <b>216</b>. The recess <b>60</b> desirably does not extend into the metal layer <b>216</b>B, which has a thickness that is about the same as the thickness of the bond pad <b>16</b> of the assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bond pad <b>216</b> has a greater thickness than the bond pad <b>16</b> to provide that the recess <b>60</b>, and thus, the metal layer <b>70</b>, formed during the packaging process, terminate within the bond pad <b>216</b> and do not contact the device wafer <b>14</b>. As a result, an active region of the wafer device <b>14</b>, such as the sensor <b>17</b>, is electrically isolated from the metal layer <b>70</b> within the recess <b>60</b>. In one embodiment, the fabrication of the assembly <b>200</b> may be performed in substantially the same manner as described above for the assembly <b>100</b>, except that the bond pad <b>216</b> is provided by forming the metal layer <b>216</b>A over the metal layer <b>216</b>B after the metal layer <b>216</b>B is formed on the front surface <b>19</b> of the device wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bond pad <b>216</b> may have a thickness that is substantially greater than 0.5 um, and may include a metal or other material resistant to laser ablation. For example, the metal used for the layer <b>216</b>A may be more resistant to laser ablation than aluminum, from which the layer <b>216</b>B is formed. Nickel, copper, gold, silver or like materials are desirable for formation of the layer <b>216</b>A based on their resistance to laser ablation, low cost and ease of deposition by standard electroless plating process.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one embodiment, the bond pad <b>216</b> may include the layer <b>216</b>A formed from nickel, copper, gold or silver disposed over the layer <b>216</b>B formed from aluminum. In one embodiment, the thickness of the layer <b>216</b>A may be greater than fifty percent of the thickness of the bond pad <b>216</b>. The thickness of the layer <b>216</b>A may be between 3-5 &#x3bc;m, and may be between 0.5-30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It to be understood that, in accordance with the present invention, a bond pad of increased thickness may be formed in a front side illuminated sensor assembly, which has the active region and the bond pads on the same face, and where the assembly is inverted during further fabrication steps.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a further embodiment of the invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a bond pad <b>316</b> having multiple levels or layers may be provided within a device wafer <b>14</b> included in a microelectronic assembly <b>300</b>. The assembly <b>300</b>, except for the bond pad <b>316</b>, has a construction similar to the construction of the assembly <b>100</b>, and like reference numerals designate the same or similar elements. The bond pad <b>316</b> may be fabricated as part of a sequence of steps performed to form the pixels of the image sensor <b>17</b>. The bond pad <b>316</b> includes several layers of metal <b>316</b>A, and each metal layer <b>316</b>A may have a construction that is the same or similar to a single layer bond pad, such as the bond pad <b>16</b> of the assembly <b>100</b> described above. The layers <b>316</b>A are connected to each other by conductive vias <b>316</b>B or other conductive vertical structures. In one embodiment, the metal layers <b>316</b>A and the vias <b>316</b> may be isolated from semiconductor material in the wafer <b>14</b>. The bond pad <b>316</b> may be fabricated recessed partly or wholly within the wafer <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or alternatively may be formed on the surface <b>19</b> of the wafer <b>14</b>. The recess <b>60</b> is desirably formed to extend into the bond pad <b>316</b> to a depth not greater than the back surface of the metal layer <b>316</b>A of the bond pad <b>316</b> which is closest to the back surface <b>23</b> of the wafer <b>14</b>. As a result, an active region of the wafer device <b>14</b>, such as the sensor <b>17</b>, is electrically isolated from the metal layer <b>70</b> within the recess <b>60</b>. The fabrication of the assembly <b>300</b> may be performed in substantially the same manner as described above for the assembly <b>100</b>, except for the formation of the bond pad <b>316</b> within the device wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another embodiment of the invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a microelectronic assembly <b>350</b> an electrical isolation region <b>360</b> extends away from a rear surface <b>361</b> of a bond pad <b>16</b> and a rear surface <b>19</b> of a device wafer <b>14</b>. The assembly <b>350</b> has a construction similar to the construction of the assembly <b>100</b>, and like reference numerals designate the same or similar elements. The region <b>360</b> is partially defined by a portion of the rear surface <b>361</b> of the bond pad <b>16</b> that completely circumscribes the portion of the bond pad <b>16</b> through which the recess <b>60</b> is formed. The region <b>360</b> may be filled with dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide, and may be a part of the sidewall <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the region <b>360</b> may be filled with the same adhesive material used to attach the sidewall <b>32</b> to the wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The material within the region <b>360</b> electrically isolates the metal layer <b>70</b> extending along the sidewalls of the recess <b>60</b> from an active region, such as the sensor <b>17</b>, of the wafer <b>14</b>. As discussed above, the metal layer <b>70</b> desirably is in contact with the bond pad <b>16</b> at a radially symmetric contact region of the bond pad <b>16</b> in the recess <b>60</b>. The region <b>360</b> provides that the metal layer <b>70</b> is electrically isolated from the wafer <b>14</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the recess <b>60</b> may be formed to extend through the entirety of the bond pad <b>16</b>, and also may extend through one or more material layers underlying the bond pad <b>16</b>, such as the material in the region <b>360</b>, the adhesive layer <b>34</b> and/or the sidewall <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fabrication of the assembly <b>350</b> may be performed in substantially the same manner as described above for the assembly <b>100</b>, except that, before attachment of the sidewall <b>32</b>, the layer <b>12</b> may be removed and then the region <b>360</b> underlying the bond pad <b>16</b> is formed by removing a portion of the wafer <b>14</b>, such as by use of photolithography and etching. Desirably, the region <b>360</b> is formed after the thickness of the device wafer <b>14</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another embodiment of the invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a microelectronic assembly <b>400</b> having a construction to similar to the assembly <b>100</b> may include an isolation region or trench <b>410</b> in a device wafer <b>14</b>. The assembly <b>350</b> has a construction similar to the construction of the assembly <b>100</b>, and like reference numerals designate the same or similar elements. The trench <b>410</b> completely circumscribes the bond pad <b>16</b> and extends at least partially, and in one embodiment completely, through the wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The trench <b>410</b> may be filled with dielectric material. Alternatively, the trench <b>410</b> is a doped semiconductor region of the wafer <b>14</b> having a different doping than the doping of a semiconductor region of the wafer <b>14</b> adjacent to and circumscribed by the trench <b>410</b>. The difference in the doping between the trench <b>410</b> and the adjacent region is adapted such that the trench <b>410</b> provides electrical isolation between the adjacent region of the wafer <b>14</b> circumscribed by the trench <b>410</b>, which are on one side of the trench <b>410</b>, and a region of the wafer <b>14</b> on a side of the trench <b>410</b> opposite to the recess <b>60</b>. The doped trench <b>410</b>, for example, may provide electrical isolation similar to that provided by an intrinsic region (I) of a PIN diode.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The trench <b>410</b> electrically isolates a portion of the wafer <b>14</b>, which extends underneath the bond pad <b>16</b> and may contact the metal layer <b>70</b> in the recess <b>60</b>, from the remainder of the wafer <b>12</b>, which includes imaging elements such as the sensor <b>17</b>. In effect, the trench <b>410</b> is a high resistivity element in the wafer <b>14</b> that creates electrical islands within the wafer <b>14</b>. The trench <b>410</b>, by circumscribing the bond pad <b>16</b>, permits that the recess <b>60</b> may be formed, using laser etching, to extend through the bond pad <b>16</b> and into the wafer <b>14</b> beneath the bond pad <b>16</b>. The trench <b>410</b> avoids shorting of active portions of the wafer <b>14</b>, such as the sensor <b>17</b>, to the metal layer <b>70</b> portions formed in the recess <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The fabrication of the assembly <b>400</b> may be performed in substantially the same manner as described above for the assembly <b>100</b>, except that the trench <b>410</b> is preferably formed during fabrication of the semiconductor wafer <b>14</b>, as part of a sequence of steps to form the pixels of the image sensor <b>17</b> and before the packaging assembly <b>31</b> including the sidewall <b>32</b> and lid wafer <b>36</b> are attached to the wafer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the invention herein has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it is to be understood that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles and applications of the present invention.
