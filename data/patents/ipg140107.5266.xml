<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter described herein generally relates to marine vessels, and more particularly, to a system and method for controlling a marine vessel through a waterway.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Operation of a marine vessel through a waterway, such as moving a marine vessel from an initial location to a final location along the waterway, may involve consideration of numerous factors, which increases the difficulty and risk of the operation. For example, such factors as the presence of fixed or moving obstacles within the waterway, and/or dimensions of the waterway (e.g., width), can increase the difficulty and risk of maneuvering the marine vessel within the waterway from the initial location to the final location. Additionally, others factors relating to the waterway may have limited foreseeability and yet have a significant impact on the operation of the marine vessel, such as weather conditions, water current, wind current, and/or other marine vessels which may suddenly obstruct a path of travel, and thus further complicate manual operation of the marine vessel from the initial location to the final location within the waterway. Also, at the final location, if the marine vessel is to be docked at a docking station, the maneuvering and/or turning of the marine vessel may involve highly complex calculations that require an operator with the significant skill, who may not be available, or the marine vessel may not be capable of being manually maneuvered by an operator of any skill level.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a system which provides for control of a marine vessel through a waterway from an initial location to a final location, while taking into consideration such factors as the dimensions of the waterway, for example.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment of the inventive subject matter described herein provides a system for controlling a marine vessel for travel through a waterway. The term &#x201c;waterway&#x201d; refers to any body of water. For example, the system may be used to optimize a path (also referred to as a route) for the marine vessel along the waterway, from a first location to a second location. As used herein, the term &#x201c;optimize&#x201d; (and the various forms thereof) means to improve something relative to another technique, system, process, or method. For example, optimizing a path may mean determining a path to follow that reduces fuel consumption, reduces emissions generated, and/or reduces a travel time of the marine vessel to a destination location relative to the marine vessel traveling along another, different path. The term optimize (and the various forms thereof) may not involve maximizing or minimizing one or more quantities. For example, optimizing the path that a marine vessel is to follow may mean that the path that is followed reduces fuel consumed, emissions generated, and/or travel time relative to traveling along one or more other paths, but not relative to all other potential paths. Alternatively, optimizing the path may mean that the path that is followed does reduce fuel consumed, emissions generated, and/or travel time relative to all other paths. The first location of the path may be, for example, an initial location of the marine vessel (such as the ingress to the waterway) or a current location of the marine vessel, and the second location may be a final location of the marine vessel, such as at a dock or other docking station, or an intermediate location between the initial or current location and a final destination. The system includes a processor having a memory, which stores at least one operating parameter of the marine vessel, and navigational data of the waterway. (&#x201c;Operating parameter&#x201d; refers to an aspect of the marine vessel as relating to its propulsion through water, including, but not limited to, vessel mass, drag and other hydrodynamic aspects, and/or propulsion power characteristics.) Additionally, the system includes a propulsion system and a directional system on the marine vessel, where the propulsion system and directional system are coupled to the processor and respectively impart a selective propulsion force on the marine vessel at a selective direction based on a respectively received propulsion command and direction command from the processor. For example, based on a propulsion command received from the processor, the propulsion system may impart a selective propulsion force on the marine vessel. The direction of the propulsion force can be governed by the directional system, based on a direction command received from the processor. &#x201c;Selective&#x201d; refers to a particular selected/designated propulsion force or direction, as applicable. The processor determines a designated (e.g., optimal) path for the marine vessel to travel along through the waterway from the first location to the second location. The processor also determines the propulsion command and the direction command to be transmitted to the propulsion and directional system at a respective incremental location along the designated path. The designated path, propulsion command, and direction command are determined so as to optimize a performance characteristic of the marine vessel along the designated path, similar to as described above. The determination of the designated path, the propulsion command, and/or the direction command is based on the first location, the second location, the at least one operating parameter, the performance characteristic, and/or the navigational data. As should be appreciated, &#x201c;incremental&#x201d; can refer to one of a plurality of successive locations along the designated path. The processor can determine a propulsion command and a direction command at each successive location for optimizing (e.g., improving but not necessarily maximizing or minimizing) the performance characteristic of the marine vessel along the designated path or route. &#x201c;Performance characteristic&#x201d; refers to a designated aspect of the marine vessel's travel along the path, such as travel time, fuel or energy efficiency, arrival time at a waypoint (or destination location or other location), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another embodiment of the presently described inventive subject matter provides a system for controlling a combination of marine vessels through a waterway. For example, the system may be used to optimize a path for the combination of vessels through the waterway from a first location (e.g., an initial or current location) to a second location (e.g., a final or intermediate location). The system includes a processor, and a respective propulsion system and a respective directional system on the vessels, which are coupled to the processor and configured to respectively impart a selective propulsion force on the respective vessel at a selective direction based on a respectively received propulsion command and direction command from the processor. For example, the system may include one or more processors that communicate with a first propulsion system and a first directional system on a first marine vessel and that communicate with a second propulsion system and a second directional system on a second marine vessel. The processor determines a respective designated (e.g., optimal) path for the vessels to travel along through the waterway from the first location to the second location, a respective propulsion command, and a respective direction command to be transmitted to the propulsion systems of the vessels and the directional systems of the vessels at one or more incremental locations along the designated path, so to optimize a performance characteristic of one or more of the vessels along the designated path. In one embodiment, the designated path may include a first path for a first vessel of the combination of vessels, a different, second path for a second vessel of the combination of the vessels, and so on. The determination of the designated path, the propulsion commands, and the direction commands can be based on the first location, the second location, at least one respective operating parameter of the vessels, the performance characteristic, and/or a navigational data of the waterway.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another embodiment of the presently described inventive subject matter provides a method for controlling a marine vessel through a waterway, such as for optimizing a path for the marine vessel through the waterway from a first location (e.g., an initial or current location) to a second location (e.g., a final or intermediate location). The method includes determining an optimal or designated path for the marine vessel through the waterway from the first location to the second location. Additionally, the method includes determining a propulsion command to be transmitted to a propulsion system of the marine vessel and a direction command to be transmitted to a directional system of the marine vessel at one or more incremental locations along the designated path. The designated path, the propulsion command, and/or the direction command are determined for optimizing (e.g., increasing or decreasing) a designated performance characteristic of the marine vessel along the path, and can be determined based on the first location, the second location, the performance characteristic, at least one operating parameter of the marine vessel, and/or navigational data of the waterway.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, a system (e.g., a system for controlling a marine vessel) includes a processor, a propulsion system, and a directional system. The processor is configured to be disposed onboard a marine vessel and to obtain a trip plan that includes designated operational settings of the marine vessel for a trip along a waterway. The propulsion system of the marine vessel is configured to be communicatively coupled with the processor and to generate propulsion to move the marine vessel according to the designated operational settings of the trip plan. The directional system of the marine vessel is configured to be communicatively coupled with the processor and to steer the marine vessel according to the designated operational settings of the trip plan. The propulsion system propelling the marine vessel and the directional system steering the marine vessel according to the designated operational settings of the trip plan reduces at least one of fuel consumed or emissions generated by the marine vessel relative to the marine vessel being propelled or steered according to one or more plans other than the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, another method (e.g., for controlling a marine vessel) is provided.

The propulsion system propelling the marine vessel and the directional system steering the marine vessel according to the designated operational settings of the trip plan reduces at least one of fuel consumed or emissions generated by the marine vessel relative to the marine vessel being propelled or steered according to one or more plans other than the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, another system (e.g., for controlling a marine vessel combination of a first marine vessel and a second marine vessel) includes a processor.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments consistent with the inventive subject matter described herein, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numerals used throughout the drawings refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At least one embodiment of the inventive subject matter described herein provides a system, method, and/or computer implemented method for determining and implementing a propulsion strategy or other mission plan of a powered system such as a train, marine vessel, other vehicle, or other powered system, including determining an approach to monitor and control operations of the powered system to improve certain objective operating criteria or parameter requirements, while satisfying schedule and speed constraints, for example. At least one embodiment can be operable in distributed power (DP) operations, such as a situation where two or more powered systems are controlled in concert for carrying out a designated mission. An apparatus, such as a data processing system, including a computer processor (CPU), memory, input/output devices (I/O), program storage, a connecting bus, and other appropriate components, could be programmed or otherwise designed to facilitate the practice of one or more methods or systems described herein. Such a system could include appropriate software for executing one or ore methods described herein. Although specific embodiments of the presently described inventive subject matter relate to a system, method, and/or computer implemented method for controlling a marine vessel through a waterway (which may include determining and implementing an optimized path of the marine vessel through the waterway), one or more embodiments described herein may be applicable to another powered system for carrying out a mission.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Also, an article of manufacture, such as a pre-recorded disk or other similar computer program product, for use with a data processing system, could include a storage medium and software recorded thereon for directing the data processing system to facilitate the practice of one or more embodiments of the methods described herein. Such apparatus and articles of manufacture also fall within the spirit and scope of the inventive subject matter described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Broadly speaking, one or more embodiments of the inventive subject matter provide a method, system, and program for controlling a marine vessel through a waterway, including determining and implementing an optimized (e.g., designated) path for the marine vessel through the waterway, and further including determining an approach to monitor and control a marine vessel's operations to improve certain objective operating criteria parameter requirements while satisfying schedule and/or speed constraints. To facilitate an understanding of the presently described inventive subject matter, it is described hereinafter with reference to specific, non-limiting implementations thereof. The inventive subject matter is described in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. For example, the software programs that underlie the inventive subject matter can be coded in different languages, for use with different platforms. In the description that follows, examples of the inventive subject matter are described in the context of a web portal that employs a web browser. It will be appreciated, however, that the principles that underlie the inventive subject matter can be implemented with other types of computer software technologies as well. In addition to a marine vessel, including a combination of marine vessels organized as a consist (e.g., a designated group of marine vessels), the inventive subject matter may be applicable to other powered systems.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Moreover, one or more aspects of the inventive subject matter may be practiced with other computer system configurations, including hand-held devices, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, and the like. The inventive subject matter may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices. These local and remote computing environments may be contained entirely within the marine vessel or other powered system, or adjacent marine vessels in a consist, or off-board in wayside or central offices where wireless communication is used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, the term &#x201c;consist&#x201d; may refer to one or more marine vessels or other powered marine vessels in succession, connected together so as to provide motoring (propulsion) and/or braking (e.g., deceleration) capability. The powered marine vessels may be connected together where no non-powered marine vessels are in between the powered marine vessels. The series of linked or connected marine vessels (referred to herein as a &#x201c;vehicle train,&#x201d; and including an embodiment where a vehicle train comprises a single marine vessel) can have more than one consist in its composition. Specifically, there can be a lead consist, and more than one remote consists, such as midway in the line of marine vessels and another remote consist at the end of the vehicle train. Each consist may have a first powered marine vessel and trail powered marine vessel(s). Though a consist is usually viewed as successive powered marine vessels, a consist group of powered marine vessels may also be recognized as a consist even when at least a non-powered marine vessel separates the powered marine vessels, such as when the consist is configured for distributed power operation, wherein throttle and braking commands are relayed from the lead powered marine vessel to the remote trails by a radio link or physical cable. Toward this end, the term &#x201c;consist&#x201d; should not be considered a limiting factor when discussing multiple powered marine vessels within the same vehicle train. The term &#x201c;consist&#x201d; is applicable to any powered marine vessel or other powered system.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to the drawings, one or more embodiments of the inventive subject matter are described herein. The inventive subject matter can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a system (including a computer processing system), a method (including a computerized method), an apparatus, a computer readable medium, a computer program product, a graphical user interface, including a web portal, or a data structure tangibly fixed in a computer readable memory. Several embodiments of the inventive subject matter are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart of a method for planning a trip or other mission for a powered system (e.g., marine vessel or other powered vehicle), according to an example embodiment of the presently described inventive subject matter. As illustrated, instructions are input specific to planning a trip either on board or from a remote location, such as a dispatch center <b>10</b>. Such input information includes, but is not limited to: marine vessel position; consist description (such as marine vessel models); marine vessel power description; performance of a marine vessel propulsion system (e.g., in the case of a marine vessel, propellers); consumption of engine fuel as a function of output power; cooling characteristics; the intended trip route; the vehicle train (e.g., series of linked marine vessels and possibly non-powered boats) represented by marine vessel makeup and loading together with effective drag coefficients; trip desired parameters including, but not limited to, start time and location, end location, desired travel time, crew (user and/or operator) identification, crew shift expiration time, and route; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">This data may be provided to a vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>) in a number of ways, such as, but not limited to, an operator manually entering this data into the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> via an onboard display, inserting a memory device such as a &#x201c;hard card&#x201d; and/or USB drive containing the data into a receptacle aboard the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, and transmitting the information via wireless communication from a central or wayside location <b>41</b>, <b>257</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>), such as a track (or other route) signaling device and/or a wayside device, to the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>. Although the vehicle <b>42</b> is shown as a rail vehicle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the vehicle may be a marine vessel. Load characteristics (e.g., drag) of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> (e.g., a group of connected marine vessels <b>204</b>) may change over the route (e.g., with altitude, ambient temperature, condition of the route and marine vessels, weather conditions, currents, and the like), and the plan may be updated to reflect such changes as needed by any of the methods discussed above and/or by real-time autonomous collection of marine vessel/vehicle train conditions. This includes, for example, changes in marine vessel or vehicle train characteristics detected by monitoring equipment on or off board the vehicle(s) <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The signal system determines the allowable speed of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>) or vehicle train. There may be many types of route signal systems and operating rules associated with each of the signals. For example, some signals have a single light (on/off), some signals have a single lens with multiple colors, and some signals have multiple lights and colors. These signals can indicate that the route is clear and the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> may proceed at max allowable speed. They can also indicate a reduced speed or stop is required. This reduced speed may need to be achieved immediately, or at a certain location (e.g., prior to the next signal or crossing). In a marine context, route signals or wayside devices may include signaling buoys, navigational beacons (e.g., channel markers), lighthouses, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The signal status is communicated to the vehicle train (or single marine vessel or other powered vehicle) and/or operator through various means. In the case of a rail vehicle, some systems have circuits in the track and inductive pick-up coils on the rail cars. Other systems have wireless communications systems. Signal systems can also require the operator to visually inspect the signal and take the appropriate actions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The signaling system may interface with an on-board signal system <b>300</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and adjust the vehicle speed according to the inputs and the appropriate operating rules. For signal systems that involve the operator visually inspecting the signal status, the operator screen can present the appropriate signal options for the operator to enter based on the location of the marine vessel. The type of signal systems and operating rules, as a function of location, may be stored in an onboard database <b>35</b>, <b>63</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Based on the specification data that is input into the system <b>300</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), an optimal plan which reduces or minimizes fuel use and/or emissions produced subject to speed limit constraints along the route with desired start and end times is computed to produce a trip profile <b>12</b> (also referred to as a mission plan, mission profile, trip plan, trip profile, or driving trajectory). The trip plan includes designated speed and power (e.g., throttle) settings that the vehicle train (or marine vessel or other powered vehicle) is to follow, expressed as a function of distance and/or time along a path or route, and such marine vessel/vehicle train operating limits, including but not limited to, upper limits on throttle power and/or brake settings, speed limits as a function of location, the expected fuel used and emissions generated, and the like. In one embodiment, the values for the throttle setting are selected to obtain throttle change decisions about once every 10 to 30 seconds. Alternatively, the throttle change decisions may occur at faster or shorter frequencies, if needed and/or desired to follow a designated speed profile (e.g., designated speeds of the marine vessel that are expressed as a function of at least one of time during a trip and/or distance along a route). In another embodiment, the trip plan can provide power settings for the vehicle train, either at the entire vehicle train level, consist level, and/or individual marine vessel level. Power settings comprise braking power settings, motoring power settings, and/or airbrake power settings. In another embodiment, instead of operating at discrete (e.g., integer value) throttle power settings, one or more non-discrete, or continuous (e.g., non-integer or decimal), power settings may be designated by the trip plan. Thus, for example, if a trip plan specifies a throttle setting of 6.8, instead of operating at throttle setting 7, the marine vessel <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) or other vehicle <b>42</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can operate at 6.8 (or at another value or setting). Allowing such intermediate power settings may bring additional efficiency benefits to operation of the vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The procedure used to compute the trip plan can include one or more methods for computing a power sequence (e.g., designated throttle, power, and/or brake settings) that drive the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>) and/or the vehicle train <b>31</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to reduce fuel consumption and/or emissions generated subject to marine vessel (or other powered vehicle) operating and schedule constraints. In some cases, the designated trip plan may be the same or similar to one or more previously determined trip plans due to similarities of the marine vessel configuration, vehicle train configuration, route, and/or environmental conditions. In these cases, it may be sufficient to look up a previously designated trip plan (such as a driving trajectory) within the database <b>36</b>, <b>63</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>) based on the similar configurations, routes, and/or conditions, and attempt to follow the trip plan during a current trip. When a previously computed trip plan or profile is unavailable, one or more methods to compute a new trip plan include, but are not limited to, direct calculation of the trip plan using differential equation models which can approximate physics of motion of the marine vessel and/or vehicle train. The setup can involve selection of a quantitative objective function, such as a weighted sum (integral) of model variables that correspond to rate of fuel consumption and/or emissions generated and, in some embodiments, adding a term to penalize excessive throttle variation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An optimal control formulation can be set up to reduce the quantitative objective function subject to constraints that include, but are not limited to, speed limits, lower limits on throttle, power, and/or brake settings, upper limits on throttle, power, and/or brake settings, and the like. Depending on planning objectives for a trip (e.g., a scheduled departure time, scheduled arrival time, limits on emission generation, limits on fuel consumption, scheduled cargo unloading times at a destination dock, and the like), the formulation of the trip plan may be flexibly implemented to reduce fuel consumption and/or emission generation subject to constraints on emissions and/or speed limits, subject to constraints on fuel use and arrival time. It is also possible to implement, for example, a goal of the trip plan to reduce the total travel time to a destination or intermediate location without constraints on total emissions generated or fuel consumed where such relaxation of constraints would be permitted or required for completion of the mission.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Mathematically, a problem to be solved by forming the trip plan may be stated by a physics model that can be expressed by one or more quantitative objective functions, such as:</p>

where x represents a position or location of the marine vessel or vehicle train, v represents a velocity of the marine vessel or vehicle train, and t represents time and/or distance along a route of a trip (which may be expressed in miles, kilometers, minutes, hours, and the like, as appropriate), and u represents an operational setting (e.g., notch or throttle setting) or command input. Further, D represents a distance to be traveled by the marine vessel or vehicle train, T<sub>f </sub>represents a desired or scheduled arrival time at distance D along the route, T<sub>e </sub>represents the tractive effort produced by the marine vessel or vehicle train, G<sub>a </sub>represents a gravitational drag of the marine vessel or vehicle train which can depend on a length (or other size) of the marine vessel or vehicle train, vehicle train makeup, and/or terrain on which the marine vessel or vehicle train is located, and R represents a net speed dependent drag of the marine vessel or vehicle train combination. Initial and/or final speeds can also be specified at one or more locations along the trip. In one embodiment, the initial and final speeds are set to be zero (e.g., where the marine vessel or vehicle train is stopped at the beginning and the end of the trip). Finally, the model used to generate the trip plan can be modified to include other movement dynamics of the marine vessel or vehicle train, such a lag between a change in a throttle setting and actual implementation of the change in the throttle setting (e.g., represented by u), and/or resulting tractive effort (e.g., propulsion) or braking. Using such a model, an optimal control formulation (e.g., a trip plan) is established to reduce one or more of the quantitative objective functions subject to constraints that may include, but are not limited to, speed limits, lower limits on power (e.g., throttle) settings, upper limits on power settings, and the like. Depending on planning objectives, the problem of generating the trip plan may be flexibly set up to reduce fuel consumed subject to constraints on emissions generation and/or speed limits, and/or to reduce emissions, subject to constraints on fuel use and/or arrival time.
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A trip plan may be generated to implement a goal of reducing a total travel time to one or more locations without constraints on emissions generated and/or fuel consumed, where such relaxation of constraints is permitted or required to complete the mission (e.g., trip). One or more of these performance measures can be expressed as a linear combination of one or more of the following functions:</p>

Note that in Equation (OP), u(t) represents an optimizing variable, such as a continuous throttle position. If a discrete throttle is used, such as for older vehicles and certain marine vessels and other powered vehicles, the solution to Equation (OP) may be discretized, which may result in less fuel saving. Finding a reduced time solution (e.g., &#x3b1;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>being set to zero) can be used to find a lower bound for an achievable travel time of the trip (e.g., T<sub>f</sub>=T<sub>fmin</sub>). In this case, both u(t) and T<sub>f </sub>can be optimizing variables. In one embodiment, Equation (OP) is solved for various values of T<sub>f </sub>with &#x3b1;<sub>3 </sub>set to zero.

where W<sub>F </sub>represents the fuel remaining in the tank of the marine vessel at a time T<sub>f</sub>. Alternatively, the objective equation (OP) can be expressed in other forms. The expressions presented above are examples for use in accordance with one embodiment of the presently described inventive subject matter.
</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Reference to emissions in the context of one or more embodiments described herein may refer to cumulative emissions produced in the form of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons, and/or particulates. For example, in the context of locomotives, the locomotives may be compliant to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for brake-specific emissions, and thus when emissions are optimized in accordance with one or more embodiments of the presently described inventive subject matter, the reduced emissions may be mission total emissions today. (This may also be applicable to other powered marine vessels.) During a trip, operations of the marine vessel may be held to be compliant with EPA mandates. If an objective during a trip or mission is to reduce emissions, the objective equation that is used to form the trip plan may be amended to consider the objective. One flexibility or variable in the setup of the trip plan is that one or more of the objectives of the trip can vary by geographic region or mission. For example, for a high priority marine vessel (relative to one or more other marine vessels), a reduced travel time may be the governing objective (relative to other objectives) on one route because the marine vessel is high priority traffic. In another example, emission output may vary from state to state (or other geographic regions) along the planned trip route.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, a dynamic optimal control problem (e.g., controlling the marine vessel to reduce fuel consumed and/or emissions generated) in the time domain to an equivalent static mathematical programming problem with N decision variables, where the number &#x201c;N&#x201d; can depend on a frequency at which throttle and/or braking adjustments are made and/or the duration or distance of the trip. This N can be in the thousands. Utilizing one or more embodiments of the presently described inventive subject matter, an example 7.6% savings in fuel consumed may be realized when a marine vessel travels according to a trip plan determined and followed using one or more embodiments described herein when compared to an actual manually controlled throttle/speed history where the trip was determined by an operator. The improved savings may be realized because the optimization realized because traveling according to a trip plan can produce a driving strategy with both less drag loss and/or little or no braking loss when compared to manual control of the marine vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, to make the optimization described above computationally tractable, a model of the marine vessel train may be employed, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the equations discussed above. One possible refinement to the trip profile or plan is produced by driving a more detailed model with a power sequence for operation of the marine vessel being generated, to test if other thermal, electrical, and/or mechanical constraints are violated by operation of the marine vessel according to the trip plan. This can lead to a modified trip profile or plan that designates alternate operational settings of the marine vessel that is closer to a trip that can be achieved without harming marine vessel or vehicle train equipment, such as by satisfying additional implied constraints such thermal and electrical limits on the marine vessels and inter-vehicle forces in the vehicle train.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, once the trip is started <b>12</b>, operational settings of the marine vessel, such as power commands, are generated <b>14</b> to put the plan in motion. Depending on the operational set-up of the marine vessel, one command is for a marine vessel or other powered marine vessel to follow the power command <b>16</b> so as to achieve a speed that is designated by the trip plan. In one embodiment, one or more sensors or other devices obtain actual operational conditions of the marine vessel, such as the actual speed and/or actual power output of the marine vessel or vehicle consist. Owing to one or more approximations in the models used for the optimization and/or one or more other reasons, a closed-loop calculation of corrections to optimized power can be obtained to track the desired optimal speed. For example, the actual operational conditions of the marine vessel can be monitored and compared to the operational settings of the marine vessel that are designated by the trip plan. Differences between the actual operating conditions and the designated operational settings can be identified and corrections or changes to the operational settings of the marine vessel can be determined. For example, if the marine vessel is traveling at a slower speed than is designated by the trip plan, increases in throttle settings can be determined as corrections to operation of the marine vessel. Such corrections can be made automatically or by the operator. As one example, the marine vessel can operate in a &#x201c;coaching mode,&#x201d; where one or more systems onboard the marine vessel generate instructions that are communicated to the operator (e.g., on a display or other output device) in order to direct the operator how to manually control the marine vessel according to the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some cases, the model used to generate the trip plan may significantly differ from the actual marine vessel. This can occur for one or more reasons, including but not limited to, extra cargo pickups or setouts, marine vessels that fail in route, errors in the database <b>36</b>, <b>63</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>), or data entry by the operator. A monitoring system can be is in place that uses real-time vehicle train data (e.g., actual operational conditions of the marine vessel, such as actual speed, power output, intra-vehicle forces, emissions output, and the like) to estimate marine vessel and/or vehicle train parameters in real time <b>20</b>. The estimated parameters are then compared to the assumed parameters that are used when the trip was created <b>22</b>. Based on differences between the assumed and estimated values, the trip may be re-planned <b>24</b>, should large enough savings accrue from a new plan. For example, if the trip plan was created based on a first vehicle mass and/or size but, for one or more reasons, the marine vessel has a lower, second vehicle mass and/or a smaller size (e.g., the marine vessel includes less cargo and/or fewer power generating units in the marine vessel), then the trip plan may be modified based on the lower mass and/or size. Other vehicle parameters and/or other parameters may be considered, such as the wind drag on the vehicle, power output of the vehicle (e.g., due to decreased health or output from the vehicle), adverse weather conditions, adverse route conditions (e.g., stronger or swifter currents in a waterway), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Other reasons a trip may be re-planned include directives from a remote location, such as dispatch and/or the operator requesting a change in objectives of the trip plan (e.g., a scheduled arrival time at one or more locations) to be consistent with more global movement planning objectives. Additional global movement planning objectives may include, but are not limited to, other vehicle train schedules, allowing exhaust to dissipate from an area such as a tunnel or beneath a bridge when a marine vehicle travels below the bridge, maintenance operations, and the like. Another reason may be due to an onboard failure of a component. Strategies for re-planning may be grouped into incremental and major adjustments depending on the severity of the disruption, as discussed in more detail below. In general, a &#x201c;new&#x201d; plan may be derived from a solution to the optimization problem equation (OP) described above, or one or more faster approximate solutions can be found, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In operation, the marine vessel <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) or other powered vehicle <b>42</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) monitors (e.g., continuously, periodically, and/or when prompted) system efficiency and update the trip plan based on the actual efficiency that is measured when such an update would improve vehicle performance. Re-planning computations may be carried out entirely within the marine vessel(s) or fully or partially moved to a remote location, such as dispatch or wayside processing facilities where wireless technology is used to communicate the plans to the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, efficiency trends of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> can be used to develop vehicle fleet data regarding efficiency transfer functions. The fleet-wide data may be used when determining a first or initial trip plan, and may be used for network-wide optimization tradeoff when considering locations of a plurality of vehicle trains. For example, the travel-time fuel use tradeoff curve as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> reflects a capability of a vehicle train on a particular route or waterway at a current time, updated from ensemble averages collected for many similar vehicles or marine vessels on the same route or waterway. Thus, a central dispatch facility collecting curves like <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> from many vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> could use that information to better coordinate overall vehicle movements to achieve a system-wide advantage in fuel use or throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Many events in daily operations can lead to a need to generate or modify a currently executing plan, where it is desired to keep the same trip objectives. For example, when a vehicle train is behind schedule for planned movement event (e.g., a meet or pass with another vehicle) and the late vehicle needs to make up time. Using the actual speed, power, and location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>), a comparison can be made between a planned arrival time and a currently estimated (e.g., predicted) arrival time at <b>25</b>. Based on a difference in the times, and/or differences in parameters of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or route (e.g., as detected or changed by dispatch or the operator), the trip plan can be adjusted at <b>26</b>. This adjustment may be made automatically according to a vehicle owner's desire for how such departures from plan should be handled, or alternatives may be manually proposed for the on-board operator and dispatcher to jointly decide how to get the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> traveling back on the trip plan. For example, one or more adjustments may be presented (e.g., shown on a display or other output device) to the operator and the operator may manually select one or more of the adjustments (e.g., using a keypad, keyboard, touchscreen, or other input device). When a trip plan is updated but where the original objectives (such as but not limited to arrival time) remain the same, additional changes may be factored in concurrently, e.g., new future speed limit changes, which could affect the feasibility of ever recovering the original plan. In such instances, if the original trip plan cannot be maintained, or in other words the vehicle train is unable to meet the original trip plan objectives, as discussed herein other trip plan(s) may be presented to the operator and/or remote facility, or dispatch.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A re-plan may also be made when it is desired to change the original objectives. Such re-planning can be done at either fixed preplanned times, manually at the discretion of the operator or dispatcher, or autonomously when predefined limits, such as vehicle train operating limits, are exceeded. For example, if the current plan execution is running late by more than a specified threshold, such as thirty minutes, the trip plan can be re-planned to accommodate the delay at the expense of increased fuel use and/or emissions generation, as described above, or to alert the operator and dispatcher how much of the time can be made up at all (e.g., what time remains to be traveled to a designated location even when the vehicle travels at speed limits of the route or the fuel that can be saved within a time constraint). Other triggers for re-plan can also be envisioned based on fuel consumed or the health of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or consist, including but not limited time of arrival, loss of horsepower due to equipment failure and/or equipment temporary malfunction (such as operating too hot or too cold), and/or detection of gross setup errors, such as in the assumed vehicle train load. That is, if the change reflects impairment in the vehicle performance for the current trip, these may be factored into the models and/or equations used in the optimization of the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Changes in plan objectives can also arise from a need to coordinate events where the trip plan for one vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>) may compromise the ability of another vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> to meet objectives and arbitration at a different level, e.g., the dispatch office is required. For example, in the case of a rail vehicle, the coordination of meets and passes may be further optimized through train-to-train communications. Thus, as an example, if a train knows that it is behind schedule in reaching a location for a meet and/or pass, communications from the other train can notify the late train (and/or dispatch). The operator can then enter information pertaining to being late into the system <b>300</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which recalculates the trip plan of the train. The system <b>300</b> also can be used at a high level, or network-level, to allow a dispatch to determine which vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> should slow down or speed up should a scheduled meet and/or pass time constraint may not be met. As discussed herein, this can be accomplished by vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> transmitting data to the dispatch to prioritize how each vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> should change its planning objective. A choice could be based on either schedule or fuel saving benefits, depending on the situation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For any of the manually or automatically initiated re-plans, the system <b>300</b> may present more than one trip plan to the operator. In an example embodiment, the system <b>300</b> presents different trip plans to the operator, allowing the operator to select the arrival time and understand the corresponding fuel and/or emission impact of the different trip plans. Such information can also be provided to the dispatch for similar consideration, either as a simple list of alternatives or as a plurality of tradeoff curves, such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One or more embodiments of the system <b>300</b> may have the ability to learn and adapt to changes in the vehicle train and power consist which can be incorporated either in the current plan and/or in future plans. For example, one of the triggers for initiating a re-plan can be a loss of horsepower generated by the vehicle. When building up horsepower over time, either after a loss of horsepower or when beginning a trip, transition logic can be utilized to determine when desired horsepower is achieved. This information can be saved in the vehicle database <b>36</b>, <b>63</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>) for use in optimizing either future trips or the current trip should loss of horsepower occur again.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts various elements that may be part of a trip (or other mission) optimizer system <b>300</b>, according to one embodiment. Although the system <b>300</b> is shown as being disposed onboard a rail vehicle <b>42</b>, alternatively, the system <b>300</b> may be disposed onboard a marine vessel <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). A locator element <b>30</b> determines a location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b>. The locator element <b>30</b> can be a GPS sensor, or a system of sensors, that determines a location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b>. Examples of such other systems may include, but are not limited to, wayside devices, such as radio frequency automatic equipment identification (RF AEI) tags, dispatch, and/or video determination. Another system may include the tachometer(s) onboard the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and distance calculations from a reference point. A wireless communication system <b>47</b> may also be provided to allow for communications between vehicles and/or with a remote location, such as dispatch. Information about travel locations may also be transferred from other vehicles or vehicle trains.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A route characterization element <b>33</b> provides information about a route, such as a path through a waterway. The information about the route can include water speed or flow (e.g., currents, tides or tidal patterns), weather conditions, depth of the water at various locations, and the like. The route characterization element <b>33</b> may include an on-board route integrity database <b>36</b>. Sensors <b>38</b> are used to measure a tractive effort <b>40</b> being hauled by the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, throttle settings of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, configuration information of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, speed of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, individual marine vessel or other vehicle configuration, individual marine vessel or other powered vehicle capability, and the like. In one embodiment, the configuration information may be loaded without the use of a sensor <b>38</b>, but is input in another manner as discussed above. Furthermore, the health of the vehicles in the consist may also be considered. For example, if one vehicle in the consist is unable to operate above a particular throttle setting, this information is used when creating or re-planning the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Information from the locator element <b>30</b> may also be used to determine an appropriate arrival time of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b>. For example, if there is a vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b> moving along a route <b>34</b> (although shown as a track, the route <b>34</b> alternatively may represent a path along a waterway) toward a destination and no vehicle or vehicle train is following behind it, and the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train has no fixed arrival deadline to adhere to, the locator element <b>30</b>, including but not limited to RF AEI tags, dispatch, and/or video determination, may be used to gage the location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b>. Furthermore, inputs from signaling systems may be used to adjust the speed of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b>. Using the on-board route database, discussed below, and the locator element, such as GPS, the system <b>300</b> can adjust an operator interface (e.g., a display device) to reflect the signaling system state at the location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b>. In a situation where signal states would indicate restrictive speeds ahead, the system <b>300</b> may elect to slow the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b> to conserve fuel consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Information from the locator element <b>30</b> may also be used to change planning objectives as a function of distance to destination. For example, owing to inevitable uncertainties about congestion along the route <b>34</b>, &#x201c;faster&#x201d; time objectives on the early part of a route may be employed as a hedge against delays that statistically occur later. If it happens on a particular trip that delays do not occur, the objectives on a latter part of the trip can be modified to exploit the built-in slack time that was banked earlier, and thereby recover some fuel efficiency. A similar strategy could be invoked with respect to emissions restrictive objectives, e.g., approaching an urban area or typically heavily congested section of a waterway (e.g., a shipping port or bay that includes a shipping port).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As an example of the hedging strategy, in the case of a rail vehicle, if a trip is planned from New York to Chicago, the system <b>300</b> may have an option to operate the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> slower at the beginning, middle, or end of the trip. The system <b>300</b> can create the trip plan to allow for slower operation at the end of the trip since unknown constraints, such as but not limited to weather conditions, route maintenance, and the like, may develop and become known during the trip. As another consideration, if traditionally congested areas are known, the trip plan can be developed with an option to have more flexibility around these traditionally congested regions. Therefore, the system <b>300</b> also may consider weighting/penalty as a function of time/distance into the future and/or based on known/past experience. The planning and re-planning can take into consideration weather conditions, route conditions, other vehicles on the route, and the like, and may be taken into consideration at any time during the trip for the trip plan to be adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> further discloses other elements that may be part of the system <b>300</b>. A processor or control unit <b>44</b> receives information from the locator element <b>30</b>, route characterizing element <b>33</b>, and/or sensors <b>38</b>. An algorithm <b>46</b> (which may represent a tangible computer readable storage medium having one or more sets of programs/instructions that direct the processor <b>44</b> to perform one or more functions) operates within the processor <b>44</b> or causes the processor <b>44</b> to operate. The algorithm <b>46</b> can e used to compute the trip plan based on parameters involving the marine vessel <b>204</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) or other powered vehicle <b>42</b>, vehicle train <b>31</b>, route <b>34</b>, and/or objectives of a mission (e.g., a trip), as described above. In an example embodiment, the trip plan is established based on models for vehicle train behavior as the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or the vehicle train <b>31</b> moves along the route <b>34</b> as a solution of non-linear differential equations derived from physics with simplifying assumptions that are provided in the algorithm. The algorithm <b>46</b> can have access to the information from the locator element <b>30</b>, route characterizing element <b>33</b>, and/or sensors <b>38</b> to create a trip plan that reduces or minimizes fuel consumption and/or emissions generation of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>, causes the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> to arrive at a destination location at a designated time, and/or ensures proper crew operating time aboard the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. In one embodiment, a driver or operator, and/or controller element, <b>51</b>, is also provided. As discussed herein, the controller element <b>51</b> is used for controlling the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> as the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> follows the trip plan. In an example embodiment, discussed further herein, the controller element <b>51</b> makes operating decisions autonomously. In another example embodiment, the operator may be involved with directing the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> to follow the trip plan. For example, as described above, instructions may be presented to the operator in a &#x201c;coaching mode&#x201d; to direct the operator how to control the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A feature of one embodiment of the system <b>300</b> is the ability to initially create and quickly modify &#x201c;on the fly&#x201d; a trip plan that is being executed. This includes creating the initial trip plan when a long distance is involved, owing to the complexity of the plan optimization algorithm. When a total length of a trip plan exceeds a given or designated distance, the algorithm <b>46</b> may segment the mission or trip, such as by dividing the mission or trip by waypoints, landmarks, and the like. Though only a single algorithm <b>46</b> is discussed, more than one algorithm may be used (or the same algorithm may be executed a plurality of times) wherein the algorithms may be connected together. The waypoints or landmarks may include natural locations where the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b> stops, for example, in the case of rail vehicles, sidings where a meet with opposing traffic (or pass with a train behind the current train) is scheduled to occur on a single-track rail, or at yard sidings or industry where cars are to be picked up and set out, and locations of planned work. At such waypoints, the vehicle train <b>31</b> may be required to be at the location at a scheduled time and be stopped or moving with speed in a specified range. The time duration from arrival to departure at waypoints is called &#x201c;dwell time.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In an example embodiment, the trip optimizer system <b>300</b> breaks clown a longer trip into smaller segments in a systematic way. Each segment can be somewhat arbitrary in length, but is typically picked at a natural location such as a stop or significant speed restriction, or at mileposts that define junctions with other routes. Given a partition, or segment, selected in this way, a driving profile (e.g., a portion of a trip plan) is created for each segment of route as a function of travel time taken as an independent variable, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The fuel used/travel-time tradeoff associated with each segment can be computed prior to the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b> reaching that segment of route. A total trip plan can be created from the driving profiles created for the various segments. The system <b>300</b> can distribute a total travel time for the trip amongst the segments of the trip in such a way so that the total trip time is satisfied (e.g., the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> is set to operate to arrive at a destination at a scheduled arrival time) and/or total fuel consumed or emissions generated over the segments is reduced. An exemplary 3-segment trip is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and discussed below. In another embodiment, the trip plan may comprise a single segment representing the entire trip.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an example embodiment of a fuel-use/travel time curve <b>50</b>. As mentioned previously, such a curve <b>50</b> can be created when calculating a trip profile or plan for various travel times for each segment of a longer, overall trip. For a given travel time <b>51</b>, an amount of fuel used or consumed <b>52</b> can be the result of a trip profile that is computed as described above. Once travel times for the various segments of the trip are allocated among the segments, a trip plan (e.g., that specifies power, brake, and/or speed settings for the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> as a function of time and/or distance) is determined for each segment, and may be determined from previously computed solutions. If there are waypoint constraints on speed between the segments, such as, but not limited to, a change in a speed limit, these constraints can be matched up during creation of the trip plan. If speed restrictions change within a single segment, the fuel use/travel-time curve <b>50</b> can be re-computed for the segment that includes the change. This reduces time for having to re-calculate more parts, or segments, of the trip. If the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle train <b>31</b> changes significantly along the route <b>34</b>, e.g., from loss of a powered vehicle or pickup or set-out of cars (non-powered vehicles), then driving profiles for subsequent segments of the trip may be recomputed, thereby creating new instances of the curve <b>50</b>. These new curves <b>50</b> would then be used along with new schedule objectives to plan the remaining trip.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Once a trip plan is created as discussed above, a trajectory of speed and power versus distance can be used to reach a destination with reduced fuel use and/or emissions generated at the required trip time. The fuel consumed and/or emissions generated by the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> may be reduced relative to the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> traveling along the same route <b>34</b> according to another plan, such as a plan that includes one or more different operational settings of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> at one or more locations along the trip. There are several ways in which to execute the trip plan. As provided below in more detail, in one example embodiment, when in an operator &#x201c;coaching mode,&#x201d; information is displayed to the operator for the operator to follow to achieve the operational settings (e.g., power and/or speeds) designated by the trip plan. In this mode, the operating information includes suggested operating conditions that the operator should use. In another example embodiment, acceleration and maintaining a constant speed are autonomously performed. However, when the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> is to be slowed according to the trip plan, the operator can be responsible for applying a braking system <b>52</b>. In another embodiment, commands for powering and braking are provided as required to follow the desired speed-distance path of the trip plan. In another embodiment, the controller <b>51</b> may generate control signals that are communicated to the propulsion and/or braking systems of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> in order to automatically cause the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> to operate according to the operational settings designated by the trip plan. Alternatively, the controller <b>51</b> may generate the control signals for communication to an output device (e.g., a display) located onboard the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. The output device may present instructions to the operator on how to manually control the operational settings of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> based on the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Feedback control strategies can be used to provide corrections to the operational settings designated by the profile to correct for events such as, but not limited to, vehicle load variations caused by fluctuating head winds, tail winds, and/or changing currents in the waterway. Other corrections can be used to account for an error in vehicle parameters, such as, but not limited to, actual vehicle mass and/or drag, when compared to the assumed or designated mass and/or drag used to create the trip plan. Other corrections may be provided to correct information contained in the route database <b>36</b>. Another possible error may involve un-modeled performance differences due to the marine vessel (or other powered vehicle) engine, traction motor thermal duration, and/or other factors. Feedback control strategies can compare the actual speed (or other operational condition) as a function of position and/or time to the designated speed (or other operational setting) in the designated trip plan. Based on differences between the actual operational condition(s) and the designated operational setting(s), one or more corrections to the trip plan can be made to drive the actual velocity (or other actual operational condition) toward the designated velocity (or other designated operational setting) of the trip plan. To ensure stable regulation, a compensation algorithm may be provided which filters the feedback speeds into power corrections so that closed-performance stability is ensured. Compensation may include standard dynamic compensation to meet performance objectives.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one embodiment, to determine a fuel-optimal trip from point &#x201c;A&#x201d; to point &#x201c;B&#x201d; where there are stops along the way, and for updating the trip for the remainder of the trip once the trip has begun, a sub-optimal decomposition method is usable for finding an optimal trip plan. Using modeling methods, the computation method can find the trip plan with a specified travel time and initial and final speeds, so as to satisfy the speed limits and vehicle capability constraints when there are stops. Though the following discussion is directed towards optimizing (e.g., reducing) fuel use, it can also be applied to optimize other factors, such as, but not limited to, emissions, schedule, crew comfort, and load impact. The method may be used at the outset in developing a trip plan and/or adapting to changes in objectives after initiating a trip.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As discussed herein, one or more embodiments of the inventive subject matter may employ a setup as illustrated in the flow chart depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and as an exemplary 3-segment example depicted in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As illustrated, the trip may be broken into two or more segments, T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, and T<b>3</b>. (As noted above, it is possible to consider the trip as a single segment.) As discussed herein, the segment boundaries may not result in equal segments. Instead, the segments may use natural or mission specific boundaries. Optimal trip plans are pre-computed for each segment. If fuel use versus trip time is the trip object to be met, fuel versus trip time curves are built for each segment. As discussed herein, the curves may be based on other factors, wherein the factors are objectives to be met with a trip plan. When trip time is the parameter being determined, trip time for each segment is computed while satisfying the overall trip time constraints. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates speed limits <b>97</b> for an example 3-segment 200-mile (321.9 kilometers) trip. Further illustrated are grade changes <b>98</b> over the 200-mile (321.9 kilometers) trip. A combined chart <b>99</b> illustrating curves for each segment of the trip of fuel used over the travel time is also shown.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Using the optimal control setup described previously and the computation methods described herein, the trip optimizer system <b>300</b> can generate the trip plan with specified travel time and initial and final speeds, so as to satisfy the speed limits and vehicle capability constraints when there are stops. Though the following detailed discussion is directed toward reducing fuel use, it can also be applied to optimize other factors as discussed herein, such as, but not limited to, emissions. A key flexibility is to accommodate desired dwell time at stops and to consider constraints on earliest arrival and departure at a location as may be required, for example, in single-route operations where the time to be in or get by a siding (or other designated area such as an intersecting waterway) is critical.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Once a trip is underway, the issue is re-determining the fuel-optimal solution for the remainder of a trip (originally from D<sub>0 </sub>to D<sub>M </sub>in time T) as the trip is traveled, but where disturbances preclude following the fuel-optimal solution. Let the current distance and speed be x and v, respectively, where D<sub>i-1</sub>&#x3c;x&#x2266;D<sub>i</sub>. Also, let the current time since the beginning of the trip be tact. Then the fuel-optimal solution for the remainder of the trip from x to D<sub>M</sub>, which retains the original arrival time at D<sub>M</sub>, is obtained by finding {tilde over (T)}<sub>i</sub>, T<sub>j</sub>, j=i+1, . . . M, which minimize or reduce:</p>

By choosing D<sub>ij </sub>(e.g., at speed restrictions or meeting points), v<sub>max</sub>(i, j)&#x2212;v<sub>min</sub>(i, j) can be minimized or reduced, thus minimizing or reducing the domain over which f<sub>ij</sub>( ) needs to be known.
</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Based on the partitioning above, a simpler suboptimal re-planning approach than that described above is to restrict re-planning to times when the vehicle train is at distance points D<sub>ij</sub>, 1&#x2266;i&#x2266;M, 1&#x2266;j&#x2266;N<sub>i</sub>. At point D<sub>ij</sub>, the new optimal trip from D<sub>ij </sub>to D<sub>M </sub>can be determined by finding &#x3c4;<sub>ik</sub>, j&#x3c;k&#x2266;N<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>ik</sub>, j&#x3c;k&#x3c;N<sub>i</sub>, and &#x3c4;<sub>mn</sub>, i&#x3c;m&#x2266;M, 1&#x2266;n&#x2266;N<sub>m</sub>, v<sub>mn</sub>, i&#x3c;m&#x2266;M, 1&#x2266;n&#x3c;N<sub>m</sub>, which minimize or reduce:</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A further simplification is obtained by waiting on the re-computation of T<sub>m</sub>, i&#x3c;m&#x2266;M, until distance point D<sub>i </sub>is reached. In this way, at points D<sub>ij </sub>between D<sub>i-1 </sub>and D<sub>i</sub>, the minimization or reduction above needs only be performed over &#x3c4;<sub>ik</sub>, j&#x3c;k&#x2266;N<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>ik</sub>, j&#x3c;k&#x3c;N<sub>i</sub>. T<sub>i </sub>is increased as needed to accommodate any longer actual travel time from D<sub>i-1 </sub>to D<sub>ij </sub>than planned. This increase is later compensated, if possible, by the re-computation of T<sub>m</sub>, i&#x3c;m&#x2266;M, at distance point D<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">With respect to the closed-loop configuration disclosed above, the total input energy required to move a vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> from point A to point B consists of the sum of four components, specifically, difference in kinetic energy between points A and B; difference in potential energy between points A and B; energy loss due to friction and other drag losses; and energy dissipated by the application of brakes (or other braking or deceleration function). Assuming the start and end speeds to be equal (e.g., stationary), the first component is zero. Furthermore, the second component is independent of driving strategy. Thus, it suffices to minimize or reduce the sum of the last two components.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Following a constant speed profile can minimize or reduce drag loss. Following a constant speed profile also can minimize or reduce total energy input when braking is not needed to maintain a constant speed. However, if braking is required to maintain constant speed, applying braking just to maintain constant speed may increase a total required energy because of the need to replenish the energy dissipated by the brakes. A possibility exists that some braking may actually reduce total energy usage if the additional brake loss is more than offset by the resultant decrease in drag loss caused by braking, by reducing speed variation.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">After completing a re-plan from the collection of events described above, the new optimal notch/speed plan (e.g., a trip plan) can be followed using the closed loop control described herein. However, in some situations there may not be enough time to carry out the segment decomposed planning described above, and particularly when there are critical speed restrictions that must be respected, an alternative is needed. In one embodiment, a smart cruise control algorithm (e.g., the algorithm <b>46</b>) can provide an efficient way to generate, on the fly, an energy-efficient (hence fuel-efficient) sub-optimal prescription for driving the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> over a known route <b>34</b>. This algorithm <b>46</b> may assume knowledge of the position of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> along the route <b>34</b> at one or more, or all, times, as well as knowledge of the grade and curvature of the route <b>34</b> (or other characteristics of the route, such as current speed and direction of water flow) versus position along the route <b>34</b>. The method may rely on a point-mass model for the motion of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>, whose parameters may be adaptively estimated from online measurements of vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> motion as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The smart cruise control algorithm has several components, such as, in one embodiment, a module for generating a modified speed limit profile that serves as an energy-efficient guide around speed limit reductions; a module for generating a throttle or dynamic brake setting profile that attempts to balance between minimizing or reducing speed variation and braking; a module or mechanism for combining the latter two components to produce a notch (or other throttle) command; and/or a module employing a feedback loop to compensate for mismatches of modeled parameters or designated operational settings when compared to reality parameters or actual operational conditions. The algorithm can accommodate strategies do no active braking (e.g., the driver is signaled and assumed to provide the requisite braking) or a variant that does active braking.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">With respect to the cruise control algorithm that does not control dynamic braking, the example components can include a module for generating a modified speed limit profile that serves as an energy-efficient guide around speed limit reductions, a notification module for generating a notification signal that notifies the operator when braking should be applied, a module for creating a throttle profile that attempts to balance between minimizing or reducing speed variations and notifying the operator to apply braking, a mechanism or module employing a feedback loop to compensate for mismatches of model parameters to reality parameters, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Also included in the trip optimizer system <b>300</b> is an approach to identify parameter values of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. For example, with respect to estimating mass of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>, a Kalman filter and a recursive least-squares approach may be utilized to detect errors that may develop over time.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a schematic view of another embodiment of a trip optimizer system <b>700</b>. The system <b>700</b> may be similar to the system <b>300</b>. For example, the system <b>700</b> may be used to create and/or re-plan a trip plan that reduces fuel consumed and/or emissions generated by the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> during a trip. As discussed previously, a remote facility, such as a dispatch <b>60</b>, can provide information to an executive control element <b>62</b> of the system <b>700</b>. Also supplied to the executive control element <b>62</b> is information from a vehicle modeling database <b>63</b>, information from a route database <b>36</b> such as, but not limited to, route grade information, speed limit information, water current flow and/or direction, estimated vehicle and/or vehicle train parameters (such as, but not limited to, weight and drag coefficients), and/or fuel rate tables from a fuel rate estimator <b>64</b>. The executive control element <b>62</b> supplies information to a planner unit <b>12</b>, which may include or represent a processor or other controller that performs one or more of the operations disclosed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Once a trip plan has been calculated, the trip plan is supplied to a driving advisor, driver (operator), or controller element <b>51</b>. The trip plan also can be supplied to the executive control element <b>62</b> so that the element <b>62</b> can compare the trip when other new data is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As discussed above, the controller element <b>51</b> can automatically set a throttle power, either a pre-established throttle setting or an optimum continuous throttle power based on the trip plan. In addition to supplying a speed command to the marine vessel <b>204</b> or other powered vehicle <b>42</b>, a display <b>68</b> is provided so that the operator can view what the planner has recommended (e.g., the designated operational settings of the trip plan). The operator also has access to a control panel <b>69</b> through which the operator can decide whether to apply the notch power (or other designated operational setting) recommended by the trip plan. Toward this end, the operator may limit a targeted or recommended power of the trip plan. That is, the operator may have final authority over what power setting the vehicle or vehicle train will operate at. This includes deciding whether to apply braking if the trip plan recommends slowing the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. For example, if operating in dark territory, or where information from wayside equipment cannot electronically transmit information to a vehicle train and instead the operator views visual signals from the wayside equipment, the operator can input commands based on information contained in the route database and visual signals from the wayside equipment. Based on how the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> is functioning, information regarding fuel measurement is supplied to the fuel rate estimator <b>64</b>. In one embodiment, if direct measurement of fuel flows is not available, the information on fuel consumed and projections of fuel consumed based on following trip plans can be carried out using calibrated physics models such as those used in developing the optimal plans. For example, such predictions may include, but are not limited to, the use of measured gross horse-power and known fuel characteristics to derive the cumulative fuel used.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> also has the locator device <b>30</b> such as a GPS sensor, as discussed above. Information is supplied to a vehicle train parameters estimator <b>65</b>. Such information may include, but is not limited to, GPS sensor data, tractive/braking effort data, braking status data, speed, and any changes in speed data. With information regarding grade and speed limit information, vehicle weight and drag coefficients information is supplied to the executive control element <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">One or more embodiments of the trip optimizer system <b>700</b> may also allow for the use of continuously variable power throughout the optimization planning and closed loop control implementation. In the rail context, for example, the power of a conventional locomotive is typically quantized to eight discrete levels. The same may be true for certain marine vessels, as being limited to discrete throttle levels. Modern powered vehicles can realize continuous variation in horsepower which may be incorporated into the previously described optimization methods. With continuous power, the marine vessel or other powered vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> can further optimize operating conditions, e.g., by reducing or minimizing auxiliary loads and power transmission losses, and fine tuning engine horsepower regions of increased efficiency, or to points of increased emissions margins. Examples include, but are not limited to, minimizing or reducing cooling system losses, adjusting alternator voltages, adjusting engine speeds, and reducing number of powered axles. Further, the marine vessel <b>204</b> or other powered vehicle <b>42</b> may use the on-board route database <b>36</b> and the forecasted performance requirements to reduce or minimize auxiliary loads and power transmission losses to provide improved efficiency for the target fuel consumption/emissions. Examples include, but are not limited to, reducing a number of powered axles on flat terrain and pre-cooling the vehicle engine prior to entering an air-flow restricted area, such as a tunnel or an area that is at least partially surrounded by high ground or buildings.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">One or more embodiments of the presently described inventive subject matter may also use the on-board route database <b>36</b> and the forecasted performance of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> to adjust the vehicle performance, such as to insure that the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> has sufficient speed to move through one or more segments of the route <b>34</b>, such as when the vehicle approaches a hill, tunnel, area of fast current, or the like. For example, this could be expressed as a speed constraint at a particular location that becomes part of the optimal plan generation created solving the equation (OP). Additionally, one or more embodiments of the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may incorporate vehicle- and/or vehicle train-handling rules, such as, but not limited to, tractive effort ramp rates, braking effort ramp rates, and the like. These may be incorporated directly into the formulation for optimum trip profile or alternatively incorporated into the closed loop regulator used to control power application to achieve a target speed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In one embodiment, the trip optimizer system of <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> is only installed on a lead vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> of a consist. Even though the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may not be dependent on data or interactions with other vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in one embodiment, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may be integrated with a consist manager, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,691,957 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,021,588 (owned by the Assignee and both incorporated by reference), and/or a consist optimizer functionality to improve efficiency. Interaction with multiple separate vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or vehicle trains <b>31</b> also may be provided, as illustrated by the example of dispatch arbitrating two &#x201c;independently optimized&#x201d; vehicles or vehicle trains described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Vehicle trains <b>31</b> with distributed power systems can be operated in different modes. One mode is where all vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the vehicle train <b>31</b> operate at the same throttle command (e.g., throttle setting). If the lead vehicle in the distributed power system is commanding motoring of the other (e.g., trail or remote) vehicles in the distributed power system, then all vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the vehicle train <b>31</b> may be commanded to generate motoring at the same notch setting. Another mode of operation is &#x201c;independent&#x201d; control. In this mode, vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> or sets of vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> distributed throughout the vehicle train <b>31</b> can be operated at different motoring or braking powers (e.g., different throttle or brake settings). For example, in the case of a railroad train, as the train crests a mountaintop, the lead locomotives (on the down slope of mountain) may be placed in braking, while the locomotives in the middle or at the end of the train (on the up slope of mountain) may be in motoring. This is done to minimize tensile forces on the mechanical couplers that connect the railcars and locomotives. Traditionally, operating the distributed power system in &#x201c;independent&#x201d; mode required the operator to manually command each remote vehicle or set of vehicles via a display in the lead vehicle. Using the physics-based planning model, vehicle train set-up information, on-board route database, on-board operating rules, location determination system, real-time closed loop power/brake control, and/or sensor feedback, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> is able to automatically operate the distributed power system in &#x201c;independent&#x201d; mode. For example, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may generate different throttle and/or braking commands (e.g., different throttle settings and/or brake settings) for different powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> of the same vehicle train <b>31</b> operating in a distributed power mode to cause the vehicle train <b>31</b> to operate at or near the designated operational settings (e.g., speed) of the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">When operating in distributed power, the operator in a lead vehicle can control operating functions of remote vehicles in the remote consists via a control system, such as a distributed power control element. Thus, when operating in distributed power, the operator can command each consist to operate at a different throttle power level (or one consist could be in motoring and another could be in braking), wherein each individual vehicle in the consist operates at the same throttle power. In an example embodiment, with the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> installed on the vehicle train <b>31</b> and in communication with the distributed power control element (e.g., the element <b>51</b> and/or <b>62</b>), when a throttle power level for a remote consist is desired as recommended by the trip plan, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> can communicate this power setting to the remote consists for implementation. The same can be true regarding braking/deceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">One or more embodiments of the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may be used with consists in which the powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> are not contiguous (e.g., the vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> capable of self propulsion are spaced apart by and interconnected with 1 or more other units or vehicles of the vehicle train <b>31</b>). Such configurations can be operated in the distributed power mode described above, where a connection between the powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> includes radio links and/or auxiliary cables to link the powered vehicles. When operating in distributed power, the operator in a lead powered vehicle can control operating functions of remote powered vehicles in the consist via a control system, such as a distributed power control element. In particular, when operating in distributed power, the operator can command each consist to operate at a different throttle power level (or one consist could be in motoring and other could be in braking) wherein each individual powered vehicle in the consist operates at the same throttle power level.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">When operating with distributed power, the optimization problem previously described can be enhanced to allow additional degrees of freedom, in that each of the remote vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> can be independently controlled from the lead vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>. The value of this is that additional objectives or constraints relating to in-train forces may be incorporated into the performance function, assuming the model to reflect the in-train forces is also included. Thus, one or more embodiments of the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may include the use of multiple throttle controls to better manage in-train or in-consist forces (e.g., forces between coupled vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>), fuel consumption and/or emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In a vehicle train <b>31</b> utilizing a consist manager, the lead powered vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in a consist may operate at a different throttle power setting than other powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in that consist. The other powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the consist operate at the same throttle power setting. One or more embodiments of the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may be utilized in conjunction with the consist manager to command throttle power settings for the vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the consist. Thus, since the consist manager divides a consist into two or more groups, namely, lead powered vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and trail or remote units or vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, the lead powered vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> may be commanded to operate at a certain throttle power and the trail or remote powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> are commanded to operate at another certain throttle power. In one example embodiment, the distributed power control element (e.g., the element <b>51</b> and/or <b>62</b>) may be the system and/or apparatus where this operation is housed.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Likewise, when a consist optimizer is used with a consist, the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> can be used in conjunction with the consist optimizer to determine throttle power for each powered vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the consist. For example, a trip plan may recommend a throttle power setting of 4 for the consist. Based on the location of the vehicle train <b>31</b>, the consist optimizer may take this information and then determine the throttle power setting for each powered vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the consist. In this implementation, the efficiency of setting throttle power settings over intra-train communication channels can be improved. Furthermore, implementation of this configuration may be performed utilizing the distributed control system.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Furthermore, one or more example embodiments of the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may be used for continuous corrections and re-planning with respect to when the vehicle train <b>31</b> uses braking based on upcoming items of interest, such as but not limited to, railroad crossings, grade changes, sidings, depot yards, fuel stations, docks, loading stations, canals, locks, slow traffic or low wake areas, and the like, where two or more powered vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the consist may be associated with different braking settings by the trip plan. For example, if a railroad train is coming over a hill, the lead locomotive may have to enter a braking condition whereas the remote locomotives, having not reached the peak of the hill may have to remain in a motoring state.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b> depict example illustrations of dynamic displays <b>68</b> for use by the operator of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>. The examples given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b> are with respect to rail vehicles, e.g., railroad trains and locomotives, but also may apply to marine vessels <b>204</b> and other vehicles. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a trip profile or trip plan <b>72</b> is provided in the form of a rolling map. Within the trip plan <b>72</b>, a location <b>73</b> of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> is provided. Such information as a length <b>105</b> (or other size) of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> and the number of vehicles <b>106</b> in the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> also is provided. Display elements can be provided regarding route information, such as a grade and/or current <b>107</b> of the route <b>34</b>, curve and/or wayside elements <b>108</b>, including bridge location <b>109</b>, and speed <b>110</b>. The display <b>68</b> allows the operator to view such information and also see where the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> is along the route <b>34</b>. Information pertaining to distance and/or estimate time of arrival to such locations as crossings <b>112</b>, signals <b>114</b>, speed changes <b>116</b>, landmarks <b>118</b>, and destinations <b>120</b> is provided. An arrival time management tool <b>125</b> is also provided to allow the user to determine the fuel savings that is being realized during the trip. The operator has the ability to vary arrival times <b>127</b> and witness how this affects the fuel savings. As discussed herein, fuel saving is one example of only an objective that can be reviewed with a management tool. Toward this end, depending on the parameter being viewed, other parameters discussed herein can be viewed and evaluated with a management tool that is visible to the operator. The operator is also provided information about how long the crew has been operating the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. In example embodiments, time and distance information may either be illustrated as the time and/or distance until a particular event and/or location, or it may provide a total elapsed time.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an example display <b>68</b> provides information about consist data <b>130</b>, an events and situation graphic <b>132</b>, an arrival time management tool <b>134</b>, and action keys <b>136</b>. Similar information as discussed above is provided in this display as well. This display <b>68</b> also provides action keys <b>138</b> to allow the operator to re-plan as well as to disengage <b>140</b> the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts another example embodiment of the display. Data typical of a modern vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> including air-brake status <b>71</b>, analog speedometer with digital insert, or indicator, <b>74</b>, and information about tractive effort in pounds force (or traction amps for DC locomotives or other electrically powered motors or propulsion systems) may be visible. An indicator <b>74</b> is provided to show the current designated speed of the trip plan being executed, as well as an accelerometer graphic to supplement the readout in mph/minute. New data for execution of the trip plan is shown in the center of the display, including a rolling strip graphic <b>76</b> with designated speed and notch setting versus distance of the trip plan compared to a history of these variables. In the illustrated embodiment, the location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> is derived using the locator element <b>30</b>. As illustrated, the location may be provided by identifying how far the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train is from a final or other destination, an absolute position, an initial destination, an intermediate point, and/or from operator input.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The strip chart provides a look-ahead to changes in speed used to follow the trip plan, which may be used to advise an operator that manually controls operations of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. In one embodiment, the strip chart may display differences between designated settings of the trip plan versus actual operational conditions during automatic control of operations of the vehicle <b>24</b>, <b>402</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>. As discussed herein, such as when in the coaching mode, the operator can follow either the notch or speed suggested by the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, for example. The vertical bar provides a graphic of designated settings of the trip plan and actual settings of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b>, which also are displayed digitally below the strip chart in the illustrated embodiment. When continuous notch power is utilized, the display may round to the closest discrete equivalent in one embodiment. The display may be an analog display so that an analog equivalent or a percentage or actual horse power/tractive effort of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Information on status of the trip can be displayed on the display, which can include the current grade or current that the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> is encountering <b>88</b>, either by the lead vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b>, a location elsewhere along the vehicle train <b>31</b>, and/or an average over a length of the vehicle train <b>31</b>. A distance traveled <b>90</b> so far in the trip plan, cumulative fuel used <b>92</b>, where the next stop is planned <b>94</b> (or a distance there from), current and/or projected arrival time <b>96</b> at one or more locations, and/or expected time to arrive at one or more locations may be displayed. The display <b>68</b> may show an estimated time to one or more locations according to one or more available trip plans. If a later arrival is desired or selected, a re-plan of one or more trip plan may be performed. Delta plan data represents status for fuel and schedule ahead or behind a current trip plan. Negative numbers may represent less fuel consumed or early arrival time compared to the trip plan, positive numbers may represent more fuel consumed or late arrival time compared to the trip plan.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The display <b>68</b> may provide the operator of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> with information representative of a comparison between an actual operation or location of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and the designated operations or locations of the trip plan. The illustrated display is for illustration of one embodiment and other displays of the information may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Another feature that may be included in the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> is the providing of data logs and/or reports. This information may be stored on the vehicle train <b>31</b> and/or downloaded to an off-board system. Such downloads may occur via manual and/or wireless transmission. This information may also be viewable by the operator via the display <b>68</b>. The data may include such information as, but not limited to, operator inputs, time periods that the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> is operational, fuel saved by controlling the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> according to the trip plan, imbalance between fuel consumption across vehicles <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> in the vehicle train <b>31</b>, vehicle train <b>31</b> journey off course, system diagnostic issues (such as if a GPS sensor is malfunctioning), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may take allowable time periods that a crew of the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> may operator into consideration when a trip plan is created. For example, if a crew may operate for a limited time period (e.g., eight hours), then the trip plan may be created to include stopping locations and/or time periods to switch crews. Such specified stopping locations may include, but are not limited to rail yards, meet/pass locations, docking stations, ports of call, and the like. If, as the trip progresses, the trip time may be exceeded, the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may be overridden by the operator to meet criteria as determined by the operator. Ultimately, regardless of the operating conditions of the vehicle train, such as but not limited to high load, low speed, train stretch conditions, and the like, the operator remains in control to command a speed and/or operating condition of the vehicle or vehicle train.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Using the trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b>, the vehicle <b>42</b>, <b>204</b> and/or vehicle train <b>31</b> may operate in a plurality of manners or modes. In one embodiment, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may provide commands for commanding propulsion and dynamic braking. The operator then handles other vehicle operations. In another embodiment, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may provide commands for commanding propulsion only. The operator then handles dynamic braking and/or other vehicle operations. In yet another embodiment, the system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may provide commands for commanding propulsion, dynamic braking, and application of the brakes. The operator then handles other vehicle operations.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The trip optimizer system <b>300</b>, <b>700</b> may be configured to notify the operator of upcoming items of interest or actions to be taken. Specifically, using forecasting logic as described above, the continuous corrections and re-planning to the trip plan, and/or the route database, the operator can be notified of upcoming crossings, signals, grade changes, brake actions, sidings, rail yards, fuel stations, docks, slow or low wake zones, restricted zones, channel or other navigational makers, and the like. This notification may occur audibly and/or through the operator interface.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Specifically, using the physics based planning model, vehicle train set-up information, on-board route database, on-board operating rules, location determination system, real-time closed loop power/brake control, and sensor feedback, the system presents and/or notifies the operator of required actions. The notification can be visual and/or audible. Examples include notifying of crossings that require the operator to activate a horn and/or bell, and, in the case of rail vehicles, notifying of &#x201c;silent&#x201d; crossings that do not require the operator activate the locomotive horn or bell.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In another embodiment, using the physics based planning model discussed above, vehicle train set-up information, on-board route database, on-board operating rules, location determination system, real-time closed power/brake control, and sensor feedback, the system may present the operator information (e.g., a gauge on display) that allows the operator to see when the vehicle train will arrive at various locations, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The system allows the operator to adjust the trip plan (e.g., target arrival time). This information (actual estimated arrival time or information needed to derive off-board) can also be communicated to the dispatch center to allow the dispatcher or dispatch system to adjust the target arrival times. This allows the system to quickly adjust and optimize for the appropriate target function (for example trading off speed and fuel usage).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In one example involving marine vessels, a plurality of tugs may be operating together as vehicles <b>204</b> of a vehicle train, where all are moving the same larger vessel (e.g., the vehicle train <b>31</b>), with each tug is linked in time to accomplish the mission of moving the larger vessel. In another example, a single marine vessel may have a plurality of engines that operate as the vehicles <b>204</b> of the vehicle train <b>31</b> (e.g., the marine vessel). Off-highway vehicle (OHV) applications may involve a fleet of vehicles that have a same mission to move earth, from location &#x201c;A&#x201d; to location &#x201c;B,&#x201d; where each OHV is linked in time to accomplish the mission. With respect to a stationary power generating station, a plurality of stations may be grouped together for collectively generating power for a specific location and/or purpose. In another embodiment, a single station is provided, but with a plurality of generators making up the single station. In one example involving locomotive vehicles, a plurality of diesel powered systems may be operated together where all are moving the same larger load, where each system is linked in time to accomplish the mission of moving the larger load. In another embodiment, a locomotive vehicle may have more than one diesel powered system.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a system <b>200</b> for controlling a marine vessel <b>204</b> through a waterway <b>210</b>. The system <b>200</b> may be similar to the system <b>300</b> and/or <b>700</b>. For example, the system <b>200</b> may include the system <b>300</b> and/or <b>700</b> onboard the marine vessel <b>204</b> to generate a trip plan that dictates operational settings of the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel along the waterway <b>210</b> from a first location <b>212</b> (e.g., an initial or current location) to a second (e.g., intermediate or final) location <b>214</b>. For example, the marine vessel <b>204</b> may be one or more watercrafts traveling from an open-water location to a docking location at a docking station within the waterway <b>210</b>. The marine vessel <b>204</b> may be any vessel having a water propulsion system and a directional system, such as a vessel having a diesel engine and an alternator and/or rectifier combination which provides A/C or D/C electrical power to an electrically powered propulsion system, for example. However, the marine vessel <b>204</b> may powered by an engine or source other than a diesel engine. Operating the marine vessel <b>204</b> according to the operational settings designated by the trip plan can reduce at least one of fuel consumed and/or emissions generated by the marine vessel <b>204</b>, while causing the marine vessel <b>204</b> to arrive at a destination (or intermediate) location at a scheduled time or within a designated time range of the scheduled time. The scheduled time may be a time that the marine vessel <b>204</b> is to arrive at a docking station so that there is sufficient time (e.g., a designated unloading time period) to unload cargo and/or passengers being carried by the marine vessel <b>204</b>. For example, the scheduled time may be sufficiently far in advance of a time that another vehicle (such as a rail vehicle, another marine vessel, an airplane, an off-highway vehicle, or other automobile or truck) is scheduled to depart from the docking station (or another nearby station) that the cargo or passengers on the marine vehicle <b>204</b> can be unloaded and loaded onto the other vehicle. The other vehicle can then depart from the docking station at or no later than a scheduled time of the other vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the system <b>200</b> includes a processor or control unit <b>216</b> positioned on the marine vessel <b>204</b>. Alternatively, the processor <b>216</b> may be positioned at a remote location (e.g., off board) from the marine vessel <b>204</b>. The processor <b>216</b> includes or is connected with a memory <b>222</b>, such as a tangible computer readable storage medium, which stores one or more operating parameter(s) of the marine vessel <b>204</b> and navigational data of the waterway <b>210</b>. &#x201c;Operating parameter&#x201d; refers to an aspect of the marine vessel as relating to propulsion of the marine vessel <b>204</b> through the waterway <b>210</b>. Therefore, in one embodiment, the stored operating parameters may include a mass of the marine vessel <b>204</b>, a drag coefficient of the marine vessel <b>204</b>, and/or a power characteristic of a propulsion system <b>228</b> of the marine vessel <b>204</b>, for example. Additionally, in one embodiment, the stored navigational data of the waterway <b>210</b> includes one or more of a geographical map of the waterway <b>210</b> in computer readable form, a location of one or more obstacle(s) within the waterway <b>210</b>, one or more dimension(s) of the waterway <b>210</b>, one or more dock location(s) along the waterway <b>210</b>, forecast data (e.g., weather forecasts) of the waterway <b>210</b>, water current data (e.g., speed and/or direction of water flow) of the waterway <b>210</b>, and/or vessel traffic data within the waterway <b>210</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The marine vessel <b>204</b> includes a propulsion system <b>228</b> and a directional system <b>234</b>, which are both coupled to the processor <b>216</b>. The propulsion system <b>228</b> imparts a selective propulsion force on the marine vessel <b>204</b> to propel the marine vessel <b>204</b> through the waterway <b>210</b>. The propulsion system <b>228</b> operates based on a propulsion command received from the processor <b>216</b>. The propulsion command may instruct the power, horsepower, speed, and/or acceleration at which the marine vessel <b>204</b> is to move and the propulsion system <b>228</b> may generate sufficient force to meet the instructed power, speed, and/or acceleration. The directional system <b>234</b> controls the direction in which the marine vessel <b>204</b> is steered based on a direction command received from the processor <b>216</b>. For example, the directional system <b>234</b> may receive the direction command and control a rudder or other device that controls where the marine vessel <b>204</b> moves.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The propulsion system <b>228</b> and directional system <b>234</b> are configured to impart a velocity to the marine vessel <b>204</b> based on commands received from the processor <b>216</b>. The term &#x201c;velocity&#x201d; refers to a vector quantity comprising a speed and direction. The propulsion system <b>228</b> may include, for example, one or more propellers, a power source (e.g., engine) for driving the propellers, and/or a drive train connecting the power source and propellers. The propulsion system <b>228</b> may not be water based. For example, the propulsion system <b>228</b> may include an air-driver system (e.g., fans/propellers) and/or chemical propellant-based systems.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The directional system <b>234</b> may include, for example, a mechanism for changing the position or orientation of the propellers in the water, a rudder or rudder system, or the like. The propulsion system <b>228</b> and directional system <b>234</b> may be all or partially integrated, such as in an outboard motor.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one embodiment, the propulsion system <b>228</b> and the directional system <b>234</b> may be combined. For example, the propulsion system <b>228</b> and the directional system <b>234</b> can be provided as one or more sails of a wind-powered marine vessel <b>204</b>, where the sails are controlled based on the propulsion command and the direction command. The propulsion command may instruct the sails to raise or lower to increase or decrease, respectively, the force used to propel the marine vessel <b>204</b> from the wind. The direction command may instruct the sails to change orientation to move the marine vessel <b>204</b> in a corresponding direction.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The processor <b>216</b> includes or is coupled with a transceiver <b>252</b> that forms a communication link <b>259</b> with a remote (e.g., off board the marine vessel <b>204</b>) station <b>257</b>. Although the remote station <b>257</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is positioned adjacent to the second location <b>214</b>, the remote station <b>257</b> may be positioned at another location within a proximate range while being capable of establishing the communication link <b>259</b> with the processor <b>216</b> at one or more times during a trip of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the waterway <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, the remote station <b>257</b> may be positioned adjacent to a final location <b>214</b> of a trip of the marine vessel <b>204</b>. The remote station <b>257</b> transmits the one or more operating parameter(s) of the marine vessel <b>204</b> and/or the navigational data of the waterway <b>210</b> to the processor <b>216</b> over the communication link <b>259</b> subsequent to receiving a request signal from the processor <b>216</b> over the communication link. Alternatively, the remote station <b>257</b> may periodically transmit such information to the processor <b>216</b> and/or may transmit such information when prompted by an operator at the remote station <b>257</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Using the methods for generating a trip plan described above, the processor <b>216</b> determines a trip plan for the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel through the waterway <b>210</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>. Alternatively, the trip plan may be provided by the remote station <b>257</b> and communicated to the processor <b>216</b>. The trip plan may include a designated path <b>202</b> for the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel. For example, in contrast to vehicles such as automobiles and rail vehicles that have fixed routes, the processor <b>216</b> can examine a variety of paths along a waterway <b>210</b> for the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel along. The trip plan can include designated propulsion commands <b>229</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) and/or designated direction commands <b>235</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-14</figref>) to dictate how the marine vessel <b>204</b> propels itself along the path of the trip plan. The designated propulsion commands <b>229</b> and/or direction commands <b>235</b> can be expressed as a function of at least one of time and/or distance along the designated path, and can be transmitted to the propulsion and directional systems <b>228</b>, <b>234</b> at one or more incremental locations <b>240</b> along the path <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates examples of designated propulsion commands <b>229</b> of a trip plan that are transmitted from the processor <b>216</b> to the propulsion system <b>228</b> as the marine vessel <b>204</b> travels along the waterway <b>210</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates examples of designated direction commands <b>235</b> of the trip plan that are transmitted from the processor <b>216</b> to the propulsion system <b>228</b> as the marine vessel <b>204</b> travels along the waterway <b>210</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates other examples of designated direction commands <b>235</b> of the trip plan that are transmitted from the processor <b>216</b> to the propulsion system <b>228</b> as the marine vessel <b>204</b> travels along the waterway <b>210</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b> may change at different times or locations (e.g., as represented by the horizontal axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) along the trip, and may be expressed as throttle settings and/or directions (e.g. forward or backward). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the designated direction commands <b>235</b> may change at different times or locations (e.g., as represented by the horizontal axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) along the trip, and may be expressed as angular orientations of a rudder or other steering component. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the designated direction commands <b>235</b> may alternatively or additionally be expressed as changes in heading directions of the marine vessel <b>204</b> about or along a center path (e.g., the designated path <b>202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The processor <b>216</b> determines the path <b>202</b>, and the propulsion commands <b>229</b>, and/or direction commands <b>235</b> so to optimize a performance characteristic of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the designated path <b>202</b>. In one example embodiment, the optimization of the performance characteristic of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the optimal path <b>202</b> is one of an optimization (e.g., increase but not necessarily maximizing or the largest possible) of a fuel efficiency of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the optimal path <b>202</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the optimization of the performance characteristic of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the optimal path <b>202</b> is one of an optimization (e.g., an increase but not necessarily maximizing or the largest possible) of an energy efficiency of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the optimal path <b>202</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the optimization of the performance characteristic of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the optimal path <b>202</b> is one of an optimization (e.g., reduction but not necessarily elimination or the shortest possible) of a transit time of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the designated path <b>202</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the optimization of the performance characteristic of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the optimal path <b>202</b> is one of a waypoint arrival time (e.g., arriving at a scheduled arrival time or within a designated time range of a scheduled arrival time) at one or more incremental or intermediate locations <b>240</b> of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the designated path <b>202</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The determination of the designated path <b>202</b>, the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b>, and/or the designated direction commands <b>235</b> can be based on the first location <b>212</b>, the second location <b>214</b>, the one or more operating parameter(s) of the marine vessel <b>204</b>, the designated performance characteristic to be optimized, the received navigational data of the waterway <b>210</b>, and the like. However, these determinations may be based on less than all of these parameters, or may be based on additional parameters related to the operating conditions of the marine vessel <b>204</b> and/or the conditions of the waterway <b>210</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As the marine vessel <b>204</b> travels along the designated path <b>202</b>, the processor <b>216</b> may be switched into an automatic mode to cause the marine vessel <b>204</b> to be automatically controlled to have a path of travel along the designated path <b>202</b> and/or to provide the actual propulsion designated by the propulsion commands <b>229</b>. The marine vessel <b>204</b> can include a position determination device <b>264</b> to measure a position of the marine vessel <b>204</b>, such as a global position system (GPS) transceiver in communication with one or more GPS satellites, an inertial navigational system, a LORAN system, a sensed magnetic compass, and/or a radar system such as a primary, transponder or Doppler radar system, for example. The position determination device <b>264</b> is coupled to the processor <b>216</b> to transmit the measured position to the processor <b>216</b> as the marine vessel <b>204</b> travels along the designated path <b>202</b> of the waterway <b>210</b>. The designated optimal path <b>202</b> that can be determined by the processor <b>216</b> includes designated positions of the marine vessel <b>204</b> through the waterway <b>210</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>. At one or more intermediate or incremental locations <b>240</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>, the processor <b>216</b> may sample (e.g., determine) the actual position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> and compare the actual position with the expected or designated position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> at the respective incremental location <b>240</b> according to the trip plan. If the measured positioned does not vary from the designated position of the trip plan, then no corrective action may be performed by the processor <b>216</b>. On the other hand, if the measured position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> varies from the designated position of the trip plan, but by less than a predetermined threshold distance stored in the memory <b>222</b> of the processor <b>216</b>, then the processor <b>216</b> can determine and transmit a corrective propulsion command and/or a corrective direction command to cause the propulsion system and the direction system to propel the marine vessel <b>204</b> toward the designated position of the designated path <b>202</b>. Alternatively, if the measured position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> varies from the designated position by less than the predetermined threshold distance, and/or if the processor <b>216</b> determines that the variation in locations is due to an error in one of the inputted first location, second location, the one or more operating parameter(s), the navigational data, and the like (upon which the trip plan is based), then the processor <b>216</b> is configured to correct the error in the inputted data so to avoid future variations between the measured and expected position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> at subsequent incremental locations <b>240</b> along the waterway <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Alternatively, if the measured or actual position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> deviates from the designated position of the trip plan by more than the threshold distance, then the processor <b>216</b> (or the remote location) can modify (e.g., re-plan) the trip plan with an initial location of the marine vessel <b>204</b> being the current position of the marine vessel <b>204</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, if a measured or actual position <b>274</b> of the marine vessel <b>204</b> varies with the designated position <b>276</b> by more than the stored predetermined threshold, the processor <b>216</b> determines a substitute designated path <b>270</b> for the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel through the waterway <b>210</b> from the measured position <b>274</b> to the second location <b>214</b>. The processor <b>216</b> may recalculate the designated path <b>270</b>, with the measured position <b>274</b> being used in place of the first location <b>212</b> for the previous designated path <b>202</b> formed by the processor <b>216</b>. The processor <b>216</b> also may determine one or more substitute or modified propulsion commands and/or substitute direction commands associated with one or more locations along the substitute designated path <b>270</b>. The determination of the substitute path <b>270</b>, the substitute propulsion commands, and the substitute direction commands may be based on the measured position <b>274</b>, the second location <b>214</b>, the one or more operating parameter(s), the designated performance characteristic to be optimized, the navigational data, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">While the marine vessel <b>204</b> is traveling along the designated path <b>202</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the second location <b>214</b>, and the processor <b>216</b> is in the automatic mode (e.g., is automatically controlling the propulsion and directional systems to automatically implement the designated operational settings of the trip plan), an operator of the marine vessel <b>204</b> may switch the processor <b>216</b> from the automatic mode to a manual mode. In the manual mode, the measured position, the designated position, the designated propulsion command <b>229</b>, and/or the designated direction command <b>235</b> at one or more intermediate or incremental locations <b>240</b> are transmitted to and displayed on an operator interface (such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>). After viewing the operator interface, the operator may manually control one or more control devices of the marine vessel <b>204</b> to transmit a propulsion command that is equivalent or similar to the designated propulsion command <b>229</b> to the propulsion system <b>228</b> and/or to transmit a direction command that is equivalent or similar to the designated direction command <b>235</b> to the directional system <b>234</b>. Additionally, the operator may transmit a propulsion and direction command which differ from the respective designated propulsion and direction command, such as when unforeseeable circumstances arise (e.g., events that the trip plan is not based on), such as a sudden change in water current, changes in vessel traffic, an obstacle, and/or the designated commands appear to be inaccurate, to divert the marine vessel <b>204</b> away from the designated path <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In one embodiment, at one or more, or each, of the incremental locations <b>240</b> along the waterway <b>210</b>, the processor <b>216</b> determines and stores an emergency propulsion command and/or an emergency direction command in the memory <b>222</b>. The emergency propulsion and direction commands are based on the measured position of the marine vessel <b>204</b> and a location of a dock within the waterway <b>210</b>. The location of the dock may be obtained from the stored navigational data, or can be designated by the operator on the interface. The location of the dock upon which the emergency commands are based may be the location of a dock that is closer to the marine vessel <b>204</b> (e.g., along a path in the waterway <b>210</b>) than one or more, or all, other docks in the waterway <b>210</b>. Thus, in an emergency situation, such as if an unforeseeable circumstance arises, such as an unforeseeable water current, vessel traffic, an obstacle, and/or marine vessel <b>204</b> system failure, an operator may switch the processor <b>216</b> from the automatic or manual mode into a safety mode. In the safety mode, the processor <b>216</b> transmits the emergency propulsion and/or direction commands to the propulsion system <b>228</b> and/or directional system <b>234</b>, in order to direct the marine vessel <b>204</b> to the location of the dock. The dock location may be referred to as a designated safe location or default safe position. The designated safe location may change as the marine vessel <b>204</b> moves along the waterway <b>210</b>. Alternatively, from an automatic mode, the processor <b>216</b> may compare the measured position with the navigational data, such as an obstacle within the waterway <b>210</b> and/or a boundary of the waterway <b>210</b>, for example. If the processor <b>216</b> determines that the measured position is within a predetermined threshold distance of the navigational data, the processor <b>216</b> switches from the automatic mode to a safety mode and transmits the emergency propulsion and direction commands to the respective propulsion system <b>228</b> and directional system <b>234</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In another embodiment, the designated safe location or default safe position may be the current location. For example, when the marine vessel <b>204</b> enters the safety mode, the processor <b>216</b> may generate commands to stop propulsion and remain in the current location.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">An operator input interface may be provided within the marine vessel <b>204</b>, including a display and an input device. The operator input interface is coupled to the processor <b>216</b>, and is activated to input one or more of the first location, the second location, a desired transit time, and/or the performance characteristic to be optimized, for example. Subsequent to inputting this data, the input device is activated to prompt the processor <b>216</b> to determine the designated path <b>202</b>, the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b>, and the designated direction commands <b>235</b> of the marine vessel <b>204</b> through the waterway <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">When the marine vessel <b>204</b> approaches a final location <b>214</b> (e.g., a landing at which the vessel is supposed to dock), control over movement of the marine vessel <b>204</b> may be transferred from the processor <b>216</b> to the remote station <b>257</b> so that the entity (e.g., an operator at a port location) that controls the movement of the marine vessel <b>204</b> has a viewpoint or visual perspective from outside the marine vessel. As discussed above, the transceiver <b>252</b> of the processor <b>216</b> forms a communication link <b>259</b> with a remote station <b>257</b>, such as a remote station positioned adjacent to or near the final location <b>214</b>. When the marine vessel <b>204</b> is located within a threshold distance of the final location <b>214</b> or another designated docking location, the processor <b>216</b> may transmit a request command signal to the remote station <b>257</b> over the communication link <b>259</b>. In response, the remote station <b>257</b> can transmit an acknowledge command signal to the processor <b>216</b>. After the transmission of the acknowledge command signal, the processor <b>216</b> may stop transmitting the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b> and/or designated direction commands <b>235</b> of the trip plan to the propulsion and directional systems <b>228</b>, <b>234</b>. Instead, control of the marine vessel <b>204</b> may be transferred to the remote station <b>257</b>, which may transmit one or more propulsion commands and/or direction commands to the propulsion and/or directional systems <b>228</b>, <b>234</b> when the marine vessel <b>204</b> is located at one or more incremental or intermediate locations along the threshold distance to the final location <b>214</b>. The remote station <b>257</b> may include a manual operator who transmits propulsion and direction commands to the marine vessel <b>204</b>, based on his or her visual monitoring of the marine vessel <b>204</b> entering the final location <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In another embodiment, the processor <b>216</b> may generate a docking plan or receive a docking plan from the remote station <b>257</b>. The docking plan may be similar to a trip plan in that the docking plan may include one or more designated operational settings (e.g., propulsion and/or direction commands) expressed as a function of distance and/or time as the marine vessel <b>204</b> travels from a starting location (e.g., the second location) to a docking location (e.g., when the marine vessel <b>204</b> is docked). The processor <b>216</b> can automatically control operations of the marine vessel <b>204</b> according to the docking plan to get the marine vessel <b>204</b> to dock and/or may present instructions to an operator onboard the marine vessel <b>204</b> or in the remote station <b>257</b> in order to direct the operator to manually control operations of the marine vessel <b>204</b> to guide the marine vessel <b>204</b> to the dock.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The docking plan may take into account open or available spaces at a dock. For example, during busy time periods, relatively few spaces at a dock may be available to dock the marine vessel <b>204</b>. The docking plan may designate direction commands that cause the marine vessel <b>204</b> to be guided to an open or available docking location. The identification of open or available docking locations can be provided by the remote station <b>257</b>. The docking plan may designate propulsion commands that cause the marine vessel <b>204</b> to be guided to an occupied docking location (e.g., another marine vessel is currently located at the dock) at a time when the other marine vessel has departed and the dock is available.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In another embodiment, the processor <b>216</b> may re-plan or otherwise update a trip plan being used to control movement of the marine vessel <b>204</b> along the designated path <b>202</b> to change a time of arrival of the marine vessel <b>204</b> at the dock. For example, if a first schedule of the marine vessel <b>204</b> includes the marine vessel <b>204</b> arriving and docking at a dock at a first time, the processor <b>216</b> can generate a first trip plan that directs operations of the marine vessel <b>204</b> to arrive at the dock at the first time. But, due to schedule changes at the dock (e.g., one or more other marine vessels staying longer at the docks or leaving earlier than expected), the processor <b>216</b> may change the trip plan en route to the dock. For example, if a docking location of the marine vessel <b>204</b> at the dock is available or will be available earlier than the previously scheduled first time, then the processor <b>216</b> may change the trip plan to cause the marine vessel <b>204</b> to arrive at an earlier second time at the dock. Conversely, if the docking location is occupied and will be occupied when the marine vessel <b>204</b> is scheduled to arrive, then the processor <b>216</b> may change the trip plan so that the arrival time of the marine vessel <b>204</b> at the dock is delayed until a later time when the docking location is available. Changing the trip plan in this way can further reduce fuel consumed and/or emissions generated by the marine vessel <b>204</b> as the modified trip plan may direct the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel at slower speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In another embodiment, the marine vessel <b>204</b> can include one or more sensors <b>278</b> that monitor characteristics of the waterway <b>210</b>. The sensor <b>278</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may represent a single sensor or multiple sensors. The sensor <b>278</b> can monitor a direction and/or speed of water current flow in the waterway <b>210</b>, a direction and/or speed of wind movement above the waterway <b>210</b>, a temperature of the waterway <b>210</b>, salinity of the water in the waterway <b>210</b>, a depth of the waterway <b>210</b>, and the like. The sensor <b>278</b> generates sensed signals that are communicated to the processor <b>216</b> for reporting the monitored characteristics of the waterway <b>210</b>. Alternatively, one or more of the characteristics of the waterway <b>210</b> may be communicated to the processor <b>216</b> from an off-board location, such as the remote facility <b>257</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The processor <b>216</b> can generate or modify the trip plan based on the characteristics of the waterway <b>210</b>. For example, the processor <b>216</b> can create the designated direction commands of the trip plan to be oriented along a common direction as the direction of the current and/or wind for one or more portions of the trip plan. Orienting the direction of travel of the marine vessel <b>204</b> with the current and/or wind can allow the propulsive force that is generated by the propulsion system of the marine vessel <b>204</b> to be reduced relative to traveling along another direction. The direction of travel of the marine vessel <b>204</b> may be aligned with the current or wind when the heading or angular orientation of the direction of travel and the direction of the current flow or wind movement are within a designated range of each other, such as within 1 degree, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, and the like. As another example, the processor <b>216</b> can modify a current trip plan if the directional commands of the trip plan cause the marine vessel <b>204</b> to travel against the direction of current flow and/or wind movement. The marine vessel <b>204</b> may travel against the direction of current flow and/or wind movement when the direction of travel and the direction of current flow and/or wind movement are not within a designated range of each other, such as the directions being 150 to 180 degrees apart from each other. The processor <b>216</b> can change the designated path of the marine vessel <b>204</b> so that the marine vessel <b>204</b> does not travel against the direction of the current flow and/or wind for more than a threshold distance or time. In one embodiment, the processor <b>216</b> may change the trip plan when the speed of the current and/or wind exceeds a designated threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In another embodiment, the processor <b>216</b> may generate or modify a trip plan based on the depth of the waterway <b>210</b>. For example, the marine vessel <b>204</b> may be able to travel at faster speeds using less propulsive power (e.g., and less fuel and/or emission generation) in deeper areas of the waterway <b>210</b> than shallower areas. The processor <b>216</b> may create or modify portions of the designated path to travel through deeper parts of the waterway <b>210</b> to reduce the amount of fuel consumed and/or emissions generated.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As described above, the processor <b>216</b> may re-plan (e.g., modify) the trip plan if movement of the marine vessel <b>204</b> deviates from the trip plan by more than a designated amount. The processor <b>216</b> can periodically compare an actual operational condition (e.g., an actual location, actual propulsive force, actual direction, and the like) of the marine vessel <b>204</b> with a designated operational setting of the trip plan (e.g., a designated location, designated propulsive force, and a designated direction) to determine whether to modify the trip plan. A frequency at which the processor <b>216</b> periodically compares the actual operational condition to the designated operational setting can be based on the at least one of the direction of water current flow, the speed of the water current flow, the direction of wind movement, or the speed of the wind movement. For example, as the speed and/or direction of the wind and/or current changes, the marine vessel <b>204</b> may be more likely to be moved (e.g., blown) off course. As a result, in one embodiment, as the speed of the current or wind increases, the processor <b>216</b> may more frequently check to see if the trip plan needs to be modified (e.g., in case the marine vessel <b>204</b> has been blown off course). Conversely, as the speed of the current or wind decreases, the processor <b>216</b> may check to see if the trip plan needs to be modified on a less frequent basis.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a combination of vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> may include the first marine vessel <b>204</b> and a second marine vessel <b>206</b> that is coupled to the first marine vessel <b>204</b>. The combination of the marine vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> may be referred to a consist, vehicle consist, or vehicle train, such as the vehicle train <b>31</b>. The second marine vessel <b>206</b> has a second propulsion system <b>230</b> and a second directional system <b>236</b> similar to the propulsion system <b>228</b> and directional system <b>234</b> of the first marine vessel <b>204</b>. The second marine vessel <b>206</b> includes a transceiver <b>254</b> which establishes a communication link <b>260</b> with the transceiver <b>252</b> of the marine vessel <b>204</b>. Thus, the secondary propulsion system <b>230</b> and the second directional system <b>236</b> are coupled to the processor <b>216</b>, through the communication link <b>260</b>. Additionally, the second propulsion system <b>230</b> and second directional system <b>236</b> can be coupled to a second processor <b>218</b> on the second marine vessel <b>206</b>. The second propulsion system <b>230</b> imparts a propulsion force on the second marine vessel <b>206</b> based on a propulsion command <b>231</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) that is received from the first and/or second processor <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The second directional system <b>236</b> directs the second marine vessel <b>206</b> to move in a selected direction based on a direction command <b>237</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref>) received from the first processor <b>216</b> and/or second processor <b>218</b>. The processor <b>216</b> and/or the processor <b>218</b> determine the designated path <b>202</b> for the combination of vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> through the waterway <b>210</b> from the first location <b>212</b> to the final or other second location <b>214</b>. Travel of the combination of vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> along the designated path <b>202</b> may be carried out based on a transmission of the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b>, <b>231</b> and/or the designated direction commands <b>235</b>, <b>237</b> to the combination of vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> at one or more incremental or intermediate locations <b>240</b> along the waterway <b>210</b>. In addition to the one or more operating parameter(s) of the marine vessel <b>204</b> and/or <b>206</b>, the memory <b>222</b> of the processor <b>216</b> and/or the processor <b>218</b> can store one or more operating parameter(s) of the second marine vessel <b>206</b>. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, although the processor <b>216</b> of the first marine vessel <b>204</b> determines the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b>, <b>231</b> and designated direction commands <b>235</b>, <b>237</b> which are transmitted to the combination of vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, in another embodiment, the system <b>200</b> may be similarly configured such that the second processor <b>218</b> on the second marine vessel <b>206</b> determines the designated path <b>202</b> for the combination of vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, the designated propulsion commands <b>229</b>, <b>231</b>, and/or the designated direction commands <b>235</b>, <b>237</b> of the combination of the vessels <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>.

<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Another embodiment relates to a method for controlling operations of a marine vessel (or combination of marine vessels) along a waterway. According to the method, the marine vessel is controlled based on an optimized or designated mission plan, typically for reducing fuel use, reducing emissions output, or optimizing some other performance characteristic of the marine vessel. For calculating the mission plan, which includes a designated path for the marine vessel along the waterway, navigational data and marine vessel operating parameters are received, e.g., from a database or otherwise. The navigational data includes data relating to one or more characteristics of a waterway on which the marine vessel is to travel, including, possibly, data relating to at least one speed limit along the waterway. The mission plan is created on-board the marine vessel at any time during travel of the marine vessel along the waterway. The mission plan is created at a first point along the waterway based on the received data, and covers at least a segment of the waterway extending to a second point further along the waterway than the first point. The mission plan is created based on the received data, the first and second points, and the performance characteristic of the marine vessel to be optimized, using the optimization computational methods described in detail above. The mission plan is created for covering the entirety of the segment based on, and regardless of, all the different hydrographic or geographic features or other characteristics of the waterway along the segment for which data is available. By this, it is meant: (i) the mission plan takes into consideration all the different geographic or hydrographic features or other characteristics of the route segment for which data is available, and (ii) the mission plan is created regardless of what particular geographic or hydrographic features or other characteristics of the waterway are along the segment. Thus, no matter what known geographic or hydro graphic features or other waterway characteristics are along a segment, a mission plan is created for that segment. The method further comprises controlling the marine vessel according to the mission plan as the marine vessel travels along the waterway.</p>
