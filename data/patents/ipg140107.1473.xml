<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to apparatus, systems and methods for the relocation of subsurface conduit. Specifically, the present disclosure relates to the movement of underground conduit, including, but not limited to, cables and pipes in either or both of laterally from a first lateral position to a second lateral position and/or vertically from a first vertical position to a second vertical position.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is, of course, generally known to bury cables, pipes and conduits underground for the transport of electricity, material and/or information. In many cases, cables, pipes and conduits are disposed underground beneath or in the vicinity and running parallel to roadways. Particularly in urban environments, when it is necessary to expand or relocate the path of a roadway, construction crews will often be required to relocate underground structures to avoid rending such structures inaccessible. For example, electrical, telephone and/or fiber optic cables are frequently buried encased in a conduit structure, such as clay tile or a raceway unitary subterranean support structure for the cables, individual raceway sections are placed end to end and mortared together. These conduit structures are frequently buried near the side of a roadway and follow along the path of the roadway. When the roadway is widened, the cables routed through the conduit structure typically must be moved to avoid buying cables beneath the expanded roadway surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, to move cables routed through a conduit structure, the conduit structure is exposed and destroyed. The cables are then removed from the conduit and bundled. The cable bundles are suspended from ropes or ties as the new location for the cables is excavated. A replacement conduit, such as a two-piece replacement conduit made of a polymer such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), may be used to house the cables in the new location. The cable bundle is placed into the first conduit piece, and the second conduit piece is attached thereto to form a closed conduit. Such as two-piece PVC replacement conduit each has flanges that abut one another when the pieces are assembled, and the flanges are then secured together by fasteners or tie wraps. Alternatively, the replacement conduit may be a plywood form into which the suspended cables are lowered after the form is placed in the excavated area at the new cable location. After placement in the new location, concrete is poured over the replacement conduit, thereby cementing the cable bundles in their new location.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While this process is effective, it is time consuming and expensive. Further, the cable bundles may become kinked or damaged from the ropes or ties used to suspend the cables after removal from the original conduit. Further, the original conduit may contain hazardous materials, such as asbestos, potentially adding to the cost and complexity of the traditional cable relocation method.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Similar problems are present when underground piping, such as natural gas and petroleum lines, must be moved to accommodate the widening of a roadway.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need, therefore, exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit. Specifically, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit without destroying the subsurface conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit without substantially interrupting the flow of material, electricity and/or information through the conduit. Moreover, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit efficiently and expeditiously.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still further, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit in the event a roadway must be widened. Thus, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit laterally so as to be placed in a proper location as a roadway is widened. Moreover, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit to a different depth in the event that a conduit must be moved up or down in relation to the surface. In addition, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit in both laterally and in depth.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A need further exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit to follow a roadway in parallel either beneath the roadway or in the general vicinity of the roadway. Moreover, a need exists for apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit to follow a curved path; such as if the roadway is curved or otherwise has turns.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure provides apparatus, systems and methods that facilitate movement of underground (subsurface) conduit, without disturbing the integrity of the original conduit. In an embodiment, the area around the conduit is first excavated, exposing one side of the conduit and leaving a buffer of subterranean material on the remaining sides. Sheets of metal pile are driven into the subterranean material underneath the conduit to create an elongated support surface for the conduit and subterranean material buffer. The sheets of metal pile are coupled to a translation system so that the metal pile, subterranean material buffer, and conduit are simultaneously relocated to a new position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Once in the new position, the translation system is decoupled from the sheet pile. The sheet pile may optionally be removed from underneath the subterranean material and conduit. The excavated area is filled in around the conduit to complete the process. Advantageously, long sections of conduit may be moved as a single section using the translation system while keeping the conduit intact and structurally sound, thereby obviating the need to replace or rebuild conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a conduit transport system for transferring a conduit from a first lateral position to a second lateral position, or a first vertical position to a second vertical position, or both a first lateral position to a second lateral position and a first vertical position to a second vertical position. The system may include a plurality of lateral supports sized to extend from the first to the second lateral position, a plurality of trolley assemblies adapted to translated along the plurality of lateral supports, a plurality of lift mechanisms (each individually associated with a trolley assembly and adapted to either simultaneously or consecutively translate at least one longitudinal support from the first vertical position to the second vertical position), at least one longitudinal conduit support coupled to each linear actuator, with each linear actuator coupled to a respective one of the trolley assemblies, in which the linear actuators are operable to translate the plurality of trolley assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the present invention provides the capability to move the system and the collective components thereof, longitudinally along the conduit structure to reposition the system in another location along the conduit structure. Further, the present invention provides the capability to steer the system, or portions thereof, such as the plurality of lateral supports, trolley assemblies, lift actuators, linear actuators and/or longitudinal conduit supports laterally towards or away from the conduit structure when repositioning the same along the conduit structure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method of moving conduit laterally, in which the method includes: excavating an area around the conduit; placing a plurality of lateral supports across the excavated area; placing at least one longitudinal conduit support upon the plurality of lateral supports so that the longitudinal conduit is positioned over the conduit; driving a plurality of plates underneath the conduit and longitudinal conduit; coupling the plurality of plates to the longitudinal conduit so that the conduit is vertically supported by the plates; and sliding the longitudinal conduit laterally across the plurality of lateral supports.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method of moving conduit up or down relative to a ground surface, the method comprises: excavating an area around the conduit; placing a plurality of lateral supports across the excavated area; placing at least one longitudinal conduit support upon the plurality of lateral supports so that the longitudinal conduit is positioned over the conduit; driving a plurality of plates underneath the conduit and longitudinal conduit; coupling the plurality of plates to the longitudinal conduit so that the conduit is vertically supported by the plates; and moving the longitudinal conduit up or down relative to the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method for transferring a conduit from a first lateral position to a second lateral position and up or down relative to a ground surface, the method comprises: excavating an area around the conduit; placing a plurality of lateral supports across the excavated area; placing at least one longitudinal conduit support upon the plurality of lateral supports so that the longitudinal conduit is positioned over the conduit; driving a plurality of plates underneath the conduit and longitudinal conduit; coupling the plurality of plates to the longitudinal conduit so that the conduit is vertically supported by the plates; moving the longitudinal conduit laterally; and moving the longitudinal conduit up or down relative to the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is, therefore, an advantage of the present invention to provide apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit. Specifically, it is an advantage of the present invention to provide apparatus, systems and methods for relocating subsurface conduit without destroying the subsurface conduit.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As indicated above, the present disclosure provides a method and apparatus which allows the lateral and/or up and down translation of conduit together with a buffer of subterranean material within which the conduit is buried. More particularly, the present disclosure provides a system in which the conduit is supported and protected from underneath by a support surface, and the support surface is suspended from a frame capable of lifting the conduit, lowering the conduit, and/or translating the conduit laterally as a single unit. Thus the structural integrity of the conduit is preserved, even if the conduit material is brittle or delicate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in the figures, conduits C, C&#x2032; and C&#x2033; are depicted as being raceways, each of which may have a plurality of openings extending along its longitudinal axis for the receipt of wires, cables, or other types of conduit therethrough. However, while shown herein as a raceway, conduits C, C&#x2032; and C&#x2033; may each be any type of conduit, such as a gas line, an oil line, an individual wire or bundle of wires, a fiber optic line or bundle of fiber optic lines, a sewer line, a fuel line, an electric line, an aqueduct, a phone line, and/or any other type of known conduit or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conduit relocation system <b>10</b> may include a plurality of translation rails <b>12</b> of sufficient length to span an excavated trench T having conduit C located therein. A pair of conduit support beams <b>14</b> may be disposed atop translation rails <b>12</b> by means of trolleys <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and above conduit C, so that conduit support beams <b>14</b> may be used to lift, lower and/or support conduit C as conduit support beams <b>14</b> translate along translation rails <b>12</b>, as described in further detail below. Conduit support beams <b>14</b> extend across a distance Dc, which is the distance between junction points J disposed at each end of conduit C.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one exemplary embodiment, illustrated in the Figures, Dc may be about 500 to about 1000 feet in length, such as about 750 feet in length. Generally, Dc is a distance determined by the original installers of conduit C between junction points J. For example, any number of translation rails <b>12</b> may be placed along the width of trench T to support conduit C along the extent of support beams <b>14</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, translation rails <b>12</b> are separated by distance D<sub>R</sub>, which is calculated to provide adequate support for the weight of beams <b>14</b>, curved sheet pile <b>18</b>, conduit C and any surrounding subterranean material, as discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this illustrated embodiment, distance DR between respective pairs of translation rails <b>12</b> is about 40 feet, which is an appropriate distance for an exemplary conduit C used for underground routing of telecommunication cables. In this exemplary embodiment, conduit C is made of a clay material and has a square cross-sectional shaped with cross-sectional dimensions of about 13 inches by 13 inches. Conduit C may be buried beside roadway R (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), for example, such that conduit C is translatable by conduit relocation system <b>10</b> in order to provide additional space to widen roadway R.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that conduit relocation system <b>10</b> may be adapted to a variety of uses and scales, in which the relative sizes and weights of translation rails <b>12</b>, conduit support beams <b>14</b> and conduit C (or other subterranean structure) may vary widely. In such alternative embodiments, distance D<sub>R </sub>between translation rails <b>12</b> will also vary widely, as will distance D<sub>C </sub>representing the length of the structure to be translated. To accommodate this variability of scale, distance D<sub>R </sub>may be expressed as a fraction of distance D<sub>C</sub>. This fraction may be between about 1/12 and about 1/25, for example. Similarly, the number of translation rails <b>12</b> required to accommodate distance D<sub>C </sub>will also vary depending on the parameters of the system to be moved, and may be as few as two or three translation rails <b>12</b> or as many as several dozen of translation rails <b>12</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a portion of conduit relocation system <b>10</b> is shown including a pair of neighboring translation rails <b>12</b> and a section of conduit support beams <b>14</b>. Conduit C is disposed underneath and generally centered between conduit support beams <b>14</b> in an initial or original position within trench T. As will be described in detail below, support beams <b>14</b> and conduit C are translatable in the direction of arrow A within trench T to relocate conduit C to a second or relocated position.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">To facilitate the translation of support beams <b>14</b> across translation rails <b>12</b>, trolleys <b>16</b> are disposed between an upper surface of each translation rail <b>12</b> and lower surfaces of support beams <b>14</b>. As discussed below, trolleys <b>16</b> provide a smooth rolling interface between conduit support beams <b>14</b> and respective translation rails <b>12</b>, thereby minimizing the force required to translate conduit C within trench T. In the illustrated embodiment, translation rails <b>12</b> are vertically oriented I-beams, i.e., the web of the I-beam is vertically oriented while the flanges of the I-beam provide the lower support surface spanning trench T and the upper support surface for trolley <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, curved sheet pile <b>18</b> is disposed beneath conduit C and coupled to trolley <b>16</b> via support structure <b>20</b>. Support structure <b>20</b> includes a suspension member or rod <b>22</b> having beam connection end <b>24</b> coupled to conduit support beam <b>14</b> and pile connection end <b>26</b> coupled to curved sheet pile <b>18</b>. Specifically, beam connection end <b>24</b> of rod <b>22</b> is threaded to accept nut <b>30</b>, so that rod <b>22</b> may be passed through a hole formed in support beam <b>14</b> and nut <b>30</b> may then be threaded onto beam connection end <b>24</b>. Nut <b>30</b> cooperates with support beam <b>14</b> to prevent downward movement of support structure <b>20</b>, as well as to facilitate upward movement of rod <b>22</b> via rotation of nut <b>30</b>. Pile connection end <b>26</b> includes J-hook <b>29</b> adapted to pass through a slot (not shown) formed in curved sheet pile <b>18</b> in one rotational orientation and engage sheet pile <b>18</b> in another rotational orientation (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), thereby coupling support structure <b>20</b> to sheet pile <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Exemplary curved sheet pile <b>18</b> and support structures <b>20</b> are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/488,045 entitled METHODS FOR THE SUBTERRANEAN SUPPORT OF UNDERGROUND CONDUITS, filed Jun. 19, 2009, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/500,906 entitled APPARATUS FOR INSERTING SHEET PILE HAVING AN INDEPENDENTLY ADJUSTABLE INSERTION ACCESS AND METHOD FOR USING THE SAME, filed Jul. 10, 2009, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, translation system <b>10</b> includes translation driver <b>32</b> to provide the requisite force for translating conduit support beams <b>14</b> along translation rails <b>12</b>. Translation driver <b>32</b> includes motor <b>34</b> operatively coupled with a transmission <b>36</b> including a ball screw bearing or lead screw bearing, and a corresponding ball screw or lead screw <b>38</b> extending between transmission <b>36</b> and trolley <b>16</b>. Lead screw <b>38</b> is fixedly coupled with trolley <b>16</b>, as described in detail below, and is rotatably coupled in force transferring relationship with transmission <b>36</b>. When motor <b>34</b> is activated, such as by control <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), transmission <b>36</b> rotates the screw bearing, causing linear translation of lead screw <b>38</b>. The translation of lead screw <b>38</b> causes trolley <b>16</b> and support beams <b>14</b> to roll along translation rail <b>12</b>, thereby translating conduit C within trench T.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each translation rail <b>12</b> may include a respective translation driver <b>32</b>, and control <b>40</b> may be operatively coupled to each translation driver <b>32</b>. As described in detail below, coupling a single control <b>40</b> to each of the multiple translation drivers <b>32</b> in translation system <b>10</b> may facilitate uniform movement of the entire span of conduit support beams <b>14</b> along all of translation rails <b>12</b>, thereby uniformly distributing the force required to move conduit C across the span of conduit support beams <b>14</b>. However, it is contemplated that other devices and methods may be used to provide the needed force for translation of support beams <b>14</b> and conduit C upon translation rails <b>12</b>. For example, in one alternative embodiment, a cable and winch or set of cables and winches may be fixed to translation rails <b>12</b> and to any fixed structure, and actuated to pull trolleys <b>16</b>. In another embodiment, a vehicle may be used to tow or push trolleys <b>16</b> along translation rails <b>12</b>. Moreover, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that any suitable device or method may be used to apply force to support beams <b>14</b> to drive translation of support beams <b>14</b> and conduit C along translation rails <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, conduit support beams <b>14</b> each include a pair of tubes <b>42</b> situated side-by-side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and joined by end plates <b>44</b> at each end of tubes <b>432</b>, such as by welding. Tubes <b>42</b> may have a length such that they are transportable through standard transportation channels, such as by truck or train car. In one exemplary embodiment, tubes <b>42</b> may be approximately 40 feet long. Where conduit C is longer than tubes <b>42</b>, end plates <b>44</b> may be joined to one another to create conduit support beam <b>14</b> in any length that is a multiple of the length of tubes <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As indicated above, trolley <b>16</b> is disposed between translation rail <b>12</b> and conduit support beams <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). Trolley <b>16</b> is in rolling contact with translation rail <b>12</b>, while conduit support beams <b>14</b> are coupled to trolleys <b>16</b>. Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, pairs of rail retention angles <b>46</b> may be affixed to rail support plate <b>48</b>, and spaced to correspond with the outer width of support beams <b>14</b> so that the outer faces of tubes <b>42</b> of support beams <b>14</b> contact rail retention angles <b>46</b> to couple conduit support beams <b>14</b> to trolley <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Rail support plate <b>48</b> is disposed upon and fixedly attached, i.e., by welding, to a pair of opposed trolley frame angles <b>50</b>. Frame angles <b>50</b> are in turn fixedly attached to one another by weld bead <b>51</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to form a channel-like shape. Captured between trolley frame angles <b>50</b> may be a plurality of axles <b>52</b>, each of which may extend outwardly to receive flanged casters <b>54</b> at opposing ends of axle <b>52</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, axles <b>52</b> are fixedly attached to trolley frame angles <b>50</b> and are therefore &#x201c;dead shafts,&#x201d; i.e., they are not rotatable with respect to frame angles <b>50</b>. To accommodate this &#x201c;dead shaft&#x201d; design, flanged casters <b>54</b> may have bearing (not shown) contained therein to facilitate rotation of casters <b>54</b> with respect to axles <b>52</b>, even under heavy pressure. Casters <b>54</b> may be prevented from translating with respect to or falling off of axles <b>52</b> by retention axle nuts <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, trolley <b>16</b> may include beam retention channels <b>58</b> fixedly attached, i.e., by welding, to each of trolley frame angles <b>50</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, beam retention channels <b>58</b> are sized and oriented so that lower lobes <b>59</b> of beam retention channels <b>58</b> may extend underneath the upper flange of translation rail <b>12</b> toward the web of the translation rail <b>12</b>. Thus, beam retention channels <b>58</b> may operate to capture trolley <b>16</b> on translation rail <b>12</b>, preventing trolley <b>16</b> from lifting vertically off of the upper flange of translation rail <b>12</b>. In addition, the width between flanges <b>55</b> formed in flanged casters <b>54</b> may correspond with the width between the edges of the upper flange of translation rail <b>12</b>. Thus, casters <b>54</b> may operate to center trolley <b>16</b> on translation rail <b>12</b> and may prevent side-to-side slipping of trolley <b>16</b> upon translation rail <b>12</b>. Moreover, the cooperation of flanged casters <b>54</b> and beam retention channels <b>58</b> with translation rail <b>12</b> may ensure that trolley <b>16</b> is only moveable along the longitudinal extent of translation rail <b>12</b>, thereby ensuring proper control over the motion of conduit support beams <b>14</b> and conduit C during translation within trench T, as discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Trolley <b>16</b> may further include screw coupler <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>) positioned and oriented to facilitate the coupling of trolley <b>16</b> with translation driver <b>32</b>. Specifically, screw coupler <b>60</b> may have a hole formed therethrough which is sized and located to receive lead screw <b>38</b> therethrough. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a pair of screw coupler nuts <b>62</b> may be threadably attached to lead screw <b>38</b> on either side of screw coupler <b>60</b> to fix lead screw <b>38</b> thereto. Screw coupler <b>60</b> may, in turn, be fixed to trolley <b>16</b>, such as by welding screw coupler <b>60</b> to trolley frame angles <b>50</b> and/or rail support plate <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As discussed in more detail below, conduit C may be moved up or down, laterally, or a combination of up or down and laterally. In addition, conduit C may be moved in sections or continuously in a &#x201c;wave&#x201d; pattern. The nature of the movement of conduit C may depend on several factors, such as the composition or material of conduit C, the material conveyed by conduit C, the environment around conduit C, and other considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Where conduit C may be brittle and/or inflexible, junction points J (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be provided to facilitate the movement of conduit C. Conduit C may be disconnected from other adjacent sections at junction points J, thereby allowing conduit C to be moved with no significant bending or stress formation therein. Other conduits that may be disposed upstream and/or downstream of conduit C may subsequently be moved in a similar manner. Further, where conduit C conveys cable or electrical wire, junction points J may provide cable slack and/or a cable disconnect point to prevent stretching or stress in the cables themselves. However, an alternate relocation may be used where conduit C may have some flexibility, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Constituent pieces of conduit relocation system <b>10</b> may first be transported to a job site, such as a site beside roadway R, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To facilitate such transport, conduit support beam <b>14</b> may be broken down into multiple pieces joinable at end plates <b>44</b>, as discussed above. Translation rails <b>12</b> may be bundled for transport. In addition, respective rails may or may not have trolleys <b>16</b> and/or translation drivers <b>32</b> already attached thereto, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Prior to installing conduit relocation system <b>10</b> proximate conduit C, trench T is excavated using any suitable method. A buffer zone or exclusion zone <b>11</b> of subterranean material M may be preserved around conduit C during the excavation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, so that the conduit C may be protected from impact and stress during the translation procedure. However aide or portion of conduit C may be exposed, at least temporarily, to determine the metes and bounds of the cross-sectional profile of conduit C within the subterranean material M. Exclusion zone <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may extend around conduit C by a predetermined distance and may define an area that curved sheet piling <b>18</b> should not enter during insertion thereof. For example, an electronic control system may be used to facilitate the insertion of curved sheet piling <b>18</b> and may be programmed to stop the insertion of curved sheet piling <b>18</b> if the control system determines that continued movement of curved sheet piling <b>18</b> may result in curved sheet piling <b>18</b> entering exclusion zone <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With trench T and exclusion zone <b>11</b> established, curved sheet pile <b>18</b> may be installed beneath conduit C by driving sheet pile <b>18</b> into subterranean material M below conduit C. For example, curved sheet pile <b>18</b> may be attached to a pile driver assembly carried by a suitable construction machine, such as the vibratory pile driver system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,387,173, entitled PILE DRIVER, filed Mar. 7, 2006, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/041,133, entitled MODULAR VIBRATORY PILE DRIVER SYSTEM, filed Mar. 3, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/169,807, entitled APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING THE SUBTERRANEAN SUPPORT OF UNDERGROUND CONDUITS HAVING A FIXED INSERTION AXIS, filed Apr. 16, 2009, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an exemplary embodiment, sheet pile <b>18</b> may be driven into subterranean material M using vibratory pile drives, impact drives, hydraulic pile drivers, hydrostatic jacking mechanisms, or any other machine or mechanism apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art. Where a vibratory pile driver is used, the curved sheet piles <b>18</b> may be vibrated as they are inserted into subterranean material M. This vibration places the soil in suspension, which allows the piles to be directed through the soil along an arcuate path that may have a curvature substantially matching the radius of curvature of the curved sheet piles <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Sections of curved sheet pile <b>18</b> may be interlocked with one another to create a substantially continuous support surface underneath conduit C, so that subterranean material M and conduit C may be lifted or otherwise moved as one long continuous column of material. Methods and apparatuses of interlocking curved sheet piles <b>18</b> to one another include flanges that may be attached to one sheet pile <b>18</b> and supporting an adjacent sheet pile <b>18</b>, flanges or structures may be adapted to interfit with one another to couple neighboring sheet piles <b>18</b>, clamps coupling neighboring sheet piles <b>18</b>, and the like. Exemplary methods and apparatuses for coupling curved sheet piles <b>18</b> are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/169,807, entitled APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING THE SUBTERRANEAN SUPPORT OF UNDERGROUND CONDUITS HAVING A FIXED INSERTION AXIS, incorporated by reference above. However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that any suitable support surface may be used to support conduit C and subterranean material M, such as flat plate materials, continuous plate materials, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With curved sheet piles <b>18</b> in place underneath conduit C, translation rails <b>12</b> may be placed across the span of trench T at regular intervals, with distance DR separating respective neighboring pairs of rails <b>12</b>, as described above. Rails <b>12</b> may be placed in generally parallel relation to one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and may be generally perpendicular to conduit C. This arrangement of rails <b>12</b> allows for lateral translation of conduit C along arrow A within trench T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). If trolleys <b>16</b> are not already mounted to rails <b>12</b>, the can now be mounted. In the illustrated embodiment, each trolley <b>16</b> may be slid onto the end of each rail <b>12</b> so that flanged casters <b>54</b> and beam retention channels <b>58</b> may engage the upper flange of translation rails <b>12</b> and trolley <b>16</b> may be moveable only along the longitudinal extent of translation rail <b>12</b>. Trolley <b>16</b> may be adjusted, either through free movement upon translation rail <b>12</b> or through actuation of motor <b>34</b> of translation driver <b>32</b>, to a position directly above conduit C. Each of the multiple trolleys <b>16</b> are similarly aligned, and conduit support beams <b>14</b> may then be placed upon trolleys between rail retention angles <b>46</b>. Where conduit support beams are separated into multiple sections, as described above, these multiple sections may then be bolted together at end plates <b>44</b> to form a continuous conduit support beam <b>14</b> spanning the distance span DC of conduit C.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Support structure <b>20</b> may then be coupled to curved sheet pile <b>18</b> and trolley <b>16</b>. Suspension members <b>22</b> may be extended through corresponding holes in conduit support beams <b>14</b>, which may be arranged to correspond with J-hook slots (not shown) formed in respective curved sheet piles <b>18</b>. J-hook <b>28</b> may be passed through the slots in curved sheet pile <b>18</b> and suspension member <b>22</b> may be rotated to engage J-hook <b>28</b> with curved sheet pile <b>18</b>. Nuts <b>30</b> may then be threaded against support beams <b>14</b> and may place slight upward pressure on subterranean material M beneath conduit C.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Nuts <b>30</b> may be further tightened to elevate subterranean material M in conduit C above the bottom surface of trench T to create a gap <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) between curved sheet pile <b>18</b> and the bottom surface of trench T. Alternatively, material may be excavated from beneath curved sheet pile <b>18</b> to create gap <b>64</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, gap <b>64</b> may be about &#xbd; inch or about &#xbe; of an inch, so that the bottom surface of curved sheet pile <b>18</b> may be just clear of the material of the bottom of trench T. In another exemplary embodiment, material may be excavated beneath curved sheet pile <b>18</b> to create a &#x201c;step down&#x201d; near the apex of curved sheet pile <b>18</b>, such that a small movement of trolleys <b>16</b> in direction A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may free curved sheet pile <b>18</b> from frictional interaction with material at the bottom of trench T.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With subterranean material M and conduit C suspended above the bottom of trench T by support structures <b>20</b>, material M and conduit C may be moved along direction A from the original position to a relocated position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As indicated above, force may be applied to trolleys <b>16</b> via any suitable method to drive trolleys <b>16</b> along direction A upon translation rails <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, motors <b>34</b> may be operatively connected to control <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and may draw trolleys <b>16</b> along direction A by rotating respective lead screws <b>39</b>. Motors <b>34</b> may be high accuracy motors with feedback mechanisms that provide data to control <b>40</b> about the movement of motor <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Control <b>40</b> may monitor the movements of each respective motor <b>34</b> throughout the span of distance DC of conduit C and may continuously ensure that each of motors <b>34</b> may be moving an equal amount as every other motor <b>34</b>. Thus, all of trolleys <b>16</b> may advance in direction A at the same rate and at the same time. Advantageously, this control methodology may ensure that conduit C may be kept straight and structurally sound throughout the translation within trench T along arrow A. Alternatively, control <b>30</b> may ensure that neighboring trolleys <b>16</b> may be longitudinally offset with one another by an amount not to exceed a predetermined level, such as where a flexible conduit is moved as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The conduit relocation may be complete when conduit C and subterranean material M are in the desired relocation position, illustrated by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. With the translation of conduit C complete, conduit relocation system <b>10</b> may be dismantled in substantially the reverse order of assembly (as described above).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">First, gap <b>64</b> in the relocated position may be backfilled with material, such as a portion of the material originally removed from trench T or a mixture of flowable fill material and gravel. Alternatively, nuts <b>30</b> may be adjusted to allow suspension members <b>22</b> to lower, thereby resting curved sheet pile <b>18</b> upon the bottom of trench T. When curved sheet pile <b>18</b> is adequately supported, either by material backfilled under sheet pile <b>18</b> or by lowering sheet pile <b>18</b>, nuts <b>30</b> may be removed from beam connection ends <b>24</b> of suspension members <b>22</b>, and suspension members <b>22</b> may then be removed from engagement with conduit support beam <b>14</b> and curved sheet piles <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With trolleys <b>16</b> now decoupled from curved sheet pile <b>18</b>, conduit support beams <b>14</b> may be dismantled and removed from trolleys <b>16</b>. Trolleys <b>16</b> may optionally be removed from engagement with translation rails <b>12</b> and translation drivers <b>32</b>. Translation rails <b>12</b> may be removed from their positions spanning trench T, leaving conduit C, subterranean material M, and curved sheet pile <b>18</b> remaining in trench T. Curved sheet pile <b>18</b> may be removed in a similar manner as it was installed, or it may be left installed beneath conduit C and subterranean material M. Finally, trench T may be filled in, such as with the material that was originally removed during excavation of trench T.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As indicated above, junction points J may be provided at each end of a conduit section C. Junction points J may be a subterranean or above-ground junction box, for example, or may be a manhole leading to a portion of conduit C. Junction points J may allow for disconnection of conduit C from adjacent sections, thereby allowing conduit C to be moved without any bending thereof. Where conduit C contains cables, such as electrical or fiber optic wires, junction joint J may be opened to expose cable slack or cable disconnect points in the manhole to facilitate relocation of conduit C without stretching or straining the cables contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Moving junction point J may be accomplished by simply relocating a junction box, where one is provided. Where junction point J is a manhole, the concrete surrounding the manhole may be removed, and another manhole may be installed at the end of the conduit C in the relocated position. A modular manhole may be installed at the end of conduit C in the relocated position. A modular manhole may be used which is capable of being broken down and moved for future relocations of conduit C. Where conduit C is moved but the neighboring conduit section remains in its original location, a transverse conduit section or &#x201c;elbow&#x201d; (not shown) may be provided at junction point J to span the gap created between the relocated conduit C and the neighboring unmoved conduit section.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some instances, several sections of conduit C may be moved sequentially, so an essentially unlimited amount of previously routed conduit may be laterally translated section-by-section. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, conduit C may have a span or distance DC of about 750 feet. Any cables contained within conduit C may be disconnected, or may have cable slack collected and exposed, at junction points J disposed at either end of the 750 foot section of conduit C. Conduit C may then be relocated as described above. With one section of conduit C successfully translated, the next neighboring section of conduit C may then be moved in a similar fashion. With both sections relocated, cables may be reconnected at junction point J, or the slack in the cables may be collected and stored at junction point J. In this manner, a plurality of sections of conduit C may be moved to ultimately translate an entire network of underground telecommunications cables.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another embodiment, conduit C may be translated upwardly or downwardly in addition to, or in lieu of the lateral translation described above. For example, some municipal or civil projects may seek to raise or lower conduit C to avoid adversely affecting a new surface structure such as light rail tracks, new roadways, other conduits, and the like. Just as the threaded engagement of nuts <b>30</b> with beam connection end <b>24</b> of suspension member <b>22</b> may be used to lift sheet pile <b>18</b> from the bottom of trench T, so may they be used to lift or lower sheet pile <b>18</b> and conduit C to a new vertical position. To prevent uneven stresses from forming with conduit C, all of nuts <b>30</b> may be advanced serially by small amounts. Put another way, for each small movement of one part of sheet pile <b>18</b> resulting from the tightening or loosening of nuts <b>30</b>, the same small movement of the other parts of sheet pile <b>18</b>, and of other upstream or downstream sheet piles <b>18</b> may also be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Alternatively, all of nuts <b>30</b> may be advanced simultaneously, such as by a series of synchronized motors operatively coupled to nuts <b>30</b> and controlled by controller <b>40</b>. Moreover, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that any suitable method of effecting the vertical translation of sheet pile <b>18</b> may be used, such as cable/winch systems, linear actuators, hydraulic or mechanical jacking systems, cranes, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In yet another alternative embodiment, conduit support beams <b>14</b> and/or translation rails <b>12</b> may be vertically translated rather than suspension members <b>22</b>. For example, lifting devices (i.e., screw jacks or hydraulics lifts, not shown) may be disposed between support beams <b>14</b> and translation rails <b>12</b>. With curved sheet piles <b>18</b> supported by respective support structures <b>20</b>, the lifting devices may be actuated to lift or lower translation rails <b>12</b> with respect to support beams <b>14</b> to a vertically relocated position. In still another alternative, the lifting devices may be placed between support beams <b>14</b> and the ground to lift or lower both support beams <b>14</b> and translation rails <b>12</b>. In addition, where conduit C may only be moved vertically, trolleys <b>16</b> may be eliminated so that conduit support beams <b>14</b> may rest directly on, and are coupled to rails <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in an alternative embodiment, conduit relocation system <b>110</b> may be used for translating curve to conduit C. In this embodiment, curved sheet piles <b>118</b> may be trapezoidally shaped having a first side <b>119</b> with a first length L<b>1</b>, and a second side <b>119</b>&#x2032; with a second length L<b>2</b>, where L<b>2</b> is less than L<b>1</b>. When multiple curved sheet piles <b>118</b> may be placed adjacent one another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a generally curved or arcuate overall profile may be formed. Similarly, conduit support beams <b>114</b> may be also curved to follow the overall profile created by curved sheet piles <b>118</b>. Curved conduit C&#x2032; may be translated in a similar manner as described above with respect to straight conduit C, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Respective ends of curved conduit C&#x2032; may be trimmed or expanded after movement as required to accommodate the altered geometrical arrangement with respect to adjacent upstream and downstream conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As indicated above, yet another embodiment may include a flexible conduit (not shown) that may be moved incrementally along its length without disconnecting individual sections of conduit using a &#x201c;wave&#x201d; movement method. Such flexible conduits may tolerate a certain amount of &#x201c;bend&#x201d; or deflection, which can be utilized in conjunction with a system of the present disclosure to move the conduit incrementally along a sufficient conduit length. If the desired net lateral movement of the conduit is known, and the ability of the conduit to withstand a certain deflection may also be known, then conduit relocation system <b>10</b> may be designed to accomplish the net movement over a distance large enough to ensure that the deflection of the conduit may not exceed the conduit's ability to safely deflect.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">More specifically, control <b>40</b> may be used to ensure that neighboring trolleys <b>16</b> may be longitudinally offset with respect to one another. Control <b>40</b> may monitor this offset, and may be programmed with distance DR between respective pairs of translation rails <b>12</b>. Control <b>40</b> may use these two pieces of information to determine the bend in conduit C, and may control the speed and/or movement of neighboring trolleys <b>16</b> to ensure that the offset does not result in a deflection exceeding a predetermined amount. The predetermined deflection may depend on the flexibility of conduit C. Control <b>40</b> may monitor all pairs of trolleys <b>16</b> in a similar fashion. The number of trolleys <b>16</b>&#x2014;and, correspondingly, the number of translation rails&#x2014;need to accomplish a translation of conduit C may be expressed by the following formula (I):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>N</i><sub>TROLLEY</sub><i>=D</i><sub>TRANS</sub><i>/D</i><sub>TROLLEY</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(I)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Where N<sub>TROLLEY </sub>is the number of trolleys needed to accomplish a translation of conduit C across a distance D<sub>TRANS </sub>given that the maximum offset distance between neighboring trolleys is D<sub>TROLLEY</sub>.
</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thus, when a first or leading trolley <b>16</b> begins to move, the neighboring downstream second trolley <b>16</b> may begin to move as soon as D<sub>TROLLEY </sub>may be established between them. A third trolley <b>16</b>, i.e., the downstream trolley neighboring second trolley <b>16</b>, will begin to move when D<sub>TROLLEY </sub>is established between the second and third trolleys <b>16</b>, and (2&#xd7;D<sub>TROLLEY</sub>) may be established between the first and third trolleys <b>16</b>. Thus, the trolleys may move in a &#x201c;wave&#x201d; pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an alternate embodiment of a conduit relocation system <b>200</b> may include a plurality of translation rails <b>212</b> of sufficient length to span an excavated trench T&#x2033; having conduit C&#x2033; located therein. A pair of conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>may be disposed atop translation rails <b>212</b> by means of trolleys <b>216</b> and above conduit C&#x2033;, so that conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>may be used to lift, lower and/or support conduit C&#x2033; as conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>move via the trolleys <b>216</b>, each of which may translate along a respective translation rail <b>212</b>, as described in further detail below. Conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>extend across a distance D<sub>C</sub>&#x2033;, which may generally be the distance between junction points J<sub>A </sub>and J<sub>B </sub>disposed at opposite ends of conduit C&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one exemplary embodiment, illustrated in the Figures, D<sub>C</sub>&#x2033; may be about 500 to about 1000 feet in length, such as about 750 feet in length. Generally, D<sub>C</sub>&#x2033; is a distance determined by the original installers of conduit C&#x2033; between junction points J<sub>A </sub>and J<sub>B</sub>. For example, any number of translation rails <b>212</b> may be placed along the width of trench T&#x2033; to support conduit C&#x2033; along the extent of support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, translation rails <b>212</b> are separated by distance D<sub>R</sub>&#x2033;, which is calculated to provide adequate support for the weight of beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, curved sheet pile <b>218</b> (as disclosed below), conduit C&#x2033; and any surrounding subterranean material.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, distance D<sub>R</sub>&#x2033; between respective pairs of translation rails <b>212</b> is about 40 feet, which is an appropriate distance for an exemplary conduit C&#x2033; used for underground routing of telecommunication cables. In this exemplary embodiment, conduit C&#x2033; is made of a clay material and has a square cross-sectional shaped with cross-sectional dimensions of about 13 inches by 13 inches. Conduit C&#x2033; may be buried beside roadway R&#x2033;, for example, such that conduit C&#x2033; is translatable by conduit relocation system <b>200</b> in order to provide additional space to widen roadway R&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that conduit relocation system <b>200</b>, like conduit relocation system <b>10</b>, described above, may be adapted to a variety of uses and scales, in which the relative sizes and weights of translation rails <b>212</b>, conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>and conduit C&#x2033; (or other subterranean structure) may vary widely. In such alternative embodiments, distance D<sub>R</sub>&#x2033; between translation rails <b>212</b> will also vary widely, as will distance D<sub>C</sub>&#x2033; representing the length of the structure to be translated. To accommodate this variability of scale, distance D<sub>R</sub>&#x2033; may be expressed as a fraction of distance D<sub>C</sub>&#x2033;. This fraction may be between about 1/12 and about 1/25, for example. Similarly, the number of translation rails <b>212</b> required to accommodate distance D<sub>C</sub>&#x2033; will also vary depending on the parameters of the system to be moved, and may be as few as two or three translation rails <b>212</b> or as many as several dozen of translation rails <b>212</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a top view of a portion of conduit relocation system <b>200</b> is shown including a translation rail <b>212</b> and a section of conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>. Conduit C&#x2033; is disposed underneath and generally centered between conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>in an initial or original position within trench T&#x2033;. As will be described in detail below, support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>and conduit C&#x2033; are translatable in the direction of arrow A&#x2033; within trench T&#x2033; to relocate conduit C&#x2033; to a second or relocated position.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">To facilitate the translation of support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>and, hence, conduit C&#x2033;, across translation rails <b>212</b>, a trolley <b>216</b> is disposed on an upper surface of each translation rail <b>212</b>. As discussed below, trolleys <b>216</b> provide a smooth rolling interface on respective translation rails <b>212</b>, thereby minimizing the force required to translate conduit C&#x2033; within trench T&#x2033;. In the illustrated embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, translation rails <b>212</b> are comprised of a pair of steel tubes placed parallel to each other to allow the trolleys <b>216</b> to roll thereon, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">To translate trolley <b>216</b> across translation rail <b>212</b>, one or more cables <b>215</b> are connected to the trolley <b>216</b>, on opposite sides thereof, for pulling the trolley <b>216</b> in either direction across the translation rail <b>212</b>. Specifically, the cables <b>215</b> may be connected to a pulley and drive system, disposed on one or both ends of the translation rail <b>212</b> for moving the trolley <b>216</b> laterally across the translation rail <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, movement of the support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>up and down and, hence, conduit C&#x2033; up and down with the trench T&#x2032;, cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>may extend from double drum <b>322</b> on the trolley <b>216</b>. Cable <b>217</b><i>a </i>may extend to single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a</i>, around single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a </i>and to sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>.

Cable <b>217</b><i>b </i>may then descend from sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>b </i>and engage the support beam <b>214</b><i>b </i>disposed therebeneath. Thus extending or pulling cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>via double drum <b>322</b> may play out or pull back cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>and, thus, ascend or descend support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>disposed therebeneath, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, curved sheet pile <b>218</b> is disposed beneath conduit C&#x2033; and coupled to trolley <b>216</b> via support structure <b>220</b>.

Rods <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b </i>also have pile connection ends <b>226</b><i>a</i>, <b>226</b><i>b </i>coupled to curved sheet pile <b>218</b>. Specifically, beam connection ends <b>224</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>b </i>of rods <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, respectively, are attached at regular intervals to the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>along the length of the conduit C&#x2033;.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, therefore, may be disposed beneath the translation rails <b>212</b> and may be operatively coupled to the trolleys <b>216</b> by means of suspending from a cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b</i>. Thus, conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>may be translated via the movement of the trolleys <b>216</b>, along translation rails <b>212</b> via cables <b>215</b>. In an alternative embodiment, as described more fully below, the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>may be utilized to lift and/or lower the conduit C&#x2033;.

Generally, conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>are each preferably formed using a pair of steel tubes placed parallel to each other, being adequately spaced at each end to allow a pocketed space to allow each end of conduit support beam saddle <b>329</b> to be placed therein. Holes may be located at each end of conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>that align with holes in each end of conduit support beam saddle <b>329</b>, thus allowing support pins <b>332</b> to be inserted, passing through both parts simultaneously until shouldering against the side of each of the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>. Retaining clip <b>333</b> may be disposed through holes in the support pin <b>332</b>, thus holding the support pin <b>332</b> in place. The conduit support beam saddle <b>329</b> may be formed with a pair of side plates <b>334</b><i>a</i>, <b>334</b><i>b</i>, each welded on each side of the main body of the conduit support beam saddle <b>329</b>, such that the pair of side plates <b>334</b><i>a</i>, <b>334</b><i>b </i>forms a pocketed space large enough to insert a clevis eye of double sheave block <b>330</b>.

The double sheave block <b>330</b> may be operatively connected via cable <b>217</b><i>a </i>to trolley <b>216</b>, as described above. Thus, the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>may be both translated along translation rail <b>212</b>, and/or may be raised or lowered cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>disposed through double sheave block <b>330</b>.</p>

Translation of each of the trolleys <b>216</b> may be accomplished via the translation driver <b>338</b>, which may include motor <b>337</b> operatively coupled to trolley <b>216</b> via cables <b>215</b>. Specifically, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, translation of one or more of the trolleys <b>216</b> may be accomplished via control box <b>333</b> attached to the end of translation rail <b>212</b>. Specifically, motor <b>337</b> may transmit necessary torque to turn pulley <b>343</b>, attached to the end of the translation rail <b>212</b>. The cables <b>215</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), adequately sized to transmit the necessary force to translate the trolleys <b>216</b> and, effectively, the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, may be affixed to trolley <b>216</b> at the end closest to the translation driver <b>338</b> via sprocket <b>343</b>, and may be routed to the opposing end of trolley <b>216</b> (such as within the tubular portions of the translation rail <b>212</b>) by first wrapping around a sprocket <b>343</b> and being affixed to the rotating member of translation driver <b>338</b>, then reversing direction, wrapping around the sprocket <b>343</b> a second time, and being affixed to a sprocket <b>342</b> attached to the opposite end of translation rail <b>212</b> by bracket <b>340</b>, and then ending affixed to the opposing end of trolley <b>216</b>. Thus, the motor <b>337</b>, when activated by control <b>333</b> via master control <b>240</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b>), may drive the trolley <b>216</b> laterally across the translation rail <b>212</b>, whether in one direction (such as toward the end of the translation rail <b>212</b> with the sprocket <b>342</b>) or towards the other (such as toward the motor <b>337</b>) via cables <b>215</b>. The support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>may be operatively coupled to the trolley <b>216</b>, as described more fully below, and thus are also translated, along with the curved sheet <b>218</b> and, ultimately, the conduit C&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a close-up view of trolley <b>216</b> is provided, without cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>or cables <b>215</b>. Conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>(not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) may be supported beneath trolley <b>216</b>, directly beneath a pair of sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>(not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> for purposes of clarity) may descend from the pair of sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>and may wrap around triple sheave block <b>330</b> (as disposed on each of the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, as shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). It is within the scope of the present invention that the conduit relocation system <b>200</b> may be adapted to accommodate varying sizes of conduit C&#x2033; disposed therebeneath by movement of sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>toward each other or away from each other. If a large volume, including conduit C&#x2033;, is required for relocation, the sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>may be disposed far apart from each other and may be bolted to holes far apart from each other. Alternatively, if only a small, narrow volume is required for relocation, then the sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>may be disposed relatively closed to each other by being bolted in holes close to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the trolley <b>216</b> may comprise, as a base, evenly spaced slide body side beams <b>357</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, showing the base of each trolley <b>216</b>), which may be evenly separated by center spacer <b>356</b> forming a retention channel <b>358</b>. Adjustment brackets <b>313</b> may form a T-shaped steel structure that fits in the retention channel <b>358</b>. A pair of adjustment brackets <b>313</b><i>a</i>, <b>313</b><i>b </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) may be bolted to one of a series of holes patterned on the top surfaces of the slide body side beams <b>357</b>. A pair of triple sheave brackets <b>314</b><i>a</i>, <b>314</b><i>b </i>may support the rotating sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b</i>, respectively that may, by using bearings on their centers, revolved around shafts <b>315</b><i>a</i>, <b>315</b><i>b </i>which are retained in position shouldered against the one side of the triple sheave brackets <b>314</b><i>a</i>, <b>314</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and by pins <b>316</b><i>a</i>, <b>316</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Each trolley <b>216</b> may slide along each translation rail <b>212</b> via a pair of roller packs <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b </i>disposed beneath the trolley <b>216</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Preferably, the roller packs <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b </i>may be bolted to opposing bottom surfaces of slide body side beams <b>357</b> by use of holes (not shown) that are patterned into the slide body side beams <b>357</b>, such that the centerline of the sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>coincide with the centerline of the roller packs <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b </i>and at the same time cover the center of conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Moreover, each trolley <b>216</b> may include a pair of single sheave wheels <b>309</b><i>a</i>, <b>309</b><i>b </i>that may be adjusted to maintain a relative distance with the pair of triple sheave clusters <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>as adjustment brackets <b>313</b><i>a</i>, <b>313</b><i>b </i>may be moved along the retention channel <b>358</b> to new positions. The pair of single sheave wheels <b>309</b><i>a</i>, <b>309</b><i>b </i>may sit atop sheave bracket <b>310</b>, which may be bolted or otherwise disposed on slide body side beams <b>357</b>. The single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a </i>may have a first pair of vertical walls <b>311</b><i>a</i>, <b>311</b><i>b </i>disposed perpendicular to main bracket <b>310</b> and may be integrally connected to main bracket <b>310</b>, whereupon the single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a </i>may sit therebetween. A second pair of vertical walls <b>311</b><i>c</i>, <b>311</b><i>d </i>may also be disposed perpendicular to main bracket <b>310</b> and may also be integrally connected to main bracket <b>310</b>, and single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>b </i>may sit therebetween. The axis of single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a </i>is set coincident to one pair of a plurality of pairs of holes disposed within the vertical walls <b>311</b><i>a</i>, <b>311</b><i>b</i>. Each of the pairs of holes may support the single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a</i>, allowing it to rotate via the single sheave wheel's bearings. Moreover, the axis of single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>b </i>is set coincident to one pair of a plurality of pairs of holes disposed within the vertical walls <b>311</b><i>c</i>, <b>311</b><i>d</i>. Thus, each of the pairs of holes within vertical walls <b>311</b><i>c</i>, <b>311</b><i>d </i>may support the single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>b</i>, allowing it to rotate via the single sheave wheel's bearings.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Aligning to and working in conjunction with the pair of triple sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>and pair of single sheave wheels <b>309</b><i>a</i>, <b>309</b><i>b </i>may be double drum <b>322</b>. Double drum <b>322</b> may be supported by bearing block <b>323</b> on one end and gear reducer <b>321</b> on the opposite end. Translation of the conduit support beams <b>314</b><i>a</i>, <b>314</b><i>b </i>may be accomplished, either independently, or simultaneously, via controls located in control box <b>333</b> that may be connected to and may activate motor <b>319</b>. Thus, a gearbox <b>320</b> and gear reducer <b>321</b> may revolve with the necessary torque to turn double drum <b>322</b> and wind up cables <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>(not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Specifically, as described above, cable <b>217</b><i>a </i>(preferably, made of steel for requisite strength) may be rolled up on one drum of the double drum <b>322</b>, then routed between single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>a</i>, triple sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, and ultimately to the first double sheave block <b>330</b>, attached to, for example, the conduit support beam <b>214</b><i>a </i>disposed beneath the trolley <b>216</b>. In addition, cable <b>217</b><i>b </i>(also preferably made of steel for requisite strength) may be wound on a second drum of the double drum <b>322</b>, then routed between single sheave wheel <b>309</b><i>b</i>, triple sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>b</i>, and ultimately to a second double sheave block <b>330</b> attached to, for example, the conduit support beam <b>214</b><i>b </i>disposed beneath the trolley <b>216</b>. Torque may be transmitted independently to each double sheave block <b>330</b> on the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and may lift or lower each of the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>by any distance B&#x2033;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Thus, triple sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b </i>may independently be controlled via a separate cable disposed from the double drum <b>322</b>. Alternatively, in a separate embodiment not shown herein, the double drum <b>322</b> may be replaced with a single drum, and a single cable may be routed between the single drum, a single sheave wheel (disposed where sheave wheels <b>309</b><i>a</i>, <b>309</b><i>b </i>are positioned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>), and through sheave wheels disposed in the general location of the triple sheave wheels <b>317</b><i>a</i>, <b>317</b><i>b</i>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Thus, a single cable may be utilized to control the up and down movement of the conduit C&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Preferably, when motor <b>319</b> is deactivated, brake <b>318</b> automatically engages with sufficient holding force, in combination with gear reduction caused by gear reducer <b>321</b> to sustain the combined weight of the conduit C&#x2033;, any supporting media such as dirt disposed around conduit C&#x2033;, and the conduit relocation system <b>200</b> equipment, as described herein.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the trolley <b>216</b> along line XVI-XVI, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Specifically, the trolley <b>216</b> may be disposed over the top surface of translation rail <b>212</b>, comprising two steel tubular portions placed side by side. Roller packs <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>c </i>may be disposed on the bottom surface of the slide body side beams <b>357</b>, and move across the top surface of the two tubular portions of translation rail <b>212</b>, thereby facilitating smooth rolling translation of the trolley <b>216</b> and, thus, the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>disposed therebeneath (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>), such as in the direction A&#x2033;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Generally, guiding of the trolley <b>216</b> is accomplished by means of two cam rollers <b>360</b><i>a</i>, <b>360</b><i>b</i>, each of which may be situated and held on the bottom edge of cam bracket <b>359</b> and affixed, by means of bolts, to the bottom side at each end of trolley <b>216</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the outside diameters of each cam roller <b>360</b><i>a</i>, <b>360</b><i>b </i>contacts the vertical plane of its corresponding inside edge of each tubular portion of translation rail <b>212</b>. Affixed to cam bracket <b>359</b>, the angles on the leading edge of guide <b>368</b> may position and guide the trolley <b>216</b> as it is placed in position onto the translation rail <b>212</b> during installation.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is saddle <b>329</b> that may sit between respective portions of conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a </i>or <b>214</b><i>b</i>, as shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The saddle <b>329</b> may adjoin terminal ends of sections of conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a </i>or <b>214</b><i>b</i>, as described above. As shown, clevis eye <b>369</b> of double sheave block <b>330</b> may be attached to the saddle <b>329</b>.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the trolley <b>216</b> may be constructed with four vertical posts <b>327</b><i>a</i>, <b>327</b><i>b</i>, <b>327</b><i>c </i>and <b>327</b><i>d</i>, positioned at each corner of the trolley <b>216</b>. The lower edges of posts <b>327</b><i>a</i>-<b>327</b><i>d </i>may be beneath the bottom leading edge of guide <b>358</b> such that the trolley <b>216</b> may rest on a truck for transport without disassembly thereof. Moreover, the upper ends of posts <b>327</b><i>a</i>-<b>327</b><i>d </i>may be high enough above the equipment disposed thereon (such as double drum <b>322</b>) such that multiple trolleys <b>216</b> may be stacked atop one another for shipment and/or storage. Holes located at each end of vertical posts <b>327</b><i>a</i>-<b>327</b><i>d </i>may align with each other once stacked, allowing a support pin (not shown) to be inserted through aligned holes.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each of the trolleys <b>216</b> atop each of the plurality of translation rails <b>212</b> may be controlled via separately bundled control wiring and power wiring (not shown) that may be coupled from a master control <b>340</b> to each control box <b>333</b> on each trolley <b>216</b>.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">At terminal points (such as points J<sub>A </sub>and J<sub>B</sub>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), may be a fixed end <b>400</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, that may consist of a pair of fixed end rails <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b </i>that may be disposed across the trench T&#x2033;. The fixed end rails <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b </i>may generally be coupled to conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, but may be a terminating point for the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>may be disposed through the fixed end rails <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b </i>or otherwise disposed therebetween, and held to the fixed end rails <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b </i>via plates <b>406</b><i>a</i>, <b>406</b><i>b</i>. Each of pins <b>408</b><i>a</i>, <b>408</b><i>b </i>may be disposed through terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>within holes bored through terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b</i>, and shouldered against plates <b>406</b><i>a</i>, <b>406</b><i>b</i>, thus holding the terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>in place. On a bottom end of the terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>may be flat portions <b>410</b><i>a</i>, <b>410</b><i>b </i>that may fit within slots formed in the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, and held in place via pins <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>. The pins <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>may be held in place via retaining clips <b>414</b><i>a</i>, <b>414</b><i>b</i>. The holes disposed in the terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>wherein pins <b>408</b><i>a</i>, <b>408</b><i>b </i>may be disposed therethrough may allow the terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b </i>to be raised and/or lowered, as necessary to generally keep the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>generally aligned over the entire length of the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>within the trench T&#x2033;. However, it should be noted that the pins <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>allow a degree of rotation to occur at the fixed end rails <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b</i>, such that when the conduit support beams <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b </i>are raised and/or lowered using the system described herein, the conduit support beams may pitch downwardly and/or upwardly as necessary, yet still be fixed to the terminal rods <b>404</b><i>a</i>, <b>404</b><i>b</i>, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">An embodiment of the present invention provides the capability, once decoupled from the sheet pile, to collectively translate the entire conduit relocation systems, as described herein, longitudinally along the conduit, thereby moving the entire system longitudinally without complete removal of the conduit support beams from the trolleys. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a perspective view of a mobile apparatus <b>500</b> of the present invention. The mobile apparatus <b>500</b> may include a pair of wheel carriages <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b </i>to be disposed on opposite ends of translation rail <b>512</b>. The translation rail may have a trolley <b>516</b> disposed thereon, the same or similar to trolleys <b>16</b> and <b>216</b>, as described herein. The wheel carriages <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b </i>may include a plurality of wheels <b>504</b> disposed thereon, allowing the entirety of the translation rail <b>512</b>, trolley <b>516</b> and conduit support beams (not shown) that may or may not be coupled to the trolley <b>516</b>, to be moved longitudinally along conduit (not shown) that may be disposed beneath the mobile apparatus <b>500</b>. Thus, the mobile apparatus <b>500</b> may be moved to an alternate location, and set up to help move conduit disposed therebeneath.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Specifically, each of the wheel carriages <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b </i>may have blocks <b>506</b> disposed beneath that may engage the ground when the wheel carriages <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b </i>are moved into position. In addition, the wheel carriages <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b </i>may each have vertical guide posts <b>508</b><i>a</i>, <b>508</b><i>b</i>, whereby the translation rail <b>512</b> may be disposed thereon via brackets <b>510</b><i>a</i>, <b>510</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the translation rail <b>512</b> may be disposed in one of many possible vertical positions along the vertical guide posts <b>508</b><i>a</i>, <b>508</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, a vertical drive may provide for the raising and/or lowering of each end of the translation rail <b>512</b> to new positions, thus allowing the translation rail <b>512</b> to maintain its horizontal and level position on uneven ground. Locking pins may be used to lock the ends of the translation rail <b>512</b> in position.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In addition, each of the wheeled carriages <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b </i>may be connected to adjacent carriage assemblies, holding other translation rails, by means of tie rod channels <b>514</b>. The tie rod channels <b>514</b> may have universal joints that allow the tie rod channels <b>514</b> to pivot at each end to allow flexibility during movement. The tie rod channels <b>514</b> may further carry carrier wire, electrical cabling and other like material from one carriage assembly to the next.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Properties of the Method and Apparatus for Relocating Conduit</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Advantageously, a conduit relocation system and method in accordance with the present disclosure may hold conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; in suspension with a force balance substantially identical to the force balance on conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; when in service underground, thereby preserving the environment for which conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; may have been originally designed. Further, the use of curved sheet pile during translation of conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; may protect conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; from impact or abrasion before, during and after translation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The method of the present disclosure may allow the translation of conduit and, thus, cabling contained within conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; in a relatively short amount of time. For example, telecommunications lines typically provide service continuously, but are typically taken out of service when movement of the cables becomes necessary. The signals carried by the cables, such as computer transmissions, cellular telephone transmissions, landline telephone transmissions, and other like transmissions, are typically routed to other cables in the area, which may place additional stress on the network receiving the additional data traffic. Because the systems and methods of the present disclosure facilitate fast conduit translation, this additional network stress may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Moreover, in some cases, users of the rerouted cables may lose service while the cables are moved. Thus, the speed with which cables may be translated using the present systems and methods may enhance continuity of service provided by the cables contained within the relocated conduit. In addition, the cables contained within conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033; may not be taken out of service at all if sufficient slack exists at junction points J<sub>A </sub>and J<sub>B </sub>to allow translation of connected cables without placing stress on the cables. Where the amount of slack in the cables may be greater than zero but less than the amount of desired translation of conduit C, C&#x2032; and/or C&#x2033;, each conduit section may be moved only enough to take up the available slack, and then the neighboring conduit sections can be moved. Further, movement of the original section can continue when the slack is again available, allowing movement of a conduit network with a small amount of cable slack without disconnecting the cables.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Also advantageously, original conduit material may be undisturbed by the present method. The structure integrity of the conduit may be preserved, and any hazardous materials which may be contained within the conduit material need never be exposed. Further, because the integrity of the conduit may be preserved, the conduit may be moved again at a later date while still preserving the functionality of the cable contained therein. Similarly, the cables of a relocated conduit installation may remain accessible in a similar manner as the cables of an original installation, rather than becoming inaccessible by being encased in concrete, for example.</p>

Specifically, the Master Control Systems may monitor and instruct the various motors to move precisely and with synchronization, thereby moving the entirety of the length of conduit precisely and with control. Monitors may be necessary to monitor the movement, positions, loads and/or other variables during a move of conduit pursuant to the present invention. Specifically, if a synchronized move between many apparatuses, including many motors, each controlling a different aspect of the move is required, the movements may be necessary within a specific tolerance. Any position deviation may distort the conduit duct package and cause cracking of the conduit. In addition, where a move requires both lateral translation of the conduit, as well as raising and/or lowering of the conduit, precise position feedback may be required. In a preferred embodiment, precise position feedback may be independent of movement of the various drive systems in order to eliminate inaccuracies.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Various methods may be utilized to monitor position and load feedback. For example, optical encoders, such as laser, LED, IR, or other like monitors may be utilized. Each optical encoder may be mounted on a translation rail, with a mirror target located on a trolley. Alternatively, an optical encoder may be mounted on a translation rail, with an optical receiver mounted on the trolley. Of course, the optical encoder may be mounted on the trolley, while the receiver may be mounted on the cross beam. Other examples of monitors may include cable encoders that may be mounted on the translation rail, limit switches may be placed in target locations (which may be particularly useful for providing safety mechanisms to apply brakes if moving parts trip the switches), capacitive feedback, such as photo eyes or other inductive measuring systems, magnetic encoders, such as hall effect scanners or magnetoresistive heads, or global positioning systems.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Load sensing may be implemented in the various embodiments to determine and monitor the weight of the load that is being moved. This may be accomplished using load cells and/or strain gauges. The load cells and/or strain gauges may be mounted beneath the trolleys so monitor whether the load may be over a predetermined limit. The load monitor may also send a safety signal to shut the system down if a weight limit has been reached.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Other Drive Options</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The lateral movement of the conduit, such as via the trolleys, as described in various embodiments herein, as well as the raising and/or lowering of the conduit, may be implemented in various forms and drives. For example, as described herein, the lateral movement may be accomplished via a screw, or a fixed length actuator. Other options may include a linear motor, rack and pinion, a friction drive, a chain drive, a cable drive, or any other drive system that may allow for movement of the conduit laterally and/or up and down.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">For example, in an embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a perspective view of a large vertical displacement apparatus <b>600</b> is illustrated. The apparatus <b>600</b> may include vertical beams <b>602</b><i>a</i>, <b>602</b><i>b </i>that may be pile driven into the ground, thereby providing a high degree of stability, which may be useful when displacing a large amount of material. A translation rail <b>612</b> may be a steel I-beam, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, and may have a trolley <b>616</b> disposed thereon. The trolley <b>616</b> may include cradles <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>604</b><i>b </i>for holding conduit support beams (not shown), as described above. Linear drives <b>606</b><i>a</i>, <b>606</b><i>b</i>, in the form of jack screws, may be fixed to the vertical beams <b>602</b><i>a</i>, <b>602</b><i>b</i>, driven by motors <b>608</b><i>a</i>, <b>608</b><i>b</i>. Thus, motors <b>608</b><i>a</i>, <b>608</b><i>b </i>may drive the linear drives <b>606</b><i>a</i>, <b>606</b><i>b </i>and move the entirety of translation rail <b>612</b> vertically, thus raising and/or lowering the conduit support beams disposed within the cradles <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>604</b><i>b </i>and the conduit or other item that may be disposed therebeneath.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In addition, the trolley <b>616</b>, having conduit support beams disposed within cradles <b>604</b><i>a</i>, <b>604</b><i>b</i>, may translate laterally along translation rail via a linear drive <b>618</b> that may be disposed beneath the translation rail <b>612</b>. A plurality of strategically placed rollers <b>622</b> may be disposed on or within the trolley <b>616</b> to allow smooth lateral movement of the trolley <b>616</b> across translation rail <b>612</b>. An armature <b>620</b> may be utilized to connect the trolley <b>616</b> to the linear drive <b>618</b> disposed beneath the translation rail <b>612</b>, thereby providing lateral movement to the trolley <b>616</b> via movement of the linear drive <b>618</b>. Thus, conduit disposed therebeneath, or any material or item needing movement may be moved using one or more large vertical displacement apparatuses <b>600</b> positioned adjacently, as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Control Software</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The Master Control Systems of the present invention should include software, and be controlled using computing devices that may have the ability to control a large number of motors and drives, driving multiple axes on a plurality of apparatuses, as described herein. Specifically, the software utilized to control the various systems may preferably coordinate multiple axis, coordinate the horizontal, vertical, lateral and/or longitudinal moves of multiple units, handle multiple drive systems and multiple drive types, handle multiple feedback and monitoring systems and types, handle emergency stop input signals, and handle and coordinate redundant feedbacks, such as GPS and optical encoders.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Moreover, the software of the present invention may be utilized to provide virtual mapping of the systems necessary to handle the movement of conduit, as described above. Thus, materials and resources may be precisely calculated for each movement of conduit. Specifically, software of the present invention may require input on variables such as conduit properties and/or characteristics, as well as ground type, amount of movement necessary, length and type of conduit, and other like variables. Software may output the amount of materials and resources necessary to complete the move of the conduit, such as the number of translation rails, the load capacity needed, trench materials necessary, filling materials necessary, the length of the system, and other like requirements. Thus, precise planning of a move may be implemented prior to conducting the move, saving time, materials and money.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It should be noted that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and without diminishing its attendant advantages.</p>
