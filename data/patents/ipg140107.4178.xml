<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In wireless communication, in the case of radar installations or other receiving devices which operate at microwave frequencies, and whose input is normally coupled to an antenna, high-power interference pulses or frequency bursts, with steep rising flanks can deliberately or inadvertently be applied to the input of the appliance, whose frequencies fall in the operating frequency range of the appliance, where they temporarily or permanently affect the sensitive input stages or, furthermore, cause damage.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the past, it has therefore variously been proposed that appliance inputs such as these be protected by means of protective circuits upstream of the input, which reliably limit or attenuate such fast high-power interference pulses without noticeably impeding the wanted signals being fed into the appliance input. In this case, a plurality of limiter circuits, which cover a coarse and a fine range of the interference power, are frequently connected in series, for example with gas discharge paths being used for the coarse range and limiting semiconductor components being used for the fine range.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of example, CH-A5-654 149 discloses a protective circuit against NEMPs, in which a gas cell as coarse protection means and a varistor as fine protection means are connected in series via a frequency-selective delay element.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE-A1-34 25 296 discloses a protective apparatus for electronic appliances, in which a coarse protective device with a gas discharge path and a fine protective device which operates with semiconductor elements are accommodated in separate housings and are connected to one another via a relatively long connecting cable. DE A1-36 26 800 also discloses a comparable solution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">DE A1-39 07 199 discloses an overvoltage protective device for coaxial cables, in which a three-electrode suppressor is used for coarse protection, and a combination of switching diodes and limiter diodes is used for fine protection. The three-electrode suppressor is inserted into a printed circuit board on which the other circuit elements are also arranged. The end-face electrodes of the three-electrode suppressor are connected to the inner conductor and outer conductor of the coaxial cable, while the center electrode is connected to a separate ground line.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP-A1-0 855 758 discloses a circuit arrangement for protection of RF input circuits of telecommunication appliances, in which a fine protective circuit having a varistor and a limiter diode is provided behind a gas capsule suppressor or a lambda/4 short-circuit line.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Finally, it has been known for a long time for PIN diodes to be used for limiting interference pulses at the input of appliances which operate in the microwave range, and these are distinguished by very small internal capacitances and short response times (see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,345,199 or WO-A1-2006/124104).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other protective methods relate to quick active regulation of a limiting element in the input of the appliance (US-A1-2006/0293020).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The known protective circuits and protective methods are not sufficient for reliably limiting or attenuating very high power interference pulses, for example those transmitted by pulsed radars or specific interference pulse generators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object of the invention is to specify a protective circuit which avoids the disadvantages of known protective circuits and is distinguished by a simple, compact and robust design, as well as reliable limiting of fast and, in particular, high-power interference pulses in the microwave band.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The object is achieved by the totality of the features of claim <b>1</b>. One essential feature for the invention is a limiter circuit, arranged at the input of the protective circuit, for the coarse power range, which comprises two parallel-connected gas discharge tubes which are connected in parallel in a specific manner. The two gas discharge tubes, which are preferably of the same type and are arranged one behind the other connected in parallel allow the isolation with respect to interference powers at the input to be improved by an order of magnitude (a factor of approximately 10) by very simple means and with a very compact design.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For optimum limiting, it is advantageous for the two gas discharge tubes to be coupled to one another as closely as possible, with regard to their ignition. According to one refinement of the invention, this is achieved in that the two gas discharge tubes have a common gas space.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is particularly advantageous for the two gas discharge tubes to be physically combined in one gas capsule, which comprises a cylindrical gas space with two mutually opposite end-face electrodes and a center electrode which is arranged in the center between the two end-face electrodes, wherein the end-face electrodes each form one electrode of the two gas discharge tubes, and the center electrode forms the other electrode of the two gas discharge tubes. This makes it possible for one gas discharge tube to likewise be ignited comparatively quickly when the (adjacent) other gas discharge tube ignites, because of the plasma that is created in the gas space.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A bridging circuit which is in the form of a T-element with two inductances and one capacitance is preferably arranged between the end-face electrodes of the gas capsule, in order to pass on the wanted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The coupling between two gas discharge tubes is improved further if the end-face electrodes extend so far in the axial direction into the gas space that their ends are covered by the center electrode, when seen in the radial direction. This results in the discharge paths of the two tube or electrode systems being directly adjacent, and influencing one another particularly intensively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to ensure that the proximity of the two gas discharge tubes does not lead to undesirable electromagnetic coupling between the input and the output of the limiter circuit, means are preferably provided for electromagnetically decoupling the two gas discharge tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, for electromagnetic decoupling of the two gas discharge tubes, the gas capsule is installed with its cylinder axis essentially at right angles to the plane into an electrically conductive flat plate, such that the plate is located between the end-face electrodes of the gas capsule. The plate then has a shielding effect.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another refinement of the invention is characterized in that PIN diodes are used as semiconductor components for limiting relatively low interference power levels, with the PIN diodes preferably being connected back-to-back in parallel, in pairs.</p>

The third limiter circuit reduces the response delay of the protective circuit even further. At the same time, the limiting range is extended toward lower power levels.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to achieve a compact design and good heat dissipation from the limiter elements, it is advantageous if the PIN diodes are arranged as unpackaged semiconductor chips directly on a thin ceramic substrate which is mounted flat on a cold plate for heat dissipation.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> uses two figure elements to show a block diagram of a protective circuit according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) and the arrangement of the protective circuit from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>in front of an appliance to be protected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>). The protective circuit <b>10</b> in the exemplary embodiment has an input <b>11</b> and an output <b>18</b>, which may be in the form of coaxial plug connections. By way of example, the input <b>11</b> may be a Type N connector, and the output <b>18</b> a Type SMA. Plug connectors such as these for frequencies in the GHz range are available, for example, from the applicant.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Three limiter circuits <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are arranged in series between the input <b>11</b> and the output <b>18</b>, and are connected to one another and to the output <b>18</b> by decoupling circuits <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b>. The decoupling circuits <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> ensure that, when the fastest reacting third limiter circuit is activated, sufficient voltage is dropped to then subsequently activate the second limiter circuit <b>14</b> and the first limiter circuit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The power ranges and response times of the limiter circuits <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are graduated, with the first limiter circuit <b>12</b> having the highest power range and the slowest response time, while the third limiter circuit <b>16</b> is distinguished by the lowest power range and the fastest response time. The third limiter circuit <b>16</b> therefore extends the scope of protection of the appliance (<b>30</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>) toward lower power levels and faster rising flanks, and therefore improves the effect of the protective circuit, irrespective of the actual configuration of the first limiter circuit <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the protective circuit <b>10</b> is connected in front of the input <b>31</b> of the electronic appliance <b>30</b> to be protected, and therefore protects the appliance against overloading by fast and high-power interference pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If just one simple typical gas discharge tube of the conventional type were to be used in the first limiter circuit <b>12</b>, this would result in a relationship between the input power present at the input <b>11</b> and the output power that appears at the output <b>18</b>, as is illustrated in the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The output power rises linearly with the input power with the gradient <b>1</b>, until the gas discharge tube ignites at about 60 Watts, and limits the output power to less than 10 Watts. As the input power rises further, the output power then also continues to rise, as a result of which, at input power levels of several 1000 Watts, such as those which can occur in extreme cases, the protection of the appliance <b>30</b> is no longer ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It has now surprisingly been found that a simple parallel circuit of two gas discharge tubes (GDT<b>1</b> and GDT<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) in the first limiter circuit <b>12</b> provides protection against 10-times higher input power levels, provided that the ignition responses of the two gas discharge tubes are sufficiently closely coupled to one another. This then results in a relationship between the input power and the output power as is shown in the diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, that is to say even input power levels of 3000 Watts and more are reliably limited to output power levels of about 30 Watts, before the output power rises again with the input power.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to achieve close coupling in a simple manner between the two gas discharge tubes (GDT) arranged one behind the other in parallel, a ceramic three-electrode gas discharge tube (gas capsule <b>19</b>) is used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and is connected such that the two end-face electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> respectively form one electrode of the two gas discharge tubes GDT<b>1</b>, GDT<b>2</b>, and the center electrode <b>21</b> forms the other electrode of the two gas discharge tubes GDT<b>1</b>, GDT<b>2</b>. The type of gas capsule <b>19</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is preferably used in this case, in which the end-face electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> project so far into the interior of the gas space <b>23</b> in the axial direction that they are covered by the (annular) center electrode <b>21</b> in the radial direction at the ends. This results in very close coupling between the discharge paths of the electrode pairs <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>, and this leads to the ignition of the rear gas discharge tube GDT<b>2</b> being triggered by the already ignited first gas discharge tube GDT<b>1</b>, and in this being done with only a short time delay.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the three-electrode gas capsule <b>19</b> is installed in the protective circuit <b>10</b> such that the path which is formed between the two end-face electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> interrupts the inner conductor of the protective circuit <b>10</b>, while the center electrode <b>21</b> is grounded. In order to bridge the interruption, a bridging circuit is arranged between the end-face electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, in the form of a T-element with two inductances L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b> and a capacitance C<b>2</b>. Furthermore, the capacitances C<b>1</b> and C<b>3</b> of the discharge paths of the gas capsule <b>19</b> as well as the inductances L<b>1</b> and L<b>4</b> of the supply lines to the end-face electrodes <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> play a part in terms of radio-frequency technology.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second limiter circuit <b>14</b> and the third limiter circuit <b>16</b> are designed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>: two PIN diodes D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> (and D<b>3</b>, D<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the same type are connected back-to-back in parallel in them. By way of example, glass-passivated chips from the Tyco Company or M/A-Com can be used as PIN diodes. In this case, the inductances L<b>5</b>, L<b>6</b> and L<b>7</b> of the supply lines are also important for radio-frequency purposes, and these are governed by the bonding wires <b>27</b>, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, of the PIN diode chips. The decoupling circuits <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> which are provided between the limiter circuits <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> and after the limiter circuit <b>16</b> are internally designed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <i>b</i>: the limiter circuit <b>13</b> comprises a series circuit of a capacitance C<b>4</b> and a transmission line T<b>1</b>, and the limiter circuits <b>15</b> and <b>17</b> each contain a transmission line T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the protective circuit <b>10</b> must be designed for the GHz range and must process considerable power levels in the event of interference, the design of the limiter circuits <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> is of considerable importance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows one exemplary embodiment of an appropriate circuit design <b>24</b>, in a simplified form. The circuit design comprises a preferably metallic cold plate <b>26</b> with good thermal conductivity and a high heat capacity, which can absorb and dissipate the heat that is created. A printed circuit board <b>25</b> is arranged on the upper face of the cold plate <b>26</b>, and is used for wiring of the circuit. The printed circuit board <b>25</b> has a cutout <b>32</b> which leaves free part of the area of the surface of the cold plate <b>26</b>. Thin, electrically insulating ceramic substrates <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> are arranged in the cutout <b>32</b>, closely thermally coupled to the cold plate <b>26</b>, and the PIN diode pairs D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b>, D<b>4</b> of the limiter circuits <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> are accommodated on their surface, in the form of unpackaged semiconductor chips. The size relationships of the chips shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> have in this case been illustrated in an exaggerated form, in order to improve clarity. The PIN diodes D<b>1</b>, . . . , D<b>4</b> are adhesively bonded or soldered on the lower face to the ceramic substrates <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. The bonding pads on the upper faces are connected by means of bonding wires <b>27</b> to corresponding conductor tracks on the printed circuit board <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A particular type of installation is envisaged for the gas capsule <b>19</b>: corresponding openings are left free one above the other in the cold plate <b>26</b> and in the printed circuit board <b>25</b>, through which the cylindrical gas capsule <b>19</b> can be passed, with its cylinder axis at right angles to the plane of the plate. In this case, the center electrode is located at approximately the same height as the printed circuit board <b>25</b> and can be grounded via a very short path. In this configuration, the metallic cold plate <b>26</b> represents a shield, which reduces or entirely suppresses the electromagnetic coupling between the electrode paths <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, <b>21</b>, thus suppressing undesirable crosstalk from the input to the output of the gas capsule <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The protective circuit <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> results in a considerably extended protective effect for the appliance <b>30</b>, as is illustrated by the diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which shows the relationship between the input power level and the output power level (in decibels with respect to 1 mW) plotted on a double-logarithmic scale.</p>
