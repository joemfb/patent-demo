<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electronic input device such as an electronic pen may be used to input an electronic instruction. In some implementations, the device may include a tip for contacting a physical document. A sensor may record movement of the tip relative to the physical document. A recognition component may recognize an electronically-executable instruction from the recorded movement of the tip, and a processing component may automatically cause execution of the electronically-executable instruction recognized from the recorded movement of the tip. In some examples, the electronic input device may locally execute the electronically-executable instruction, while in other examples, the electronic input device may communicate the electronically-executable instruction to a separate device for remote execution.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for processing annotations of a document. Traditionally, print media has been the only way to record information and ideas. Thus, when a person annotated a paper version of a document, the annotation could be replicated, for example, by rewriting the annotation in another copy of the document or by making copies of the annotated document. Presently, advancements in digital imaging allow persons to convert documents in printed form into digital form. When a person annotates a paper version of a document, a digital version of the document can be made by physically scanning the annotated document into a digital form.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There remains a need for better technology for automatically processing annotations of a document.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the invention described herein provide, for example, an electronic input device, a computer-implemented method, and computer-readable medium for use in annotating a document. In at least one embodiment, an electronic input device includes a recording component, a recognition component, and a processing component. The recording component is configured to electronically record an annotation of a document, while the recognition component is configured to analyze the annotation and determine whether the annotation includes an electronically-executable instruction. When the annotation is determined to include an electronically-executable instruction, the processing component is configured to automatically cause an execution of the instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The electronic input device may be configured to locally execute the electronically-executable instruction. Alternatively, or in addition, the electronic input device may be configured to communicate the instruction to a separate device for remote execution. In some circumstances, the instruction may specify the separate device in a manner that the recognition component can identify the separate device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Execution of the electronically-executable instruction may result in different actions. For example, without limitation, execution of the instruction may initiate a search of a digital version of the document for one or more words or for one or more annotations. In other examples, execution of the instruction may cause at least a portion of a digital version of the document to be printed or may cause an e-mail to be generated. In the latter case, a digital version of the annotated document may be attached to the e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The recognition component may be configured to recognize an electronically-executable instruction in the annotation based on one or more predefined characters in the annotation that indicate an electronically-executable instruction. In some circumstances, the document may be a physical paper document and the recording component is configured to electronically record an annotation of the physical paper document.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least one embodiment, a computer-implemented method for processing an annotation of a physical printed version of a document may be provided. The method may include obtaining an electronic version of an annotation from a physical printed version of a document; determining if the annotation includes an electronically-executable instruction; and automatically causing an execution of the electronically-executable instruction if the annotation includes an electronically-executable instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, a computer-readable medium containing executable instructions may be provided. When executed by a computing apparatus, the executable instructions may cause the computing apparatus to obtain an electronic version of an annotation of a document from a physical printed version of the document; identify an electronically-executable instruction in the annotation; and automatically cause an execution of the electronically-executable instruction.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The invention is directed to methods and apparatus, such as an electronic input device, a computing system, and a computer-implemented method and medium for correlating an annotation on a paper version of a document with a digital version of the document. More specifically, an electronic input device is provided for recording an annotation on a paper version of a document and an image of human-comprehensible content that is sufficient to identify the document and possibly a location within the document. The human-comprehensible content may include words, letters, characters, pictures, etc., that convey meaning to a human reader of the document. Such content does not include unique identifiers such as barcodes, watermarks, or any other element comprised of symbols that are not comprehensible to a human. The human-comprehensible content and/or an image thereof are usable to locate a digital version of the document. The annotation is stored, and is associated with the digital version of the document if a digital version of the document is identified. In the case that the annotation is an instruction concerning the document or subject matter in the document, the instruction is recognized and executed. Further aspects of the invention can be used to augment the digital version of the document with the annotation. The combined result may be displayed, played back, or printed through an output device, for example, upon receiving a request from a user.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following description first provides an overview of a computing system in which an exemplary embodiment of the invention may be implemented. Then a method for correlating an annotation on a paper version of a document with a digital version of the document is described. The following detailed description provides exemplary implementations of the invention. Although specific flow diagrams and system configurations are illustrated, it should be understood that the examples provided are not exhaustive and do not limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Persons having ordinary skill in the field of computers and digital imaging will recognize process steps and structure described herein that may be interchangeable with other steps and structure, or combinations of steps or structures, and still achieve the benefits and advantages of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To provide a context for describing embodiments of the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a pictorial block diagram of a computing environment <b>100</b> that may be used to implement the invention. The computing environment <b>100</b> includes at least one electronic input device <b>102</b> and a computing system, such as a server system <b>104</b>. The electronic input device <b>102</b> may communicate with the server system <b>104</b> through a network <b>106</b>, using, for example, a wired or wireless connection, or may communicate directly with the server system <b>104</b> without an intervening network. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the server system <b>104</b> may be associated with a mass storage that contains a digital works database <b>108</b> and an annotations database <b>110</b>. These two databases may be part of the server system <b>104</b>; they may also be remotely located and communicatively connected to the server system <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As will be described with regard to the particular embodiments shown herein, the server system <b>104</b> is configured to communicate with the electronic input device <b>102</b>. For example, the server system <b>104</b> may receive an annotation that was made on a paper version of a document and an image of human-comprehensible content in the document that is sufficient to identify the document and possibly a location in the document. In some cases, the electronic input device <b>102</b> processes the image of human-comprehensible content and generates data, such as a hash key or a digital signature. In other cases, the human-comprehensible content itself is used to identify a digital version of the document and possibly a location in the document. The electronic input device may, but is not required to, process the image of human-comprehensible content before sending it to the server system <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The server system <b>104</b> uses the data received to query the digital works database <b>108</b> for a digital version of the document that is being or has been annotated. The server system <b>104</b> stores the annotation in the annotations database <b>110</b>, in association with a digital version of the document if a digital version of the document has been found. In circumstances where the server system <b>104</b> recognizes some or all of the annotation as constituting an instruction, the server system <b>104</b> also executes (or causes to be executed) the instruction portion of the annotation. As will be described later herein, in some embodiments of the invention, the digital version of the document may be augmented with the annotation. The resultant combination may be sent to an output device <b>112</b> through the network <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The output device <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> communicates with the server system <b>104</b> through the network <b>106</b>. An output device <b>112</b> in communication with the server system <b>104</b> may include typical output devices, such as a computer display (e.g., CRT or LCD screen), a television, printer, facsimile machine, copy machine, etc. As noted above, the output device <b>112</b> can be used to display, play back, and/or print a digital version of a document augmented with an annotation provided to the server system <b>104</b> by the electronic input device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Digital works may include any type of content that may be stored or distributed in digital form. By way of illustration, without limitation, digital works can include all forms of textual and graphical information, such as books, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, menus, guides, references, photographs, articles, reports, documents, etc., and all forms of audio and audio visual works such as music, multimedia presentations, audio books, movies, etc. Digital works may be stored as media files in the digital works database <b>108</b> that resides in or is otherwise communicatively connected to the server system <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An annotation can be any form of content that is associated with a document. It may include (but is not limited to) a critical commentary, an explanatory note, a summary of the document or some aspect of the document, a separate explanation of the same topic presented in the document, or a simple mark to highlight or emphasize something in the document. Annotations may be words, graphs, formulae, files, images, enhancements, markings, etc., provided by a user. For example, a user may wish to annotate a travel book by providing recent images of locations described in the travel book. A user may annotate a music sheet by commenting on the music, providing background information on the composer, alternative lyrics, technical information as to the composition, related musical compositions, etc. In a circumstance where the document is a cookbook, for example, a user may identify alternative ingredients that enhance a recipe, ingredients that make a spicier dish, ingredient substitutions considered to be lower in fat or carbohydrates, etc. In another circumstance, a user such as a student or teacher may provide a markup of an academic textbook. As can be appreciated from the foregoing, there is virtually no limitation to the type, form, and content of annotations that can be added to a digital work. By way of illustration, an annotation can also be in the form of a link or address to another page, file, or document available to the server system <b>104</b> or other computing system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In embodiments of the invention, an annotation can also be an instruction concerning the document or subject matter in the document. For example, an annotation can be a command to look up a certain word in the document, to print the document, to check existing commentaries concerning the content of the document, to print a picture of a selected object in the document, etc. An annotation can also be a command to route the annotated document to a specified location, to generate a notification to be sent to a mail list to notify members on the mail list, for example, that the document has new annotation(s), etc. An annotation can further be a command to execute an action on a remote system. For example, an annotation can be a command to generate an e-mail in a remote server; the e-mail attaches the annotated document. In circumstances where the annotation is written, a character recognition routine, such as OCR, may be applied to the annotation; and if one or more characters or words in the annotation indicate an executable instruction, the instruction can then be carried out. The execution of the instruction may occur locally on the electronic input device, remotely on the server where the annotation is sent, or remotely on another computing system that is specified in the instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The computing environment <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has an annotations database <b>110</b> residing in or otherwise communicatively connected to the server system <b>104</b>, though in other computing environments, the computing systems may be arranged differently. Annotations that are stored in the annotations database <b>110</b> may be associated with the digital works stored in the digital works database <b>108</b>. The network <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be a local area network (LAN) or a larger network, such as a wide area network (WAN), a collection of networks, or the Internet. Wired or wireless network connections may be used with any suitable communication protocols, such as TCP/IP. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and others, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a simplified example of one suitable computing environment for implementing embodiments of the invention, and is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When software and hardware formed in accordance with the invention is implemented in one or more input devices and computing systems of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the devices and systems provide a way for users to annotate a paper version of a document such that the annotation can be automatically associated with a digital version of the document. In embodiments of the invention, the devices and systems may also provide a way for augmenting the digital version of the document with the annotation and present the augmented document for further use. Allowing an annotation on a paper version of a document to be associated with a digital version of the document and/or providing a mechanism for augmenting a digital version of a document with an annotation can make the underlying digital work more useful and valuable. For example, upon request, the digital version of the document can be printed along with the annotation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides one exemplary implementation of an electronic input device <b>102</b> that can be used to correlate an annotation on a paper version of a document with a digital version of the document. The electronic input device contains a recording component that enables a user to annotate a document. In some embodiments of the invention, the recording component is an audio device <b>201</b>. When the audio device <b>201</b> is turned on, a user may dictate an annotation, which will be recorded in the audio device <b>201</b>. In other embodiments of the invention, the recording component is a writing tip <b>202</b> for a user to annotate a document. The writing tip <b>202</b> may include a sensor, having a capacity to record the movements of the writing tip <b>202</b>. The electronic input device <b>102</b> may further include an ink deposit. In some embodiments, the electronic input device <b>102</b> contains a switch that enables or disables the flow of ink from the ink deposit through the writing tip <b>202</b>. The switch, for example, may control a valve or other mechanism that can open and close a channel through which ink from the ink deposit may flow.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiments that include a sensor with the writing tip <b>202</b>, the sensor captures the annotation by recording the movements of the writing tip <b>202</b>. Any form or type of sensor may be used to record the movements of the writing tip <b>202</b>. Some examples, without limitation, include: a solid state gyro that is configured to detect and report motion of the writing tip <b>202</b>, e.g., in the X-Y plane, as the writing tip moves across the document being annotated; a roller ball that detects and reports motion of the writing tip <b>202</b>, e.g., in a manner similar to a roller ball in a conventional computer mouse; an RF signal that emanates from the electronic input device <b>102</b> from which the relative motion of the writing tip <b>202</b> can be determined; or a digitizer positioned around or under the document page being annotated. At its simplest, the sensor needs only to detect and to provide signals reflecting the relative motion of the writing tip <b>202</b> as it moves across the document being annotated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The electronic input device <b>102</b> may further contain an imaging component <b>204</b> for obtaining an image of human-comprehensible content in the document that is sufficient to identify the document and possibly a location in the document. The imaging component <b>204</b> may be any device that has image recording capabilities. For example, the imaging component <b>204</b> can be a digital camera, a scanning device, etc. The imaging component may be configured to record a single image, or record a series of images, that capture human-comprehensible content in the document. The human-comprehensible content is preferably adjacent to or spatially near the annotation, though embodiments of the inventions may be configured to operate using human-comprehensible content located anywhere in the document. As will be understood below, the human-comprehensible content is used to identify the digital version of the document that is being or has been annotated. Where the human-comprehensible content is adjacent to or spatially near (including under) the annotation, the content can be used to identify the location in the digital version of the document where the annotation is found in the printed version of the document. The imaging component can also be used to record the annotation itself.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Finally, the electronic input device <b>102</b> includes a data communication component <b>206</b> through which the electronic input device <b>102</b> communicates with a computing system, such as the server system <b>104</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The data communication component <b>206</b> is used to upload the data and information recorded by the imaging component <b>204</b> and by the recording component, which can be the audio device <b>201</b> and/or the writing tip <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If desired, the electronic input device <b>102</b> records and transmits information while the user is annotating. In other embodiments, the electronic input device records and transmits information after the annotation has been completed. The data communication component <b>206</b> hosts a wired or wireless connection unit through which the electronic input device <b>102</b> communicates.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments of the invention, the electronic input device <b>102</b> includes a processor that processes human-comprehensible content to generate data such as a hash value or a digital signature concerning the human-comprehensible content as will be described in greater detail herein. Such data is then transmitted to a computing system, such as the server system <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments of the invention, the electronic input device <b>102</b> may be associated with a docking station. In such embodiments, the electronic input device <b>102</b> captures and stores data, such as annotations and images of human-comprehensible content in a document that is sufficient to identify the document and possibly a location in the document. The electronic input device <b>102</b> communicates the annotations and images of the human-comprehensible content to a computing system, such as the server system <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, when the electronic input device <b>102</b> is docked in the docking station.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an exemplary computer architecture for the server system <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, suitable for use in implementing embodiments of the invention. The server system <b>104</b> connects to the network <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) using a network interface <b>302</b>. The network interface <b>302</b> includes the necessary hardware and software to allow the server system <b>104</b> to communicate with other computing devices connected to the network <b>106</b> by use of one or more suitable communication protocols, such as TCP/IP protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The server system <b>104</b> further includes a processor <b>304</b>, memory <b>306</b>, and an input/output interface <b>308</b>, all communicatively connected together and to the network interface <b>302</b> by a communication bus <b>310</b>. The processor <b>304</b> is configured to operate in accordance with computer program instructions stored in a memory, such as the memory <b>306</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The memory <b>306</b> may be comprised of any type of storage facility, and may include, by way of example, RAM, ROM, and/or removable computer-readable media.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The memory <b>306</b> additionally stores program code and data that provide a database manager <b>314</b> and a correlation program <b>316</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As noted above, the server system <b>104</b> may receive data concerning an annotation on a paper version of a document from an electronic input device, such as the electronic input device <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The annotation is stored in the annotations database <b>110</b>, and may be stored in association with a digital version of the document if a digital version of the document is found. Storing an annotation in association with a digital version of the document may be accomplished in any suitable manner. Such a manner can be, for example, simply storing the annotation in the annotations database <b>110</b> with an indication of the digital work to which the annotation pertains, and if appropriate, the location(s) within the digital work to which the annotation pertains.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides a functional block diagram of one exemplary implementation of the correlation program <b>316</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As noted above, the correlation program <b>316</b> receives information about an annotation of a document and searches to locate a digital version of the document in the digital works database <b>108</b>. If a digital version of the document is found, the correlation program <b>316</b> saves the annotation in the annotations database <b>110</b> in association with the digital version of the document. If the digital version of the document is not found, the correlation program <b>316</b> still saves the annotation in the annotations database <b>110</b>, expecting a digital version of the document can be automatically or manually identified at a later time. In some embodiments of the invention, the correlation program <b>316</b> is further capable of augmenting the digital version of the document with the annotation and providing the resultant combination for display, playback, and/or printing to an output device such as the output device <b>112</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> specifically illustrates exemplary components that may be included in a correlation program <b>316</b>. These components include an image correction module <b>402</b>, a character recognition module <b>404</b>, and a source identification module <b>406</b>. Collectively, the components of the correlation program <b>316</b> can be used to correlate an annotation on a paper version of a document with a digital version of the document.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the electronic input device <b>102</b> records an annotation and an image of human-comprehensible content in a document (hereinafter &#x201c;comprehensible content&#x201d;) that is sufficient to identify the document and possibly a location in the document. The comprehensible content may include words, letters, characters, pictures, etc. that convey meaning to a human reader of the document. Such content does not include identifiers, such as bar codes, watermarks, cross hatches, etc., that are not comprehensible to a human, even though they can be used by a machine to uniquely identify a document. Embodiments of the invention can be configured to use the comprehensible content and possibly spatial relationships among the comprehensible content to locate the digital version of the document, as will be discussed later below in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments of the invention, the electronic input device <b>102</b> may record and transmit an annotation and an image of comprehensible content in a document before, during, or after the time in which the document is annotated. If the data contains an image of the annotation and/or comprehensible content in the document, upon receiving the image, the image correction module <b>402</b> may be engaged to reduce or eliminate distortions, if any, in the image. Any of a variety of known methods for image correction may be used in conjunction with the invention. For example, the image correction module <b>402</b> may be comprised of one or more image correction applications such as a perspective skew correction application, a rotational skew correction application, and a movement stabilization application. Individually or collectively the applications comprising the image correction module <b>402</b> can operate to reduce or eliminate distortions in images so that a character recognition application may better identify comprehensible content, including text, in the corrected image.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">One example of a perspective skew correction application calculates the perspective skew angles of images and adjusts the images to reduce or eliminate perspective skew. The angles of perspective skew can be calculated by analyzing one or more indictors that exist in the images of printed content. For example, a linear indicator of the skew angles is the predominant direction of white space on a page. Typically, white space exists between successive lines of text and the orientation of a page in relation to an input device may be derived by calculating the prevailing direction of white space. This linear indicator and other indicators such as the prevailing direction of character strings, orientation of geometric shapes and page edges, and the orientation of individual characters may all be used, individually or collectively, to determine the perspective skew angles of a page image.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the perspective skew angles are calculated, a perspective skew correction application can adjust the images to reduce or eliminate perspective skew. More specifically, the perspective skew correction application can map pixels from a source image to a destination image based on a mapping function that eliminates perspective skew. The source image may be mapped to a destination image with a technique known as mesh warping transformation. Generally described, mesh-warping transformation applies two-dimensional geometric transformations to reshape geometric alignments. In order to reshape geometric alignments, a correspondence is established between feature primitives, e.g., curves, line segments, and points. Each feature primitive specifies an image feature or landmark. The correspondence between feature primitives and the perspective skew angles is then used to compute a mapping function that defines the change in each pixel's location between the source and destination images. Applying the mapping function to the source image produces a destination image free from perspective skew. One algorithm for performing a mesh warping transformation that may be used in conjunction with the present invention to eliminate perspective skew may be found in &#x201c;A Mesh Warping Algorithm Based on Weighted Lapacian Smoothing,&#x201d; by Suzanne Shontz and Stephen Vavasis, in <i>Proceedings of the </i>12<i>th International Meshing Roundtable</i>, Sandia National Laboratories, September 2003, pp. 147-158.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Rotational skew refers to distortion in an image when text follows a curved path out of alignment with an associated line of text. Rotational skew in a page image is common when text is located near a binding. A rotational skew correction application can determine if an image contains text that is rotationally skewed and perform adjustments to reduce or eliminate the skew. To determine if rotational skew exists, one embodiment of a rotational skew correction application analyzes lines of text and determines the predominant direction of the text. Text that is out of alignment with the predominant direction and follows a curved path is identified as being rotationally skewed. Similar to the perspective skew correction application described above, the rotational skew correction application may use a technique of mesh warping transformation to produce an image that is not rotationally skewed. However, the mapping function that corrects rotational skew generally uses different parameters than the mapping function that corrects perspective skew. For example, the mapping function generated by the rotational skew correction application determines the amount that text is rotationally skewed (i.e., rotational variance). Then a correspondence is established between feature primitives. The correspondence between feature primitives and the rotational variance are then used to calculate the mapping function that corrects rotational skew. One algorithm for performing a mesh warping transformation that may be used in conjunction with the present invention to eliminate rotational skew may be found in &#x201c;A Mesh Warping Algorithm Based on Weighted Lapacian Smoothing,&#x201d; by Suzanne Shontz and Stephen Vavasis, referenced above.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The imaging component <b>204</b> of the electronic input device described above may capture one or more images of the document with text that is distorted or blurred due to movement. A movement stabilization application can adjust an image to reduce or eliminate this type of distortion. More specifically, a movement stabilization application can identify character edges in images by identifying pairs of adjacent pixels that have a predetermined difference in brightness. The brightness of each pixel along an edge is then exaggerated so that dark pixels are darkened and light pixels are lightened. The result is to increase the contrast between neighboring pixels and create characters with visually perceptible edges.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be well understood that the image correction module <b>402</b> may implement other techniques for correcting images that are generally known in the art. For example, character recognition applications often have difficulty recognizing text in images with heavy noise (i.e., grainy or heavily pixilated images). The image correction module <b>402</b> may reduce the amount of noise in an image by adjusting pixels that are not associated with text in the image.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The character recognition module <b>404</b> operates on the image to identify comprehensible content, such as text, in the image. Where suitable, the character recognition module <b>404</b> may translates images of characters using a standard encoding scheme (such as ASCII or Unicode) to digitally represent the characters in an image. These standard encoding schemes specify a correspondence between digital bit patterns and symbols of a written language, thus allowing a computer to process, store, and communicate character-oriented information. In embodiments of the invention, the term &#x201c;character recognition&#x201d; refers to all forms of optical character recognition (using optical techniques such as mirrors and lenses) and digital character recognition (using scanners and computer algorithms). Since very few applications remain that use true optical techniques, the term OCR as used herein includes all forms of optical and digital character recognition.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this particular embodiment, text that is identified by the character recognition module <b>404</b> may constitute comprehensible content in the document that is usable to locate the digital version of the document. As will be described below, the source identification module <b>406</b> is then engaged to query the digital works database <b>108</b> to identify a digital version of the document that is being or has been annotated. The source identification module <b>406</b> may also determine the location in the digital version of the document that corresponds to the location of the annotation in the paper version of the document.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Finally, the correlation program <b>316</b> works in conjunction with the database manager <b>314</b> to store the annotation in the annotations database <b>110</b>, preferably identifying the location at which the annotation should appear in the digital work. In some embodiments of the invention, the correlation program <b>316</b> may further be employed to augment the digital work with the annotation and provide the augmented digital work for display, play back, and/or printing to an output device, such as the output device <b>112</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> illustrate one exemplary implementation of a process <b>500</b> for correlating an annotation on a paper version of a document with a digital version of the document. The process <b>500</b> is described with reference to the systems and programs illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. Briefly stated, the process <b>500</b> receives from an electronic input device <b>102</b> an image of human-comprehensible content in a document that is sufficient to identify the document and possibly a location in the document. The process <b>500</b> uses the data to locate a digital version of the document in the digital works database <b>108</b>. Upon locating a digital version of the document, the process <b>500</b> further identifies the location of the annotation in the digital version of the document. The location of the annotation may be associated with any aspect of the document, including but not limited to the front or back of the document or a section, chapter, page, paragraph, sentence, phrase, word, character, etc. in the document. The process <b>500</b> then stores the annotation in the annotation database <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As noted above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments of the invention, the electronic input device <b>102</b> records images of comprehensible content in a document and uploads the images to the server system <b>104</b>, as indicated at block <b>502</b>. The process <b>500</b> executes a routine <b>504</b> to locate a digital version of the document in the digital works database <b>110</b>, using the received images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> illustrates one exemplary implementation of the routine <b>504</b> and will be discussed in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After executing the routine <b>504</b>, the process <b>500</b> determines whether a digital version of the document has been found, as indicated at decision block <b>506</b>. If the process <b>500</b> has not been able to locate a digital version of the document using the received image(s), the process <b>500</b> proceeds to check if it has received additional images containing comprehensible content from the electronic input device <b>102</b>. See decision block <b>508</b>. If the answer is YES, the process <b>500</b> loops back to the routine <b>504</b> to search for a digital version of the document using the additional images. If the process <b>500</b> does not receive additional images from the electronic input device <b>102</b>, the process <b>500</b> proceeds to receive and store the annotation from the electronic input device <b>102</b>. See block <b>509</b>. A digital version of the document may be identified later, by manual or automatic searching and matching.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If the answer to decision block <b>506</b> is YES, the process <b>500</b> has successfully located a digital version of the document, and proceeds at continuation terminal A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) to identify the location of the annotation in the digital version of the document. See block <b>510</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, the process <b>500</b> may also send a notification to the electronic input device <b>102</b>, acknowledging the successful identification of a digital version of the document that the user is annotating, as indicated at block <b>512</b>. For example, the electronic input device <b>102</b> may emit a beep upon receiving the notification from the server system <b>104</b>. At that moment, the electronic input device <b>102</b> may stop transmitting images used for purposes of identifying the digital version of the document, though additional images containing one or more annotations on the paper version of the document may be sent to the server system <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At block <b>514</b>, the process <b>500</b> receives the annotation and proceeds to process the annotation, as indicated at block <b>516</b>. As noted above, the annotation can be (or include) an executable instruction concerning the document. Such an instruction can be, for example, to look up a certain phrase or word in the document, to locate annotations made by other users, to locate annotations concerning a certain subject matter in the document, to print an object in the document, to execute an action on a remote system, etc. Typically, an annotation containing an instruction starts with a one or more predefined characters or words that can be recognized as indicating an executable instruction. Upon identifying such an annotation with an instruction, the process <b>500</b> executes the instruction contained in the annotation. Alternatively, the process <b>500</b> may trigger a new process to execute the instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Part of processing the annotation at block <b>516</b> may include storing the annotation in the annotation database <b>110</b>. In some embodiments of the invention, the process <b>500</b> receives and stores the annotation as an image file. In other embodiments, the process <b>500</b> processes the annotation using a standard character recognition process that converts the annotation into text, and stores the annotation as a text file. A text file may also be used to store the annotation when the annotation is received in text format from the user (e.g., using a keyboard). Alternatively, in the case that the annotation was dictated by the user and captured by the audio device <b>201</b> in the electronic input device <b>102</b>, the annotation can be saved as an audio file.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments of the invention, the process <b>500</b> augments a digital version of the document with the annotation, as indicated at block <b>518</b>. When augmenting a digital version of a document with an annotation, the process <b>500</b> may cause the annotation to appear in the digital version of the document at approximately the same location as the annotation appeared on the paper version of the document, otherwise referred to herein as in-line insertion. In other embodiments, the process <b>500</b> may cause the annotation to appear as a footnote to the digital version of the document on the page where the annotation is located, at the end of the document, or on a separate page. If desired, a footnote indicator may appear in the digital version of the document at approximately the same location that the annotation appeared on the paper version of the document. The annotation may be presented in a graphic format (typically as an image of handwriting) or in a text format (which may be the result of applying OCR technology to a handwritten annotation or input received from a device such as a keyboard). A handwritten annotation may be displayed just as it is received from the electronic input device <b>102</b>. The process <b>500</b> may then send the augmented document to an output device, such as the output device <b>112</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as indicated at block <b>520</b>. It should be understood, in the context of the invention, the terms &#x201c;text&#x201d; and &#x201c;character&#x201d; include all forms of letters, characters, symbols, numbers, formulae, etc., that may be used to represent information on a paper version of a document. The term &#x201c;page&#x201d; broadly refers to any space of two dimensions or greater in which content may reside.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> illustrates one exemplary implementation of the routine <b>504</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> for locating a digital version of a document. The routine <b>504</b> implements aspects of the correlation program <b>316</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Upon receiving an image from the electronic input device <b>102</b>, the routine <b>504</b> first checks at decision block <b>530</b> if there is any distortion in the image received. If there is distortion in the image, the routine <b>504</b> proceeds to block <b>532</b> to correct the image using an image correction module, such as the image correction module <b>402</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and described above. In a case where there is no distortion in the image or if the distortion has been corrected (or if no distortion correction is available or desired), the routine <b>504</b> proceeds to block <b>534</b> to process the image. When processing the image, the routine <b>504</b> may perform a character recognition process on the image. As described above, with respect to the character recognition module <b>404</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a character recognition process converts characters in an image to electronic text. Examples of commercially-available optical character recognition software include OmniPage Pro from ScanSoft, Inc., and FineReader from SmartLink Corporation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The routine <b>504</b> then proceeds to block <b>536</b> to locate a digital version of the document using the human-comprehensible content in the document. In some embodiments of the invention, one or more types of computer-implemented matching may be used to identify a digital version of the document. Such computer-implemented matching can include text matching using text resulting from performing character recognition on the received image. Alternatively, in other embodiments, signature matching using a digital signature derived from the received image may be used to identify a digital version of the document.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, using one or more strings of text (i.e., a collection of one or more characters) from the document obtained via the character recognition process, the server system <b>104</b> may search a database of content of known source for strings of content that match. In this example, the server system <b>104</b> may compare some or all of the text obtained from the printed document with digital text stored in the digital works database <b>108</b>. If matching text is found in the digital works database <b>108</b> to uniquely correlate the image of comprehensible content with content of a known source, the identity of the digital version of the document is known. Similar matching algorithms may be employed where document is an audio or video work and the &#x201c;image&#x201d; received from the electronic input device <b>102</b> is a segment of audio or video. The server system <b>104</b> may compare the segment of audio or video, or some transformation thereof, with a digital works database of known content in order to find content that matches the input segment. If matching content is identified, the identity of the digital version of the document is known.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Other forms of computer-implemented matching may be used in embodiments of the invention. For example, rather than using a string of text to search the digital works database <b>108</b>, the image of the document may itself be used to generate a digital signature that is then compared to digital signatures of content of known source. As will be seen below, optical character recognition may or may not be needed in such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, a digital signature is generated from an image of a document by quantifying one or more characteristics of the image. Characteristics such as the amount of white space existing on a page, the distance between lines of printed text, the number of characters, words, or ink marks on the page or in a segment of the text in the page, or the placement of graphics in text or in the page, may all be used, either individually or collectively, to generate a digital signature that represents the image. Signal information in an image may also be transformed to another domain, such as a frequency domain, to generate a digital signature that represents the image.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Once a digital signature is generated from the image of the document, the digital version of the document may be identified by searching a repository of digital signatures generated from digital works of known source using the same process as employed on the received image. A matching digital signature results in identification of the digital version of the imaged document. Some caution should be exercised however when generating and comparing digital signatures of images with distortions from faxing, scanning, multi-generation copying, inconsistent lighting or shadowing, or other skewing that may change or degrade the quality of an image of content.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In yet another embodiment, a digital signature may be obtained using a hash function that operates on a subset of the comprehensible content, such as text, obtained from an image of a document. The hash function produces a hash key (sometimes referred to as a hash value). As known to those skilled in the art, hash functions can be used to represent a large amount of data with a smaller range of data, and are particularly suitable for fast searching. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment, a hash key for a page of printed content may be generated using digital text contained within predetermined fields on the page. For example, the first character of each line of text in a page and the length of the first word in each line may be combined to form a hash key. In another example, a hash key may be generated using a hash function that identifies the first character in one or more lines of text and combines it with the number of &#x201c;ink marks&#x201d; or strokes used in the first word, including punctuation, in each line of text.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Multiple hash keys for an image of a document may also be derived and used for searching the digital works database <b>108</b> to identify the digital version of the document. For example, a hash function could be employed on portions of text occurring at the top and bottom and left and right corners of the text. Having multiple hash keys for a document image is useful in cases where part of an image received from the electronic input device <b>102</b> is obscured or distorted. A hash function operating on text in an unobscured or undistorted portion of the image may be used to generate a suitable hash key that identifies the digital version of the document when a matching hash key is found in the digital works database <b>108</b>. In these examples, the optical character recognition process is not necessarily performed on an entire image of a document nor is an image containing an entire page of a document required.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After identifying the digital version of the document, the routine <b>504</b> may also identify the location of the annotation in the document, as indicated at block <b>538</b>, for later display of the annotation with the digital version of the document. In one exemplary implementation, the routine <b>504</b> may incorporate data obtained from the character recognition process indicating the relative location of text identified in the image received from the electronic input device <b>102</b>. OCR software is capable of recording X-Y positions of text identified in an image. One or more segments of identified text adjacent to an annotation in the image may be selected by the routine <b>504</b>. The digital version of the document is analyzed and the location of these segments in the digital version of the document is determined. Since the selected segments were adjacent to (or under) the annotation, the location of the annotation in the digital version of the document is known. This location information can be stored with the annotation in the annotations database <b>110</b>. One or more distances may also be calculated between the selected segments and the annotation itself. The additional distance information can be used to position the annotation more precisely with the digital version of the work when augmenting the digital work with the annotation at a later time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Returning to block <b>536</b> described above, OCR text position data can also be used to identify the digital version of the document. Segments of text identified in an image received from the electronic input device <b>102</b>, and the relative distance between the segments, can be determined to form a unique digital signature. Documents of known identity in the digital works database <b>108</b> (stored with text position data possibly obtained by the same OCR process run earlier on the known documents) are analyzed to see if any one of them contains the same segments of text having the same spatial relationship among them. When a document is found with the same segments of text having the same spatial relationship among them (i.e., a matching digital signature), the identity of the document is known.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Alternatively, as noted above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments of the invention, the electronic input device <b>102</b> processes the image of the human-comprehensible content to generate data such as a hash key or a digital signature concerning the human-comprehensible content. In these embodiments, the electronic input device <b>102</b> may generate a hash key or digital signature by using the same or similar hash key and digital signature generation procedures described above. Upon receiving such data, the process <b>500</b> may use the one or more types of computer-implemented matching described above to identify a digital version of the document and the location of the annotation in the digital version of the document.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As for augmenting and presenting the digital version of the document with stored annotations, as previously described, the annotation may appear in the digital version of the document at approximately the same location where the annotation appeared on the paper version of the document. In one embodiment, a layered display may be used to create this effect where the digital work (without annotation) is displayed and the annotation is displayed on another layer superposed over the layer with the digital work. Alternatively, the data forming an image of the digital work (e.g., bit map or vector data) may be modified to incorporate the data representing the annotation, with the modified digital work then being provided for display. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a digital version of a document <b>600</b> where annotations <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> have been caused to appear &#x201c;in-line&#x201d; at the location where they appeared on the paper version of the document <b>600</b>.
