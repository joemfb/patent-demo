<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Parallel Forking is a feature in SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) that allows a user to be called simultaneously on several SIP-enabled devices. For example, parallel forking may involve simultaneous ringing where a communications network rings all of the communication devices associated with a user, i.e., a user's work, home, cell and any other device associated with the user, at the same time. Accordingly, parallel forking forwards copies of a request to initiate communication to multiple destinations simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">However, in order to implement parallel forking, each of the communication devices are assigned the same AOR (Address of Record). While sharing the same AOR across multiple devices allows for valuable services like parallel forking, a problem arises related to feature control. Namely, with present approaches there is no way to grant one device control of features compared to the control the other devices are granted. Such features may include the ability to send a call directly to voicemail, or even call forwarding. This is problematic because the end user can only be in one location at a time, even though the user may be logged into multiple devices simultaneously, each device located in different physical areas. The consequence is that an unauthorized user could answer or initiate a call using an endpoint that is logged into by another user and access any of the features normally granted only to the original user.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an embodiment, a method of operating a feature control module within a communications system comprises identifying a location of a user, wherein a plurality of communication devices are associated with the user, identifying at least one of the communication devices in proximity to the location of the user, and granting feature control for a communication session to at least one communication device based on the identification of the location of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In another embodiment, a computer readable includes instructions stored thereon that when executed perform a method for operating a feature control module, the method comprising the steps of identifying a location of a user, wherein a plurality of communication devices are associated with the user, identifying at least one of the communication devices in proximity to the location, and granting feature control for a communication session to at least one communication device based on the identification of the location of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In yet another embodiment, a communication system comprises a plurality of communication devices and a feature control module.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Systems and methods are provided herein for controlling features on end communication devices according to which communication device is in proximity with the intended user. Exemplary systems and methods grant feature control to selected communication devices based on an inferred presence of the user nearby the selected communication device. In at least one example, feature control is granted to a communication device based on physical activity that indicates presence of the user near the communication device. Such a configuration may allow the system to provide full feature control for a device the user is likely to be using while still allowing a common address of record with multiple other devices registered to the same user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description and associated figures teach the best mode of the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects of the best mode may be simplified or omitted. The following claims specify the scope of the invention. Note that some aspects of the best mode may not fall within the scope of the invention as specified by the claims. Thus, those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from the best mode that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a communications system <b>100</b> that includes a communications network <b>110</b> configured to facilitate a communication session between a user <b>120</b> and one or more third parties (not shown). The user <b>120</b> may have access to a plurality of communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> located at a plurality of locations <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>. Though shown at fixed locations, it will be appreciated that the locations <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> may be transitory, fixed, or some combination thereof. Further, a number of communication devices may be located at any number of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As will be discussed in more detail hereinafter, the communications system <b>100</b> includes a feature control module <b>115</b> that is configured to grant feature control to selected communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> based on proximity of the user <b>120</b> to the communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>. Features that may be controlled as described herein may include the ability to send calls directly to voicemail, call forwarding, voicemail features, and other features related to the control or access of a communication session, such as a call. In the illustrated example, the feature control module <b>115</b> is implemented in the communication network <b>110</b>. In other examples, the feature control module <b>115</b> may be separate from the communication network, implemented in the communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>, or implemented in some other manner. Proximity of the user <b>120</b> to the communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> may be inferred in several ways, as will also be discussed in more detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communications network <b>110</b> is operatively associated with each of the communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>. In particular, the communications network <b>110</b> may be configured to perform the methods shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a method <b>200</b> of initially establishing feature control for communication devices associated with a user based on a location of the user. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the method <b>200</b> begins at step <b>210</b> when the communications network <b>110</b> receives a request to initiate a communications session with the user <b>120</b>. The request is directed to the communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> associated with the user <b>120</b> at step <b>215</b>. Steps <b>210</b> and <b>220</b> may be optional or may be part of an initial process for initially determining to which communication device to grant feature control. It will also be appreciated that the communication session may begin at any point during the method. Further, it will be appreciated that the management of feature control may be performed independently of the actual conduct of the communications session if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The user <b>120</b> may move between any of the locations <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> as the user so desires. Thus, in order to implement parallel forking, it may be desirable to direct the request to a variety of locations but to grant feature control only to a communication device at the location the user is likely present.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, the method continues at step <b>220</b> when the feature control module <b>115</b> identifies a location of the user <b>120</b>. In one example, the feature control module <b>115</b> identifies the location of the user <b>120</b> through inferences. In other examples, direct determination of the user's location may be performed. Various processes are described herein for inferring the location of the user <b>120</b> as well as for directly determining the user's location. Several exemplary processes will be described in more detail at appropriate points hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> are located at various locations <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>. Once the location of the user <b>120</b> has been identified, at step <b>230</b> at least one of the communication devices in proximity to the inferred location of the user <b>120</b> is identified. Thereafter, at step <b>240</b> the feature control module <b>115</b> grants feature control for communication sessions to selected communication device(s) based on the identification of the inferred location. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a method of initially establishing feature control for communication devices associated with a user based on an inferred location of the user</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a method <b>245</b> of managing feature control among various communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b>. Feature control may be granted to the appropriate communication devices <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> in a dynamic manner as the user <b>120</b> moves between various locations <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In at least one example, determinations as to whether feature control should be granted to a given device may occur independently of requests to initiate communication sessions with the user or even independently of the actual conduct of the communication sessions. In such examples, the communications system <b>100</b> may monitor the location of the user at step <b>250</b> constantly or periodically. In other examples, monitoring the location of the user <b>120</b> according to step <b>250</b> may be performed in response to a request to initiate a communication session with the user <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In either case, the method <b>245</b> also includes identifying communication devices at or near the user's location at step <b>260</b>. Thereafter, if the communication device(s) at or near the user's location have feature control already granted to them (YES, step <b>270</b>), the communications system <b>100</b> continues to monitor the location of the user <b>120</b>. If, however, the communication devices at the user's location have not been granted feature control (NO, step <b>270</b>), at step <b>280</b> the communication devices at the user's location are granted feature control. Thereafter, tracking of the location of the user <b>120</b> and the feature control status of communication devices at those locations continue as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When a user changes location, that change in location will be noted, communication devices at that location will be identified, and those devices will then be granted feature control. This may occur on an on-going basis. Accordingly, feature control may flow with the location of the user <b>120</b> based on inferences about the user's location. Exemplary methods of inferring a user's location will now be described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate a communications system <b>300</b> that is configured to infer the location of a user <b>320</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the communications system <b>300</b> includes a communications network <b>310</b> having a feature control module <b>315</b> that is configured to infer the presence of a user at various locations <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, identify which of the communication devices <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> are at the inferred location, and grant feature control to a selected device or devices.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the communications system <b>300</b> includes sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> positioned at each of the locations <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, <b>344</b> respectively. The sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be configured to detect the presence of a secondary device <b>360</b> that is usually within the control of the user <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be configured to detect the presence of devices utilizing short range wireless signals. Exemplary short range wireless signals include wireless devices, such as mobile devices, wireless mobile headsets and other such devices. The sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be configured to detect the signals, analyze the signals, and determine whether the secondary device <b>360</b> is associated with the user <b>320</b>. If the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> detect a signal indicative that the secondary device <b>360</b> is a device associated with the user <b>320</b>, it may be inferred that the user <b>320</b> is at the location corresponding to the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the sensor <b>354</b> at location <b>344</b> detects the presence of the secondary device <b>360</b>. In response to the detection of the secondary device <b>360</b>, the feature control module <b>315</b> grants feature control to the communication device <b>334</b> at location <b>344</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> are shown separate from the communication devices <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> for ease of reference. In at least one example, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be integrated into the communication devices <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>. For example, a sensor integrated with a deskphone may detect via short range wireless signals the presence of the user's cell phone or other secondary device. In such an example, the desk phone would then know that the user is likely nearby the desk phone, and can therefore limit feature control to the desk phone for the period of time during which the user is nearby the desk phone. Feature control would be taken away from the other communication devices <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> registered to the same user, while preserving the fundamental benefit of parallel forking.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, once the secondary device <b>360</b> is moved to a different location, the feature control module <b>315</b> withdraws feature control from the communication device <b>334</b>. Feature control is transferred to the communication device <b>332</b> at the location in which the sensor <b>352</b> detects the presence of the secondary device <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In yet another example, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be physical buttons on the communication devices <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>. In such an example, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be actuated by the user <b>320</b> to indicate presence. This may be appropriate in a scenario whereby the phone is already located in an area linked to a particular user&#x2014;such as in an office or study. The user <b>320</b> could actuate the button to indicate his/her presence nearby the phone. As in the examples above, feature control could be granted to that phone and taken away from other devices. In the illustrated example, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> are coupled directly with the communication network <b>310</b> and/or the feature control module <b>315</b>. In other examples, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be in communication with the communication devices <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> alternatively or in addition to coupling directly to the communication network <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the examples described above, user presence at a location is inferred by detecting the presence of active secondary devices. In yet another example, the secondary device <b>360</b> may be a passive secondary device. Passive secondary devices may include credentials, such as badges, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and the like. In such an example, the sensors <b>350</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> may be a card or badge reader. Such a sensor may be separate from or integrated into the communications <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> as desired. In this example, the user <b>320</b> would swipe a badge or card when entering an area, such as a lab, office, or library. Feature control would then be transferred to the phone in that area (this assumes that the user is already logged into that phone). Feature control may then be taken away from other communication devices registered to the same user, while preserving the fundamental benefit of parallel forking.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In any of the cases above, the presence of the user nearby any of the devices may be tracked by the communications network, which maps the AOR to the address of the underlying devices serving the user. Then when features are invoked, the address of the underlying device invoking the feature can be compared to the address of the device granted feature control. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate examples in which the presence of a secondary device is detected in order to infer the presence of a user at a plurality of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a communications system <b>400</b> in which a communications network <b>410</b> includes a feature control module <b>415</b> that grants feature control to various communications devices <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b> based on interaction of a user <b>420</b> with secondary devices <b>460</b>, <b>462</b>, <b>464</b> to infer the presence of the user <b>420</b> at various locations <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>444</b>. Exemplary secondary devices include, without limitation peripheral devices such as keyboards, mice, or other devices. In the example shown, when interaction with the secondary device <b>464</b> is detected, it may be inferred that the user <b>420</b> is present at location <b>444</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As a result, the feature control module <b>415</b> grants feature control to the communication device <b>434</b> at the location <b>444</b> in which the presence of the user <b>420</b> has been inferred and withdraws feature control from the other secondary devices <b>460</b>, <b>462</b>. Similarly, the feature control module <b>415</b> may grant feature control to secondary devices when the inferred location of the user <b>420</b> changes in a similar manner as described above. User interaction with computing devices may also be used to infer the location of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method <b>500</b> of operating a communications system according to one example. The method begins by identifying and analyzing occurrences of appointments for a user at step <b>510</b>. In such an example, the communications system may have access to a user's appointment calendar. It will be appreciated that appointments often include information about the time and location of the appointment. Accordingly, analyzing appointments for the user may include identifying the time and location of each of the appointments.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>520</b>, the method continues by identifying communication devices associated with the user at the appointment location. If the user is scheduled to be present at a location in which a communication device is located, then at step <b>530</b> the method may include granting feature control to the communication device, if any, present at the location of the appointment during the time of the appointment. For instance, if a user's calendar indicates that she is in a lab area, then feature control can be granted to a phone in the lab area.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To this point, management of feature control has been discussed with reference to methods in which inferences are made about a user's presence at various locations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flowchart of a method <b>600</b> of operating a communications system in which a location of the user is determined through voice analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, the method <b>600</b> begins by receiving a request to initiate a communications session with a user at step <b>610</b> and directing the request to communication devices associated with the user at step <b>620</b>. At step <b>630</b> initiation of the communication is detected. For example, the method may include detecting that a phone call has been answered.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>640</b>, the method then includes performing voice analytics on the communications session. If the voice analytics indicate the actual user is the intended user (YES, step <b>650</b>), the location of the user is verified as being near the communication device at step <b>660</b> and feature control is granted to the communication device at step <b>670</b>. If, however, the voice analytics indicate the actual user is not the intended user (NO, step <b>650</b>) the communications session is terminated at step <b>680</b>.</p>
