<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to wellbore fluids. In particular, embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to processes for mixing wellbore fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When drilling or completing wells in earth formations, various fluids typically are used in the well for a variety of reasons. Common uses for well fluids include: lubrication and cooling of drill bit cutting surfaces while drilling generally or drilling-in (i.e., drilling in a targeted petroliferous formation), transportation of &#x201c;cuttings&#x201d; (pieces of formation dislodged by the cutting action of the teeth on a drill bit) to the surface, controlling formation fluid pressure to prevent blowouts, maintaining well stability, suspending solids in the well, minimizing fluid loss into and stabilizing the formation through which the well is being drilled, fracturing the formation in the vicinity of the well, displacing the fluid within the well with another fluid, cleaning the well, testing the well, transmitting hydraulic horsepower to the drill bit, fluid used for emplacing a packer, abandoning the well or preparing the well for abandonment, and otherwise treating the well or the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, drilling fluids should be pumpable under pressure down through strings of drilling pipe, then through and around the drilling bit head deep in the earth, and then returned back to the earth surface through an annulus between the outside of the drill stem and the hole wall or casing. Beyond providing drilling lubrication and efficiency, and retarding wear, drilling fluids should suspend and transport solid particles to the surface for screening out and disposal. In addition, the fluids should be capable of suspending additive weighting agents (to increase specific gravity of the mud), generally finely ground barites (barium sulfate ore), and transport clay and other substances capable of adhering to and coating the borehole surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Drilling fluids are generally characterized as thixotropic fluid systems. That is, they exhibit low viscosity when sheared, such as when in circulation (as occurs during pumping or contact with the moving drilling bit). However, when the shearing action is halted, the fluid should be capable of suspending the solids it contains to prevent gravity separation. In addition, when the drilling fluid is under shear conditions and a free-flowing near-liquid, it must retain a sufficiently high enough viscosity to carry all unwanted particulate matter from the bottom of the well bore to the surface. The drilling fluid formulation should also allow the cuttings and other unwanted particulate material to be removed or otherwise settle out from the liquid fraction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is an increasing need for drilling fluids having the rheological profiles that enable these wells to be drilled more easily. Drilling fluids having tailored rheological properties ensure that cuttings are removed from the wellbore as efficiently and effectively as possible to avoid the formation of cuttings beds in the well which may cause the drill string to become stuck, among other issues. There is also the need, from a drilling fluid hydraulics perspective (equivalent circulating density), to reduce the pressures required to circulate the fluid, this helps to avoid exposing the formation to excessive forces that may fracture the formation causing the fluid, and possibly the well, to be lost. In addition, an enhanced profile is necessary to prevent settlement or sag of the weighting agent in the fluid. If this occurs, it can lead to an uneven density profile within the circulating fluid system that may result in well control (gas/fluid influx) and wellbore stability problems (caving/fractures).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To obtain the fluid characteristics required to meet these challenges, the fluid must be easy to pump, so it requires the minimum amount of pressure to force it through restrictions in the circulating fluid system, such as bit nozzles or down-hole tools. Or in other words, the fluid must have the lowest possible viscosity under high shear conditions. Conversely, in zones of the well where the area for fluid flow is large and the velocity of the fluid is slow or where there are low shear conditions, the viscosity of the fluid needs to be as high as possible in order to suspend and transport the drilled cuttings. This also applies to the periods when the fluid is left static in the hole, where both cuttings and weighting materials need to be kept suspended to prevent settlement. However, it should also be noted that the viscosity of the fluid should not continue to increase under static conditions to unacceptable levels. If this occurs, it can lead to excessive pressures when the fluid is circulated again that can fracture the formation, or alternatively it can lead to lost time if the force required to regain a fully circulating fluid system is beyond the limits of the pumps.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Depending on the particular well to be drilled, a drilling operator typically selects between a water-based drilling fluid and an oil-based or synthetic drilling fluid. Each of the water-based fluid and oil-based fluid typically include a variety of additives to create a fluid having the rheological profile necessary for a particular drilling application. For example, a variety of compounds are typically added to water- or brine-based well fluids, including viscosifiers, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants, pH control additives, surfactants, solvents, thinners, thinning agents, and/or weighting agents, among other additives. Some typical water- or brine-based well fluid viscosifying additives include clays, synthetic polymers, natural polymers and derivatives thereof such as xanthan gum and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Similarly, a variety of compounds are also typically added to a oil-based fluid including weighting agents, wetting agents, orgalnophilic clays, viscosifiers, fluid loss control agents, surfactants, dispersants, interfacial tension reducers, pH buffers, mutual solvents, thinners, thinning agents and cleaning agents.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">While the preparation of drilling fluids can have a direct effect upon their performance in a well, and thus profits realized from that well, methods of drilling fluid preparation have changed little over the past several years. Typically, the mixing method still employs manual labor to empty sacks of drilling fluid components into a hopper to make an initial drilling fluid composition. However, because of agglomerates formed as a result of inadequate high shear mixing during the initial production of the drilling fluid composition, screen shakers used in a recycling process to remove drill cuttings from a fluid for recirculation into the well also filter out as much as thirty percent of the initial drilling fluid components prior to the fluid's reuse. In addition to the cost inefficiency when a drilling fluid is inadequately mixed, and thus components are aggregated and filtered from the fluid, the fluids also tend to fail in some respect in their performance downhole. Inadequate performance may result from the observations that the currently available mixing techniques hinder the ability to reach the fluids rheological capabilities. For example, it is frequently observed that drilling fluids only reach their absolute yield points after downhole circulation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, for drilling fluids that incorporate a polymer that is supplied in a dry form, the adequacy of the initial mixing is further compounded by the hydration of those polymers. When polymer particles are mixed with a liquid such as water, the outer portion of the polymer particles wet instantaneously on contact with the liquid, while the center remains unwetted. Also effecting the hydration is a viscous shell that is formed by the outer wetted portion of the polymer, further restricting the wetting of the inner portion of the polymer. These partially wetted or unwetted particles are known in the art as &#x201c;fisheyes.&#x201d; While fisheyes can be processed with mechanical mixers to a certain extent to form a homogenously wetted mixture, the mechanical Nixing not only requires energy, but also degrades the molecular bonds of the polymer and reduces the efficacy of the polymer. Thus, while many research efforts in the drilling fluid technology area focus on modifying drilling fluid formulations to obtain and optimize rheological properties and performance characteristics, the full performance capabilities of many of these fluid are not always met due to inadequate mixing techniques or molecular degradation due to mechanical mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, there exists a need for improved techniques which enable efficient and effective mixing of drilling fluids.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate to methods and systems for mixing drilling fluid components to produce drilling fluids that are substantially homogenously mixed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referrng to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>100</b> for mixing drilling fluids in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. In this embodiment, fluid supply tank (i.e., mud pit in various embodiments) <b>102</b> is connected to mixing reactor <b>104</b> via fluid line <b>106</b> such that an unmixed drilling fluid flows from fluid supply tank <b>102</b> into mixing reactor <b>104</b>. A mixed drilling fluid exits mixing reactor <b>104</b> and may be either collected in receiving tank <b>108</b> or if additional mixing is desired, the mixed fluid may be returned via recycling fluid line <b>110</b> through fluid supply tank <b>102</b> to fluid line <b>106</b> for a subsequent pass through mixing reactor <b>104</b>. Alternatively, recycled fluid line <b>110</b> may be directly connected to fluid line <b>106</b>, and the fluid need not be passed through fluid supply tank <b>102</b>. A hopper <b>112</b> is shown connected to fluid line <b>106</b> between fluid supply tank <b>102</b> and mixing reactor <b>104</b>. As the unmixed drilling fluid flows from fluid supply tank <b>102</b> to mixing reactor <b>104</b>, drilling fluid additives, may flow from hopper <b>112</b> into the unmixed drilling fluid. However, one of skill in the art would recognize that in alternative embodiments, hopper <b>112</b> may be connected to fluid supply tank <b>102</b> so that additives may be poured directly into fluid supply tank <b>102</b>, or in alternate embodiments, additives may be poured directly into fluid supply tank <b>102</b> without the use of hopper <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As a base fluid and drilling fluid additives are introduced into system <b>100</b>, a fluid regulation valve <b>114</b> (and additive regulation valve <b>116</b>, if a hopper is used) may control the flow of base fluid and drilling fluid additives, respectively, into fluid line <b>106</b> and thus mixing reactor <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a mixing reactor <b>200</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure is shown. Mixing reactor <b>200</b> includes a mixing chamber <b>202</b>, defining a flow passage for the drilling fluid, and an intake <b>204</b> and an outlet <b>206</b> through which the drilling fluid, respectively, enters unmixed and exits mixed. After drilling fluid enters the mixing reactor <b>200</b> through intake <b>204</b>, it flows into mixing chamber <b>202</b>. Inlets <b>208</b> and <b>212</b> in the side wall of mixing chamber <b>202</b> provide a first and second aerating gas, respectively, to the flow path of unmixed drilling fluid. Inlet <b>210</b> in the side walls of mixing chamber <b>202</b> provides a compressible driving fluid to the unmixed drilling fluid. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that inlets <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b> may each individually include, for example, nozzle structures, ports, isolation valve and/or aperatures. In alternate embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>202</b> may have a single inlet for injecting an aerating gas and may be placed either upstream or downstream from the driving fluid inlet <b>210</b>, or the aerating gas and the compressible driving fluid may be injected through the same inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As the driving fluid enters the mixing chamber, it may undergo a reduction in pressure and increase in velocity (typically to supersonic levels). As the high velocity driving fluid condenses via expansion and the cooling influence of the drilling fluid, a pressure reduction in the mixing chamber may result. The rapid pressure reduction is in effect an implosion within the mixing zone. A volumetric collapse of the driving fluid may draw further unmixed drilling fluid through the intake and mixing chamber. The high velocity of the driving fluid may also affect momentum transfer to the drilling fluid and accelerate the drilling fluid flow at an increased velocity. Consequently, unmixed drilling fluid may be entrained from the intake to the mixing chamber on a continuous basis. During operation of the mixing reactor, the driving fluid may be injected into the drilling fluid on a continual basis or on an intermittent basis such as in a pulsed fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the velocity of the mixed driving fluid and drilling fluid becomes supersonic, it may form a shock wave. As the shockwave grows, a low density, low pressure, supersonic energy wave or shock zone may be formed in the mixing chamber across the bore diameter, thereby increasing energy transfer. High shear forces in the shock zone may homogeneously mix the gas and liquid to produce an aerated mixture with fine bubbles. The high shear forces in the shock zone may also form a substantially homogenously mixed drilling fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The compressible driving fluid may include a substantially gaseous fluid capable of rapid pressure reduction upon exposure to the cooling influence of the drilling fluid. In some embodiments, the compressible driving fluid may include a gas or a gaseous mixture. In other embodiments, compressible driving fluid may have particles such as liquid droplets entrained therein. In a particular embodiment, the driving fluid may, for example, comprise a condensable vapor such as steam. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that when the drilling fluid contains water, steam may be a particularly appropriate form of driving fluid so there is no undesirable contamination of the drilling fluid upon contact with the steam. The driving fluid may also be a multi-phase fluid, such as a mixture of steam, air, and water droplets, e.g., where the air and water droplets may be in the form of a mist. Such a multi-phase fluid may also serve to increase the mass flow rate of the driving fluid and the density of the driving fluid to a density more similar to the density of the drilling fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The compressible driving fluid injected into the unmixed drilling fluid may have a supply temperature proportional to its supply pressure. When the compressible driving fluid is injected into the unmixed drilling fluid it can have the effect as to increase the temperature of the drilling fluid. The degree of temperature increase may be dependent on the chosen flow rate of the compressible driving fluid. In one embodiment, the temperature of the driving fluid is a temperature of at least 50&#xb0; C., providing a 30&#xb0; C. temperature rise above the ambient condition of 20&#xb0; C. In an alternate embodiment, a drilling fluid temperature rise of more than 50&#xb0; C. above ambient temperature may be observed. The compressible driving fluid may also be pressurized prior to injection into the drilling fluid. In one embodiment, the compressible driving fluid may be subjected to a pressure ranging from about 3 to about 10 bar. The process of injecting the compressible driving fluid into a lower pressure environment may result in the compressible driving fluid pressure reaching equilibrium pressure to the local environment pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">During operation of the mixing reactor, the driving fluid may be injected into the drilling fluid on a continual basis or on an intermittent basis (e.g., in a pulsed fashion). The flow rates of the driving fluid and the drilling fluid may be selected according to the desired flow rate of working fluid discharging at the outlet. The required total drilling fluid flow rate will dictate the physical size of the mixing reactor and hence the flow. Each size of mixing reactor may have a proportional relationship between the flow rate of driving fluid to that of the induced drilling fluid inlet flow rate.</p>

After the first pass, the product was sent directly to the feeding tank instead of the receiving tank, so no samples would be taken on the fly. Subsequent passes were attempted but not possible due to back pressure, causing the material to blow out from the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Sample 5: 1 lb/bbl Seleroglucan</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A gel slurry was formed by adding scleroglucan (0.286 kg) to a fresh water flow (98.2 kg) and aerating/injecting steam into the flow using a mixing reactor system as described above. Steam was injected at a rate of 3.2-0.3 kg/min with a pressure of 5 bar for 30 seconds, thus injecting 1.5 kg of steam and forming a 100 kg gel slurry sample. The sample was subjected to three passes in the mixing reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Sample 6: 2 lb/bbl Scleroglucan</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A gel slurry was formed by adding scleroglucan (0.572 kg) to a fresh water flow (97.9 kg) and aerating/injecting steam into the flow using a mixing reactor system as described above. Steam was injected at a rate of 3.2-0.3 kg/min with a pressure of 5 bar for 30 seconds, thus injecting 1.5 kg of steam and forming a 100 kg gel slurry sample. The sample was subjected to three passes in the mixing reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Sample 7: 1 lb/bbl Scleroglucan, pH 5</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A gel slurry was formed by adding scleroglucan (0.286 kg) to a fresh water flow (98.2 kg) having its pH adjusted to 5.0 using 32 g of citric acid and aerating/injecting steam into the flow using a mixing reactor system as described above. Steam was injected at a rate of 3.2-0.3 kg/min with a pressure of 5 bar for 30 seconds, thus injecting 1.5 kg of steam and forming a 100 kg gel slurry sample. The sample was subjected to three passes in the mixing reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The Theological properties of the mixed fluids in each of Samples 1-7 were determined using a Fann Model 35 Viscoineter, available from Fann Instrument Company at 120&#xb0; F. and a Brookfield Viscometer for Low Shear rate viscosity at room temperature. The samples were also subjected to a low pressure, low temperature filtration test to measure the static filtration behavior of the fluid at room temperature and 100 psi, according to specifications set by the API Fluid Loss test procedures. The gel strengths (i.e., measure of the suspending characteristics or thixotripic properties of a fluid) of the samples were evaluated by the 10 second and 10 minute gel strengths in pounds per 100 square feet in accordance with the procedures in API Bulletin RP 13B-2, 1990. The results of the tests are shown below in Table 1a-b.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In order to determine the ability of the disclosed system to optimize the rheological properties of the mixed fluids, the mud formulations of Samples 8A and 9A were also formed using a conventional Silverson mixer at 4000 rpm for 1 hour to produce Samples 8B and 9B. The Theological properties of the mixed fluids in each of Samples 8B and 9B were determined using a Fann Model 35 Viscometer, available from Fann Instrument Company at 120&#xb0; F. and a Brookfield Viscometer for Low Shear rate viscosity at room temperature. The samples were also subjected to a low pressure, low temperature filtration test to measure the filtration behavior of the fluid at room temperature and 100 psi, according to specifications set by the API Fluid Loss test procedures. The tests were each performed twice before heat rolling (BHR) and after heat rolling (AHR) for 16 hours at 150&#xb0; F. Each repetition showed identical results to the first test. The results are shown in Table 3 below.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It can be shown from the absence of fisheyes in the visual examination of the samples and the above results, that the drilling fluids may be more homogenously mixed using the methods and systems disclosed herein as compared to conventional mixing methods that produce drilling fluids encumbered by fisheyes. Additionally, in comparing the Theological propel-ties of fluids mixed by a system of the present disclosure to fluid prepared by conventional mixing techniques, the fluids of the present disclosure showed improvements in the fluids' rheological properties without downhole circulation.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Embodiments disclosed herein may provide for at least one of the following advantages. The methods disclosed herein may provide for a drilling fluid that may be substantially homogeneously mixed and substantially free of fisheyes. In enabling the formation of drilling fluids without agglomerates, the cost efficiency of the additives may be optimized by reducing the amount of additives that is filtered out by shale shakers prior to recirculation of a drilling fluid downhole. Additionally, performance of the drilling fluids downhole may be increased due to the decreased amount of agglomerated material. Increases in performance may result from the better achievement of the fluid's maximum rheological capabilities. Further cost efficiency may also be achieved by allowing for the modification of existing hopper systems to provide a substantially homogenous mixed drilling fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">While the present disclosure has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as described herein.
