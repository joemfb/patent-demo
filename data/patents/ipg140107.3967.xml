<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the technical field of displaying, and more particularly, to a pair of 3D glasses and a 3D video playing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the continuous advancement and development of the science and technology, 3D videos are attracting more and more attentions. The 3D videos are greatly favored by many consumers as they can provide a real-world feeling and a visual impact when being played. Currently, the most common device for achieving the 3D effect in the market is a kind of light gate glasses, whose two glasses are installed with a light gate respectively. The two light gates are opened and closed alternately in such a way that when one of the two light gates is opened, the other is closed. Thus, one image can be seen by only one eye. Because the image can keep a visual persistence of about 0.15 s in human eyes, the image in the eye will not disappear so long as a time interval during which the same glass is closed is less than 0.15 s. In this way, although the image is not seen by this eye, the image still persists in the brain, so a 3D image can be composed in the brain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a schematic structural view of an embodiment of a 3D video playing apparatus in the prior art. In the prior art, a first polarizer <b>3</b> is often disposed on a display <b>1</b>; and a pair of 3D glasses for use with the display <b>1</b> comprises a second polarizer <b>4</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>2</b> and a third polarizer <b>5</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>2</b> is located between the second polarizer <b>4</b> and the third polarizer <b>5</b>; a transmittance axis of the first polarizer <b>3</b> is parallel with a transmittance axis of the second polarizer <b>4</b>; and a transmittance axis of the third polarizer <b>5</b> is perpendicular to the transmittance axis of the second polarizer <b>4</b>. Through control of twisting of liquid crystals in the liquid crystal layer <b>2</b>, functions of a light gate can be achieved. A user can observe a 3D image at a side of the pair of 3D glasses away from the display <b>1</b>. However, as the pair of 3D glasses is worn on the head of the user, the luminance of the image will decrease when the transmittance axis of the second polarizer <b>4</b> becomes unparallel with the transmittance axis of the first polarizer <b>3</b> disposed on the display <b>1</b>; and when the transmittance axis of the second polarizer <b>4</b> becomes perpendicular to the transmittance axis of the first polarizer <b>3</b> disposed on the display, the light exiting from the display <b>1</b> will be completely absorbed by the second polarizer <b>4</b> and, as a result, no image can be seen by the user.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">This embodiment differs from the first embodiment of the 3D display device <b>10</b> in that: the 3D display device <b>10</b> of this embodiment further comprises a first half-wave phase plate <b>14</b>, which is disposed between the first polarizer <b>12</b> and the first quarter-wave phase plate <b>13</b>. The half-wave phase plate <b>14</b> matches with the light exiting surface of the LCD <b>11</b> in terms of both size and shape. When a polarizing axis of the first half-wave phase plate <b>14</b> and the transmittance axis of the first polarizer <b>12</b> include an angle of &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>there between, the polarizing axis of the first quarter-wave phase plate <b>13</b> and the transmittance axis of the first polarizer <b>12</b> include an angle of 2&#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>+45&#xb0; there between. In this embodiment, a retardation value of the light is in inverse proportion to the wavelength thereof, so a retardation value corresponding to a short wavelength is larger than a retardation value corresponding to a long wavelength; therefore, when the wavelength is in the magnitude of nm, the incident linearly polarized light will become the circularly polarized light after passing through the first quarter-wave phase plate <b>13</b>. The retardation values corresponding to the wavelengths of 450 nm and 650 nm are different from the retardation value corresponding to the wavelength of 550 nm, and are generally called color shift retardation. Therefore, the linearly polarized light will not become a roundly polarized light after passing through the first quarter-wave phase plate <b>13</b>, so a first half-wave phase plate <b>14</b> is additionally provided to solve the problem of dispersion which caused by the first quarter-wave phase plate <b>13</b>. A second half-wave phase plate <b>24</b> described below has the same working principle and function as the first half-wave phase plate <b>14</b>.</p>
