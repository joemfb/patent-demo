<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A refrigerated server rack that may be used in a server room to cool computing equipment. The refrigerated server rack may contain a cooling unit or include a cooling inlet to receive chilled air to cool the computing equipment within the server rack. The self contained server rack has a modular design such that it may be easily integrated into mounting point within a data center. As the requirements of the data center change, server racks may be added or removed to provide scalability. As the racks are added or removed, a monitoring application discovers the server racks and equipment contained therein. The server rack and equipment may then be configured to operate within the data center computing infrastructure. Because only the interior of the self-contained server rack is cooled to maintain a proper operating environment for the computing equipment, there is no need to cool entirety of the data center.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The rise in demand for IT business support and the resulting increase in density of IT equipment are stretching data center power and cooling resources to the breaking point. Recently, energy costs and the inability of data center infrastructures to accommodate new high-density computing platforms have become problems for data centers. Higher rack densities have caused power and cooling costs to surpass the costs of the IT equipment and the facility space.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The increase in server density is being driven by the need to maximize the use of data center floor space and to extend the life of data centers. As a result, rack power density (kW/rack) has grown more than five times over the past ten years. The growth in rack power density and the associated heat load are outpacing conventional thermal management techniques, which are typically designed for previous generations of IT equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To lower total cost of ownership (TCO), data centers are struggling to adopt a paradigm that focuses on maximizing the energy efficiency of components, systems, and the infrastructure while controlling energy usage. Because the demand for IT business support will continue to increase, an organization's best strategy to manage growth is to improve power and cooling infrastructure efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure describes a self-contained server rack that may be used in a server room to cool computing equipment. As will be described, the rack may contain a cooling unit or a cooling inlet to produce or receive chilled air to cool computing equipment within the server rack. The self-contained server rack may have a modular design such that it may be easily incorporated into a data center and to provide scalability. Because only the interior of the self-contained server rack needs to be cooled to prevent the computing equipment from overheating, this eliminates the need to cool entirety of the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a front perspective view of an example server rack <b>100</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a front view of the server rack <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the server rack <b>100</b> is formed generally as a self-contained rectangular enclosure having upper and lower walls, sidewalls, and a rear wall. One or more computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may be mounted on racks <b>105</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>109</b> and <b>111</b>, respectively, within the server rack <b>100</b>. The computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may be, e.g., blade servers, network equipment, power equipment, communications equipment, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An integral cooling unit <b>102</b> may provide chilled air <b>116</b> or other fluid that may be circulated within the server rack <b>100</b> to cool the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> contained therein. The chilled air <b>116</b> may be cooled by cooling unit <b>102</b> to a temperature that maintains the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> at a safe internal operating temperature. In some implementations, the cooling unit <b>102</b> may contain an optimally sized air conditioner for the anticipated heat load contained within the server rack <b>100</b>. For example, the anticipated heat load may be calculated based on the power consumption of devices mounted within the server rack <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As the chilled air <b>116</b> removes heat from the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, the chilled air <b>116</b> warms due to the heat transfer and rises to the top of the server rack <b>100</b>. The warmed air may be removed from the server rack <b>100</b> as exhaust <b>120</b> through an outlet <b>118</b>. The outlet <b>118</b> may be connected to a manifold provided within a data center for venting the warmed air.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Electrical and network connections to the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may be made through a connector block <b>104</b>. For example, connections such as power, Ethernet, fiber optic connections, coaxial, etc. may be made to the connector block <b>104</b> using cables <b>114</b>. In some implementations, the connector block <b>104</b> may be a modular system, such that individual connections may be tailored to the connection requirements of the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the connector block <b>104</b> may include a standardized set of connectors to accommodate certain types of computing devices. For example, the connector block <b>104</b> may include a row of RJ45 sockets and a row of AC sockets to accommodate servers as the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A door <b>113</b> may be provided to close the server rack <b>100</b>. The door <b>113</b> may provide a seal along the front of the server rack <b>100</b> to create a closed system whereby the removal of heat generated by the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> is accomplished through the circulation of the chilled air <b>116</b> to the exhaust <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An indicator panel <b>103</b> may be provided on the door <b>113</b> or other location to provide an indication of the operational status of the server rack <b>100</b>, the cooling unit <b>102</b>, and/or the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. For example, the indicator panel <b>103</b> may indicate that the door <b>113</b> is ajar, that the cooling unit <b>102</b> has malfunctioned, that one of the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or <b>112</b> has crashed, or that everything is operating within normal parameters, etc. such that IT support technician may easily identify problems with or in the server rack <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate four computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>, any number of computing devices may be installed within the server rack <b>100</b> as space permits. Further, the cables <b>114</b> may be provided to make any type of connection to the connector block <b>104</b> as required by the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Thus, the cables <b>114</b> may be an Ethernet cable, power cord, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a rear perspective view of the server rack <b>100</b>. The connector block <b>104</b> extends through the rear wall of the server rack <b>100</b> to enable external connections to be made to the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. Thus, the connector block <b>104</b> may serve as the external interface to the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> where all connections are made. As will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the connector block <b>104</b> is adapted to mate with a respective connector block within a floor module or mounting point in the data center to provide connections between a computing infrastructure and the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a rear perspective view of another example server rack <b>150</b>. The server rack <b>150</b> provides an inlet to receive a cooling duct <b>152</b> rather than having an integral cooling unit. The cooling duct <b>152</b> may provide chilled air from a cooling unit within the data center or from a cooling unit <b>102</b> on an adjacent or nearby server rack <b>100</b>. Similar to the server rack <b>100</b>, the connector block <b>104</b> extends through the rear wall of the self-contained server rack <b>150</b> to enable connections to be made to the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates the server rack <b>150</b> having the outlet <b>118</b> at floor level. The outlet <b>118</b> may be connected to a manifold provided within a mounting point or floor module for venting the warmed air as exhaust <b>120</b>. In some implementations, the server rack <b>100</b> may include the floor level outlet <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a front perspective view of an example floor mounting point <b>126</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the example server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> coupled to the floor mounting point <b>126</b>. The floor mounting point <b>126</b> may include one or more connector blocks <b>128</b> and <b>130</b>. The connector blocks <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> are designed to be a mirror image of the connector block <b>104</b> provided on the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> and is adapted to mate with the connector block <b>104</b> to provide power, network, etc. connections between the computing equipment <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> and the computing infrastructure within the data center.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In implementations where the outlet <b>118</b> is provided at floor level, an exhaust inlet <b>132</b> may be provided within the floor mounting point <b>126</b> to receive the outlet <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> may be slid into place to mate with the floor mounting point <b>126</b>. Multiple floor mounting points <b>126</b> may be provided in the data center to accept multiple self-contained server racks <b>100</b>/<b>150</b>. As the data center's needs and requirements grow, additional self-contained server racks <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> and floor mounting points <b>126</b> may be installed within the data center to accommodate the needs of the data center. If the data center's needs are reduced, the server racks <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> and floor mounting points <b>126</b> may be removed. Thus, in accordance with the implementations described above, the cooling needs of computing equipment within the data center may be satisfied by cooling the space only within the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b>, eliminating the need to cool the entire data center. In addition, the cooling requirements can be scaled proportionally to the amount of computing equipment needed to meet the data center's computing requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an example operational flow of a process <b>200</b> to monitor the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> and components therein. In some implementations, the process <b>200</b> may be executed by a general purpose computer running a monitoring application within the data center. The process <b>200</b> may be part of an administrative application suite running on the general purpose computer to monitor the health and status of the self-contained server racks within the data center, as well as the computing equipment and devices contained within a self-contained server racks.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At <b>202</b>, self-contained server rack is coupled to the mounting point. For example as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> may be positioned in place such that the connector block <b>104</b> mates with the connector block <b>128</b>. At <b>204</b>, equipment is discovered by the network. For example, the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> and the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> may be discovered by the data center and/or the computing infrastructure using network protocols such as SLP (service location protocol), Jini, UPnP (Universal plug and play), salutation, SDP (service discovery protocol), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At <b>206</b>, self-contained server rack and/or computing devices are configured. For example, the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or <b>112</b> may be authenticated and assigned an IP address from a DHCP server, and configured such that they are able to communicate with the computing infrastructure to which the data center is connected. Optionally or additionally, the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> may be configured such that it may be monitored by the monitoring application to determine the health and status of the self-contained server rack and the components therein. At <b>208</b>, the self-contained server rack and/or computing devices are operational within a computing infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At <b>210</b>, the equipment and self-contained server rack are monitored. At <b>212</b>, it is determined if a change occurred in the status of the server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b>, the computing devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or <b>112</b>, or the cooling unit <b>102</b>. If no change has occurred then the process returns to <b>210</b> to continue monitoring. However, if a change is that is has occurred at <b>212</b>, then at <b>214</b>, networking and/or an administrative application may be notified of the change. If at <b>216</b>, it is determined that a new server rack <b>100</b>/<b>150</b> or new computing devices have caused the change, then the process returns to <b>206</b> where the new equipment is configured. If at <b>216</b>, if the change in status was the result of some other cause, an alarm may be trigger to notify IT personnel of the change in status. The process returns to <b>210</b> to continue monitoring the equipment and server rack.</p>
