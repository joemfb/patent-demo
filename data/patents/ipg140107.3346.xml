<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/282,952, filed Apr. 28, 2010.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to devices for generating electricity in a motor vehicle, and shock absorber electrical generator for converting motion of the motor vehicle into electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rising fossil fuel costs, increased environmental concerns, environmental regulations, and the like are driving the need for a variety of novel energy conserving and generating technologies. For example, new, highly efficient electric, hybrid, and fuel-efficient gas vehicles having improved electric batteries are coming to market.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Shock impact forces from road surface irregularities, vibration forces from unbalanced vehicle wheels, sudden accelerating, and vehicle braking forces are normally absorbed and damped by the shock absorbers of these vehicles. Vehicle size, body weight and desired level of riding comfort are factors that affect the selection of shock absorber type and design. A shock absorber dampens the oscillations of vehicle suspension spring components, the spring components producing mechanical work as they absorb road shocks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In many cars, the shock absorber is combined with a spring in a unit known as the frame strut. The shock absorber restricts displacement and oscillation frequency of the spring thereby assisting in keeping the vehicle body (and its occupants) from bouncing dramatically. Shock absorber design and capacity are tailored to the load, type of vehicle, road conditions, and type of driving. Some shock absorbers are comprised of an incompressible liquid working fluid to dampen the shocks, whilst other shock absorbers (gas shock absorbers) are comprised of a compressible gaseous working fluid to dampen the shocks. Gas shock absorbers are preferable in the aforementioned modern vehicles because of their ease of use in such vehicles that also have active suspension control features. To further obviate the impact of rising fuel costs, and the like, it would be desirable to capture a portion of the work done by these gas shock absorbers as they smooth out the ride of the aforementioned new highly efficient vehicles which are coming to market.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, a shock absorber electrical generator solving the aforementioned problems is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The shock absorber electrical generator includes a piston disposed for reciprocating motion within a cylinder as a vehicle's suspension system deflects. A substantially gaseous working fluid is contained within the cylinder. During the compression stroke of the piston, the working fluid is forced through a working fluid circuit through at least one chamber in the cylinder opposite the piston. This working fluid is in fluid communication with a fan turbine motor disposed in the chamber and in fluid communication with the piston chamber, the chamber capturing the working fluid on the return stroke. Upon compression due to the piston, the working fluid passes through the fan turbine motor, thereby turning a shaft connected to a DC generator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electric energy generated by the generator may be used by the vehicle as it is generated, or stored in, for example, the vehicle's battery. Preferably, the harvested electricity is used to power components on a vehicle that would otherwise strain the internal combustion engine, thereby increasing fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the shock absorber electrical generator <b>105</b> includes a substantially cylindrical, hollow shock absorber body <b>106</b>. A first end of the shock absorber body <b>106</b> extends into a hollow cap unit having a bottom portion <b>124</b>, a cylindrically elongate middle portion <b>125</b> and a suspension attachment mount <b>126</b> adapted for attachment to suspension and/or wheel components of a vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the bottom of the cap unit has a plurality of tube ring seals <b>1100</b><i>a </i>and a singular central tube ring seal <b>1100</b><i>b </i>to prevent the nitrogen filled shock absorber body <b>106</b> from leaking nitrogen back into the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A nitrogen fill valve <b>128</b> extends at a substantially perpendicular angle from the attachment mount <b>126</b>. A second end of shock absorber body <b>106</b> is adapted for receiving a piston assembly. The piston assembly is comprised of an elongate rod <b>113</b> having a first end extending into a piston <b>115</b> and a second end extending into a piston-suspension attachment mount <b>109</b> having an eyelet and bushing <b>107</b> adapted for attachment to a vehicle's suspension/wheel components.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Travel limiter <b>111</b> limits the displacement of the piston assembly as it slides up and down inside the shock absorber body <b>106</b>. A central tube <b>502</b> forms a piston chamber <b>129</b> that extends downward from the first end of hollow body <b>106</b> towards the second end of hollow body <b>106</b>. Auxiliary piston <b>500</b> is coaxially attached to the rod <b>113</b> and displaces working gas, preferably a nitrogen-CO2 mix, within a lower portion of the interior of the shock absorber body <b>106</b>. The working medium within shock absorber <b>105</b> may also include a small amount of liquid oil which flows through the system to cool, lubricate, and dampen noise of internal moving parts of the assembly. The piston assembly including the piston <b>115</b> and a portion of rod <b>113</b> is slidably disposed within the central tube <b>502</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The body <b>106</b>, including the piston assembly is hermetically sealed thereby allowing the internal portion of the body <b>106</b> to accept and retain a high pressure gaseous working medium introduced into the body <b>106</b> via nitrogen fill valve <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Extending longitudinally alongside the central tube <b>502</b> are undulating, power transfer tubes <b>132</b>, which form power transfer chambers <b>131</b>. A plurality of one-way valves <b>122</b> is disposed in the transfer chambers <b>131</b> within the power transfer tubes <b>132</b>. The configuration of the transfer chambers <b>131</b> in relation to the central tube <b>502</b> is most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The one-way valves <b>122</b> are spherical, and each has a seal ring <b>610</b> (most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that separates hemispherical portions of the valve <b>122</b> and seats against opposing lateral edges formed in the power transfer tubes <b>132</b> to prevent backflow of the gaseous working medium through the transfer chambers <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A spring <b>121</b> attaching the one-way valve <b>122</b> to the inside of power transfer tube <b>132</b> biases the valve <b>122</b> to a closed position inside of the power transfer chamber <b>131</b> until a blast of high pressure gas is forced through the chamber <b>131</b> by dual-stroke action of the auxiliary piston <b>500</b>. Turbine fans <b>205</b> are attached to the power transfer tubes <b>132</b> via axles <b>207</b>, thereby allowing the turbine fans <b>205</b> to freely spin when working gas impinges upon the fan blades. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the fan axles <b>207</b> are seated in axle-support bearing holes <b>218</b>. A Direct Current (DC) generator motor <b>120</b> is coaxially attached to each turbine fan <b>205</b>. During the compression stroke of the piston assembly, the auxiliary piston <b>500</b> forces compressed working gas into inlets of the chambers <b>131</b> formed by power transfer tubes <b>132</b>. During the expansion stroke of the piston assembly, the auxiliary piston <b>500</b> sucks working gas out of opposing side outlets of the chambers <b>131</b>. Thus, the inlets and outlets form a circuit adapted for one-way flow of nitrogen therethrough. Due to the arrangement of the one-way valves <b>122</b> inside of the chambers <b>131</b>, both the compression stroke and the expansion stroke result in relative synchronous spinning of the fan assemblies <b>205</b>, which causes the DC generators <b>120</b> to generate DC current, which can be routed out of the shock absorber <b>105</b> to electrical components of a vehicle using the shock absorber <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B, the fans <b>205</b> may either be designed to have a spherical shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or a toroidal shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Alternative housings are provided in the power transfer tubes <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a motor-retaining assembly portion <b>700</b> of the power transfer tube <b>132</b> includes two longitudinally opposed sidewalls <b>707</b>, which form snap ring groove <b>705</b>, the snap ring groove <b>705</b> permitting the motor assembly to be snap fitted into the motor retaining assembly <b>700</b>. A permanent magnet <b>710</b> is disposed in the floor of the motor-retaining assembly <b>700</b> and functions as a stator for the motor-electrical generator <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the motor <b>120</b> has positive and negative voltage connectors <b>712</b><i>a </i>and <b>712</b><i>b</i>, respectively. A plurality of air vents <b>714</b> is disposed concentrically around an inner peripheral circumference of coaxially disposed motor <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the rotor portion of the motor <b>120</b> fits along the length of motor-retaining stator portion <b>700</b>, and is allowed to rotate securely via attachment of the axle <b>207</b> to a washer bearing <b>900</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the rotor has a plurality of preferably spiral grooves <b>1000</b> disposed around it in which enamel-coated copper wiring is coiled to form the wire loop responsible for electric generation when the rotor causes the wire loop to repetitively break the magnetic field formed by the stator magnet <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> presents a diagrammatic view of operations of the shock absorber electrical generator <b>105</b>. The electric energy generated by the generator may be used by the vehicle as it is generated, or stored in, for example, the vehicle's battery. Preferably, the harvested electricity is used to power components on a vehicle that would otherwise strain the internal combustion engine, thereby increasing fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> illustrate operations of a system of shock absorber electrical generators <b>105</b> as they would be deployed in a typical motor vehicle. As most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an air compressor manual foot pump primer <b>15</b> is disposed in the vehicle interior IN to the left of a vehicle's footbrake FB. As most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the pedal <b>15</b> engages the spring loaded primer pump <b>12</b><i>a</i>, which forces fresh air into the air compressor tank <b>13</b> via air tube <b>12</b><i>b</i>. The foot pump primer <b>12</b><i>a </i>starts the car's generator system if the battery or batteries are low or stolen.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The air compressor tank <b>13</b> has a pressure valve <b>17</b>, which then allows compressed air into the circuit to thereby turn the generators <b>120</b>. The multi-generator systems (one shock absorber <b>105</b> per vehicle wheel), fan, and housing units are deployed in a plurality of shock absorber electrical generators <b>105</b>, which are attached to the vehicle wheel system. The air filter compressor intake <b>16</b> allows air to pass through the associated intake valves IV. The system works in a coordinated manner to provide electricity for the vehicle and to keep the vehicle's battery charged. Oil flows through the component parts of the shock absorber generator <b>105</b> and aids in cooling the unit <b>105</b>.</p>
