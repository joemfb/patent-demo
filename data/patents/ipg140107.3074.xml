<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One embodiment of the printed wiring board of the present invention will be described hereinafter. In the printed wiring board, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, at least one opening is provided in a solder resist layer (SR layer) formed in the outermost layer of a wiring substrate, a part of a conductor circuit exposed from the at least one opening is formed as conductor pads for mounting electronic parts, the conductor pads are arranged with a pitch of about 200 &#x3bc;m or less, and solder bumps are formed on the respective conductor pads in the form of filled viaholes each completely filled in the opening, and further the ratio (W/D) of a solder bump diameter W to a diameter D of the opening provided in the solder resist layer is about 1.05 to about 1.7.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment of the present invention, for forming the respective solder bumps in the corresponding openings provided in the solder resist layer, it is desirable to use a novel method and a device for dropping solder balls having very fine particle diameter on the connecting pads through the corresponding openings of a ball aligning mask as described below, without employing a printing method with the use of a conventional mask.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">First, a novel solder ball mounting method and a device thereof are used for manufacturing. As to the printed wiring board of the present invention, the construction of one embodiment is explained by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a sectional view of a printed wiring board <b>10</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a state in which an IC chip <b>90</b> is mounted on the printed wiring board <b>10</b> and the printed wiring board <b>10</b> is mounted on a daughter board <b>94</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the printed wiring board <b>10</b> has a conductor circuit <b>34</b> formed on both surfaces of a core substrate <b>30</b>, and the respective conductor circuits are electrically connected through a plated through hole <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, on the conductor circuit <b>34</b> of the core substrate <b>30</b> is formed a conductor circuit <b>58</b> forming a conductor circuit layer through an interlaminar insulative resin layer <b>50</b>. The conductor circuit <b>58</b> is connected to the conductor circuit <b>34</b> through via hole <b>60</b>. On the conductor circuit <b>58</b> is formed a conductor circuit <b>158</b> through an interlaminar insulative resin layer <b>150</b>. The conductor circuit <b>158</b> is connected to the conductor circuit <b>58</b> through a via hole <b>160</b> formed in an interlaminar insulative resin layer <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A solder resist layer <b>70</b> is formed by covering the conductor circuit <b>158</b> and the via hole <b>160</b>, and a connecting pad <b>75</b> is formed by forming a nickel plated layer <b>72</b> and a gold plated layer <b>74</b> on an opening <b>71</b> provided in the solder resist layer <b>71</b>. On the connecting pad <b>75</b> of the top face is formed a solder bump <b>78</b>U and on the connecting pad <b>75</b> of the bottom face is formed a BGA (ball grid array) <b>78</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the solder bump <b>78</b>U on the upper side of the printed wiring board <b>10</b> is connected to an electrode <b>92</b> of the IC chip <b>90</b> to form an IC mounted printed wiring board, and the IC mounted printed wiring board is connected to a land <b>96</b> of a daughter board <b>94</b> through the BGA <b>78</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment of the invention, it is desirable that the conductor pad is provided with a pitch of about 200 &#x3bc;m or less, and the ratio (W/D) of a solder bump diameter W to an opening diameter D of the opening provided in the solder resist layer is made within a range of about 1.05 to about 1.7, preferably about 1.05 to about 1.5, thereby making a gap difficult to be formed between the solder bump and the opening side wall of the solder resist layer, so as to make flux residue and clearing solution residue difficult to remain between the solder bump and the solder resist layer. As a result, it becomes possible to prevent lowering of insulation resistance and peeling of the under fill caused by residue, thereby insulation reliability and connection reliability are easily improved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, in the embodiment of the invention, it is desirable to flatten the solder resist layer surface to secure flatness to some extent. Such flattened surface can increase the volume of the solder resist layer to which large stress is applied, and decrease the bending portion on which stress tends to concentrate. As a result, heat cycle resistance can easily be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is desirable that the surface of the solder resist layer corresponding to at least electronic parts mounting region is flattened. The solder resist layer and the solder bump are different in thermal expansion coefficient, so that there are produced repeatedly contraction and expansion at the boundary vicinity between the solder bump and the solder resist layer. And, when large unevenness is existent on the solder resist layer surface, i.e. small flatness, the volume of the solder resist layer in the bump vicinity is small to be easily broken. Therefore, by making flatness of the solder resist layer surface small to some extent, the volume of the solder resist layer where large stress is applied to is increased, bending portion where stress tends to concentrate is lessened, and heat cycle resistance can easily be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To the solder resist layer surface is desirably applied flattening treatment in, for instance, at least electronic parts mounting region. As thermal expansion coefficient of the solder resist layer and the solder bump are different, contraction and expansion are repeated in the vicinity of the solder bump and the solder resist layer by thermal change. When large unevenness is existent on the solder resist layer surface, that is, small flatness, the volume of the solder resist layer in the vicinity of the solder bump is less, breakdown tends to occur. Therefore, the volume of largely stressed portion of the solder resist layer is increased by lessening flatness of the solder resist layer surface to some extent and the stress-concentrating bent portion is lessened, so as to improve heat cycle resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The flattened surface of the solder resist layer is desirably about 0.8 to about 3.0 &#x3bc;m in maximum surface roughness. The reason is that when the maximum surface roughness is within a range of about 0.8 to about 3.0 &#x3bc;m, crack is hardly generated in the solder resist in the vicinity of the conductor pad, and air (void) is hard to enter into the under fill resin. As a result, insulation reliability and connection reliability are easily improved.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, in the embodiment of the present invention, it is desirable to further apply a roughening treatment to the flattened surface of the solder resist layer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Wettability of the under fill resin is easily improved by applying the roughening treatment to the surface of the solder resist layer flattened to some extent, so that under fill resin can be filled in a narrow gap portion in the boundary vicinity between the solder resist layer and the solder bump so as to improve connection reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is desirable that the roughened surface of the solder resist layer is smaller than the maximum surface roughness of the flattened surface and about 0.2 to about 0.5 &#x3bc;m at an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The reason is that when the arithmetic mean roughness Ra is made within a range of about 0.2 to about 0.5 &#x3bc;m, adhesion to the under fill resin can be increased, and flux residue and cleaning residue are hardly remained on the solder resist surface. As a result, insulation reliability and connection reliability are easily improved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, in the embodiment of the invention, an opening side wall of the solder resist layer is tapered, thereby hardly concentrating stress because a form of the solder bump is not extremely changed at the opening periphery. As a result, connection reliability is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An opening provided in the solder resist layer may be, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10B</figref> for instance, rectangular or trapezoidal in section. Particularly, in case of the trapezoidal section, the solder bump portion filled in the opening and that exposed to the outside are smoothly continued, and the bent portion of the solder bump becomes small in the boundary with the solder resist layer, that is, the form of the solder bump is not extremely changed at the boundary portion with the solder resist layer so as not to concentrate stress. As a result, the solder bump is hard to be broken and connection reliability is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, when an opening diameter at the top face is made D<b>1</b> and that at the bottom face is made D<b>2</b>, it is desirable that the shape of the opening may be a trapezoid in section wherein the difference between the opening diameters D<b>1</b>-D<b>2</b> is about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 20 &#x3bc;m. When the difference D<b>1</b>-D<b>2</b> is within such range, stress by thermal expansion coefficient difference between IC chip and print wiring board is hardly concentrated, so that connection reliability tends to be improved, and insulation performance between adjacent solder bumps can be secured. Further, migration is scarcely generated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, as understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, two connecting pads positioned at center among connecting pads <b>75</b> provided on the top face are formed into the form of a land just above a via hole <b>160</b>, and two connecting pads adjacent thereto are formed into the form of a pad adjacent to the land of the via hole <b>160</b>, further, two connecting pads positioned at both ends are formed into the form of a pad consisting of a part of a wiring pattern of the conductor circuit <b>158</b>, and solder bumps are formed on these connecting pads.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In like manner, two connecting pads among connecting pads <b>75</b> on the bottom face are formed into a land just above the via hole <b>160</b>, and four connecting pads positioned at center are formed into a pad adjacent to the via hole <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The viahole <b>160</b> as a connecting pad formed by the solder bump <b>78</b>U is preferably a filled-via, and the uneven amount of the filled-via surface exposed from the surface of the interlaminar insulative resin layer <b>150</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11B</figref>, desirably within a range of about &#x2212;5 &#x3bc;m to about +5 &#x3bc;m in relation to the surface thickness of the conductor circuit <b>158</b>. The reason why the depressed or protruded amount of the filled-via surface is restricted to a mentioned above is due to the fact that when the depressed amount is about 5 &#x3bc;m (&#x2212;5 &#x3bc;m) or less, the number of contact point defined by the solder ball and the connecting pad consisting of the filled-via is secured, and wettability in case of forming the solder bump is easily improved, and entanglement of voids within the bump and missing bump can be controlled, while when the protruded amount of the filled-via surface is about 5 &#x3bc;m (+5 &#x3bc;m) or less, the thickness of the conductor circuit <b>158</b> is controlled not to become large but easily adaptable for micro-patterning.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the &#x201c;electronic parts mounting region&#x201d; in the embodiment of the invention substantially corresponds to a region (hereinafter, simply called as &#x201c;connecting pad region&#x201d;) where conductor pads such as filled-via and the like for mounting electronic parts are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> shows a state of aligning all of the outermost peripheral connecting pads along each side of a rectangle among grid-like aligned connecting pads, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> shows a state of not aligning a part of the outermost peripheral connecting pads along each side of the rectangle, however, in either case, when the connecting pad region is made rectangle, a rectangle region determined to minimize an area of the region enclosing all connecting pads is called as &#x201c;connecting pad region&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> are views explaining the steps for forming the solder bumps on the printed wiring board <b>10</b> according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">First, a flux layer <b>80</b> is formed for covering conductor pads formed in the openings <b>71</b> provided in the solder resist layer <b>70</b> on the top face side of the printed wiring board, i.e. the connecting pads <b>75</b> by a printing method (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Next, on the connecting pads <b>75</b> on the top face side of the printed wiring board are mounted very small solder balls <b>78</b><i>s </i>(for example, made by Hitachi Metals or Tamura) with the use of a solder ball loader described later on (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Such solder ball is desirable about 40 &#x3bc;m or more and less than about 200 &#x3bc;m in diameter. When the diameter is made within such range, each solder ball easily drops on the corresponding connecting pad because it is not too light in weight, and the solder balls are easily assembled in a cylinder member, thereby to control the presence of connecting pads with no solder balls mounted thereon. In order to match for the fine patterning, the solder ball having a diameter of about 80 &#x3bc;m or less is desirable. Thereafter, solder balls <b>78</b>L of a usual diameter (250 &#x3bc;m) are adsorbed and placed on the connecting pads <b>75</b> on the bottom face side of the printed wiring board with the use of an adsorption head as described in Japanese Patent No. 1975429, for instance (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0163">From such test results, Examples 1 to 48 and Reference Example 1 completely filling the solder bump in the opening of the solder resist are liable to improve connection reliability as compared with Comparative Example. This is because volume of the solder bump is large and stress owing to thermal expansion difference between IC chips and printed wiring boards is more mitigated, or because of no gap between solder resists and solder bumps, voids are difficult to generate within under fill, or no residuum of flux and clearing solution.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0164">Further, connection reliability is liable to improve in order of (1) when the ratio (W/D) of a solder bump diameter W to a solder resist opening diameter D is within a range of about 1.05 to 1.7, (2) when the solder resist opening is a tapered form wherein the top opening diameter is larger than the bottom opening diameter, and the ratio (W/D) is within a range of about 1.05 to 1.5, and (3) when the solder resist opening is a tapered form wherein the top opening diameter is larger than the bottom opening diameter, and the ratio (W/D) is within a range of about 1.05 to 1.25.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0165">It is considered that if the ratio (W/D) exceeds about 1, the solder bump tends to bend at the boundary with the solder resist layer surface (the portion of solder bump exposed from the surface of solder resist layer to the outside, which is circled with a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>), and stress tends to concentrate in this bent portion, so that connection reliability is improved when a bending degree is made small. The bending degree is correlated to the ratio (W/D), and it is assumed that connection reliability is easily improved when the ratio (W/D) is about 1.7 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0166">In the solder bump completely filled in the solder resist layer opening as described above, solder volume is large, so that significance of applying to the printed wiring board having a large connecting pad region such as about 2000 to 30000 solder bumps is large. When the connecting pad region (rectangular region including outermost connecting pad) is large, shearing stress due to thermal expansion coefficient difference between IC chips and printed wiring boards becomes large.</p>
<heading id="h-0071" level="1">EXAMPLES 49 TO 66</heading>
<p id="p-0160" num="0167">Next, in the Examples 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45 and 46, except that flattening treatment for minimizing unevenness of the solder resist layer surface due to presence of the connecting pad by heat pressing the solder resist layer surface under the following condition after forming the solder resist layer, the IC mounting printed wiring board is manufactured in the same manner as in each example, and described as Examples 49 to 66.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0171">Here, before and after the flattening treatment, an uneven amount of the solder resist surface is measured at the same spot by means of a surface roughness measuring instrument (e.g. &#x201c;SURFCOM 480A&#x201d; made by Tokyo Seimitsu or &#x201c;WYKO N-2500&#x201d; by Veeco).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0172">The measured spots (measured numbers are 5) are the solder resist layer surface positioned at the upper part of the connecting pad and the solder resist layer surface of the adjacent connecting pad non-forming portion (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). That is, the uneven amount of the solder resist layer surface due to presence of the connecting pad is measured, and the maximum value (max) and the minimum value (min) of the 5-point measured results are described. These measurement results are shown in Table 3 (before flattening treatment) and Table 4 (after flattening treatment).</p>
<heading id="h-0073" level="1">EXAMPLES 67 TO 84</heading>
<p id="p-0164" num="0173">Further, except that roughening treatment is applied to the solder resist layer surface under the following condition and uniformly fine unevenness is formed on the surface after flattening in Examples 49 to 66, the IC mounting printed wiring board is manufactured in the same manner as in each example, and described here as Examples 67 to 84.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0178">Further, after the roughening treatment, surface roughness of the solder resist surface is measured at 10 spots at random with reference length 5 &#x3bc;m by means of a surface roughness measuring instrument (e.g. &#x201c;SURFCOM 480A&#x201d; made by Tokyo Seimitsu or &#x201c;WYKO N-2500&#x201d; by Veeco). As a result, surface roughness of the roughening treated solder resist layer becomes a small uneven face of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 0.6 &#x3bc;m at Ra.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0179">Now, &#x201c;surface roughness Ra&#x201d; mentioned here means &#x201c;arithmetic mean roughness Ra&#x201d; prescribed by JIS B0601. The reason why Ra has a range in the above measured result is because that among respective Ra at the measured 10 spots, there are described the most minimum Ra as Ra (min) and the most maximum Ra as Ra(max).</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0180">Further, at each measurement point of 10 spots, when a distance between the highest top and the lowest bottom measured from the mean line to the uneven direction based on 5 &#x3bc;m of reference length is made &#x394;, a mean value of 10&#x394; is described as Rmax.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0181">However, surface roughening measurement is carried out at random 10 spots in the solder resist layer surface corresponding to the conductor circuit (pad) forming region and the conductor circuit non-forming region, but not in the boundary vicinity of the conductor circuit forming region and the conductor circuit non-forming region.</p>
<p id="h-0075" num="0000">(Heat Cycle Test)</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0182">A heat cycle test is carried out for the IC mounting printed wiring board manufactured according to Examples 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 21, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45 and 46, Examples 49 to 66, and Examples 67 to 84 by repeating 2500 times of 1 cycle of &#x2212;55&#xb0; C.&#xd7;30 min and 125&#xb0; C.&#xd7;30 min after leaving in an atmosphere such as temperature of 85&#xb0; C. and humidity of 85% for 24 hours. Electric resistances after 1750 cycles and 2000 cycles are measured, and the rate (100&#xd7;(measured value&#x2212;initial value)/initial value) (%) of change with the initial value is sought. The case of the rate of change within &#xb1;10 is evaluated as &#x201c;good&#x201d; and shown by O, and other cases are evaluated as &#x201c;no good&#x201d; and shown by x.</p>

<p id="p-0175" num="0187">It is understood from the results of this evaluation test that connection reliability is easily improved when the uneven amount of the solder resist layer surface is preferably about 0.8 &#x3bc;m to 3.0 &#x3bc;m and further, the arithmetic mean roughness Ra thereof is about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 0.5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0188">The solder bump in the invention is large in bump diameter so as to increase bump height for its degree. Therefore, as the space between the solder resist layer surface and the IC chip becomes large, under fill is difficult to be filled and void tends to generate in the under fill. Here, as the moving speed of the under fill is liable to depend on the space between the solder resist layer surface and the IC chip, it is considered that unevenness of the solder resist layer surface is about 2 &#x3bc;m or less. On the other hand, if uneven amount and surface roughness (Ra) of the solder resist layer surface are small, adhesion of the solder resist to the under fill becomes weakened, so that it is assumed that the uneven amount of about 0.8 &#x3bc;m or more and further the surface roughness of about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 0.5 &#x3bc;m are required. Further, the surface roughness of about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 0.5 &#x3bc;m improves wettability of the under fill, so that it is considered that even in the bent solder bump is completely filled the under fill.</p>
<p id="h-0076" num="0000">(Insulation Reliability Test)</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0189">The IC mounting printed wiring board manufactured according to Examples 1 to 84 and Comparative Example are left in an atmosphere of 85&#xb0; C. in temperature and 85% in humidity for 100 hours by applying voltage of 3.3V between dependent solder bumps (electrically not connected solder bumps). After leaving as they are, insulation resistance between voltage-applied solder bumps is measured. The value of more than or equal to 10<sup>7</sup>&#x3a9; is evaluated as good and the value of less than 10<sup>7</sup>&#x3a9; is evaluated as no good. As a result, Examples 1 to 8 are recognized as good, while Comparative Example is as no good.</p>
