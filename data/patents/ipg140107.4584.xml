<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present principles relate generally to video encoding and decoding and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus for video coding using parametric filtering.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In state of the art video coding schemes, block-based motion compensated prediction (MCP) is used to exploit temporal redundancy. For inter-view coding in a multi-view video coding (MVC) scenario, a block matching procedure can also be applied to perform disparity compensated prediction (DCP), thus exploiting inter-view redundancy. Multi-view video coding (MVC) is the compression framework for the encoding of multi-view sequences. A multi-view video coding (MVC) sequence is a set of two or more video sequences that capture the same scene from a different view point.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there exist mismatches in the video content that are beyond translational displacement, such as focus changes, motion blur in monoscopic video, and illumination and/or focus mismatches across different views in multi-view video coding. Furthermore, the exhibited mismatches may be localized such that different portions of a video frame can undergo different types of change with respect to the corresponding areas in one or more frames used as reference. For example, with heterogeneous camera settings among cameras (utilized in multi-view video coding), different types of blurriness/sharpness mismatches will be associated to objects with different depths. As for motion blur in monoscopic video, objects moving in different directions could result in directional blurring. These non-translational mismatches will lower the coding efficiency of motion compensated prediction/disparity compensated prediction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Without prior information about the mismatch in the video content, a two-pass encoding scheme can be utilized, in which an initial search and filter estimation are performed first to adaptively design filters based on the differences between the current frame and the reference frame(s). Higher coding efficiency is achieved by the preceding described two-pass encoding scheme as new references are created using the estimated filters. However, such scheme significantly increases encoding complexity and also increases the overhead since we transmit filter coefficients for every frame encoded with this scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the context of video coding, reference frame filtering approaches have been proposed, in which new reference frames are generated to improve coding efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For focus changes and/or camera panning, a technique referred to as blur compensation was proposed, in which a fixed set of blurring (lowpass) filters are used to generate blurred reference frames for video coding. This technique has two shortcomings for the scenarios we consider. First, the filter selection is made only at the frame-level, i.e., applying different filters to different parts of a frame was not considered. Second, this method relies on a very limited pre-defined filter set (lowpass only).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To more efficiently capture the actual mismatch in the video content, we have previously proposed an adaptive reference filtering approach, which is a two-pass encoding scheme. For example, to encode a frame with inter-view prediction, it was proposed to first perform an initial disparity estimation. By exploiting the disparity fields as an estimation of scene depth, video frames are partitioned into regions which correspond to different scene-depth levels. For each depth level, a spatial filter is adaptively designed based on the difference between the current frame and the reference frame to minimize the residue energy. Such a design approach is able to address depth-dependent focus mismatches exhibited across different views. The estimated filters are applied to the reference frame to create filtered references. For each block, the encoder selects the predictor (filtered or unfiltered) that provides the lowest rate-distortion cost (RD-cost), thus ensuring the highest coding efficiency. In this adaptive reference filtering (ARF) method, the overhead (frame-wise filter coefficients) will be larger as compared to fixed filter set approaches. More importantly, this two-pass method significantly increases encoding complexity. The additional steps (initial search and filter estimation) are necessary if we do not have prior knowledge about the mismatch.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As noted above, the present principles are directed to methods and apparatus for video coding using parametric filtering.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In contrast to the above described prior art technique of blur compensation which relies upon a very limited pre-defined filter set (lowpass only), in accordance with the present principles, we provide pre-defined filter sets that are designed based on the characteristics of the mismatch to be compensated. Possible examples of such mismatches are focus mismatch in inter-view prediction for multi-view video coding (MVC) and directional motion blur in monoscopic video. Thus, in an embodiment, we can include high-frequency enhancement filters to compensate for focus mismatch, and in another or the same embodiment, we can include directional filters to compensate for motion blur. Multiple parametric filters can be supported in our approach such that localized compensation can be applied. It is to be appreciated that the preceding types of mismatches (focus mismatch and motion blur) are mentioned for the purpose of illustration and, thus, the present principles are not limited to solely those types of mismatches. That is, given the teachings of the present principles provided herein, one of ordinary skill in this and related arts will readily appreciate the various types of mismatches to which the present principles may be applied, while maintaining the spirit of the present principles.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, parametric filtering for video coding in accordance with the present principles advantageously exploits the characteristics of the mismatch. In an embodiment, a set of parametric filters are designed before encoding the video sequence (pre-defined filter set). These parametric filters are designed based on the knowledge of the target mismatch to be compensated for, such as isotropic filters for focus change and directional filters for motion blur. Hence, embodiments of the present principles are capable of providing application specific pre-defined filter sets. Multiple parametric filters can be designed in order to compensate for localized mismatches. In the presence of the targeted mismatch, new reference frames can be generated by applying the parametric filters to improve coding efficiency. Note that although the parametric filters are designed beforehand, the decision of whether to use them, which filter(s) to be used, and the ordering of the filters for generating new reference frames, can be adaptively determined based on estimations of the mismatch. Thus, embodiments of the present principles can reduce complexity as compared to other methods that also utilize reference filtering (which estimate filters with an initial search for each frame to be encoded), while still efficiently capturing the mismatches exhibited in the video content. Moreover, since the filters are parameterized according to the properties of the mismatch and the coding decision can be made adaptive, the coding efficiency is improved. That is, while we keep the overhead very small (pre-defined filter set instead of one filter set for every frame), high coding efficiency can be achieved since the filters are parameterized by exploiting the properties of the mismatch and the selection is adaptive to the estimated difference between video frames.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present principles, we disclose methods and apparatus for designing parametric filters based on the properties of a mismatch, where the parametric filters are applied to video sequences that suffer from the same category of mismatch (such as, for example, focus change, and/or motion blur). The new coding scheme avoids performing two-pass coding as in adaptive reference filtering (ARF), while the parametric filters to be utilized can still be designed/selected according the difference between the current frame and a reference frame(s). For example, we can fix the structure of the filter, and the filter parameters can be adjusted, so that the filter can be changed to a lowpass, bandpass and/or highpass filter accordingly. Multiple parametric filters can be constructed to compensate for localized and/or different types of mismatch within a frame. After designing the set of filters, the filters are made available to the encoder such that the encoder can use them to generate new filtered reference frames for higher coding efficiency (application specific pre-defined filter set).</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Parametric Filtering for Focus Mismatch in MVC Inter-View Prediction</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In multi-view video coding, video data captured simultaneously by multiple cameras is encoded. We refer to the respective video from the different cameras as views. Inter-view prediction refers to encoding a frame using frames from other views as references. Frames from different views may exhibit focus mismatch, due to heterogeneous camera settings and/or different shooting positions/orientations. It has been shown that the differences exhibited in images captured by different cameras can be represented in terms of the focus setting mismatches and the depths of objects. The mismatches lead to differences in optical transfer functions which can be represented as blurring (lowpass)/sharpening (enhancement) filters that are circular symmetric in the spatial domain. For a given pair of views, the type (lowpass, enhancement, and so forth) and degree of change are associated with the depth composition within the scene. Parametric filters can be constructed to cover a wide range of such focus mismatches. Some examples are summarized below in the following tables. TABLES 1A and 1B show parametric filters with 3&#xd7;3 and 5&#xd7;5 symmetric constraints, respectively. TABLES 2A and 2B show parametric filters with 3&#xd7;3 and 5&#xd7;5 vertical/horizontal symmetric constraints, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">By varying the values of the parameters (filter coefficients), we can generate filters with different frequency responses to compensate for possible focus mismatch in inter-view prediction. In one embodiment, we construct a set of filters by estimating and collecting parametric filters that minimize the prediction error for sequences with focus mismatches, and classify/cluster the collected parametric filters into some representative filters. Then, the obtained filter set can serve as the parametric filters that are used to compensate for focus mismatch in multi-view video coding inter-view prediction. In another embodiment, we fix the structure of a set of the parametric filters and estimate the parameters for each parametric filter on the fly.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The pre-defined filter set provides encoder options when coding multi-view video. Depending on the focus setting difference and the depth composition of the scene, the image will exhibit different types of focus mismatch. Thus, it is not necessary for a multi-view video coded view to utilize all the parametric filters. The following provide some examples of when all of the parametric filters need not be used:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0055">(1) If a view does not have focus mismatch as compared to the view(s) used for reference, the filtering approach is not necessary while coding efficiency can be preserved.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0056">(2) When only certain types of focus mismatch are present in the view being encoded, some parametric filters may be very rarely selected by block-based compensation as they cannot provide coding improvement. Eliminating these parametric filters from the filter list can help save the bitrate spent on signaling the reference index, as we will have fewer filtered references to choose from.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0057">(3) Even if there are similar types of mismatch, the composition of the mismatch in the scene can still be different. For example, one scene may have objects mostly requiring enhancement where only a few of the objects need lowpass filtering, while in another scene a larger portion may need to be smoothed (lowpass filtering). The ordering of the parametric filters should be altered accordingly. Putting the most dominant mismatch filter first in the list can further reduce the signaling bitrate.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0058">To take these into account and improve the coding efficiency, in accordance with one or more embodiment, we also propose estimation techniques to adaptively determine, for each view, which parametric filters are to be included and the ordering of the included filters.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment I</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0059">If the camera parameters (such as, for example, focus setting and aperture size) are available, the characteristics of the imaging system (i.e., the optical transfer functions) can be derived. When the depth information is also available (for example, in free viewpoint television systems), combined with the optical transfer functions, we will be able to know what kinds of mismatch will be present in the images. For a given view, we select from the pre-defined filter set the parametric filters which cover the types of mismatch that will be exhibited in the images based on the above information. The depth information also tells us the depth composition of the scene and consequently tells us what type of mismatch is more dominant. Thus, the ordering of the selected filters can be determined accordingly.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Focus Mismatch Estimation</heading>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiment II</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0060">When the camera parameters are available (and, thus, the optical transfer functions are known) but not depth information (i.e., no depth information is currently available for use), we can perform an estimation to approximately calculate the depth. For example, if we also know the spacing between cameras and the relative shooting orientation, the estimated disparity can then be used to trace back the actual depth of different objects in the scene. That is to say, given the multi-view camera parameters, we can perform disparity estimation (via search, for example) to identify possible types of focus mismatch. For a given view, after such estimation, we select from the pre-defined filter set the parametric filters which cover the types of mismatch we are considering. The disparity estimation also indicates the depth composition of the scene and consequently what type of mismatch is more dominant. The ordering of the selected filters can be determined accordingly.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Focus Mismatch Estimation</heading>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment III</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0061">When the multi-view camera parameters are not fully available, we can use the procedure similar to adaptive reference filtering to estimate the mismatch in the images. For a given view to be encoded, frames are partitioned into different depth-levels based on classification of the disparity vectors. Then, two-dimensional (2D) minimum mean-squared error filters are estimated for all the blocks in each depth level. These estimated filters indicate what the types of focus mismatch are in the current view as compared to the reference view(s). We can then compare the estimated filters with the parametric filters in the pre-defined set. Filters in the pre-defined set which have the highest correlations to the estimated filters are selected to serve as additional coding options for the current view, in order to generate new reference frames. The ordering of the selected parametric filters can also be decided based on the classification and correlation analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0062">It is to be noted that in various embodiments of these methods, the disparity estimation (embodiments II and III) and filter estimation (embodiment III) can be performed in some early frames of a given view and, then the selected parametric filters are applied to the remaining frames. In other embodiments, the estimations can be carried out at certain particular timestamps (for example, every 10th frame) and the chosen parametric filters are applied to frames between the mismatch-estimation timestamps.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Parametric Filtering for Directional Motion Blur in Video Coding</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0063">We now describe the idea of applying parametric filtering to directional motion blur. Parametric filters can be constructed to compensate for motion blur. Since motion can occur in different directions in the video content, the filters can be parameterized with directionality as illustrated below:</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0065">After constructing a set of filters, the encoder can select which of them to use as well as the filter ordering by performing estimations of the motion blur mismatches. In an embodiment, estimations of the motion blur mismatches may be performed by motion estimation to identify the possible motion blur directions. In another embodiment, we can apply a process similar to adaptive reference filtering to estimate filters which capture the motion blur exhibited in video frames. Then the filters from the pre-defined set which demonstrate the highest correlation to the estimated filters are selected to generate new reference frames.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Signaling of Parametric Filtering</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0066">Since the filter set is pre-defined by exploiting the characteristics of the mismatch, the coefficients only have to be transmitted at most once for the entire sequence. Furthermore, if the pre-defined filter set is built as a dictionary which is common to both the encoder and decoder, we do not have to transmit the filter coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0067">For the case when they are transmitted once, the order in which they are transmitted can be considered as their default order and in the case when they are a fixed set, the default order can be established for them.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">When we wish to use these filters in their default order, there is no additional syntax needed. Once the reference picture list is established, the filters are applied in their default order. If there are N filters in each list but only M&#x3c;N reference pictures in the reference list, then the first M filters are applied.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">Due to the fact that frames may use different numbers of parametric filters (even 0, if the encoder determines not to apply filtering) from the pre-defined and the ordering may be different, it will become necessary for these cases to provide such information to the decoder. Here, we demonstrate an example of multi-view video coding interview-prediction using parametric filtering with respect to the signaling of selected filters.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0070">Presume there are 4 parametric filters in the pre-defined set, and they are denoted as f1&#x2dc;f4 and with the default order of f1, f2, f3, f4. Five views (V0&#x2dc;V4) are encoded using inter-view prediction with an IBPBP structure.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0072">In this example, for V1, the decoder will know this B-view was encoded with parametric filtering (filter_flag=1). The flag is transmitted as a high level syntax and may be present in, for example, but not limited to, the PPS, SPS, NAL unit header and/or slice header. One embodiment of this flag is shown in TABLE 6, which shows slice header syntax.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0073">As shown in TABLE 5, for V1 there are three filters for List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 and one filter for List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1. The filter order indicates that the references in List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 (a total of four: three filtered and one unfiltered) correspond to a filtered reference by f3, a filtered reference by f4, an unfiltered reference, and a filtered reference by f1, and the only filtered reference in List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1 is generated by f2, which is put after the unfiltered reference in List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0074">In this example, the number of filters in each list is different and, in addition, the ordering of the filters is also changed. In order for the decoder to be aware of this, we propose to transmit an additional syntax along with the reference picture list reordering (RPLR) commands which indicates which filter index to use for the reference picture that is being reordered. TABLE 7 shows reference picture list reordering syntax.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0075">V2 is also encoded with parametric filtering (filter_flag=1) and there are two filtered references by f3, f1. The ordering of the references corresponds to: filtered by f3; unfiltered; and filtered by f1. There is no syntax for the number of filters in List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0 since the bitstream will indicate this view is a P-view and, thus, all filters are for List<sub>&#x2014;</sub>0. As for V4, filter_flag=0 indicates that is was encoded without applying parametric filtering.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0091">Another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder as described above, wherein at least one set of parametric filters used for the parametric filtering is pre-defined before encoding the picture or a video sequence to which the picture belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0092">Yet another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder where at least one set of parametric filters is pre-defined as described above, wherein the at least one pre-defined set of parametric filters is estimated based on an expected mismatch between the picture and the at least one reference picture.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0093">Still another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder wherein the at least one pre-defined set of parametric filters is estimated as described above, herein coefficients of the at least one pre-defined set of parametric filters are calculated based on estimating a group of filters which compensate for the expected mismatch and classifying at least a portion of the estimated group of filters.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0094">Moreover, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder where at least one set of parametric filters is pre-defined as described above, wherein the encoder selects at least one set of parametric filters from the at least one pre-defined filter set to use for the parametric filtering, and further selects an ordering of the filters in the at least one selected set.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0095">Further, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder that selects at least one set of parametric filters and further selects an ordering of the filters as described above, wherein at least one of the at least one selected set of parametric filters and the ordering of the filters in the at least one selected set is selected based on an estimation of a mismatch between the picture and the at least one reference picture.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0096">Also, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder that selects based on an estimation of a mismatch as described above, wherein the picture corresponds to at least one view of at least two views of multi-view video content, and the estimation is based on at least one of camera parameters and camera settings for at least two cameras used to capture the multi-view video content.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0097">Additionally, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder that selects based on an estimation of a mismatch as described above, wherein the estimation is based on at least one of motion information, depth information, a motion search, and a disparity search.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0098">Moreover, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder that selects based on an estimation of a mismatch as described above, wherein the estimation is performed by partitioning the picture into regions with different types of mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0099">Further, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder that selects at least one set of parametric filters and further selects an ordering of the filters as described above, wherein the at least one filtered reference picture obtained by performing the parametric filtering is associated with a different reference index for encoding selection and signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0100">Also, another advantage/feature is the apparatus having the encoder that selects at least one set of parametric filters and further selects an ordering of the filters as described above, wherein the encoder signals the at least one selected set of parametric filters and a reference picture ordering in a resultant bitstream to allow a reconstruction of the picture by a corresponding decoder.</p>
