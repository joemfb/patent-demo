<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to methods for manufacturing light-emitting diodes and in particular to a method for producing high efficiency light-emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nitride semiconductor light emitting devices have been employed in a wide variety of applications, including traffic lights, backlights of electronic apparatus, outdoor optical displays, white light illumination apparatus, UV light apparatus, and data storage apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a nitride semiconductor light-emitting device, a structure of the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device includes a substrate, which can be made of sapphire or SiC (silicon carbide). In a process of the nitride semiconductor light-emitting device manufacture, the process includes forming an epitaxial light emitting stack on a substrate wafer, and then cutting the wafer into dice. The wafer can be separated into dice by a number of ways, for example, the wafer can be mechanically scribed, such as with a diamond scribe, and then be separated along scribing lines. However, the hardness of the sapphire or the SiC is greater than traditional III-V materials (for example, Si or GaAs), and it is difficult and time-consuming to cut the wafer made of sapphire or SiC. Furthermore, the consumption of the diamond is so great that the manufacturing cost is raised.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another separation method involves scribing the wafer by a high energy density laser beam ablating the bonds between atoms of the substrate. In laser ablation scribing, the scribing temperature has to be high enough to break the crystal bonds of the substrate and then results in the build-up of waste material along the scribing lines. Because the light emitting from the light-emitting device can be absorbed by the waste material, the light extraction efficiency is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,190, a dry etching method of removing by-products generated from cutting the silicon carbide substrate by the laser light is disclosed. However, the dry etching method can damage the device and affect the product characteristics. Besides, the dry etching method causes the wafer breakage and reduces the product yield.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,849,524, a wet etching method of using a KOH cleaning solution to remove by-products generated from cutting the sapphire substrate by the laser light is disclosed. The cleaning solution can remove slag from the cutting and debris from the breaking. This method applies a protective coating on the cutting side of the sapphire wafer, and then cleans the sapphire wafer with the cleaning solution. However, the method cannot remove the slag completely and efficiently.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the description to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the schematic cross-sectional views showing a light-emitting device with by-products deposited in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention respectively. The processes of manufacturing the light-emitting device comprises disposing a light-emitting stack <b>12</b> over an upper surface of a substrate <b>10</b> to form a light-emitting unit <b>100</b>, coating a first protective layer <b>13</b> on an upper surface of the light-emitting stack <b>12</b>. In another embodiment, the light-emitting stack <b>12</b> is trapezoid wherein the upper surface is smaller than the lower surface so the first protective layer <b>13</b> is easier to be coated on the light-emitting stack <b>12</b>. The lower surface of the substrate <b>10</b> is cutting by a laser beam of a wavelength less than 365 nm to generate cutting lines <b>101</b>, and then putting the light-emitting unit <b>100</b> with the first protective layer <b>13</b> into a warm chemical solution, e.g. an acid solution, for a predetermined period of time. By-products <b>11</b> comprise a first by-product <b>111</b> and a second by-product <b>112</b>. The first by-product <b>111</b> is deposited in the cutting lines <b>101</b> and the second by-product <b>112</b> is deposited around the cutting lines <b>101</b> of the lower surface of the substrate <b>10</b> wherein the first by-product <b>111</b> and the second by-product <b>112</b> contain the debris of laser ablation from the light-emitting stack <b>12</b> and the substrate <b>10</b> such as sapphire.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an SEM (scanning electron microscope) photograph showing a top-view of the light-emitting device with by-products. One of the cutting lines <b>101</b> has an extension direction A-A&#x2032; and the other has an extension direction B-B&#x2032;. There are a lot of by-products <b>11</b> deposited around the cutting lines <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is an SEM photograph showing a cross-sectional view of the light-emitting device with by-products taken by. There are a lot of by-products <b>11</b> deposited around the cutting line along with direction A-A&#x2032; and in the cutting line along with direction B-B&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The compositions of the chemical solution are phosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). The preferred cleaning temperature of the chemical solution is higher than the atmospheric temperature. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the chemical solution is 175&#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. Furthermore, a second protective layer can be deposited on the lower surface of the substrate <b>10</b> in order to avoid any damage caused by the chemical solution.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> are SEM photographs showing the results of several experiments with different cleaning temperature and cleaning time. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the cutting lines are cleaned by a chemical solution in an experiment I. The ratio of the H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>to the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>adopted in experiment I is 2:1, and the temperature of the chemical solution is 130&#xb0; C. The light-emitting device <b>1</b> is cleaned in the chemical solution for 10 minutes, but the first by-product <b>111</b> and the second by-product and <b>112</b> cannot be removed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the cutting lines are cleaned by a chemical solution in an experiment II. The light-emitting device <b>1</b> is cleaned in the chemical solution having the temperature of 240&#xb0; C. for 2 minutes. The second by-product <b>112</b> deposited around the cutting line of the lower surface of the substrate <b>10</b> are removed, but the first by-product <b>111</b> deposited in the cutting line still cannot be removed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the cutting lines are cleaned by a chemical solution in an experiment III. The light-emitting device <b>1</b> is cleaned in the chemical solution of the temperature of 330&#xb0; C. for 1 minute, and the first and second by-products <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are totally removed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The foregoing are just some experiments of the first embodiment. After many experiments, the results are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The curve A is a limit of the cleaning condition to remove the second by-product <b>112</b>, and the curve B is a limit of the cleaning condition to remove the first by-product <b>111</b> and the second by-product <b>112</b>. If a cleaning procedure is performed with the condition of region I, the by-products cannot be removed. When a cleaning procedure is performed with the condition of region II for which the temperature of the chemical solution is between 175&#xb0; C. to 275&#xb0; C. or 200&#xb0; C. to 250&#xb0; C., the second by-product <b>112</b> can be removed. When a cleaning procedure is performed with the condition of region III for which the temperature of the chemical solution is equal or greater than 275&#xb0; C. or 250&#xb0; C., the first by-product <b>111</b> and the second by-product <b>112</b> can be removed. It is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that a similar removal result can be achieved by lowering the cleaning temperature but prolonging the cleaning time, or elevating the cleaning temperature but reducing the cleaning time.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The composition ratio of the chemical solution can be changed based on the user requirement. If the user prefers a shorter cleaning time, a chemical solution with a higher ratio of the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and higher cleaning temperature can serve the purpose. The chemical solution has a good selectivity between the by-products <b>11</b> and the substrate <b>10</b>, and most of the by-products <b>11</b> can be removed without damaging the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, schematic cross-sectional views of a light-emitting device with by-products in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention is shown. The method of manufacturing the light-emitting device comprises disposing a light-emitting stack <b>22</b> over an upper surface of a substrate <b>20</b> to form a light-emitting unit <b>200</b>, coating a first protective layer <b>23</b> of an exemplary thickness of 1-4 &#x3bc;m on an upper surface of the light-emitting stack <b>22</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in some embodiments, the first protective layer <b>23</b> is also covering the substrate <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, the light-emitting stack <b>22</b> is trapezoid wherein the upper surface is smaller than the lower surface so the first protective layer <b>23</b> is easier to be coated on the light-emitting stack <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, cutting the light-emitting stack <b>22</b> from the upper surface by a laser beam with a wavelength less than 365 nm, and putting the light-emitting unit <b>200</b> with the first protective layer <b>23</b> into a chemical solution for a predetermined period of time to remove the by-products resulted from the laser cutting. When the substrate is cut by the laser beam from the upper surface of the substrate <b>20</b>, cutting lines <b>201</b> are formed. By-products <b>21</b> comprise a third by-product <b>211</b> and a fourth by-product <b>212</b>. The third by-product <b>211</b> is deposited in the cutting lines <b>201</b> and the fourth by-product <b>212</b> is deposited around the cutting lines <b>201</b> wherein the third and the fourth by-products contain the debris of laser ablation from the light-emitting stack <b>22</b> and the substrate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The composition of the chemical solution includes H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The preferred temperature of the chemical solution is higher than the atmospheric temperature. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the chemical solution is 175&#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the temperature of the chemical solution is 320&#xb0; C. The light-emitting device <b>2</b> is cleaned in the chemical solution for 10-60 seconds. A second protective layer can be deposited on the lower surface of the substrate <b>20</b> in order to avoid any damage caused by the chemical solution. The depth of the cutting lines <b>201</b> can reach downward to about 5%-70% of the thickness of the substrate <b>20</b>. For a substrate <b>20</b> such as sapphire at a thickness of 100&#x2dc;200 &#x3bc;m, the depth of the cutting lines <b>201</b> is substantially in a range of 5 &#x3bc;m to 140 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, after removing the by-products, the protective layers are removed. The light emitting stack <b>32</b> includes a first semiconductor layer <b>321</b>, a semiconductor light-emitting layer <b>322</b>, and a second semiconductor layer <b>323</b>. The semiconductor layers <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>, and <b>323</b> of the light emitting stack <b>32</b> can be grown by epitaxy technology such as a metal organic chemical vapor deposition method (MOCVD method), a molecular beam epitaxy method (MBE method) or the like, and with proper doping if necessary. The semiconductor light-emitting layer <b>322</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>323</b> are etched to expose partial of the first semiconductor layer <b>321</b>. Following, a first electrode <b>324</b> and a second electrode <b>325</b> are formed on the first semiconductor layer <b>321</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>323</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, cross-sectional views of a light-emitting device in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention is shown. To avoid the damage to the light-emitting stack caused by the chemical solution, both the process of cutting the substrate to form cutting lines and the afterward process of putting the substrate into a chemical solution to remove the by-product are done before the light-emitting stack is formed. The cutting lines <b>401</b> can be formed on the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b> as shown in cross-sectional views (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, or can be formed on the lower surface of the substrate <b>40</b> as shown in cross-sectional views (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. Here, the cross-sectional views (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, where the cutting lines <b>401</b> are formed on the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b>, are taken as an example for following illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The method of manufacturing the light-emitting device comprises cutting the substrate <b>40</b> from the upper surface by a laser beam with a wavelength less than 365 nm, and putting the substrate <b>40</b> in a chemical solution for a predetermined period of time to remove the by-products resulted from the laser cutting. When the substrate is cut by the laser beam from the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b>, cutting lines <b>401</b> are formed. By-products <b>41</b> comprise a fifth by-product <b>411</b> and a sixth by-product <b>412</b>. The fifth by-product <b>411</b> are deposited in the cutting lines <b>401</b> and the sixth by-product <b>412</b> are deposited around the cutting lines <b>401</b> wherein the fifth and the sixth by-products contain the debris of laser ablation from the substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The composition of the chemical solution includes H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The preferred temperature of the chemical solution is higher than the atmospheric temperature. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the chemical solution is 175&#x2dc;300&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the temperature of the chemical solution is 320&#xb0; C. The substrate <b>40</b> is cleaned in the chemical solution for 10-60 seconds. As illustrated in previous embodiments, a first protective layer can also be deposited on the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b> before the cutting process in order to avoid any damage caused by the chemical solution. Similarly, a second protective layer can be deposited on the lower surface of the substrate <b>40</b> in order to avoid any damage caused by the chemical solution. After removing the by-products, the protective layers are removed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, disposing a light-emitting stack <b>42</b> over an upper surface of a substrate <b>40</b> to form a light-emitting unit <b>400</b>. Similar to those previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> may include a first semiconductor layer, a semiconductor light-emitting layer, and a second semiconductor layer. Because the cutting lines <b>401</b> comprise a different crystal plane from that of the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b>, during epitaxial growth of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b>, the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> material does not grow directly on the cutting lines <b>401</b>. However, by fine tuning the forming parameters, such as pressure, temperature, and flowing rate of gases to grow the light-emitting stack <b>42</b>, the materials of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> can still be formed on the cutting lines <b>401</b>, but as the cutting line <b>401</b> comprises multiple crystal planes caused by a laser beam, polycrystalline and/or amorphous materials of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> are formed directly on the cutting lines <b>401</b>. In contrast, single crystal materials of light-emitting stack <b>42</b> are formed on the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b> other than the cutting lines <b>401</b>. The polycrystalline and/or amorphous materials of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> formed directly on the cutting lines <b>401</b> are more fragile than the single crystal materials of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> on other region of the upper surface of the substrate <b>40</b>. Therefore, it is much easier to break the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> along the cutting lines <b>401</b> than other region of the substrate <b>40</b> when being applied to the same magnitude of force. A subsequent wafer breaking process can be provided to separate the wafer into chips. As a result, the wafer breaking process breaks the fragile materials of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> directly on the cutting lines <b>401</b>, and the broken materials are removed to leave side walls <b>400</b><i>a </i>of light-emitting stack <b>42</b> rough. In other words, at least one side wall of one of the chips is rough, and the light extraction efficiency of the light-emitting units <b>400</b> is therefore enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Still another embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and corresponding process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Step <b>801</b> is to provide a substrate <b>40</b> comprising a wafer with a diameter between 2 inches and 8 inches. Step <b>802</b> is to cut the substrate <b>40</b> to form cutting lines <b>401</b>. As illustrated previously, protective layers can also be deposited on one or both surfaces of the substrate <b>40</b> before the cutting process in order to avoid any damage caused by the chemical solution in a following cleaning step <b>803</b>. The cleaning step <b>803</b> is mainly to clean the by-products of the cutting step <b>802</b> by using the chemical solution as illustrated in previous embodiments. And then step <b>804</b> is to form a light-emitting stack <b>42</b>. The details for these four steps are as the above illustration. For either type illustrated above, i.e., whether the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> materials are formed on the cutting lines <b>401</b> or not, a lithography and etch process can be used in a light-emitting stack patterning step <b>805</b> to pattern the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> into a plurality of light-emitting units <b>400</b>. Each of the light-emitting units <b>400</b> substantially corresponds to a chip region <b>760</b> previously defined by the cutting lines <b>401</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a photoresist is used to cover the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> to the whole wafer <b>740</b>, and then the lithography method is used to align and remove part of photoresist that is substantially directly over the cutting lines <b>401</b> to leave the remaining photoresist <b>750</b> to serve as a mask for a subsequent etch process. And then the etch method such as dry etch, with the remaining photoresist <b>750</b> as a mask, is used to remove part of the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> that is substantially over the cutting lines <b>401</b> to expose the cutting lines <b>401</b> and thus pattern the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> into a plurality of light-emitting units <b>400</b>. The remaining photoresist <b>750</b> is then removed. The light-emitting unit <b>400</b> can be defined, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with a side wall <b>400</b><i>a </i>adjacent to but away from the edges <b>401</b><i>a </i>of the cutting lines <b>401</b> with a distance D, or can be defined with a side wall <b>400</b><i>a </i>almost close to the edges <b>401</b><i>a </i>of cutting lines <b>401</b>. That is, the light-emitting stack <b>42</b> is patterned into a plurality of light-emitting units <b>400</b>, and each of the light-emitting units <b>400</b> substantially corresponds to the chip region <b>760</b>. After the light-emitting stack patterning step <b>805</b>, a light-emitting device structuring step <b>806</b> is followed. This is similar to those previously illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, where the semiconductor light-emitting layer and the second semiconductor layer are etched to expose partial of the first semiconductor layer. Following, a first electrode and a second electrode are formed on the first semiconductor layer and the second semiconductor layer respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment of the present invention, the method thereof further comprises a wafer grinding and/or polishing step <b>807</b>. The wafer grinding step is to thin the substrate <b>40</b> and the polishing step is to flatten the substrate <b>40</b>. And the method thereof further comprises a wafer breaking or dicing step <b>808</b> along the cutting lines <b>401</b> to separate the wafer into chips.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The material of the substrate comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting of sapphire, SiC, GaN, AlN, ZnO, MgO, and any combination thereof. The material of the light-emitting stack comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting of Ga, Al, In, As, P, N, Si, and any combination thereof. The light-emitting stack comprises a first conductive type semiconductor layer, a light-emitting layer, and a second conductive type semiconductor layer. The material of the first conductive type semiconductor layer comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting of AlGaInP, AlInP, GaInP, AlN, GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN. The material of the light-emitting layer comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting of AlGaInP, AlInP, GaInP, GaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN. The material of the second conductive type semiconductor layer comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting of AlGaInP, AlInP, GaInP, AlN, GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN. The material of the first protective layer or the second protective layer comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting of gold, platinum, titanium, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Si, carbon film, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, epoxy, and photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this invention, the light-emitting stack is cutting before the wafer polishing process; it can reduce the breaking rate of the wafer, especially when the thickness of the light-emitting stack is increasing. Besides, by cutting the light-emitting stack before forming the electrodes and dicing process, the light emitting stack is well protected to avoid the chemical solution damaging the semiconductor layer and its electrical property.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be apparent; however, that other variations and modifications may be made to the described embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of their advantages. Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications that fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
