<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As to a lateral field-effect transistor, if an enlarged gate width is used to increase current capacity, a comb-shaped structure is often employed for source wiring and for drain wiring so that a plurality of transistor cells can be disposed to be connected in parallel. In such a case, as for gate wiring, a meander shape or a comb shape is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A conventionally proposed field effect transistor has a top surface pattern formed in such a shape that digitiform portions of comb-shaped source and drain electrodes are disposed in opposed positions to interdigitate with each other, and a meander-shaped gate electrode is located between the source electrode and the drain electrode. Another conventionally proposed field effect transistor has digitiform portions of comb-shaped source and drain electrodes formed in an opposing manner to interdigitate with each other, digitiform portions of a comb-shaped gate electrode formed between the source electrode and the drain electrode, and common sections to serve as bases of the digitiform portions of the gate electrode and formed external to the transistor (for example, see Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2006-066887 (Patent Literature 1)).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A still another conventionally proposed transistor has a plurality of unit cells each having a source contact and a drain contact which are interdigitated, a gate contact situated between the source contact and the drain contact, and an overlayer electrically coupling the source contact to a p+ region via a p+ contact which is disposed in a contact via hole (for example, see International Publication No. WO 2006/065324 (Patent Literature 2)).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">Generally, it is understood that on the meander-shaped gate electrode disclosed in the document above, there is a gate wiring which is in the same meander shape as that of the gate electrode and has one end connected to a gate pad. If the gate wiring is in a meander shape, the gate wiring has a high resistance, and charging/discharging of a gate circuit takes time. In addition, the gate wiring has a longer length, which causes a time lag in a gate voltage change between a section of the gate wiring near the gate pad and another section distant from the gate pad. For these reasons, switching of the transistor cannot be speeded up.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">Further, generally, the gate wiring has a width on the order of not more than 1 &#x3bc;m. Thus, during a manufacturing process, a missing pattern may occur, where wiring is partially not formed due to a failure in photolithography. If the gate wiring is in a meander shape, when the gate wiring breaks at even one point, a gate voltage does not change in a section of the gate wiring more distant from the gate pad than the point, and the transistor does not operate in that section. For this reason, an operationally defective transistor product tends to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">Now, the comb-shaped gate wiring disclosed in the above-indicated Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2006-066887 (Patent Literature 1) has the digitiform portions of the gate wiring which run below the base of the source wiring. Usually, the base of the source wiring takes a large width, and therefore, the gate wiring running therebelow has a longer length and a higher resistance. Further, the gate wiring and the base of the source wiring have a larger intersecting area between them, which results in a larger gate-to-source capacity. For these reasons, charging/discharging of a gate circuit takes time, and switching of the transistor cannot be speeded up. In addition, due to a missing pattern occurred during a manufacturing process, the digitiform portions of the gate wiring break, the transistor does not operate in a section beyond the broken point, and an operationally defective transistor product tends to be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">The present invention has been made in view of the problems above, and an object of the invention is to provide a lateral field-effect transistor capable of improving switching speed and reducing operationally defective products.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">A field effect transistor according to the present invention includes a substrate, an active layer formed on the substrate and a source wiring, a drain wiring and a gate wiring formed above the active layer. The source wiring is formed in a comb shape having a source wiring base and a plurality of source wiring fingers protruding from the source wiring base. The drain wiring is formed in a comb shape having a drain wiring base and a plurality of drain wiring fingers protruding from the drain wiring base. The source wiring and the drain wiring are arranged to oppose each other such that the source wiring fingers and the drain wiring fingers interdigitate. The gate wiring has a gate wiring base, a plurality of gate wiring fingers protruding from the gate wiring base, and a connection connecting tips of adjacent gate wiring fingers. The gate wiring finger is arranged between the source wiring finger and the drain wiring finger, and the gate wiring base is arranged between the source wiring base and the drain wiring fingers and intersects with the source wiring fingers, with an insulating film interposed between the gate wiring base and the source wiring fingers.</p>

Further, finger <b>45</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> may have a width w<b>2</b> of 2 &#x3bc;m and a thickness h<b>2</b> of 0.1 &#x3bc;m, and finger <b>45</b> may have a length of 150 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">In RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> having the configuration above, a plurality of fingers <b>45</b> are formed in a manner protruding from base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b>, and a plurality of fingers <b>45</b> are connected to base <b>44</b> in parallel. For this reason, as compared with conventional meander-shaped gate wiring, a difference between electrical resistances of a path from gate pad <b>49</b> to finger <b>45</b> close to gate pad <b>49</b> and a path to finger <b>45</b> distant from gate pad <b>49</b> can be made smaller. Therefore, a time lag in gate voltage change between finger <b>45</b> close to gate pad <b>49</b> and finger <b>45</b> away from gate pad <b>49</b> can be made small.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">Gate wiring <b>43</b> is formed such that the electrical resistance of first wiring <b>101</b> formed by fingers <b>45</b> and connection <b>47</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> is not less than the electrical resistance of second wiring <b>102</b> formed by base <b>44</b> and in parallel with first wiring <b>101</b>. Since the electrical resistance in base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> is small, the resistance to current flowing through base <b>44</b> can be made small. At the same time, since current flows through base <b>44</b> more easily as compared with finger <b>45</b>, a time lag in gate voltage change between finger <b>45</b> close to gate pad <b>49</b> and finger <b>45</b> distant from gate pad <b>49</b> can be made smaller. By making the vertical cross-sectional area of finger <b>45</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> not more than the vertical cross-sectional area of base <b>44</b>, a more remarkable effect of achieving a smaller resistance of base <b>44</b> as compared with finger <b>45</b> can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Further, since base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> is arranged between base <b>24</b> of source wiring <b>23</b> and drain wiring <b>33</b>, source wiring <b>23</b> and gate wiring <b>43</b> have smaller intersecting area therebetween. Generally, base <b>24</b> of source wiring <b>23</b> has a larger width (the size in a direction orthogonal to a direction in which base <b>24</b> extends (the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) than the width of base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b>. For this reason, as compared with the intersecting area between a base of source wiring and fingers of gate wiring in the conventional art where fingers of the comb-shaped gate wiring run below the base of the source wiring, the intersecting area between fingers <b>25</b> of source wiring <b>23</b> and base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> in the configuration of the present embodiment can be made smaller. Accordingly, a smaller gate-to-source capacity can be achieved, and therefore, time required for charging/discharging a gate circuit can be shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">As such, RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the present embodiment has a smaller time lag in a gate voltage change and a shorter time required for charging/discharging a gate circuit, and therefore, an improved switching speed of RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">At the same time, in RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, since a plurality of fingers <b>45</b> are connected in parallel to base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b>, a missing pattern occurred in one finger <b>45</b> does not affect transmission of a gate voltage change to other fingers <b>45</b>. Further, since two adjacent fingers <b>45</b> and connection <b>47</b> form U-shaped wiring which has two connection points to base <b>44</b>, even if a missing pattern occurs at one point on finger <b>45</b> and the wiring breaks, it is possible to transmit a gate voltage change to a portion of wiring ahead thereof, from the other connection with base <b>44</b>, thereby to operate the transistor. In a case where two or more points within one U-shaped wiring break, although a portion where transistor does not operate is created, there is no effect on transmission of a gate voltage change to other fingers <b>45</b> in this case as well. Occurrence of an operationally defective transistor product can therefore be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">A missing pattern could also occur in base <b>44</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b>. However, by making the vertical cross-sectional area of finger <b>45</b> of gate wiring <b>43</b> not more than the vertical cross-sectional area of base <b>44</b>, it is possible to reduce the possibility that the missing pattern causes gate wiring <b>43</b> to break in base <b>44</b>, as compared with finger <b>45</b>. Occurrence of an operationally defective transistor product can therefore be further suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">Next, a method for manufacturing RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart showing a method for manufacturing the lateral field-effect transistor of the first embodiment. In a method for manufacturing RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> implementing the lateral field-effect transistor according to the present embodiment, the following steps are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">First, substrate <b>10</b> to serve as a semiconductor substrate is prepared (S<b>10</b>). For example, an n type substrate of such as single crystal type SiC called 4H-SiC is prepared. Buffer layer <b>11</b> which is located on a main surface of substrate <b>10</b> and made of an SiC layer including a p type impurity as a first conductivity type impurity is then formed (S<b>20</b>). Buffer layer <b>11</b> can have a thickness of 10 &#x3bc;m, for example, and an epitaxial growth method can be used as a film forming method. Aluminum (Al) may be used as a p type impurity. Buffer layer <b>11</b> has a p type impurity concentration of, for example, 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">Channel layer <b>12</b> located on buffer layer <b>11</b> and including a second conductivity type (n type) impurity having a higher concentration than the concentration of the p type impurity in buffer layer <b>11</b> is then formed (S<b>30</b>). Nitrogen (N) may be used as an n type impurity. Channel layer <b>12</b> may have a thickness of 0.4 &#x3bc;m, for example. Channel layer <b>12</b> may have a concentration of the n type conductive impurity of 2.0&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. Subsequently, RESURF layer <b>13</b> is formed on channel layer <b>12</b> (S<b>40</b>). RESURF layer <b>13</b> includes a first conductivity type (p type) impurity having a higher concentration than the concentration of the p type impurity in buffer layer <b>11</b>. RESURF layer <b>13</b> may have a thickness of, for example, 0.25 &#x3bc;m and RESURF layer <b>13</b> may have a p type conductive-impurity concentration of 2.0&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">Gate region <b>41</b> including a first conductivity type (p type) impurity is then formed to extend from surface <b>13</b><i>a </i>of RESURF layer <b>13</b> through RESURF layer <b>13</b> to channel layer <b>12</b> (S<b>50</b>). Specifically, a patterned resist film is formed using a photolithography method. By means of the resist film as a mask, aluminum (Al) is implanted into RESURF layer <b>13</b> and channel layer <b>12</b> using an ion implantation method. In this way, gate region <b>41</b> of p type conductivity is formed. Gate region <b>41</b> may have a depth of, for example, 0.4 &#x3bc;m. Further, gate region <b>41</b> may have a p type impurity concentration of, for example, 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">Source region <b>21</b> and drain region <b>31</b> opposing each other with gate region <b>41</b> sandwiched therebetween and including a second conductivity type (n type) impurity are then formed to extend from surface <b>13</b><i>a </i>of RESURF layer <b>13</b> through RESURF layer <b>13</b> to channel layer <b>12</b> (S<b>60</b>). Specifically, as in the above-described step for forming gate region <b>41</b>, source region <b>21</b> and drain region <b>31</b> of n type conductivity are formed by implanting phosphorus (P) into RESURF layer <b>13</b> and channel layer <b>12</b> using an ion implantation method. Source region <b>21</b> and drain region <b>31</b> may have a depth of 0.4 &#x3bc;m, for example. Source region <b>21</b> and drain region <b>31</b> may have an n type impurity concentration of, for example, 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Activation annealing for activating ions implanted into the above-described gate region <b>41</b>, source region <b>21</b>, and drain region <b>31</b> is then performed (S<b>70</b>). As to conditions for the activation-annealing step, for example, argon gas may be used as an ambient, and a heating temperature of 1700&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 30 minutes may be employed. It is noted that the ambient pressure in annealing may be 100 kPa, for example. Field oxide film <b>20</b> is then formed (S<b>80</b>). Specifically, surface <b>13</b><i>a </i>of RESURF layer <b>13</b> is thermally oxidized to form field oxide film <b>20</b> by heating, in an oxygen atmosphere, substrate <b>10</b> which has been subjected to the above-described processes. As to heating conditions, for example, a heating temperature of 1300&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 60 minutes may be employed. It is noted that the ambient pressure in heating may be at the atmospheric pressure. As a result, field oxide film <b>20</b> having a thickness of 0.1 &#x3bc;m is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">An opening is then formed in a predetermined region of field oxide film <b>20</b> (S<b>90</b>). The opening is formed at a position where an electrode is formed in a subsequent step. Specifically, a resist film having a predetermined pattern is formed on field oxide film <b>20</b> using a photolithography method. This resist film has an opening pattern formed in a region in which opening is to be formed. Using this resist film as a mask, field oxide film <b>20</b> is partially removed by etching. In this way, the opening is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">An ohmic electrode is then formed within the opening (S<b>100</b>). Specifically, a conductive material film (for example, a nickel (Ni) film) constituting the ohmic electrode is formed within the opening and on the upper surface of the resist film using a vapor deposition method. Subsequently, by removing the resist film, a portion of the Ni film formed on the resist film is also removed (lift-off procedure). Then, in an argon atmosphere, the SiC substrate on which the Ni film has been formed is heat-treated and the Ni film is turned into the ohmic electrode. As to the conditions for this heat treatment, for example, a heating temperature of 950&#xb0; C. and a heating time of 2 minutes may be employed. Further, the pressure of the argon atmosphere may be at the atmospheric pressure. In this way, source electrode <b>22</b> in contact with source region <b>21</b>, drain electrode <b>32</b> in contact with drain region <b>31</b>, and gate electrode <b>42</b> in contact with gate region <b>41</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">Gate wiring <b>43</b> is then formed on gate electrode <b>42</b> (S<b>110</b>). Specifically, a patterned resist film is formed on gate electrode <b>42</b> using a photolithography method. The resist film has an opening pattern formed to expose gate electrode <b>42</b>. A conductive material film (for example, an aluminum film) to turn into gate wiring <b>43</b> is formed by vapor deposition onto the interior of the opening pattern of the resist film. The aluminum film may have a thickness of 0.1 &#x3bc;m, for example. Subsequently, part of the conductive material film located on the resist film is removed by removing the resist film (lift-off procedure). As a result, gate wiring <b>43</b> located on gate electrode <b>42</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> covering gate wiring <b>43</b> is then formed (S<b>120</b>). Specifically, a plasma CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method is used to form interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> made of an SiO<sub>2 </sub>film having a thickness of 0.2 &#x3bc;m. In this way, interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> is formed to be in contact with the surfaces of gate wiring <b>43</b>, source electrode <b>22</b>, drain electrode <b>32</b>, and field oxide film <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">Part of interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> is then removed to form openings in predetermined regions of interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> (S<b>130</b>). The openings are formed at positions where gate pad <b>49</b>, source wiring <b>23</b> and drain wiring <b>33</b> are to be formed in a subsequent step. Specifically, after a resist is applied onto interlayer insulating film <b>51</b>, exposure and development are performed, and a resist film having an opening in a desired region of interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> is formed. The resist film is used as a mask to partially remove interlayer insulating film <b>51</b>, for example, by RIE (Reactive Ion Etching). In this way, interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> in contact with source electrode <b>22</b> and drain electrode <b>32</b> is removed, and interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> in a region corresponding to the arrangement of gate pad <b>49</b> is removed as well.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">Source wiring <b>23</b> including a pad, drain wiring <b>33</b> including a pad and gate pad <b>49</b> are then formed (S<b>140</b>). Specifically, on interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> partially removed by RIE, an aluminum film made of aluminum and having a thickness of 3 &#x3bc;m is formed by, for example, spattering and etched into a desired shape, so that source wiring <b>23</b>, drain wiring <b>33</b> and gate pad <b>49</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">Passivation film <b>52</b> is then formed (S<b>150</b>). Specifically, on the entire top surface of RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> except a pad portion such as gate pad <b>49</b> to be externally connected, for example, on the surface of interlayer insulating film <b>51</b> and above source wiring <b>23</b> and drain wiring <b>33</b> formed in step (S<b>140</b>), passivation film <b>52</b> made of an SiO<sub>2 </sub>film having a thickness of 5 &#x3bc;m is formed by, for example, plasma CVD. By forming passivation film <b>52</b> to serve as a protection film, RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> is externally protected.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">Such a manufacturing method can readily provide RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> capable of improving the switching speed and reducing operationally defective products, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a lateral field-effect transistor of a second embodiment. The lateral RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to serve as an example of the lateral field-effect transistor has the same basic configuration as that of RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the first embodiment. RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the second embodiment is, however, different from RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the first embodiment in that a base region <b>61</b> electrically in contact with buffer layer <b>11</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">Specifically, RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the second embodiment includes p+ type base region <b>61</b> which is formed below part of finger <b>25</b> of source wiring <b>23</b>. Base region <b>61</b> is formed to extend from surface <b>13</b><i>a </i>of RESURF layer <b>13</b> to buffer layer <b>11</b>. On base region <b>61</b>, a base electrode <b>62</b> which is in contact with base region <b>61</b> is formed. Base electrode <b>62</b> connects finger <b>25</b> of source wiring <b>23</b> and base region <b>61</b>. Base electrode <b>62</b> is electrically in contact with buffer layer <b>11</b>. Base electrode <b>62</b> is arranged to be in contact with source electrode <b>22</b> and has the same electric potential as that of source electrode <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">Although base electrode <b>62</b> can be placed at any place as long as a connection with source wiring <b>23</b> can be made, it is desirable that the electrode be provided under finger <b>25</b> of source wiring <b>23</b> together with source electrode <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a cross section of RESURF-JFET <b>1</b>, however, it is more preferable that base electrode <b>62</b> be surrounded by source electrode <b>22</b> in plan view. That is, it is more preferable that base region <b>61</b> be surrounded by source region <b>21</b> when RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> is seen in plan view.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">In RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the second embodiment having such a configuration, since base electrode <b>62</b> is provided below finger <b>25</b> of source wiring <b>23</b> together with source electrode <b>22</b>, stabilization of operation of a transistor cell is promoted. Further, extension of a depletion layer in an OFF operation of the transistor and contraction of the depletion layer in an ON operation within buffer layer <b>11</b> are promoted. Therefore, an improved switching speed of RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> can be achieved. Base region <b>61</b> surrounded by source region <b>21</b> in plan view can provide a more stable operation of the transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">A method for manufacturing RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is basically the same as the method for manufacturing RESURF-JFET <b>1</b> of the first embodiment basically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, however, different in that the step of forming base region <b>61</b> is added. Specifically, steps (S<b>10</b>) to (S<b>60</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are performed. Subsequently, aluminum ion implantation is performed with a depth reaching buffer layer <b>11</b> to form p+ type base region <b>61</b>.
