<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-276278, filed on Dec. 4, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mobile terminal, a base station, a communication system, and a communication method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">General cellular systems employ single-hop communication that is directly performed between a base station and a radio terminal (e.g. mobile terminal). Besides single-hop communication, multi-hop communication causing a radio terminal to relay traffic from another radio terminal has also been studied (as described in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2004-248210).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the field of mobile radio communications, error compensation techniques for compensating for an error taking place over a radio communication path are used (as described in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2006-066948, for example). The error compensation techniques include automatic repeat request (ARQ). In ARQ, a receiver side detects an error on a per packet basis using an error detection code attached to a transmission packet by a transmitter side. If no error is detected, the receiver side then returns an acknowledgement (ACK) signal to the transmitter side, and requests the transmitter side to transmit a next packet. If an error is detected, the receiver side returns a negative acknowledgement (NACK) signal to the transmitter side and requests the transmitter side to retransmit the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To reduce the number of retransmissions of ARQ, hybrid ARQ (HARQ) has been used recently. In HARQ, a reception packet is stored on the receiver side if an error is detected. The reception packet is combined with a packet retransmitted in response to a retransmission request, and a combined packet is demodulated. Reception characteristics during the retransmission are thus improved.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above-described related art techniques have difficulty in transferring data efficiently. For example, in the multi-hop communication, the relaying by the mobile terminal causes a transfer delay of the data. In the single-hop communication, data is retransmitted from a base station if an error takes place, thus the availability of the base station's radio resources becomes tight.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the invention, a mobile terminal includes a data receiver that receives data transmitted by a base station to another mobile terminal, a response receiver that receives from the other mobile terminal a negative acknowledgement response indicating that the other mobile terminal has failed to receive the data normally, and a data transmitter that transmits to the other mobile terminal the data, received by the data receiver, in response to the negative acknowledgement response received by the response receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to the accompanying drawings, a mobile terminal, a base station, a communication system, and a communication method as embodiments are described in detail below. In certain embodiments described herein the mobile terminal, the base station, the communication system, and the communication method, the mobile terminal stores data transmitted from the base station, and transmits the data in response to a negative acknowledgement response from another mobile terminal. Thus, the mobile terminal retransmits the data, which was directly transmitted by the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Note that the term &#x201c;mobile terminal&#x201d; is not limiting with regard to the mobility of the terminal. In other words, there is no requirement that the terminal have mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Structure Example of Communication System</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram of a communication system <b>100</b> of one embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the communication system <b>100</b> of the present embodiment includes base station <b>110</b>, mobile terminal <b>120</b>, and mobile terminal <b>130</b>. The base station <b>110</b> transmits data addressed to each of the mobile terminals <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>. The mobile terminals <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are located within the cell of the base station <b>110</b>, and communicate with the base station <b>110</b>. The mobile terminals <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are located within the same communication coverage area.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The mobile terminal <b>120</b> receives data transmitted by the base station <b>110</b> to the mobile terminal <b>130</b>. The mobile terminal <b>120</b> also transmits the data to the mobile terminal <b>130</b> in response to a negative acknowledgement response related to the data and transmitted by the mobile terminal <b>130</b>. The mobile terminal <b>120</b> includes data receiver <b>121</b>, storage unit <b>122</b>, response receiver <b>123</b>, and data transmitter <b>124</b>. This data may hereinafter be referenced to as another-terminal addressed data.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The data receiver <b>121</b> receives data (the another-terminal addressed data) which the base station <b>110</b> has directly transmitted to the mobile terminal <b>130</b> in a single-hop mode. The data receiver <b>121</b> outputs the received data to the storage unit <b>122</b>. A transmitter (not illustrated) in the mobile terminal <b>120</b> transmits to the base station <b>110</b> a response signal related to data addressed to the mobile terminal <b>120</b> itself and received by the data receiver <b>121</b>. In the following discussion, it is assumed that the data addressed to the mobile terminal <b>120</b> has been normally received by the data receiver <b>121</b> and that the mobile terminal <b>120</b> has transmitted an acknowledgement response to the base station <b>110</b>. The acknowledgement response relating to the normally received data addressed to the mobile terminal <b>120</b> itself. Note that data addressed to the mobile terminal <b>120</b> itself will be referred to as own-terminal addressed data.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The storage unit <b>122</b> stores the data addressed to the mobile terminal <b>130</b> and output by the data receiver <b>121</b> (the another-terminal addressed data). In one example embodiment, the storage unit <b>122</b> may store the another-terminal addressed data received together with own-terminal addressed data by the data receiver <b>121</b>, and may not store the another-terminal addressed data received separately from the own-terminal addressed data by the data receiver <b>121</b>. This arrangement reduces a frequency at which the data receiver <b>121</b> stores the another-terminal addressed data and lowers process workload of the mobile terminal <b>120</b>. The storage unit <b>122</b> may store the another-terminal addressed data in an undecoded state. This arrangement may eliminate the need to decode the another-terminal addressed data, and lowers the process workload of the mobile terminal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The response receiver <b>123</b> receives from the mobile terminal <b>130</b> a negative acknowledgement response indicating that the mobile terminal <b>130</b> has failed to receive normally the data addressed to the mobile terminal <b>130</b>. For example, the response receiver <b>123</b> may receive the negative acknowledgement response transmitted by the mobile terminal <b>130</b> to the base station <b>110</b>. The response receiver <b>123</b> outputs the received negative acknowledgement response to the data transmitter <b>124</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The scheduler <b>510</b> schedules radio communications between the base station <b>500</b> and each of the mobile terminals (including the mobile terminal <b>300</b>). The scheduler <b>510</b> determines a radio resource for transmitting data to each mobile terminal. The scheduler <b>510</b> outputs schedule results to the transmission signal processor <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The scheduler <b>510</b> performs a retransmission control process in response to a response signal from a mobile terminal related to data transmitted from the transmission signal processor <b>520</b> and the radio transmitter <b>530</b>. More specifically, the scheduler <b>510</b> schedules transmission of next data to the ACK terminal managed by the terminal information manager <b>560</b>. The scheduler <b>510</b> also schedules retransmission of data to the NACK terminal managed by the terminal information manager <b>560</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The scheduler <b>510</b> includes a terminal selector <b>511</b>. The terminal selector <b>511</b> selects an ACK terminal which is requested to retransmit the data to the NACK terminal managed by the terminal information manager <b>560</b>, from among the ACK terminals managed by the terminal information manager <b>560</b>. For example, the higher communication quality indicated by the quality information managed by the terminal information manager <b>560</b> the ACK terminal has, the terminal selector <b>511</b> selects the ACK terminal with the higher priority as an ACK terminal which is to be requested to retransmit the data to the NACK terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The scheduler <b>510</b> outputs to the transmission signal processor <b>520</b> the retransmission request signal including information indicating the NACK terminal as a retransmission destination. The retransmission request signal is addressed to the ACK terminal selected as a retransmission source by the terminal selector <b>511</b>. The retransmission request signal output to the transmission signal processor <b>520</b> is transmitted via the radio transmitter <b>530</b> to the ACK terminal selected as the retransmission source.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The scheduler <b>510</b> may output a plurality of retransmission request signals, one signal indicating the NACK terminal as a retransmission destination and the other signal indicating the ACK terminal as a retransmission source.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The scheduler <b>510</b> may have a function of an allocation unit.
