<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The illustrative embodiments generally relate to task chairs used in a variety of everyday situations. More specifically, the illustrative embodiments relate to an ergonomic, adjustable, rotating office chair with a lumbar support, designed to provide a more natural sitting position for a sitter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many conventional task chairs are designed to provide a comfortable sitting position for the sitter, but most of the designs force the sitter's body into unhealthy postures. Lumbar supports are typically attached to the back of the chair, and while the support may be adjustable, it does not provide adequate support for a sitter leaning forward in the chair. This lack of support presents a problem, as many sitters lean forward when engaging in conversation or focusing intently on a task. Even when sitters recline in most chairs, the chairs are still not designed with the proper posture in mind. There is a need for a chair that will encourage proper body posture and provide adequate lumbar support over a variety of sitter positions. By supporting continual movement of the seated person, improved spinal health and worker productivity are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One feature of the illustrative embodiments is a floating, articulating lumbar support. The support is attached to the frame of the chair by a rocker arm lever, allowing the support to move forward and backwards in response to similar movements by the sitter. The rocker arm may be attached to the back of the seat, at a rear pivot point, by a pair of steel pins. As the sitter fully reclines in the chair, the articulating lumber passes through an opening in the back of the chair, and the sitter's shoulder blades and upper spine are then supported by an auxiliary back. The back and the lumbar support may be constructed of molded glass reinforced nylon, and the rocker arm lever may be constructed of a high grade aluminum alloy, however any suitable materials may be used. A seat cushion layer of the seat may comprise a composite of renewable, blended materials, such as cork, felt, or latex, however any suitable materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to this illustrative embodiment, the chair also has rollers mounted under a movable, contoured seat, allowing the seat to slide smoothly from a forward tilt to a recline position. A front roller provides tracking guidance for the forward portion of the seat, and a floating spring with rollers provides guidance for the rear portion of the seat. Additionally, the rear spring with rollers helps push the seat forward as the sitter moves into a forward tilt position. The seat has a contoured bottom designed to ride smoothly over both sets of rollers. The rollers may be composed of delrin, the seat is composed of glass reinforced nylon, and the spring material is laminated carbon fiber, but any suitable materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At the front of the seat is a pivot point where, in one illustrative embodiment, two rocker arms attach to the seat, connecting the seat to a lower torsion spring. The lower torsion spring provides the main resilience for reclining and returning to forward tilt posture. This spring is positioned low, to allow the maximum arc of movement and to lower the center of gravity of a moving user, while providing appropriate leverage for supporting the full range of movement. The pivot point may be machined steel pin, and the lower torsion spring may be made from steel and rubber covered with an aluminum housing, however any suitable pivoting connection may be used and the parts may be made from any suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The rocker arms of the lumbar support may attach to the rear of a keystone assembly by a lumbar spring assembly. The lumbar spring is a torsion spring, similar to the lower torsion spring, and the lumbar spring provides tension and resilience for the movement of the articulating lumbar support. The spring assembly may be clamped to the rear of the keystone assembly and may be attached with a steel axle to the rocker arms of the articulating lumbar support. The keystone assembly not only connects to the lumbar support, but also connects to the rollers, the lower torsion spring, and to a seat height adjustment lever and height adjustable column. The keystone assembly may be made from cast aluminum, and the lumbar spring may be made from steel and rubber and cased in aluminum, however any suitable materials may be used for construction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another illustrative embodiment, the keystone assembly attaches to a height adjustable column comprised of a gas cylinder and a steel and plastic housing in a preferred embodiment. Adjustments to the seat height can be made by actuating a lever attached to the keystone assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another feature of one illustrative embodiment is a cast aluminum footrest that curves upward from a center recessed base affixed to the bottom of the central column. The recesses in the base allow clearance for the lower torsion spring when the chair is in a low height position, and consequently the chair can still shift and rotate without contact between the base and the torsion spring. The footrest creates a comfortable place for the sitter to rest his feet without interfering with chair functions. Wheels may also be attached to the end of the footrests to allow the chair to be easily moved about. In one illustrative embodiment, the central base and footrests are made of cast aluminum, however any suitable materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The illustrative embodiments also may have several user adjustable features. Two contoured armrests may attach to the contoured seat and may be custom made to fit the individual user. The vertical position of the lumbar support may be raised or lowered to closely match the curves of a sitter's spine. In this embodiment, this adjustment is made by means of a spring button which unlocks the support and allows the user to vertically adjust the height thereof. Additionally, the back and lumbar support may be custom made or selected from a variety of custom sizes, although a standard back and/or lumbar support size may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the instant invention will be more clearly understood from the review of the following detailed description of the invention when read in conjunction with the appended drawings, in which:</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary side elevation of one illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support. An auxiliary back <b>1</b> provides shoulder blade and upper spine support for a sitter when the sitter is in a reclined position. According to this embodiment, the auxiliary back <b>1</b> may be selected from a variety of customized backs, or a standard back may be used. The auxiliary back <b>1</b> attaches to the contoured seat <b>3</b> and moves with the movement of the seat. The contoured seat <b>3</b>, may have a layer of padding, preferably comprised of renewable composite materials, however padding may be excluded or any suitable materials may be used. The contoured seat <b>3</b> has contours <b>5</b> formed into its bottom face, and the contours slide on rollers <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>. The rollers allow the seat to move through a range of forward tilt to full recline as the contours move across the rollers. The rear roller <b>7</b> is attached to a floating spring <b>11</b>, and the floating spring <b>11</b> acts to push the seat forward in response to a forward movement by a sitter and to support the rear of the seat in response to a rearward movement by a sitter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the sitter moves forward, the lumbar support <b>13</b> attached to an articulating rocker arm <b>15</b> moves forward in response. This provides constant support for the sitter's lower back, keeping the sitter's back in lordosis, the natural curvature of the spine. The articulating rocker arm <b>15</b> is attached to a lumbar spring assembly <b>17</b>. The spring assembly <b>17</b> allows the rocker arm to articulate and also serves to affix the articulating rocker arm to the keystone assembly <b>19</b>. The articulating rocker arm also attaches to the rear of the seat <b>3</b> at a pivot point <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The keystone assembly <b>19</b> attaches to a height adjustable column <b>23</b> and a lower torsion spring <b>25</b>. The height adjustable column is made up of a gas cylinder <b>27</b> and a central column housing <b>29</b>. The lower torsion spring <b>25</b> attaches to two rocker arms <b>31</b>, which in turn attach to the front of the seat <b>3</b> at a forward pivot point <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The center base of the chair <b>35</b> is attached to the height adjustable column <b>23</b> and has recesses <b>37</b> to prevent contact between the lower torsion spring <b>25</b> and the chair base <b>35</b> when the chair is set at a low height position. Arms <b>39</b> extending from the chair base <b>35</b> attach to wheels <b>41</b>. According to this embodiment, the arm rests <b>48</b>, the lumbar support <b>13</b>, and the auxiliary back <b>1</b>, may be selected from a plurality of sizes to meet an individual user's needs. Alternatively, a standard size may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an exemplary front elevation of another illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support. An opening <b>57</b> in the auxiliary back <b>1</b> provides passage for the articulating lumbar support <b>13</b>. When the sitter moves forward, the support <b>13</b> can pass through the opening <b>57</b> to follow the sitter's back. As the sitter moves back, the support <b>13</b> passes back through the opening <b>57</b> in response to the sitter's movement. The lumbar support <b>13</b> can also be height adjusted, sliding up and down in a gap <b>53</b> in the articulating rocker arm <b>15</b>. A lever <b>55</b> allows adjustment of the height adjustable column. Two custom made arms <b>43</b> can be attached to the chair, and they can be capped by padded armrests <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an exemplary three-dimensional side elevation of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support according to a further illustrative embodiment. From this view it is easy to see how the recesses <b>37</b> in the chair base <b>35</b> provide clearance for the lower torsion spring <b>25</b>. If the sitter spins the chair, the seat <b>3</b> pivots on the central column. Because the lower spring <b>25</b> is attached to the seat, the torsion spring <b>25</b> also pivots. Since the recesses <b>37</b> are below the level of the spring <b>25</b>, the spring <b>25</b> can pivot through a full 360-degrees without interference. Of course, the spring could also be mounted above the level of the chair base <b>35</b>, but the lower the spring <b>25</b> the better the range of tilt movement of the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary three-dimensional rear elevation of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support according to another illustrative embodiment. The actuating rocker arm <b>15</b> fits within a recess <b>61</b> in the rear of the seat <b>3</b>. The auxiliary back <b>1</b> attaches to the bottom face of the seat <b>3</b> in the rear of the seat. When the sitter leans forward, the auxiliary back <b>1</b> moves forward in response, being fixed to the seat <b>3</b>. The actuating rocker arm, pivots forward, moving the lumbar support <b>13</b> forward at a faster rate than the auxiliary back, following the sitter's spine. The recess <b>57</b> in the auxiliary back <b>1</b> allows the lumbar support <b>13</b> to cleanly move forward and backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary three-dimensional perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support from a front-left perspective. The articulating rocker arm <b>15</b> attaches to the keystone assembly <b>19</b> at the lumbar spring assembly <b>17</b>. The front rocker arms <b>31</b> attach to the seat <b>3</b> at a forward pivot point <b>33</b>. Each of the rocker arms is attached to a torsion spring <b>17</b>,<b>25</b>, which stores energy as the sitter moves forwards or backwards. These springs <b>17</b>,<b>25</b> push and pull the chair back into a default position when the sitter is no longer applying forward or backward pressure on the chair. The rear spring <b>17</b> also uses the stored energy to keep the lumbar support in pressured contact with the sitter's lower back.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary three-dimensional perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support from a rear-right perspective. The lumbar spring assembly <b>17</b> is clamped to the bottom of the keystone housing <b>19</b> by a clamping piece <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exemplary three-dimensional perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support from a front-right perspective above the chair. The seat <b>3</b> has a recess <b>61</b> in the rear where the articulating rocker arm <b>15</b> of the lumbar support attaches. This recess helps prevent the seat from interfering with the movement of the rocker arm as it pivots forward and backwards. Of course, other suitable methods of attaching the rocker arm such that interference is minimized may also be used.</p>

The lumbar spring assembly <b>17</b> is clamped to the keystone assembly <b>19</b> by a clamping piece <b>71</b>. The rear roller <b>7</b> is attached to a floating spring <b>11</b> which is in turn attached to the keystone assembly <b>19</b>. The keystone assembly <b>19</b> also houses the front roller <b>9</b>. The keystone assembly serves to interconnect many of the various parts of the chair, and to provide pressure and tension where it is needed in the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an exemplary perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the keystone assembly. The front rollers <b>9</b> sit in slots <b>81</b> cut in the keystone assembly <b>19</b>. The floating spring <b>11</b> holding the rear rollers <b>7</b> attaches to the top face of the keystone assembly <b>19</b>. The adjustable lever <b>55</b> also sits in a slit <b>83</b> in the keystone assembly <b>19</b>. The front rocker arms <b>31</b> attach to the seat <b>3</b> at the pivot point <b>33</b> and the seat contours <b>5</b> are designed to roll smoothly over the rockers <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a </i>shows an illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support with a sitter in a forward tilt position.

The lumbar support <b>13</b> has moved backwards and the auxiliary back <b>1</b> has taken the load off of the sitter's shoulder blades and upper spine. The floating spring <b>11</b> is also flexed, providing support for the rearward tilted seat <b>3</b>. If the sitter moved forwards, the spring <b>11</b> would unflex, providing impetus for the forward movement.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of the mobile ergonomic rotating adjustable chair with lumbar support progressing through a variety of sitter positions ranging from a forward tilt position to a reclined position. As the sitter moves backwards towards a reclining position, the lumbar support <b>13</b> moves backwards as well, keeping constant pressure and support on the sitter's lower back and the seat <b>3</b> tilts downward in the rear to provide a more comfortable reclining position and to transfer weight to the auxiliary back <b>1</b> and pressure to the floating spring.</p>
