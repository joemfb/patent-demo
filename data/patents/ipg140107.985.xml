<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Persons with severe physical disabilities require the use of power wheelchairs for mobility, which are typically controlled through a joystick. However, when the user has no functional control of his/her upper extremities (e.g. quadriplegia) using a joystick becomes inadequate. In these cases the use of alternate control systems is needed such as head arrays, chin joysticks, foot control, etc. Several progressive conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and amio-lateral sclerosis (ALS) often render these alternate systems unusable since voluntary motor control becomes extremely limited. For such severe cases a single switch-driving system (e.g. blink switch, puff switch, EMG switch) is used to control a scanning array linked to the wheelchair electronics. These switch-driving systems require the use of specialized control interfaces, special wheelchair electronics and special rehab wheelchairs all of which are very expensive and limit the use of switch driving control to a very limited number of high end wheelchairs. For individuals with severe progressive conditions, such as the ones indicated before, this means being able to drive their wheelchairs with a regular joystick at one point in time and then having to abandon the chair they are used to, in order to acquire a new chair (which may easily cost three to four times as much as their original chair) so that the needed electronics and driving interfaces can be purchased and incorporated to it.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Thus, what is needed is a universal single actuator-driving system for power wheelchairs, which can be attached to any wheelchair joystick and controlled by any of the single switches available for persons with disabilities.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Throughout the figures, the same reference numbers and characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like elements, components, portions or features of the illustrated embodiments. The subject invention will be described in detail in conjunction with the accompanying figures, in view of the illustrative embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention provides a universal single switch driving system for power wheelchairs which can be attached to any wheelchair joystick and controlled by any of the single switches available for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the system is composed of two main parts: a) a controlling unit <b>8</b> where the user plugs any single switch <b>7</b> to scan through an LED array (or similar display) <b>6</b> in order to select the desired function, and b) an actuator unit <b>1</b> which physically moves the joystick <b>2</b> based on the user's selection. This actuator unit is fitted over the wheelchair joystick and is adjusted to the joystick support arm or wheelchair armrest. The LED array is mounted on a gooseneck or other adjustable support structure for easy viewing and fitted to the side of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Users with severe physical disabilities have a wide selection of single switches (also called capability switches) available to them according to their functional capabilities (e.g. puff switch, blink switch, EMG switch). These switches allow a user to control any switch-adapted device such as a computer, electronic aids to daily living, communication systems, etc. Any of the single switches available on the market can be plugged into the controlling unit of the proposed invention to serve as the user interface according to the functional capabilities of the individual.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the user activates the single switch <b>7</b> a microcontroller (or similar electronic device) located inside the controlling unit <b>8</b> receives the input and activates a direction indicator <b>6</b> consisting of eight small LEDs <b>6</b><i>a </i>distributed in a circular configuration that geometrically represent the eight cardinal points, or any similar display as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Each cardinal-point indicator lights up one at a time (clockwise) at a predetermined speed that can be adjusted according the user visual-motor coordination. When the user sees the desired cardinal-point indicator light up (e.g. left) he/she activates the switch <b>7</b> to select the function and the signal is sent to the microcontroller for it to turn on the actuator <b>1</b> that physically moves the joystick <b>2</b> in the desired direction. As long as the single switch <b>2</b> remains activated, the selected directional indicator <b>6</b><i>a </i>will remain lit up and the corresponding actuator <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>will &#x201c;hold&#x201d; the joystick <b>2</b> in the desired direction until the user releases the switch <b>7</b>. When the user releases the switch <b>7</b>, the selected cardinal-point indicator <b>6</b><i>a </i>turns off and so does the corresponding actuator <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, thus allowing the joystick <b>2</b> to return to the neutral (middle) position. The cardinal-point indicator <b>6</b>, then, resumes the scanning for the user, to select the next direction to move.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As a power saving feature, the directional indicators will cycle a predetermined number of times (adjustable in the programming) and then turn off if the user does not make a selection, thus remaining in an idle state. Activating the switch <b>7</b> once again will activate the cardinal-points display <b>6</b> and resume scanning. The scanning system also includes a sound option (that can be toggled on/off) to provide auditory feedback (beeps) while the cardinal-point indicator cycle through the directions.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> show a switch-actuated joystick system and electrical schematic according to the present invention. The controlling unit <b>8</b> comprises a scanning circuit <b>9</b> configured to scan and detect a user-generated from the switch <b>7</b>. A cardinal-points display <b>6</b> having a plurality of directional indicators <b>6</b><i>a </i>receives an activating signal from a driving circuit <b>10</b> on said controlling unit <b>8</b>. Once a desired direction is determined according to the present invention, a motor driving circuit <b>11</b> sends a driving signal to selectively control motors <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>so that the joystick <b>2</b> is moved to a direction corresponding to a selected direction as represented by a selected active directional indicators <b>6</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the actuator system <b>1</b> consists of two motors <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>placed in a perpendicular arrangement along the horizontal plane. A semicircular rail <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>is attached to the rotating part each motor <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>. Each rail <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>has an internal separation <b>5</b><i>a</i>, <b>5</b><i>b </i>large enough for the joystick to fit (the separation between the rails can be adjustable with a screw in order for this system to be adaptable to different joystick sizes). As seen in the Figures, the two motors <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>and their corresponding rails <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>work perpendicularly to each other so that one of them can move the joystick <b>2</b> left/right and the other can move it forward/backward. The two rails <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>are concentric to each other so that the joystick <b>2</b> can assume all eight positions (e.g. front, front-right, back-left, etc) without one rail colliding with the other. According to the directional indicator <b>6</b><i>a </i>selected by the user in the controlling unit, the microcontroller (or similar electronic device) activates one motor at a time for basic movements (e.g. left, forward) or both motors at the same time for combination movements (e.g. forward/right). The motors in the actuator system <b>1</b> then physically move the joystick <b>2</b> in the desired direction until the controlling unit <b>8</b> receives another signal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The whole system is powered through the wheelchair batteries (24V). Voltage regulators can be used to bring the voltage from 24V to 12V. Then two more are used, one to go from 12V to 5V, which are supplied as the operating voltage for the motors. The other one is used for 12V to 3.3V to power the microcontroller (or similar electronic device). These voltage regulators were used specifically for the prototype, but a DC-to-DC converter (buck configuration) would be used in the actual product so as to reduce the amount of energy that is lost with the regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to another embodiment, a double switch step-scanning system can be used instead of the single switch auto-scanning. One switch would be used to scan through the choices and the other one would select the desired one.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The joystick and joystick control assembly may be taken off the arm rest area and mounted in another part of the wheelchair (e.g. back of the chair, under the chair) since the user will not directly control the joystick. This will free up space that could be needed for wheelchair trays, mounting of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices or to facilitate patient transfers to and from the wheelchair.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The LED array of the preferred embodiment can be substituted by a backlit liquid crystal display, which can present the user with the scanned choices. Beeping in the auditory scanning mode may be substituted by a synthesized or digitized voice cue to indicate the choices being scanned. Scanning options and corresponding actuators may be added to control special wheelchair functions such as power recline, power leg raise, tilt in space, etc. Voltage regulators can be replaced by a DC-to-DC converter (buck configuration) so as to reduce the amount of energy that is lost with the regulators. The servomotors may be substituted by step motors, solenoids or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the present invention has been described herein with reference to the foregoing exemplary embodiment, this embodiment does not serve to limit the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains will appreciate that various modifications are possible, without departing from the technical spirit of the present invention.</p>
