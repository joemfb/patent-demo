Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Galvanic isolation may refer to isolating different sections of an electrical circuit such that current does not flow from one section of the electrical circuit to another section of the electrical circuit.

For an example only, an isolation barrier may be implemented to permit different sections of an electrical circuit to operate at different reference potentials. For another example only, an isolation barrier may be implemented to protect electrical components from being subjected to voltage and/or current that is greater than a predetermined voltage rating and/or a predetermined current rating.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description is merely illustrative in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A transmitter transmits data to a receiver via a primary isolation barrier. The primary isolation barrier electrically isolates the transmitter from the receiver. More specifically, the primary isolation barrier prevents current from flowing from the transmitter to the receiver. For example only, the primary isolation barrier may be a capacitive isolation barrier, an inductive isolation barrier, or another suitable type of non-optical isolation barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The primary isolation barrier has a breakdown voltage. The primary isolation barrier may become short circuited when a voltage across the primary isolation barrier is greater than the breakdown voltage. When the voltage across the primary isolation barrier is greater than the breakdown voltage, insulating (isolating) material of the primary isolation barrier breaks down and conducts. The voltage across the primary isolation barrier may be greater than the breakdown voltage, for example, when a transient increase in a voltage output by the transmitter occurs. When short circuited, the primary isolation barrier provides a path for current to flow from the transmitter to the receiver and stops providing electrical isolation between the transmitter and the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">An isolation barrier according to the present disclosure includes a primary isolation barrier that has a first breakdown voltage. The isolation barrier also includes a fuse that is connected in series with the primary isolation barrier. When a voltage across the primary isolation barrier is greater than the first breakdown voltage, the primary isolation barrier short circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, the fuse blows and creates an open-circuit when the primary isolation barrier shorts. The material resulting from the blowing of the fuse has a second breakdown voltage that is greater than the first breakdown voltage. By blowing and creating an open-circuit when the primary isolation barrier is short circuited, the fuse ensures that the transmitter and the receiver remain electrically isolated in the event that the voltage across the primary isolation barrier becomes greater than the first breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a functional block diagram of an example system including an isolation barrier <b>104</b> is presented. The isolation barrier <b>104</b> provides electrical (galvanic) isolation between electrical components, such as a transmitter <b>108</b> and a receiver <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The transmitter <b>108</b> may include a transmitter input pad <b>116</b> and a transmitter output pad <b>120</b>. The transmitter <b>108</b> may receive an input <b>124</b> via the transmitter input pad <b>116</b>. The transmitter <b>108</b> may include one or more active and/or passive components <b>128</b>, such as an amplifier, a driver, etc. The transmitter <b>108</b> outputs a voltage for the receiver <b>112</b> via the transmitter output pad <b>120</b>. The transmitter <b>108</b> may selectively vary the voltage to transmit data to the receiver <b>112</b>. The transmitter <b>108</b> generates the voltage based on a first reference potential.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A connector <b>132</b> may be connected between the transmitter output pad <b>120</b> and a primary isolation barrier <b>134</b>. For example only, the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> may include a capacitive isolation barrier, an inductive isolation barrier, a giant magneto resistive (GMR) isolation barrier, or another suitable non-optical isolation barrier. An input conductor <b>136</b> of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is isolated from an output conductor <b>140</b> of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> by an insulating medium (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>). The insulating medium prevents current flow from the input conductor <b>136</b> to the output conductor <b>140</b> and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The isolation barrier <b>104</b> also includes a fuse <b>144</b> that is connected in series with the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> between the components <b>128</b> of the transmitter <b>108</b> and one or more components <b>148</b> of the receiver <b>112</b>. For example only, the fuse <b>144</b> may be connected between the output conductor <b>140</b> and a barrier output pad <b>152</b>. The barrier output pad <b>152</b> may be connected to a receiver input pad <b>156</b> via a second connector <b>160</b>. The components <b>148</b> of the receiver <b>112</b> may include one or more active and/or passive components. The receiver <b>112</b> may provide output <b>164</b> via a receiver output pad <b>168</b>. The receiver <b>112</b> may provide the output <b>164</b> based on a second reference potential that is different than the first reference potential.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> has a first breakdown voltage. For example only, the first breakdown voltage may be approximately 2.5 kilo-Volts (kV) root mean squared (rms) or another suitable voltage. For another example only, the first breakdown voltage may be greater than approximately 1.0 kV rms. The primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> may be chosen such that the first breakdown voltage satisfies an Underwriters' Laboratory (UL) standard or another suitable standard for the system in which the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The voltage across the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> may be greater than the first breakdown voltage under some circumstances. For example only, the voltage across the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> may be greater than the first breakdown voltage when an increase in the voltage output by the transmitter <b>108</b> occurs. When the voltage across the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is greater than the first breakdown voltage, the insulating medium breaks down and becomes a conductor. The input and output conductors <b>136</b> and <b>140</b> may therefore be short circuited. Accordingly, the electrical isolation provided by the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> may be eliminated when the voltage across the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is greater than the first breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Without the fuse <b>144</b> connected in series with the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b>, current could flow from the transmitter <b>108</b> to the receiver <b>112</b> when the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is short circuited. The fuse <b>144</b>, however, blows when the voltage across the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is greater than the first breakdown voltage. More specifically, the fuse <b>144</b> blows when the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> shorts.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When blown, the fuse <b>144</b> acts as an open-circuit. The fuse <b>144</b> may act as a resistor of at least a predetermined resistance when blown. For example only, the predetermined resistance may be approximately 1 gigaohm (G&#x3a9;) or another suitable resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A second breakdown voltage of the blown fuse <b>144</b> is greater than the first breakdown voltage of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b>. For example only, if the first breakdown voltage of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is approximately 2.5 kV rms, the second breakdown voltage may be approximately 10.0 kV rms or another suitable voltage that is greater than the first breakdown voltage. The fuse <b>144</b> may be configured such that the second breakdown voltage is 1.5 times the first breakdown voltage, 2 times the first breakdown voltage, 3 times the first breakdown voltage, 4 times the first breakdown voltage, or another suitable amount greater than the first breakdown voltage. The fuse <b>144</b> ensures that the transmitter <b>108</b> and the receiver <b>112</b> will be electrically isolated at voltages up to the second breakdown voltage when the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> will be shorted.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, functional block diagrams of other example systems including the isolation barrier <b>104</b> are presented. While the isolation barrier <b>104</b>, the transmitter <b>108</b>, and the receiver <b>112</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as being implemented on separate chips, the isolation barrier <b>104</b> and the receiver <b>112</b> may be integrated on one chip as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The isolation barrier <b>104</b> and the transmitter <b>108</b> may alternatively be integrated on one chip as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>

In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>10</b>, N is equal to 1, 2, 4, and 2 respectively. The isolation barrier <b>104</b> may include N primary isolation barriers <b>508</b>; one primary isolation barrier for each of the N conductors <b>504</b>. The isolation barrier <b>104</b> may include N fuses <b>512</b>; one fuse connected in series with each of the N primary isolation barriers <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an example cross-sectional view of a chip <b>604</b> including the isolation barrier <b>104</b>, the transmitter <b>108</b>, and the receiver <b>112</b> is presented. A substrate <b>608</b> may be implemented on a package frame <b>612</b>. For example only, the substrate <b>608</b> may be a quartz substrate, a silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) substrate, or another suitable type of substrate. The transmitter <b>108</b> may receive the input <b>124</b> via an external input pin <b>616</b>. The receiver <b>112</b> may provide the output <b>164</b> to an external output pin <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The isolation barrier <b>104</b> may be implemented on top of the substrate <b>608</b>. The transmitter <b>108</b> and the receiver <b>112</b> may be implemented on separate substrates on top of the isolation barrier <b>104</b> in various implementations. One or more conductors (not shown) may be deposited on top of the substrate <b>608</b>. The chip <b>604</b> may include a molding compound that is generally illustrated by <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> include top and side-angle views of an example implementation of the isolation barrier <b>104</b> where the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is a capacitive isolation barrier. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the transmitter <b>108</b> and the receiver <b>112</b> may be connected to the isolation barrier <b>104</b> via bond wires <b>636</b>. The transmitter <b>108</b> may be connected to the input conductor <b>136</b> of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> through one of the bond wires <b>636</b>. The receiver <b>112</b> may be connected to a conductive pad, such as the barrier output pad <b>152</b>, through one of the bond wires <b>636</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A dielectric material <b>640</b> or another suitable insulating material is included between the input conductor <b>136</b> of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> and the output conductor <b>140</b> of the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b>. The dielectric material <b>640</b> prevents current flow from the input conductor <b>136</b> to the output conductor <b>140</b> and vice versa. A first conductive lead <b>644</b> is connected between the output conductor <b>140</b> and a first terminal <b>646</b> of the fuse <b>144</b>. A second conductive lead <b>648</b> may be connected between the barrier output pad <b>152</b> and a second terminal <b>650</b> of the fuse <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The voltage at the input conductor <b>136</b> may be approximately equal to the voltage output by the transmitter <b>108</b>. When the fuse <b>144</b> is intact (non-blown), the voltage at the output conductor <b>140</b> may be approximately equal to the voltage at the barrier output pad <b>152</b>. A portion of the dielectric material <b>640</b> may break down and become a conductor when the voltage across the input and output conductors <b>136</b> and <b>140</b> is greater than the first breakdown voltage. In other words, the dielectric material <b>640</b> may create a short-circuit between the input conductor <b>136</b> and the output conductor <b>140</b> when the voltage across the input and output conductors <b>136</b> and <b>140</b> is greater than the first breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fuse <b>144</b> includes a conductive material. For example only, the conductive material may include or consist of nickel chromium, chromium silicon, polysilicon, or another suitable conductive material. The fuse <b>144</b> may be formed, for example, using thin film deposition or in another suitable manner. In other words, the fuse <b>144</b> may be a thin film resistor. When in its non-blown state, the fuse <b>144</b> has approximately a first resistance. For example only, the first resistance may be between 1 ohm (&#x3a9;) and 10 k&#x3a9; or another suitable resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the input and output conductors <b>136</b> and <b>140</b> are short-circuited, current that is greater than a predetermined current flows from the first terminal <b>646</b> to the second terminal <b>650</b>. Current greater than the predetermined current may cause the fuse <b>144</b> to blow. More specifically, the conductive material of the fuse <b>144</b> evaporates (e.g., oxidizes) when the current is greater than the predetermined current. The conductive material of the fuse <b>144</b> and the dimensions of the fuse <b>144</b> may be configured to minimize the amount of residual conductive plasma that is present after the conductive material evaporates. The conductive material of the fuse <b>144</b> and the dimensions of the fuse <b>144</b> may be configured such that the predetermined current corresponds to the first breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is another example illustration of an example implementation of the isolation barrier <b>104</b> where the primary isolation barrier <b>134</b> is a capacitive isolation barrier. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>, the barrier output pad <b>152</b> may be connected to a conductor layer <b>904</b> through a conductive via <b>908</b>. A voltage of the conductor layer <b>904</b> may be a reference potential, such as one of the first and second reference potentials or a third, different reference potential.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A distance <b>912</b> between the first terminal <b>646</b> and the second terminal <b>650</b> may be configured such that at least a first predetermined distance (and at least the second breakdown voltage) is present when the fuse <b>144</b> is open. A distance <b>916</b> between the first terminal <b>646</b> and a conductor that is at the same reference potential as the second terminal <b>650</b> (e.g., the conductor layer <b>904</b>) may also be configured such that at least a second predetermined distance (and a third breakdown voltage that is greater than or equal to the second breakdown voltage) is present when the fuse <b>144</b> is open. The predetermined resistance may correspond to a resistance necessary to achieve electrical isolation at voltages that are less than the second breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a diagram of an example barrier state indication system is presented. A current sensor <b>1104</b> may be implemented in various implementations. The current sensor <b>1104</b> measures current flowing through the fuse <b>144</b> and generates a signal <b>1108</b> based on the current flowing through the fuse <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A barrier monitoring module <b>1112</b> determines an amount of current flowing through the fuse <b>144</b> based on the signal <b>1108</b>. The barrier monitoring module <b>1112</b> monitors the amount of current and may indicate a state of the isolation barrier <b>104</b> based on the amount of current. For example only, the barrier monitoring module <b>1112</b> may indicate that the isolation barrier <b>104</b> is in a non-functional state when the amount of current is approximately zero.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The barrier monitoring module <b>1112</b> may indicate that the isolation barrier <b>104</b> is in the non-functional state, for example, by illuminating an indicator lamp <b>1116</b>, generating a message on a display <b>1120</b>, and/or in another suitable manner. An indication that the isolation barrier <b>104</b> is in the non-functional state may indicate the chip of the isolation barrier <b>104</b> should be replaced.</p>
