<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an Internet-based method of, and system for, enabling the customers of banks, brokerage firms, insurers and other financial institutions the freedom to exercise the rights they possess as holders of money so that they can optimize the utility and value of their money, and capture interest on owned money where currently surrendered in global financial marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the State of Knowledge in the Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic representation of the conventional &#x201c;Uses of Money&#x201d; where the &#x201c;Specific Functions of Money&#x201d; represent the general purposes of money in an economic framework. The &#x201c;Specific Functions of Money&#x201d; include all uses of money, from its inception to the present day, and define money's role in local, national and global economies; all economies using any form of money incorporate some and/or all of these functions in their use(s) of money.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, taken together, set forth a schematic representation illustrating the various conventional uses of/for money in the marketplace, including, but not limited to: purchasing and paying for goods and services, investing, earning interest, lending, borrowing, storing as value, and gifting.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic representation illustrating the flow of money associated with conventional money transfer systems utilized in both physical money transfers and electronic money transfers in the global financial system. Money is transferred to another institution(s) and, at the end of the transfer period, the money and any accrued interest are transferred back to the owner of the money and/or the owner's bank or other financial institution.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consumers and businesses loose interest income, on money that belongs to them but, which, is held by financial intermediaries in areas like: mortgage escrow, payroll withholding, any type of stored value/prepaid product or device, bill payment, tax payment, consumer rebates, merchants' bank accounts, and any other area in which, a financial intermediary holds a consumer's or business's money and either pays no interest on those funds or pays a suboptimal interest rate/yield on those funds.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Owners of money have many options from which to choose when selecting a bank or other type of financial institution for depositing (and subsequently investing) their money. Most financial institution customers assume (and rightfully so) that there is a tremendous amount of time and effort involved in first trying to ascertain where the opportunities exist to earn higher interest rates/yields on their money and, second, in actively transferring their money into and back out of those institutions' accounts and products to capture the higher rates offered. Several internet sites have aggregated financial information for consumers, with Bankrate.com being the most popular and oft-cited of these sites. However, Bankrate.com does not offer any transactional capability leaving all of the actual transfer work to the consumer. Furthermore, even with advanced transfer systems like Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and the Automated Clearing House (ACH), there are time lags, ranging from a couple of days to longer, during which time, the consumer is not earning interest on the transferred monies as they are deemed &#x201c;in transit&#x201d; and unavailable for use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Due to the difficulties in finding better interest rates/yields and in transferring money, owners of money experience depositor/investor burnout (similar to mortgage burnout where mortgagees, after a certain period of time, cease searching for better mortgage rates, even though they exist in the marketplace, due to the amount of work involved) as they tire of seeking higher interest rates/yields and accept those, though almost always sub-optimal, offered by their &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution(s). Because of these factors, there is little incentive for the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution(s) to offer highly competitive interest rates and yields for their accounts and products.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Through cash management, or &#x201c;sweep&#x201d;, accounts, financial institutions &#x201c;sweep&#x201d; customers' unused, available monies into other accounts and products that enable the customers to earn higher interest rates and yields on their monies than if those monies were left in a standard account/product. But even though these customers are considered more sophisticated than the average financial institution customer, recent evidence suggests that many financial institutions haven't been paying the appropriate (or advertised) rates on these accounts and products. (&#x201c;Investors Get Shortchanged on Interest&#x201d;, The Wall Street Journal, Feb. 15, 2005, p. D1 and &#x201c;Savings: Sweep Yields Can Make You Weep&#x201d;, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, May 2005, p. 92).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Many recent articles have highlighted the problems financial institution customers encounter when seeking higher interest rates/yields on their money. The article &#x201c;Wall Street Cuts Yields on Investors' Cash&#x201d; (The Wall Street Journal, Aug. 31, 2005, p. D1) states, &#x201c;In a development that hurts investors, brokerage firms are quietly moving their clients' cash from money market mutual funds&#x2014;the traditional default option&#x2014;into lower-yielding bank accounts.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There have been many attempts, through new technologies, to address these financial industry shortcomings. A brief review of the following U.S. Patents and Publications will provide a good overview of the state of knowledge in the art attempting to address the various problems recognized in the fields of finance, banking and investment management: U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,868,408 (Rosen), 6,609,113 (O'Leary, et al), 6,324,525 (Kramer, et al), 6,304,860 (Martin, et al), 6,240,399 (Frank, et al), 6,233,566 (Levine, et al), 6,112,189 (Rickard, et al), 6,049,782 (Gottesman, et al), 6,021,397 (Jones, et al), 5,933,817 (Hucal), 5,924,082 (Silverman, et al), 5,911,135 (Atkins), 5,852,811 (Atkins), 5,839,118 (Ryan, et al), 5,832,461 (Leon, et al), 5,297,026 (Hoffman), 5,082,275 (Nilssen), 4,751,640 (Lucas, et al), 4,507,745 (Agrawal), 20040153403 (Sadre), 20040044632 (Onn, Liav, et al), 30030236726 (Almonte, et al), 20030212641 (Johnson), 20030097331 (Cohen), 20030070080 (Rosen), 20020185529 (Cooper), 20020116331 (Cataline, et al), 20020091635 (Venkatachari, et al), 20020087461 (Ganesan, et al), 20020022966 (Horgan), and 20020013767 (Katz), each incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Finally, opening multiple accounts at multiple financial institutions to seek higher yields for cash is a very time-consuming, onerous process that requires a potential customer to read through complex and lengthy documents specific to each financial institution, submit all personal information numerous times, and to file reports from each financial institution regarding interest income earned annually with state and federal tax authorities.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of all of the aforementioned shortcomings, deficiencies and inefficiencies that exist in the local, national and global financial marketplaces, there is still a great need in the art for an improved method of and system for solving the problem(s) of surrendered interest-capturing opportunities in modern society, while avoiding the shortcomings and drawbacks of the prior art apparatus and methodologies heretofore known.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another object of the present invention is to provide a MRTS network that recognizes and accounts for an unbundled and individually transferable set of monetary rights associated with an amount of money held in a first account at the home financial institution and possessed by the owner/holder, wherein the unbundled and individually transferable set of monetary rights (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)) are selected from the group consisting of a monetary right to invest ((R (&#x3b1;, $)), a monetary right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)), a monetary right to use as collateral (R (&#x3c7;, $)), a monetary right hold money as a store of value (R (&#x3b4;, $)), a monetary right to make purchases (R (&#x3b5;, $)), a monetary right to make payments (R (&#x3c6;, $)), a monetary right to lend (R (&#x3b3;, $)), a monetary right to borrow (R (&#x3b7;, $)), and a monetary right to gift (R (&#x3b9;, $)).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another object of the present invention is to allow the owner/holder of the amount of money to transfer from a first financial institution account to a second financial institution (interest bearing) account, a subset of the monetary rights represented by the whole or partial value of money held in the first financial institution account, while a non-transferred subset of monetary rights associated with the value of money remain in the first account and serve as full, non-leveraged collateral for the subset of transferred monetary rights.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another object of the present invention is to allow the owner/holder of the amount of money to earn an amount of interest on the value of transferred monetary rights while the owner/holder of the amount of money enjoys full use of the value of money held in a first account and represented by the non-transferred subset of monetary rights associated with the amount of money held in the first account.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another object of the present invention is to provide an Internet-based method and system for monetary rights transfer (MRT), wherein the customers of financial and non-financial institutions are afforded the opportunity to freely transfer monetary rights which the system recognizes such customers possessing as owners, holders (fiduciary), and borrowers of money (e.g. the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) or other monetary rights) between various institutions and also within their own institutions, so as to take advantage of better rates and yields available in the financial marketplace.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another object of the present invention is to provide an Internet-based method and system of monetary rights transfer (MRT), wherein, in situations where other entities collect monies for future payments on behalf of an individual or business, the rightful owner of the money is able to benefit from the transfer and/or use of such monetary rights and captures earned interest on such monetary rights until such payments are effected.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Referring now to the figures in the accompanying Drawings, the illustrative embodiments of the present invention will now be described in great technical detail, wherein like parts are indicated by like reference numbers.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview of the Method of Monetary Rights Transfer According to the Principles of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, there is presented an important set of equations that formally recognizes a broad set of monetary rights, possessed by an owner of any amount of money, that can be separated into individual rights (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)) and effectively transferred in the marketplace in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As will be described in great detail hereinafter, the transfer of individual monetary rights, or subsets of monetary rights, is carried out using the Internet-based Monetary Rights Transfer (MRT) Network of the present invention which recognizes and ensures that the above-identified set of individual rights is divisible, and each individual right is transferable, alone or in subsets, on the MRT Network (MRTN), in a non-mutually exclusive manner, so as to maximize the utility and value of money in the global marketplace. Such divisibility of rights is akin to the bundle of rights possessed through ownership of land, including rights pertaining to minerals, timber, agriculture, riparian rights, surface and ground water, air, and development, to name the most common rights.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Overview of Internet-Based MRT Network of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the Internet-based MRT Network of the present invention represents a significant improvement on the &#x201c;Conventional Money Transfer Systems&#x201d; as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this figure, the MRT Network is shown transferring only the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) possessed by an owner of money, from a &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution to either an &#x201c;external&#x201d; institution(s) or internally within the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution's accounts and products, in order to allow the owner to receive a better rate/yield at an &#x201c;external&#x201d; institution than that offered at the owner's &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution, while all other monetary rights within the bundle {R(&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;)} possessed by the holder of money remain at the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution, serving as full, non-levered collateral for the transferred monetary right, and available for full utilization by the holder, thereby allowing the holder to maximize the utility of the money held in the global marketplace, in accordance with the principles of the present invention. For the purpose of the present invention, an &#x201c;external&#x201d; bank or financial institution is defined as any other bank or financial institution to which a user of the MRT Network and methods, described herein, might transfer monies and investments, either manually or automatically and, either through an actual transfer of a user's monies or investments or through a transfer of one or more of the user's monetary rights&#x2014;as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the monetary right to earn interest, which constitutes a transfer of the right to earn interest associated with a user's monies and investments, but not the user's actual monies and/or investments.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the Internet-based MRT Network of the present invention utilizes one or more Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems, within the global financial marketplace whereby, various RTGS systems, utilizing the MRT Network, are linked to other RTGS systems, also utilizing the MRT Network, via the Internet, allowing MRT Network users in various countries around the world to effect monetary right(s) transfers with other RTGS systems.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the MRT Network Universal Financial Institution Account Opening Process, which allows an MRT Network User to open multiple accounts at financial institutions participating on the MRT Network. This process involves providing all relevant personal or business financial information at once, with the participating financial institutions agreeing to a universal account opening form, that includes all pertinent user financial information and universal legalese required to open a financial account at each financial institution participating within the MRT Network. A participating financial institution, for the purposes of the present invention, is defined as any financial institution that has the ability to transact over one or more RTGS systems, any financial institution that has access to one or more RTGS systems via another financial institution that has the ability to transact over one or more RTGS systems, or any non-financial institution that has access to one or more RTGS systems via another financial institution that has the ability to transact over one or more RTGS systems. Various financial institutions, each of which includes enterprise level computer networks (ELCN), are shown linked to the MRT Network, also supported by an ELCN, via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">In general, each ELCN comprises packet-switched routers, switches, gateways, and other data-packet networking components, systems and devices, as well as Web (HTTP), application (JAVA) and database (SQL) servers, and numerous Internet-enabled client systems, configured and distributed throughout the enterprise, in a manner well known in the computer, networking and communication arts.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the MRT Network is also linked, via the Internet, to the ELCN's of all of the various state and federal regulatory agencies, that oversee all facets of banking in the United States and, which, have similar counterparts in other global financial systems.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when an MRT Network User populates the MRT Network Account Opening form on the MRT Network graphic user interface (GUI) page, the MRT Network forwards the pertinent information to all of the various regulatory agencies to assure that an MRT Network User opening a universal account providing access to all participating financial institutions' accounts, is not doing so for the purpose of money laundering or terror financing and that the MRT Network User reports all earned interest income for tax purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the MRT Network Universal Account Opening process, through which an MRT Network User populates a graphic user interface (GUI) page, which allows the MRT Network to collect all relevant personal (or business) information related to the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank account(s), which will allow the MRT Network User to open an MRT Network universal account providing instant access to all financial institutions' financial accounts and products that participate on the MRT Network. Importantly, the MRT Network User is required to read and check a box that acknowledges that the MRT Network User has read the standardized legalese to which, all participating financial institutions have agreed.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> details the various steps included in the MRT Network Universal Financial Account Opening Process.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the Internet-based MRT Network of the present invention is shown comprising various enterprise-level computer information systems and supporting global financial information services, for each ELCN-based financial institution recognized as a participating financial institution on MRT Network (e.g. banks, thrifts, brokers, insurers, mortgage companies, payroll services companies, billing companies, prepaid product/device issuers, and other institutions including the Federal Reserve Bank, US Treasury Department, State Banking Regulators, IRS, SEC, FDIC, et al).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">As shown, each of these enterprise-level information management and transaction supporting systems is integrated with the information infrastructure and services of the MRT Network, including its web, application and database (RDBMS) servers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref>) configured according to a multi-tier network architecture supported with packet-switched firewall, switch and router technology well known in the networking communications art.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, web, application and database servers at each node in the MRT Network cooperate so as to support and deliver the various suites of information services on the MRT Network, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 through 29B</figref>. Among such services are the interest-capturing service (ICS) of the present invention, wherein a system-user (i.e. account holder) is capable of transferring one (or more) of his or her monetary rights (i.e. the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) associated with money ownership) to one or more participating financial institutions registered on the MRT Network to earn interest on such transferred monetary right(s).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As will be described in greater detail hereinafter, this service involves each ELCN-based financial institution recognized as a participating financial institution on the MRT Network, and offering a ICS-enabled financial product or service, to automatically feed (to the MRT Network's information servers) various kinds of time-varying information relating to interest rates/yields, accounts and products, and other information relevant to helping a system user make investment decisions with regard to interest right(s) transfers.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an owner of money that has established an account within a &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution is also an MRT Network accountholder. As shown, the MRT Network's servers (which are mirrored at various locations around the globe) receive, via the Internet's IP infrastructure, rate/yield, account/product, and other information fed to the MRT Network's databases by all participating financial institutions. At the end of the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer period, which may be determined by the accountholder or by the MRT Network based upon the MRT Network User's pre-specified instructions (automated mode), the accountholder's transferred monetary rights R (&#x3b2;, $)+/&#x2212;earned interest (i) may then be either returned to the bank account at the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution, or may be transferred on to another &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution. Even if the accountholder chooses to transfer the R (&#x3b2;, $) to another institution, the accountholder can choose to transfer the accrued interest (i) along with the R (&#x3b2;, $) either to another &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution or back to the MRT Network accountholder's account(s) at the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution. At the end of the monetary right(s) transfer process R (&#x3b2;, $)+(i) is returned to the MRT Network accountholder's account(s) at the accountholder's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">However, should the MRTN system user, who originally transferred the monetary right(s), then go out and utilize the remaining monetary rights, held by the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution, the MRT Network will recall/cancel a commensurate amount of the transferred monetary rights instantaneously and, which, is required to make the system user's transaction good. Monetary rights associated with any funds transferred over the network to a party to support a transaction can, at any time, be automatically terminated over the network by any utilization of the remaining rights associated with the monetary amount held. For example, one or more monetary rights transferred i.e., the right to invest, over the network to a recognized participating financial institution, will earn interest for the owner until the owner chooses to utilize the non-transferred right(s) (in whole or in part) for any other uses such as payments, purchases, cash withdrawals, and any other transactions drawn on a demand account, and upon such alternative use, the right to invest will be automatically terminated with the &#x201c;receiver&#x201d; of the monetary rights transfer, and the associated monetary value of such alternative use(s) will be subtracted from the account maintained within the MRT Network.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Cash Deposit Requirements of Participating Financial Institutions Registered on the MRT Network of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In much the same manner as banks and other financial institutions account for derivatives, participating banks and financial institutions will have to maintain adequate reserves (Cash ($)) to facilitate the monetary right(s) transfer process. Presently, banks are required to hold a certain percentage of their total assets as reserves (reserve requirements) in order to assure their financial health and to demonstrate their liquidity. While there are minimum reserve requirements required by the Federal Reserve Bank and other financial regulatory authorities, for the purposes of describing the present invention, the reserve requirement is defined as the bank's or financial institution's &#x201c;Preferred Capital Ratio&#x201d; (PCR), as each institution may decide, above the Federal Reserve Bank-mandated minimum reserve requirement, what its preferred capital ratio will be. While holding these reserves, banks try to invest (lend, purchase securities, etc.) the remainder of the funds in order to earn a return higher than that which they are paying out to their depositors and investors in interest, dividends, etc. Transferring funds under this regime is straightforward; cash (CASH, $) moves, primarily by electronic means. Thus as an investor transfers cash or electronic money out of a &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank or financial institution to an &#x201c;external&#x201d; bank or financial institution, the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank or financial institution is no longer required to reserve against those funds, as they are no longer domiciled within the institution from which they were transferred. But, due to a physical or electronic transfer of funds out of a &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank or financial institution, the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank or financial institution may be required to sell investments or loan out less money in order to satisfy the aforementioned reserve requirements as there are fewer total assets against which to lend, invest, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Internally, within the MRT Network of the present invention, the right(s) transfer processes (notably the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $))), participating &#x201c;home&#x201d; banks and financial institutions may have to hold a portion of reserves (Cash ($)) against which such monetary right(s) transfers are made. However, this process represents a vast improvement for the &#x201c;home&#x201d; banks and financial institutions. In cases where the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) (and/or other monetary rights) is being transferred out of the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank or financial institution, even though the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution must reserve against these monies as they are held, and it may have to liquidate investments, call loans, etc., if the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) is transferred to another MRT Network participant similar to a wholesale transfer of funds out of the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution, as opposed to a wholesale transfer of funds to another institution, the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution still holds the remaining set of rights {R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $)}, which serves as full, non-leveraged collateral for the transferred monetary right(s) and, which, the retained customer can utilize via the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution's accounts and products.

This EDI-based process effectively credits the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank Account, with a monetary value (MV) equal to the corresponding monetary rights transfer, while debiting the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank Account with a monetary value (MV) equal to the corresponding monetary rights transfer. This corresponding credit to the external financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank Account ensures that the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution can lend cash (CASH, $) to a third party, or can invest cash (CASH, $), for the purpose of earning a return on the loaned/invested funds so as to allow the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution to pay interest on the transferred monetary right(s).</p>

<p id="p-0213" num="0212">It is appropriate at this juncture to provide a more detailed example of the monetary rights and credit/debit transfer process supported on the RTGS-enabled MRT Network described above.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">First, each participating financial institution on the MRT Network must maintain an account with the Federal Reserve Bank (i.e. a Federal Reserve Bank account). Also, each participating financial institution must be registered with the MRT Network. When a monetary right(s) transfer occurs, such as the right to earn interest, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution to which the monetary right(s) (in this case, the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $))) is being transferred receives notice from the MRT Network of the present invention that it has received the monetary right(s) transfer, while the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution receives notice from the MRT Network of the present invention that the monetary right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) has been transferred from it. Coincident with those two messages, the MRT Network of the present invention also notifies the Federal Reserve Bank of the monetary right(s) transfer and that there is sufficient collateral, in the form of the remaining subset of non-transferred monetary rights still residing at the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution, (R (&#x3b1;, $))&#x2212;(R (&#x3b2;, $)), to fully collateralize the monetary right(s) transfer. Via the Fedwire infrastructure, the Federal Reserve Bank then debits the Federal Reserve Bank Account of the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution and credits the Federal Reserve Bank Account of the MRT user's &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution, for the monetary value (i.e. amount) of the monetary right(s) transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">At this point, the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution may have to liquidate its investment(s) in the amount of the monetary right to earn interest ((R (&#x3b2;, $)) transfer or, up to the amount of the Federal Reserve's debit/the bank's preferred capital ratio (PCR) depending upon the amount invested, in order to satisfy the MRT user's request to transfer the monetary right(s) and/or, the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution may have to cancel loans in the amount of the monetary right to earn interest ((R (&#x3b2;, $)), or up to the amount of the Fed debit/the bank's preferred capital ratio (PCR) depending upon the amount lent, in order to satisfy the MRT user's request to transfer the monetary right(s).</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Importantly, for a &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution from which the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) (or other monetary rights) have been transferred, the transferred right(s) is &#x201c;dead&#x201d; to the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution, but the transferor (MRT Network User) still has the remaining subset of now &#x201c;dormant&#x201d; rights {R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;(R (&#x3b2;, $)} residing at the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution&#x2014;monetary right(s) that cannot be utilized by the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution for lending or investing but, which, can be activated/exercised by the MRT Network User during the transfer process by utilizing one, or more, of the non-transferred monetary rights. Economic value is still maintained by the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution due to the fact that the monetary right(s) transfer process allows the &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution to keep a customer as opposed to losing a customer to another financial institution.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic representation of the Internet-based MRT Network of the present invention, showing the Federal Reserve Bank Accounts of home and external financial institutions' being debited and credited by the Fedwire&#xae; RTGS system whenever a MRT Network user transfers one (or more) of the individual monetary right(s) over the MRT Network. In this illustrative example, the transferred monetary right is the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) associated with money ownership and, which, is fully collateralized by the remaining, non-transferred subset of monetary rights residing at the user's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution. Once a participating financial institution's account maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank has been credited with the dollar amount of the monetary right(s) transfer, the financial institution is then able to go out and lend or invest cash (CASH, $) in the amount of the monetary right(s) transfer or up to an amount that is consistent with the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution's PCR. Similarly, when a participating financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank-maintained account has been debited for the dollar amount of the monetary right(s) transfer from that financial institution, that financial institution's ability to lend and/or invest cash (CASH, $) in the amount of the monetary right(s) transfer, or up to an amount that is consistent with the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution's PCR has been truncated.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Importantly, while the above illustrative example is for the case of a single monetary right(s) transfer on the MRT Network of the present invention and involves a single credit and debit, via the Fedwire RTGS EDI messaging system (for the purpose of lending and/or investing cash in the amount of the monetary right(s) transfer), to the receiving financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank-maintained account (and debit to the sending financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank-maintained account), it is understood that the MRT Network accounting system can be utilized to facilitate thousands of transfers simultaneously and/or throughout the course of the day through the process of aggregating monetary right(s) transfers and netting the dollar amounts of those transfers between the various participating financial institutions prior to a Fedwire transfer; netting is commonly used in the financial world to settle multiple transactions simultaneously and helps to reduce the costs and number of those transactions. The MRT Network of the present invention can perform, and account for, thousands of monetary right(s) transfers between multiple accounts at multiple financial institutions, and can report each monetary right transfer, along with the appropriate collateral, in the form of the non-transferred subset of monetary rights, to the Federal Reserve Bank, but for the purpose of debiting and crediting the Federal Reserve Bank-maintained accounts of those multiple financial institutions, the MRT Network's monetary right(s) transfers can be netted so that each financial institution's Federal Reserve Bank-maintained account is debited/credited a minimum amount of times, for the netted dollar amount of transferred monetary right(s), via the Fedwire RTGS EDI messaging system. As mentioned previously, no cash moves in the Fedwire RTGS, but the netted dollar amounts of the monetary right(s) transfers are reflected as credits and debits to participating financial institutions' Federal Reserve Bank-maintained accounts.</p>

<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The process of transferring ((R (&#x3b2;, $))+i) back to the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution begins with a MRT Network Fedwire EDI message (MRT Network Fedwire EDI message <b>134</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37B</figref>, employed to notify the MRT Network of the present invention, by the MRT Network User, of the request to transfer back the monetary right(s) in transfer plus the accrued interest income ((R (&#x3b2;, $))+i), back to the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution from the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A</figref>.</p>

Again, because the Fedwire system is a real-time gross settlement system, the total amount of the transfer&#x2014;in this case the $5,000 monetary right to earn interest ((R (&#x3b2;, $5,000)) plus the cash interest earned (i) of $77.50) at the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution&#x2014;can be transferred via Fedwire with no actual money moving but, instead, each financial institution's accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank being debited/credited accordingly. This process is also reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 &#x26; 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">Once the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution that had initially received the credit to its Federal Reserve Bank-maintained account via the initial monetary right(s) transfer receives notice from the MRT Network of the monetary right(s) plus earned interest ((R (&#x3b2;, $))+i) transfer request back to the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x201d; financial institution, the &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institution, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> (STEP &#x201c;H&#x201d;), either liquidates it investments or cancels its outstanding loans in the amount of the monetary right(s) transfer plus accrued interest income ((R (&#x3b2;, $))+i) transfer request in order to facilitate their transfer back to the MRT Network User's &#x201c;home&#x2019; financial institution via the MRT Network or liquidates it investments or cancels its outstanding loans up to the amount of the Fed debit/the bank's preferred capital ratio (PCR).</p>

<p id="p-0347" num="0346">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the Manual Transfer Process (Method &#x201c;A&#x201d;) of the present invention, includes three different kinds of processes by which an accountholder on the MRT Network can manually transfer ones right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) namely: the &#x201c;Manual Unrestricted&#x201d; Method; the &#x201c;Manual Semi-Restricted&#x201d; Method; and the &#x201c;Manual Restricted&#x201d; Method.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, when using the &#x201c;Manual Unrestricted&#x201d; Method, the accountholder selects from among the ranked institutions' accounts and products every time the accountholder accesses the system. The accountholder then selects from among the participating institutions' accounts and products and manually effects the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) receiving confirmation from the MRT Network of the completed transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">When using the &#x201c;Manual Semi-Restricted&#x201d; Method, the MRT Network notifies an accountholder (via email or other method) of better rate/yield opportunities available to the accountholder and to which, the accountholder can transfer the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)). After such system notification, the accountholder then selects from among either the opportunities of which the system notified the accountholder or, from the ranked institutions' accounts and products, and effects the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) manually. The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">When using the &#x201c;Manual Restricted&#x201d; Method, the MRT Network ranks institutions' rate(s)/yield(s) accounts and products based on an accountholder's pre-specified transfer criteria. The accountholder then manually selects from among the ranked, displayed options and effects the manual transfer of right to earn interest (REI) (R (&#x3b2;, $)). The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">As indicated at Block A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, the accountholder receives updated rates supplied by participating financial institutions recognized as members on the MRT Network, along with other information about accounts and products. At Block B, the accountholder manually selects one or more institutions/accounts to which to transfer R (&#x3b2;, $), reviews choices and summary, and then if in agreement, clicks TRANSFER icon on a control panel so as to effect the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer. At Block C, the MRT Network then effects R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) and informs accountholder of the transfer details including the amount of R (&#x3b2;, $) transferred, institutions and accounts of transfers, rate/yields, time periods(s), if any, etc. At Block D, the MRT Network then displays the accountholder's new accounts status which includes all institutions and accounts/products with pertinent details that holds accountholder's full set of monetary rights (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $) and all institutions and accounts/products to which accountholder's monetary right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) has been transferred along with all pertinent account/product details. This method is particularly suited for those accountholders who wish to exercise a high degree of control over all aspects of REI transfer.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">&#x201c;Accountholder-Specified Criteria&#x201d; REI Transfer Processes According to the Present Invention (Method B)</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29B</figref>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>A<b>1</b>, <b>48</b>A<b>2</b>, <b>48</b>A<b>3</b>, <b>48</b>B, <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B, the REI Transfer Method &#x201c;B&#x201d; will be described in greater detail.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the Accountholder-Specified Criteria REI Transfer Process (Method &#x201c;B&#x201d;) of the present invention, includes six different kinds of processes by which an accountholder on the MRT Network can manually transfer one's right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) namely: &#x201c;Manual Restricted&#x201d; Method; &#x201c;Manual Semi-Restricted&#x201d; Method; &#x201c;Manual Unrestricted&#x201d; Method; &#x201c;Automatic Restricted&#x201d; Method; &#x201c;Automatic Semi-Restricted&#x201d; Method; and the &#x201c;Automatic Unrestricted&#x201d; Method. In each method shown, the accountholder pre-specifies criteria that determine how the MRT Network of the present invention will rank and display institutions' accounts and products based on factors ranked by the accountholder. Establishing (and updating) R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer criteria requires an accountholder to rank variables related to participating institutions' accounts and products, and to the accountholder's own interests including, but not limited to, interest rates/yields, safety and credit ratings, deposit insurance afforded, transfer frequency, types of accounts/products, specific types of institutions, specific institutions, tax treatment, duration, fees, charges and penalties, local, national and/or international institutions, and establishment of various idiosyncratic formulas for governing transfers. The MRT Network will rank and display R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer opportunities among participating institutions based on an accountholder's rankings. An accountholder can employ multiple rankings of transfer criteria to further diversify transfer opportunities. Furthermore, this process is not limited only to transfers of the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)), but is applicable to any of the other individual, separable rights possessed by an owner of money.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Once the accountholder has established the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer criteria, there are then at least six different iterations of the Accountholder-Specified Criteria REI Transfer Process that an MRT Network accountholder may employ.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, when using the &#x201c;Manual Restricted&#x201d; Method, the accountholder pre-specifies criteria (highest rate/yield, credit, local, etc.), based upon only accounts and products offered by institutions in the accountholder's &#x201c;Preferred Partner Network&#x201d; (PPN) that the accountholder deems important with regard to effecting an REI transfer. The MRT Network then ranks and displays institutions' accounts and products based on the accountholder's pre-specified transfer criteria. The accountholder then selects from among the ranked and displayed accounts and products and effects the REI transfer(s) manually via the system of the present invention. The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">When utilizing the &#x201c;Manual Semi-Restricted&#x201d; transfer option on the MRT Network, the accountholder, having pre-specified REI transfer criteria, is shown only institutions' accounts and products from institutions on the accountholder's institutions list. These institutions' accounts and products are ranked and displayed based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria. The accountholder then selects from among the ranked products and accounts and effects the REI transfer(s) manually via the MRT Network of the present invention. The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">The MRT Network accountholder, when using the &#x201c;Manual Unrestricted&#x201d; Method, has all registered institutions' accounts and products ranked and displayed based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria. The accountholder then selects from among the ranked products and accounts and effects the REI transfer(s) manually via the MRT Network of the present invention. The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">Prior to utilizing any of the automated REI transfer options provided by the MRT Network, the accountholder has to elect to give the MRT Network the authority to make automated transfers on the accountholder's behalf.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">When using the &#x201c;Automatic Restricted&#x201d; Method, the MRT Network continually ranks only those institutions' accounts and products that are included in the accountholder's PPN, based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria. The MRT Network of the present invention then effects REI transfers automatically, with the frequency of the REI transfers pre-determined by the accountholder's pre-specifications. The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">When using the &#x201c;Automatic Semi-Restricted&#x201d; Method, only institutions' accounts and products on the accountholder's preferred institutions list are continually ranked by the MRT Network based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria. Based upon the desired REI transfer frequency, as indicated by the accountholder in the &#x201c;REI Transfer Frequency Filter&#x201d; control panel (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref>), the MRT Network automatically effects REI transfers on the accountholder's behalf.

At Block C, the accountholder has pre-specified REI transfer criteria by which the MRT Network databases will rank participating financial institutions and their accounts and products. At Block D, the MRT Network accountholder, in the manual iterations of Method &#x201c;B&#x201d;, chooses an institution(s) and account(s)/product(s) from MRT-ranked institutions and accounts/products based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria. At Block E, the MRT Network displays all information pertinent to the accountholder's chosen institution(s) and account(s)/product(s) to which to transfer the accountholder's right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)); if the accountholder agrees with the displayed information, then the accountholder clicks the &#x201c;TRANSFER&#x201d; icon to effect a manual transfer of the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)). At Block F in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49B</figref>, the accountholder receives confirmation of the transferred R (&#x3b2;, $), the names of the institutions' account(s)/product(s) to which the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) has been transferred, and all of the pertinent information with regard to the account(s)/product(s) including: rate(s)/yield(s), time periods (if any), etc. At Block G, the MRT Network then displays the accountholder's new accounts status including existing institutions and accounts/products' R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $), accounts from which R (&#x3b2;, $) has been transferred (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $)), and accounts to which R (&#x3b2;, $) has been transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">Notably, for the automatic REI transfer iterations of Method &#x201c;B&#x201d;, Blocks A-C are the same as in the manual iterations; however, Block D and Block E will consist of the MRT Network effecting the REI transfer automatically on the MRT Network accountholder's behalf based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria.

Furthermore, the system would provide to the user's &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution(s) the opportunity to match or beat a competing offer even after the user's monetary right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) had been transferred to an &#x201c;external&#x201d; institution(s). In such a case, the user would be apprised of the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution's offer and would then have the option as to whether or not to accept said offer. The &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution would then facilitate (pay) for any transfer costs associated with transferring the system user's monetary right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) back to the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0369">Another benefit to banks' and other participating financial institutions' participation is that they may be able to provide their customers with higher rates of interest through a right-of-first-refusal option (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71A-D</figref> and <b>72</b>) whereby the &#x201c;home&#x201d; or &#x201c;external&#x201d; bank(s) holding the system user's monies would have the opportunity to improve its own terms or, match or beat other offers from any other banks or financial institutions before the system user's monetary right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) is transferred to other institutions. This would allow any bank or participating financial institution to compete on an individualized basis for a system user's monies as opposed to offering the same rate to the universe of potential customers. A bank might be willing to match or beat an offer from a competitor if it thought it might be able to sell the system user other, more lucrative, financial products and services. Obviously, banks offering higher rates of interest are trying to attract additional monies to their accounts and products. As an example, ABC Bank, which may offer a full range of banking and other financial products and services, may not be able to offer optimal interest rates on a range of accounts and instruments due to its high overhead and fixed costs. XYZ Bank may only offer checking, savings, CD's and other accounts on which it can pay much higher, or even optimal, interest rates because it doesn't have high overhead and fixed costs. Through use of the system of the invention, ABC Bank's customers can receive higher rates on their monies and investments at ABC Bank if ABC Bank chooses to match or beat XYZ Bank's (or any other bank's or institution's offer(s)) through the system's right-of-first-refusal feature.</p>

The MRT Network accountholder begins by pre-establishing R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer criteria based on select institutions (or select accounts/products) with whom (which) the accountholder prefers to conduct all R (&#x3b2;, $) transfers via the MRT Network.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0372">The accountholder then pre-specifies, via PPN control panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>, to make a PPN criteria (Method &#x201c;C&#x201d;) REI transfer and has an option of picking between five separate iterations of this R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer process.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">The first is the &#x201c;Manual Restricted&#x201d; iteration, by which an accountholder, after having logged-in to the MRT Network, requests rankings of only pre-chosen institutions' accounts and products based on pre-specified REI transfer criteria. Only institutions' accounts/products (or accounts/products) in the accountholder's PPN are ranked and displayed based on an accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria. The accountholder then selects from among the displayed ranked choices and effect an R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) manually.

The MRT Network then notifies the accountholder, via the accountholder's preferred contact method of a transfer(s) opportunity, and the accountholder then selects and effects the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer manually from the MRT Network ranked and displayed institutions' accounts/products (or accounts/products). The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">In the &#x201c;Automatic Restricted&#x201d; R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer iteration of Method &#x201c;C&#x201d;, all participating PPN institutions' accounts/products that meet the accountholder's pre-specified R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer criteria are ranked by the MRT Network. Then, based on pre-approval to make automatic REI transfers given by the accountholder in the control panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, the MRT Network effects the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer automatically on behalf of the accountholder.

<p id="p-0377" num="0376">In the &#x201c;Manual Unrestricted&#x201d; R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer iteration, only institutions' accounts/products in the accountholder's PPN are ranked based not on the MRT Network accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria, but on MRT Network-specified REI transfer criteria. The accountholder then chooses from among the MRT Network-ranked PPN accounts/products and effects the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer manually. The accountholder then receives confirmation, via the accountholder's preferred means, of the completed REI transfer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">Finally, in the &#x201c;Automatic Unrestricted&#x201d; R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer process, all participating, registered PPN institutions' accounts/products that meet the MRT Network's R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer criteria are ranked by the MRT Network. The MRT Network, having received accountholder pre-approval via the control panel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref>, then effects the R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) automatically on behalf of the MRT Network accountholder.

<p id="p-0381" num="0380">After securely logging-in to the MRT Network, the MRT Network accountholder is presented with a screen (FIG. <b>51</b>A<b>1</b>) that shows the accountholder's existing institutions' accounts and products, existing balances, and the amount available for interest right (R (&#x3b2;, $)) transfer(s). From this screen the MRT Network accountholder chooses from which accounts to transfer the accountholder's REI. (In the automatic transfer iterations, the accountholder will pre-choose from which accounts the MRT Network will effect automatic REI transfers on the accountholder's behalf).</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">FIG. <b>51</b>A<b>2</b> shows a screen that provides an MRT Network accountholder's Preferred Partner Network (PPN) institutions, as pre-chosen by the MRT Network accountholder.</p>

In the automated iterations of Method &#x201c;C&#x201d;, the accountholder doesn't receive the PPN institutions' accounts/products rankings, as the MRT Network either utilizes the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria, or that REI transfer criteria proprietary to the MRT Network, to effect REI transfers.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">As indicated in Block A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52A</figref>, an MRT Network accountholder securely logs-in to the MRT Network and chooses to make an R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s).

At Block C the MRT Network displays an accountholder's ranked, pre-specified, PPN institutions and their accounts/products (or accounts/products). The accountholder then chooses institution(s) and account(s)/products (or account(s)/product(s) to which to transfer the accountholder&#x201d; REI (R (&#x3b2;, $)). At Block D the MRT Network then displays the accountholder's REI transfer choices, including all pertinent institution(s) and account(s)/product(s) (or account(s)/product(s)). If the MRT Network accountholder agrees with the displayed information, then the accountholder clicks the &#x201c;TRANSFER&#x201d; icon to effect transfer(s) of the accountholder's REI (R (&#x3b2;, $)) to the chosen institution(s) and account(s)/product(s) (or account(s)/product(s)) within the accountholder's PPN. At Block E in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52B</figref>, the accountholder then receives confirmation of the transferred R (&#x3b2;, $), institution(s) and account(s)/product(s) to which the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) has been transferred, and all relevant information relating to rates/yields, time periods (if any), etc. At Block F, the MRT Network then displays the accountholder's new accounts status including existing institutions and accounts/products R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $), accounts from which the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) has been transferred (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $)), and accounts to which the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) has been transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">Notably, for the automatic REI transfer iterations of Method &#x201c;C&#x201d;, the Blocks A-C are the same as in the manual iterations; however, Block D will consist of the MRT Network effecting the REI transfer automatically on the MRT Network accountholder's behalf based on the accountholder's pre-specified REI transfer criteria or, on the MRT Network's REI transfer criteria.

<p id="p-0443" num="0442">As an employee earns periodic paychecks (or other compensation like bonuses, etc.) from an employer, either the employer or a payroll service provider (collectively the &#x201c;benefits administrator&#x201d;) withholds monies from each paycheck for various taxes, insurance premium payments, etc., on behalf of the employee. These monies are held in escrow by the &#x201c;benefits administrator&#x201d; until such payments are due, allowing the &#x201c;benefits administrator&#x201d; to earn interest on monies legally belonging to the employee until such payments are effected on the employee's behalf.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">This process will allow an employee, having previously supplied all relevant employment information (FIG. <b>67</b>B<b>1</b>) and appropriate authorization to the MRT Network (FIG. <b>67</b>B<b>2</b>), to transfer the R (&#x3b2;, $) on the employee's/accountholder's monies held in escrow by the &#x201c;benefits administrator&#x201d;. Once the MRT Network accountholder authorizes the transfer of R (&#x3b2;, $) on these monies (FIG. <b>67</b>B<b>2</b>), the MRT Network notifies the &#x201c;benefits administrator&#x201d; of the transfer and effects the transfer, based on the accountholder's (or MRT Network's) pre-specified transfer criteria, by transferring the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) to any participating institution(s) (FIG. <b>67</b>B<b>3</b>). The accountholder then receives a message confirming the right transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">The accountholder then sees, in FIG. <b>67</b>C<b>1</b>, the &#x201c;Account Status (NEW)&#x201d; screen. The accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer remains in effect until an individual payment on behalf of the employee/accountholder is due. On the due date of an individual payment, the accountholder's transferred R (&#x3b2;, $) is reduced (or cancelled) commensurately with the payment amount; any accrued interest can remain in transfer or be returned to the accountholder's MRT Network account(s). This activity is reflected in the &#x201c;Transaction Log&#x201d; (FIG. <b>67</b>C<b>2</b>). This allows the employee's/accountholder's transferred R (&#x3b2;, $) to be returned to the &#x201c;benefits administrator&#x201d; to effect &#x201c;full&#x201d; payment on the employee's behalf, yet allows the employee/accountholder to earn interest on all monies up until the due date of each individual payment made for the employee's benefit.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">As in previous examples, the MRT Network provides the accountholder with an &#x201c;Accounts Status (NEW)&#x201d; screen (FIG. <b>67</b>C<b>3</b>) allowing the accountholder to track items such as account/product balances, right(s) transfers, payments and payment dates, interest earned, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0448" num="0447">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68A and 68B</figref>, at Block A, an MRT Network accountholder/employee works for an employer that either manages the employee's benefits payments (salary, taxes, insurance, etc.) or outsources these services to a payroll services provider/administrator that manages employee benefits and makes the aforementioned payments for the benefit of the accountholder/employee. At Block B, the MRT accountholder/employee provides to the MRT Network all relevant employer or payroll service provider information and authorizes the MRT Network to effect to effect automatically (or the accountholder can effect manually) R (&#x3b2;, $) transfers on the accountholder's monies held by the employer or the payroll service provider to make the accountholder's/employee's future benefits payments. AT Block C, the MRT Network accountholder/employee securely logs-in to the MRT Network and indicates a desire to transfer R (&#x3b2;, $) from the monies held by the employer or payroll service provider associated with payments for the accountholder's/employee's benefit. At Block D, either the accountholder or the MRT Network, depending on the transfer method and iteration chosen, transfers the accountholder's/employee's R (&#x3b2;, $) on escrowed payments for the accountholder's obligations and benefits such as taxes, insurance, etc., via the MRT Network, to &#x201c;home&#x201d; or &#x201c;external&#x201d; participating institutions to earn additional interest on the accountholder's transferred R (&#x3b2;, $). The R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) is shown in the new account status screen. At Block E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68B</figref>), as the employer or payroll service provider, which is holding the accountholder's/employee's remaining set of monetary rights (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $)), makes the payments on behalf of the accountholder, the accountholder's transferred R (&#x3b2;, $) is automatically reduced (or cancelled) commensurately with each individual payment made on each individual payment's due date as reflected in the &#x201c;Transaction Log&#x201d;. Accrued interest (i) is then returned to the accountholder's/employee's MRTS account(s). AT Block F, the MRT Network accountholder's remaining transferred R (&#x3b2;, $) balance is reflected in the accountholder's new account status screen and information concerning payments and payment due dates of the accountholder's taxes and benefits obligations is sent to the accountholder via the accountholder's preferred contact method(s).</p>

<p id="p-0452" num="0451">An MRT Network accountholder provides to the MRT Network all pertinent information with regard to accountholder's bills received including, but not limited to, company name, account number(s), contact information, payment due date, etc., that will allow the MRT Network to establish an electronic link with each individual bill sender (FIG. <b>69</b>B<b>1</b>). The MRT Network accountholder also authorizes the MRT Network to transfer accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) from payments sent to biller until the each bill's due date, at which time the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) is returned to the original payment of R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $), allowing the MRT Network accountholder to earn additional interest until each payment's due date (FIG. <b>69</b>B<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">As in previous embodiments of the system of the invention, participating institutions submit rate feeds to the MRT Network via an electronic network (Internet). The incoming institutions' account/product information is then ranked by the system's databases and displayed for the accountholder. The accountholder can then choose from among the various right(s) transfer methods offered by the MRT Network and indicate the intent to transfer the R (&#x3b2;, $) from various payments made at any time prior to a bill's due date. While this process can be effected manually by an accountholder, an accountholder also has the option to put this payment method in automatic mode whereby the system will automatically withhold and transfer the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) from each payment made from an account within the MRT Network to one of the bill senders as previously specified by an accountholder.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">When an accountholder effects bill payment via this process, the MRT Network sends the payment as R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $), withholding and transferring the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) (FIG. <b>69</b>B<b>3</b>) per the accountholder's chosen transfer option(s) (FIG. <b>69</b>C<b>1</b>). On an individual payment's due date, the MRT Network reduces or cancels the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer(s) commensurately with the amount of the bill payment (FIG. <b>69</b>C<b>2</b>) shown in the &#x201c;Transaction Log&#x201d;. R (&#x3b2;, $)+(i) is then split, with accrued interest (i) being returned to the accountholder's MRT Network account(s), and R (&#x3b2;, $) returned to the bill payment receiver thus restoring R (&#x3b2;, $) to the accountholder's original payment of R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $) and restoring the full set of monetary rights (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)) to the payment receiver on the bill's due date.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">As in previous embodiments, the accountholder is provided with a &#x201c;Accounts Status (NEW)&#x201d; screen (FIG. <b>69</b>C<b>3</b>) at the end of this process that apprises the MRT Network accountholder of account balances, transfers, bill payments and payment dates, and all information relevant to the transfer and payment process.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">This process allows an MRT Network accountholder to pay, at any date prior to a bill's due date, in full, yet withhold the right to earn interest R (&#x3b2;, $) from that payment in order to maximize interest earned until the bill's actual due date, allowing the MRT Network accountholder, not the payment recipient, to earn interest on the accountholder's monies until the last possible date prior a bill's payment due date.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0456">An MRT Network accountholder pre-designates specific accounts, either within or via the MRT Network or within the accountholder's &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) from which to effect payments withholding accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) until payment due date. Via this process, the accountholder can pre-specify from which account(s) to effect such payments and also pre-specify whether to effect these payments automatically or, whether accountholder will effect them manually. If the accountholder chooses to effect them electronically, then the MRT Network or &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) will restore the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) to the original payment of R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $) on the payment due date while simultaneously returning any accrued interest (i) to the accountholder's account(s) within the MRT Network or the accountholder's &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s). However, should the accountholder choose to effect these payments manually, the MRT Network (or accountholder's &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s)) will automatically withhold the equivalent R (&#x3b2;, $) from the manual payment, as the accountholder has already provided biller's account numbers, contact information, and authorizations to the MRT Network, until the payment's due date at which time the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) will be restored to the original payment of R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $). Again, any accrued interest (i) will be returned to the accountholder's MRT Network or &#x201c;home&#x201d; account(s).</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0457">Now, referring to FIG. <b>69</b>D<b>1</b>, at Block A, an MRT Network accountholder provides the MRT Network with a list of names and account numbers from which the accountholder receives bills for such things as: electricity, natural gas, credit cards, mortgage payments, phone service, auto insurance, health insurance, etc., and authorizes the MRT Network to contact each identified party and to withhold transfer of the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) until each payment's due date. At Block B, the MRT Network accountholder securely logs-in to the MRT Network and indicates a desire to transfer the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) from monies associated with payments made to the various companies from which the accountholder receives bills. At Block C, the accountholder then transfers, via preferred means, the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) coincident with the payment of each bill, via check, money market account, electronic bill payment, debit/credit card, etc. at any time prior to a bill's due date. Thus, the accountholder is remitting to each company from which a bill is received R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $). The R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer is reflected in the accountholder's new account status screen. At Block D, as each bill's payment due date arrives, the MRT Network automatically reduces (or cancels) the accountholder's transfer(s) of R (&#x3b2;, $) commensurately with the amount of each bill and restores R (&#x3b2;, $) to the accountholder's original payment of received R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $) to each payee. Simultaneously, the MRT Network returns all accrued interest (i) to the accountholder's account(s) within the MRT Network on the date of each bill payment.

Due to foreign exchange quoting convention, this example also serves for the Swiss Franc, the Swedish Krona, the Norwegian Krona, the Chinese Yuan, the Mexican Peso, the Brazilian Real, and many other currencies.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 73A-B</figref> is a schematic representation of the MRT Network Foreign Entities and Foreign Exchange Conversion Process. This process allows an MRT Network accountholder to effect foreign R (&#x3b2;, $) (and other right(s)) transfers via the system and methods of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">An MRT Network accountholder maintains accounts at &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution(s) where the accountholder's individual, separable set of monetary rights (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)) reside. The MRT Network receives foreign rate feeds from various foreign financial institutions and ranks and displays them in the same manner as it ranks and displays domestic institutions' accounts and products.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">The MRT Network accountholder (or the MRT Network, depending on the accountholder's pre-specified criteria) initiates an R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer to a foreign institution. Prior to receipt by a foreign institution, the R (&#x3b2;, $) is converted to R (&#x3b2;, foreign currency (fc)) by using a market-derived foreign exchange conversion rate which can be &#x201c;time-stamped&#x201d; to assure that the accountholder is receiving a fair conversion rate. After the conversion to R (&#x3b2;, fc), the transfer is placed with the foreign institution(s) until such time as the accountholder or the MRT Network recalls the R (&#x3b2;, fc) or transfers the R (&#x3b2;, fc) to another institution in another country.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">If the R (&#x3b2;, fc) is recalled, then R (&#x3b2;, fc)+(i, fc) must be converted back to R (&#x3b2;, $)+(i, $) by again utilizing a market-derived foreign exchange conversion rate, which can again be &#x201c;time-stamped&#x201d; to assure a fair conversion rate. Once this conversion back to R (&#x3b2;, $)+(i, $) has taken place the accrued interest is placed in the accountholder's MRT Network account(s), the R (&#x3b2;, $) is restored to the accountholder's MRT Network account(s) and the process can begin anew.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">In the event the accountholder (or the MRT Network) chooses to transfer the R (&#x3b2;, fc) to another foreign institution, the (i, fc) can be transferred as well or converted back to (i, $) and deposited in the accountholder's MRT Network account. The R (&#x3b2;, fc) can be transferred to another institution and, if necessary, can be converted to another R (&#x3b2;, fc) via the aforementioned process.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">Depending on the foreign currency conversion, there are two separate conventions that are used to convert the R (&#x3b2;, $) and the (i, $) to their foreign currency equivalents, and back; both are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 73A-B</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0483" num="0482">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, at Block A, participating foreign financial institutions feed rate/yield and account/product information to the MRT Network databases where the information is collected and ranked both by the pre-specified criteria supplied by the accountholder and by the MRT Network-specified criteria. At Block B, the MRT Network accountholder indicates, via the MRT Network, the desire to effect an R (&#x3b2;, $) to account(s)/product(s) at foreign financial institutions. At Block C, the MRT Network transfers the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) to foreign institution(s) account(s)/product(s) using a foreign exchange conversion rate to convert R (&#x3b2;, $) to R (&#x3b2;, foreign currency (fc)) and, per earlier embodiments, notifies the accountholder of rate/yield and other details of the foreign transfer(s). At Block D, when the accountholder wants to effect another transfer of what is now R (&#x3b2;, fc) back to an account/product within the U.S. (or other foreign country) the MRT Network now converts R (&#x3b2;, fc)+i (fc) back to R (&#x3b2;, $)+i ($) (or other foreign currency) using a foreign exchange conversion rate and effects the transfer either at the command of the accountholder or automatically. At Block E, the MRT Network then provides to the accountholder a transaction log detailing all R (&#x3b2;, $) transfers, amounts, rates/yields, etc., as well as all R (&#x3b2;, fc)+i (fc) earned along with all foreign exchange conversion rates used in the REI transfer process.</p>

<p id="p-0509" num="0508">If the MRT Network accountholder allows a &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) to beat &#x201c;external&#x201d; offers, then a drop-down menu appears that allows the accountholder to determine by what amount of basis points the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) must beat the &#x201c;external&#x201d; offer to retain the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $). The accountholder highlights the choice from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0509">If the MRT Network accountholder allows the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) to make a counter-offer(s), again a drop-down menu appears that allows the accountholder to determine by what amount of basis points the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) offer(s) can be less than that of the &#x201c;external&#x201d; offer(s) (If the amount is 0.000% then the accountholder would choose the &#x201c;match&#x201d; option), and still be acceptable to the MRT Network accountholder. Again, the accountholder chooses this amount from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0510">These choices are not mutually exclusive, as the MRT Network accountholder's choices here are not known to the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s), and the &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s) must make their best offer and see if it is accepted based on the MRT Network accountholder's criteria. However, if the MRT Network accountholder is operating in a completely manual mode, the accountholder may override the pre-established criteria and allow an R (&#x3b2;, $) transfer to occur that would normally be rejected by the MRT Network accountholder (or the MRT Network) based on the accountholder's pre-established criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0511">As in previous embodiments, after making choices in this control panel the accountholder then can either edit or save choices made.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0512"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref> is a schematic representation for a Web-based control panel for the Account-Specific Payment Method Withholding the Right to Earn Interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) until payment Due Date Pre-Specifications that allows an accountholder on the MRT Network to pre-specify from which account(s) to make payments withholding R (&#x3b2;, $) until a payment's due date, and to pre-specify whether to make said payment by electronic means or by manual means. This MRT Network control panel allows an MRT Network accountholder to pre-designate from which accounts to make bill payments (or payments of any type) via the MRT Network Account-Specific Payment Method Withholding the Right to Earn Interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) until Payment Due Pre-Specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0513">This control panel provides an MRT Network accountholder with specific payment options with (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $)) being paid by an MRT Network accountholder at any time prior to a bill's actual payment due date, allowing the accountholder to transfer the withheld R (&#x3b2;, $) and earn interest until the actual payment due date. The accountholder chooses from accounts already registered with the MRT Network by the accountholder (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>) from which to make the payments withholding the right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, $)) until the payment(s) due date.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0514">Then the MRT Network accountholder pre-specifies whether to pay electronically, which may be effected either by the MRT Network or by the accountholder's &#x201c;home&#x201d; bank(s)/institution(s), or whether to pay manually from one (or more) of the already-specified accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">Should the MRT Network accountholder choose to pay manually, the MRT Network, having already been provided the accountholder's account number(s) with each bill sender, the bill sender's contact information, and the proper authorization to establish contact with each bill sender, will automatically withhold the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $) from payments the accountholder chooses to make manually until the actual payment(s) due date(s) at which time the withheld R (&#x3b2;, $) will be restored to the accountholder's initial payment of (R (&#x3b1; . . . &#x3b9;, $)&#x2212;R (&#x3b2;, $)). This will allow MRT Network accountholders who are more comfortable paying bills manually to still withhold, and transfer, their R (&#x3b2;, $) until each payment's due date.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0516">As in previous embodiments of control panels, the accountholder always has the ability to edit and/or save any choices made in this panel.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0517"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> is a schematic representation for a Web-based control panel for the Right(s) Transfer Preferred Accounts and Products List that allows an accountholder on the MRT Network to specify to which accounts and products the accountholder prefers to transfer the accountholder's monetary right to earn interest R (&#x3b2;, $) possessed by an owner (or borrower) of money. This MRT Network control panel allows an MRT Network accountholder to pre-specify types of accounts and products to which to transfer the accountholder's R (&#x3b2;, $). The first option allows the accountholder to pre-specify all participating institutions' accounts and products, which would then preclude all of the other options. However, if an accountholder prefers to pick accounts and products individually, then the accountholder may do so. Once the accountholder has made the preferred choices, as in previous embodiments of the MRT Network control panels, the accountholder can at any time either edit or save selections made in this control panel.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0518">It is understood that while the illustrative embodiments of the MRT Network of the present invention have been described using the example(s) of an accountholder transferring its right to earn interest (R (&#x3b2;, S)) to one &#x201c;external&#x201d; bank or financial institution under the accountholder's management, it is understood that in alternative embodiments such monetary right(s) can be transferred among multiple &#x201c;external&#x201d; financial institutions (and internally among the &#x201c;home&#x201d; institution) in order to maximize earned interest. In such embodiments, the MRT Network of the present invention will track and account for all such R (&#x3b2;, $) (and other right(s)) transfers as well as the netting of earned interest.</p>
