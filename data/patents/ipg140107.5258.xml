<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A controller pilot data link communications (CPDLC) human machine interface (HMI) is a set of screens used by members of an aircraft flight crew to receive uplink messages from the air traffic controller and to send downlink messages to the air traffic controller. Today when a pilot of an aircraft wants to change altitude or speed, the pilot talks to the air traffic controller (ATC), typically, via a very high frequency (VHF) radio and asks for the desired altitude or speed. The ATC datalink system (also referred to herein as a CPDLC system) permits the pilot make the request for the desired altitude or speed via a datalink.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One type of CPDLC message that the pilot creates, requests changes to the flight such as a different altitude or a different speed. The air traffic controller, upon receiving the downlink request message, reads it and sends a response. Usually the response grants the request or denies the request. In some cases, the controller may be puzzled by the request and question whether the pilot really meant to send that specific request. In this case the controller has a third response, which is to respond with the &#x201c;confirm request&#x201d; uplink. The CPDLC uplink message &#x201c;confirm request&#x201d; is alpha-numerically indicated as &#x201c;UM143&#x201d; and is sometimes sent responsive to a downlink request message. The air traffic controller sends a confirm request message when there is concern that the wrong value may have been sent in the original message.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The intent of the confirm request message is to trigger a resending of the last downlink request message sent by the pilot. Currently, when the confirm request message is received, the pilot searches for the last downlink request message sent. When the last downlink request message sent is found, the pilot then navigates through air traffic control menu screens, selects the same downlink request message screen, composes the message by filling in the data to match the original downlink request message or revised data, and sends the downlink request message again. This process requires considerable &#x201c;head-down time&#x201d; during which the pilot is looking down at the display showing the HMI screens instead of flying the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">If there is operational urgency in the message being sent, the head-down time adds time to the processing of the message and delays an urgently required action.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present application relates to a system to reduce head-down time for a flight crew.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with common practice, the various described features are not drawn to scale but are drawn to emphasize features relevant to the present invention. Like reference characters denote like elements throughout figures and text.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The process described herein provides a system and method to reduce the head-down time for responding to a confirm-response message to a downlink request message previously sent from an aircraft. With reduced head-down time, the downlink request message is resent to the ground control more quickly after receipt of a confirm-response message. The process described herein also improves accuracy of the resent downlink request messages since the pilot is not required to type duplicate data into the resent downlink request message. Upon receipt of a confirm-response message, the system and method described herein allow the flight crew member to review the originally sent message and either resend a message with the same data as the originally sent message or modify the data in the originally sent message and send the modified message.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Downlink messages are sent from the aircraft to an air traffic controller on the ground. Uplink messages are sent from the air traffic controller on the ground to the aircraft. The controller pilot data link communications (CPDLC) includes a data dictionary of predefined message elements that the pilot and controller can use to compose messages to send. There are several categories of message elements: requests (e.g., request speed 240 kts, request attitude 25,000 feet); reports (e.g., maintaining speed 230 kts); and responses (e.g., WILCO, UNABLE, AFFIRM, NEGATIVE, CONFIRM REQUEST).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The systems described herein monitor received confirm-response messages. As defined herein the confirm-response messages include, but are not limited to, a CPDLC CONFIRM REQUEST message; a CPDLC CONFIRM ASSIGNED LEVEL message; a CPDLC CONFIRM ASSIGNED SPEED message; a CPDLC CONFIRM ASSIGNED ROUTE message; CPDLC CONFIRM TIME OVER REPORTED WAYPOINT message; a CPDLC CONFIRM NEXT WAYPOINT ETA message; a CPDLC CONFIRM ENSUING WAYPOINT message; and a CPDLC CONFIRM SQUAWK message. These messages are CPDLC messages UM135-UM144, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When the avionics receives a confirm-response message in response to a downlink request message, the received confirm-response message is displayed for viewing by the pilot or other crew member. The pilot goes to a message log to view the confirm-response message. Exemplary downlink request messages include &#x201c;request altitude MMM&#x201d; or &#x201c;request speed LLL&#x201d;, where MMM and LLL are numerical values.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If the air traffic controller feels the data in the downlink request message is incorrect (e.g., a typographical error by the pilot) the air traffic controller sends a confirm-response message so the pilot can review the request and be sure that data is correct. When a confirm-response message is received and viewed by the pilot, a shortcut prompt is displayed (or otherwise provided) for the pilot. A touch of a button (or a touch of an icon on a display) triggers a processor to retrieve the down link message (including the data in the downlink request message) that prompted the confirm-response message from the air traffic controller. The pilot then looks at the displayed downlink request message to determine if the data in the originally sent downlink request message was correct. In accordance with the present application, the pilot is not required to navigate through the display menu in the HMI to a screen for recomposing the downlink request message for resending responsive to the confirm-response message. Thus, the pilot requires less head-down time to downlink the downlink request message. The terms &#x201c;pilot&#x201d; and &#x201c;flight crew&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. The flight crew can also include a co-pilot of the aircraft.</p>

It is to be understood that method <b>400</b> can be implemented using other embodiments of system <b>5</b> as is understandable by one skilled in the art who reads this document.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At block <b>402</b>, the pilot of aircraft <b>10</b> sends a downlink request message (DRM), such as downlink request message <b>131</b>, to the ATC <b>130</b>. Responsive to receiving the downlink request message <b>131</b>, an uplink message <b>141</b> is sent from the ATC <b>130</b> to the aircraft <b>10</b> via communication link <b>81</b>. The MIN in the first field <b>151</b> of the downlink request message <b>131</b> (e.g., 2) is the MRN in the second field <b>152</b> of the uplink message <b>141</b>. In one implementation of this embodiment, the uplink message <b>141</b> is a CONFIRM REQUEST message (e.g., CPDLC message UM143). In another implementation of this embodiment, the uplink message <b>141</b> is one of the CPDLC messages UM135-UM144.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At block <b>404</b>, the functional module <b>26</b> receives confirm-response message <b>141</b> and the confirm-response message <b>141</b> is stored in the message log <b>22</b>. An alert is used to notify the pilot that a message has been received. The alert can be visual (e.g., a light) or aural (e.g., a chime).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At block <b>406</b>, the pilot or other crew member goes to the message log <b>22</b> to view the uplink message <b>141</b>. Since the uplink message is a confirm-response message, the processor <b>45</b> automatically displays a shortcut prompt for viewing by the pilot as the pilot views the confirm-response message <b>141</b>. The shortcut prompt can be an icon <b>44</b> or a message on the message composition screen <b>30</b> that reads &#x201c;shortcut available&#x201d; or &#x201c;push shortcut button for shortcut&#x201d; or some other message to indicate to the pilot that the shortcut is available to respond to the confirm-response message <b>141</b>. At block <b>408</b>, the pilot uses (implements) a shortcut prompt. In one implementation of this embodiment, the shortcut prompt is implemented by the push of the shortcut interface <b>40</b>. Other methods of prompting an implementation of the shortcut prompt are possible. For example, the system <b>5</b> can include a microphone and pilot can say &#x201c;SHORTCUT&#x201d; to initiate the shortcut.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>410</b>, the processor <b>45</b> determines if the uplink message <b>141</b> included a MRN in the second field <b>152</b> of the CPDLC message header <b>150</b> of the confirm-response message <b>141</b>. If there is a MRN in the second field <b>152</b> of the CPDLC message header <b>150</b> of the confirm-response message <b>141</b>, the flow proceeds to block <b>412</b>. At block <b>412</b>, the processor <b>45</b> retrieves the downlink request message <b>131</b> stored in the message log <b>22</b> that has a MIN value in the first field <b>151</b> that matches the MRN value in the second field <b>152</b> in the CPDLC message header <b>150</b> and the flow proceeds to block <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If, at block <b>410</b>, the processor <b>45</b> determines the uplink message <b>141</b> does not include a MRN in the second field <b>152</b> of the CPDLC message header <b>150</b> of the confirm-response message, the flow proceeds to block <b>414</b>. At block <b>414</b>, the processor <b>45</b> retrieves the last-sent downlink request message <b>131</b> and the flow proceeds to block <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">At block <b>416</b>, the processor <b>45</b> refills the message composition screen <b>30</b> with data in the downlink request message <b>131</b> retrieved at block <b>412</b> or <b>614</b>. This provision of the downlink request message <b>131</b> for viewing on the message composition screen <b>30</b> is the result of a user (e.g., the pilot or other flight crew member) implementing the displayed shortcut prompt at block <b>408</b>. At this point, the pilot is able to see the data from the downlink request message <b>131</b> to determine if a change is required. The pilot does not need to navigate through air traffic control menu screens to select the same downlink request message screen.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one implementation of this embodiment, the blocks <b>406</b>-<b>414</b> of method <b>400</b> are not implemented and method <b>400</b> flows from block <b>404</b> to block <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At block <b>418</b>, it is determined if the pilot wants to change the data that was sent in the original downlink request message <b>131</b> before resending the downlink request message <b>134</b>. If the pilot wants to change the data that was sent in the original downlink request message <b>131</b> before resending the downlink request message <b>134</b>, the flow proceeds to block <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At block <b>420</b>, the pilot or other crew member changes the data in the display <b>30</b>. This is done by typing the correct data in the appropriate data field of the refilled message composition screen <b>30</b>. In this manner, updated data is received from the user (e.g., pilot) and the data in the downlink request message shown in the message composition screen is changed to form a modified downlink request message. In an exemplary case, the downlink request message <b>131</b> received at the ATC <b>130</b> was a request to move to an altitude of 300 feet. The ATC <b>130</b> on the ground recognizes that the aircraft <b>10</b> is currently at 2,500 feet and is taking off The ATC <b>130</b> wants to make sure that the pilot actually wants to reduce altitude during takeoff. In this scenario, the ATC <b>130</b> sends a CONFIRM REQUEST message (um<b>143</b>) to the pilot. When the pilot sees the data from the downlink request message <b>131</b> that has refilled the message composition screen <b>30</b> at block <b>416</b> indicates a request to move to 300 feet altitude, the pilot recognizes the error and replaces the number 300 with the number 30,000 since the pilot had originally intended to request to move to an altitude of 30,000 feet in the downlink request message <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At block <b>422</b>, the pilot sends the modified downlink request message <b>134</b> shown on the message composition screen <b>30</b> by implementing a send-prompt. Upon receiving the send-prompt at the processor <b>45</b>, the modified downlink request message is sent from the aircraft <b>10</b> to the ATC <b>130</b> via the wireless communication link <b>81</b>. Upon receiving the send-prompt, the modified downlink request message is sent from the aircraft <b>10</b> to the ATC <b>130</b> via the wireless communication link <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If it is determined at block <b>418</b> that the pilot does not want to change the data that was sent in the downlink request message <b>131</b> before sending the downlink request message <b>134</b>, the flow proceeds to block <b>420</b>. At block <b>424</b>, the pilot sends the message shown on the display <b>30</b> as downlink request message <b>134</b>, without modification, by implementing a send-prompt. Thus, in this manner, the pilot did not need to search for the last-sent downlink request message and then navigate through air traffic control (ATC) menu screens to select the same downlink request message screen, and recompose the message by filling in the data to correct the data in the original downlink request message <b>131</b>. Upon receiving the send-prompt at the processor <b>45</b>, the downlink request message is resent from the aircraft <b>10</b> to the ATC <b>130</b> via the wireless communication link <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, by an implementation of the shortcut interface, which is automatically displayed when a confirm-response message is received and viewed, the previously-sent downlink request message or the associated downlink request message is displayed (with data filled in the appropriate field of the message) for viewing by the pilot. The pilot does not need to search for the last downlink request message sent and then navigate through air traffic control (ATC) menu screens to select the same downlink request message screen, and recompose the message by filling in the data to match the data in the downlink request message <b>131</b>. If the pilot decides to change the data before resending the downlink request message, the pilot enters the new data on the display screen in place of the original data, and then provides the send-prompt to send the modified downlink request message.</p>
