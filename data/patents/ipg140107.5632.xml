<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for remotely enabling one or more features. The features may be features in an application loaded on a client, which are remotely enabled from a server.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices such as cell phones, PDAs, cable boxes and other devices often have a plurality of features that a particular user may or may not desire to use with the device. These features may be included within an application, such as a software application, stored in memory on the device, such that they may be selectively activated. A user will usually select such features upon purchasing the device, such as with a cell phone, or upon signing up for a service, such as with cable television. The features are typically set in the device before it is given to the user. It would be advantageous if the features could be selectively enabled and/or disabled from a remote location.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Providers of video, audio, or other content, such as phone or cable companies, are converting from analog delivery systems to more sophisticated digital delivery systems. These systems are being deployed, and will, over time, phase out the analog delivery systems. For example, cable companies are offering digital set top boxes to customers, that offer more viewing choices to the customer. These digital set top boxes may offer additional features and services such as additional channels, interactive user interfaces, digital programming, pay-per view, video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many providers of such video content provide to users in more than one geographic area. The providers are now offering content such as weather or traffic conditions that may be different for users in different geographic areas. It would be beneficial if this information could be individualized to the particular customer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, such content providers may employ diagnostics in a set top box provided to the customer. This often involves pre-installing diagnostic software or code on each set top box, or downloading the diagnostics to each set top box. As the diagnostics become more and more complex, often with multiple levels of diagnostics, the software uses more memory and computational resources. The diagnostics are often run from a remote location, such as a head end. Such use makes it difficult to program each user's box individually with the appropriate level of diagnostics. It would be advantageous if different levels of diagnostics could be selectively enabled and disabled from a remote location.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention enables a feature among a plurality of features in an application loaded on a client, with the client located remotely from a server. The server receives a data profile request from the client. In response to the data profile request, a data profile is sent from the server to the client, the data profile including a profile key to identify the client, an application identification to identify the application, and a feature selector. The application uses the feature selector to enable the feature among the plurality of features.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. Computing device <b>100</b> is suitable for use with the present invention. The computing device <b>100</b> may include a processor <b>110</b>, a memory <b>120</b>, an user input <b>130</b>, a display <b>140</b>, and an output <b>150</b>. The memory <b>120</b> may contain software to be run in conjunction with processor <b>110</b>, and may cause images to be displayed on display <b>140</b>.

For example, the display may be a CRT or LCD monitor, a heads-up display, a television, etc. The display <b>140</b> may be structurally included as part of the electronic device, or may be physically separated from but connected with the other components of device <b>100</b>, such as a monitor in a desktop computer. The output <b>150</b> can be any type of output, such as a serial port, a wireless output, a connection to a cable modem, an infrared output, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. The client device <b>210</b> may correspond to the computing device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and may include a processor <b>110</b>, the memory <b>120</b>, the user input <b>130</b>, the display <b>140</b>, and the output <b>150</b>, as well as other computer elements. The server <b>220</b> may include the same elements. The client device <b>210</b> may be programmed with software in memory to carry out the present invention. The client device <b>210</b> is remote from the server <b>212</b>. The client device may be a device such as a cell phone, a set top box in a cable television system, a PDA, a computer, or other type of electronic device. The server <b>212</b> may be a server located at a service provider location, for example, or another server programmed to carry out the present invention. For example, the server <b>212</b> could be a server located at a mobile phone service provider location, an Internet service provider location, or a cable television service provider location. The server <b>212</b> may communicate with the client device <b>210</b> in any way, such as wirelessly, over satellite, over telephone lines, over a cable television connection, etc. The means of communication between the client device <b>210</b> and the server <b>212</b> is not a critical part of the invention. The server <b>212</b> may be connected to a plurality of the client devices in a network.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention allows a user to select features to be enabled. The user may select such features using the user input <b>130</b> in conjunction with display <b>140</b> by accessing programming that has been loaded into memory <b>120</b>, with the programming being run by processor <b>110</b>. For example, the user may be able to call up a display of available features, and select one or more features that the user wishes to be enabled. In response to such a selection of one or more features, the programming loaded into the client device <b>210</b> will generate a data profile request, which is sent to the server <b>212</b>. The data profile request will indicate which client device is sending the data profile request, and which features are desired to be enabled. As an alternative, the data profile request could be sent from the client device <b>210</b> to the server every time the client device is powered up, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The client device may include one or more applications, which may be in the form of computer programs, stored in the memory <b>120</b>. The applications may be stored on the client device <b>210</b> in advance, or may be downloaded or otherwise loaded into the client device at a later time. The applications may include features that are selectively enabled on the client device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Upon receipt of the data profile request at the server <b>212</b>, the server <b>212</b> generates a data profile, which includes a profile key, an application key, and a feature selector. The profile key identifies which client the data request is generated for. Thus, if the data profile is broadcast to a plurality of clients in a network such as a mobile phone or cable television network, each client will check the profile key to determine if it is destined for that particular client device. If it is not destined for that particular client device, it is disregarded and not used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">If the profile key indicates that it is designated for that particular client device, the client device <b>210</b> will examine the application identification to determine which among a plurality of applications it may apply to. Then, the client device will examine the feature selector included in the data profile, to determine which features should be enabled. The programs on the client device will then enable the desired features</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention may also be used to enabled features that are not selected at the client device <b>210</b>, but are selected at the server <b>212</b>. For example, when the client device is powered on, it may send a data profile to the server <b>212</b>, which will identify the client device. The server may be used to selectively enable features at one client device or at group of client devices. For example, it may be determined that all client devices in a particular area should have a feature enabled. Such a feature could be a display of weather data or other data particular to that geographical area. In this case, the profile key could include identifying information particular to the geographical area, such as zip code, or could include an identification code for each client device <b>212</b>. The feature may then be enabled at each client device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This invention is particularly useful for remote diagnostics. For example, an application loaded on the client device may be a remote diagnostics application. The application may contain a plurality of diagnostic levels. The diagnostic levels may be prestored in memory of the client device <b>210</b>, or may be loaded therein from the server <b>212</b> or from another location. In this way, the server can remotely set different diagnostic levels to be run on the client device <b>210</b>. For example, the server <b>212</b> may access the client <b>210</b> and send a first diagnostic level. The server <b>212</b> may send a second diagnostic level. Any number of such diagnostic levels may be used. The server <b>212</b> may then receive from the client device results of the diagnostics and continue other diagnostic levels as required.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating steps carried out by an embodiment of the present invention. In step <b>300</b>, the client device sends a data profile request to the server. As explained above, the data profile request will identify the client, and may include an indication of a feature or features that need to be enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step <b>310</b>, in response to the data profile request, the server generates a data profile. The data profile includes a profile key, an application key and a feature selector. The profile key identifies the particular client, so that if the server is connected to more than one client, the client can determine whether the data profile is for that particular client. The profile key may identify more than one client. The application key identifies a particular application, so that if more than one application is on the client, the appropriate application made be determined. The feature selector identifies which feature should be enabled by the client. The server may generate more than one data profile, and may broadcast the data profile to multiple clients in a network, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment that is used with a cable television system, a head end <b>410</b> corresponds to the remote computing device <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The head end may <b>410</b> comprise a server such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or may be another type of computing device. The head end and the cable box <b>412</b> may each comprise a computing device such as computing device <b>100</b>, and may include additional computing elements. The head end <b>410</b> is located remotely from cable box <b>412</b>, which is typically located at a user premises. The cable box <b>412</b> could alternatively be a type of device such as a personal computer, etc. The head end <b>410</b> and the cable box <b>412</b> carry out the process described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> so as to enable features on cable box <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flowchart in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In step <b>500</b>, the present invention sends a data profile request from the cable box <b>412</b> to the head end <b>410</b> at a remote location. The data profile may be sent when the cable box <b>412</b> is powered on, at regular intervals, when a user indicates that a new feature or service is desired, or at other times. As described above, the head end <b>410</b> may be accessed by any means.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step <b>510</b>, the head end <b>410</b> receives the data profile request, and generates the data profile, which is sent to the cable box <b>412</b>. The data profile includes the profile key, the application key and the feature selector as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step <b>520</b>, the cable box <b>412</b> determines whether the data profile should be used, by examining the profile key as described above. If the data key indicates that the data profile is for that particular cable box, the cable box <b>412</b> examines the application key to determine which application should be used, and uses the feature selector to enable the appropriate feature.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the embodiments described herein, the data profile request, and the data profile, including the profile key, the application key and the feature selector may be implemented in various known ways to send the appropriate information. For example, these items may be sent in a digital message, with certain portions of the message designated to include each of the required bits of information. The information may then be appropriately determined by the above-described computing elements and appropriate software using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in these arts.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Several embodiments of the present invention are specifically illustrated and described herein. However, it will be appreciated that modifications and variations of the present invention are covered by the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention.</p>
