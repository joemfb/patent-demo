<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to touch sensing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Touch sensitive systems refer, in general, to systems that detect and respond to multiple simultaneous points of contact on a surface. Typically, a touch sensitive system is incorporated within an electronic device in the form of a touch screen display that allows a user to both view and manipulate objects using one or more inputs that are in contact with the screen. Examples of electronic devices in which a touch sensitive system has been used include computer tablets, personal digital assistants (PDA), and cell-phones, among others. A variety of techniques are available that enable touch sensitive systems. For example, some touch systems identify surface contact by detecting changes in heat, pressure, capacitance or light intensity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This specification describes technologies relating to touch sensing. In general, one aspect of the subject matter described in this specification can be embodied in a touch-screen device that includes: a radiation source; a pliable waveguide configured to receive radiation emitted by the radiation source and to cause at least some of the received radiation to undergo total internal reflection within the pliable waveguide; a frustrating layer disposed relative to the pliable waveguide so as to enable the frustrating layer to physically contact the pliable waveguide when the pliable waveguide is physically deformed; and an imaging sensor configured to detect at least some radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide. The frustrating layer is configured to cause frustration of the total internal reflection of the received radiation within the pliable waveguide at a contact point between the frustrating layer and the pliable waveguide when the pliable waveguide is physically deformed to contact the frustrating layer such that some of the received radiation undergoing total internal reflection within the pliable waveguide escapes from the pliable waveguide at the contact point.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This and other implementations may optionally include one or more of the following features. In some implementations, the frustrating layer may include a structure configured to steer at least a portion of the radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide toward the imaging sensor. For example, the structure may include a light diffusing surface and/or a volume diffusing structure integral to the frustrating layer. In another example, the structure may include a diffraction pattern that corresponds to a grating structure. In some cases, the diffraction pattern may be formed by employing an interference pattern that is transferred to the structure, in which a series of fringes representing intensity minima or maxima of the transferred interference pattern correspond to the grating structure. The grating structure may include a blazed grating profile, a square-wave profile, a sinusoidal profile, and/or a half-sinusoidal profile. The square-wave profile may include a 1-bit binary diffraction grating profile. Alternatively, or in addition, the square-wave profile may include a multiple-bit modulated binary profile.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, the structure may include an aperiodic diffraction pattern, in which a series of fringes representing intensity minima or maxima of an interference pattern transferred to the structure are arranged in an aperiodic pattern. Alternatively, or in addition, the fringes of an interference pattern correspond to planes of refractive index variation that are aligned substantially parallel with a surface of the frustrating layer on which the radiation is incident.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some cases, the structure is on a surface of the frustrating layer that is nearest to the pliable waveguide and/or on a surface of the frustrating layer that is furthest from the pliable waveguide. The structure may be configured to steer by diffraction at least a portion of the radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide toward the imaging sensor. The structure may be configured to steer by refraction at least a portion of the radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide toward the imaging sensor. In an example, the structure may include an array of prisms.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain instances, the structure is divided into sub-structures and each sub-structure is configured to steer radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide toward the imaging sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations, the device includes a pliable frustrating layer disposed relative to the pliable waveguide so as to enable the pliable frustrating layer to contact the pliable waveguide when the pliable frustrating layer is physically deformed. The pliable frustrating layer may be configured to cause frustration of the total internal reflection of the received radiation within the pliable waveguide at a contact point between the pliable frustrating layer and the pliable waveguide when the pliable frustrating layer is physically deformed to contact the pliable waveguide layer such that some of the received radiation undergoing total internal reflection within the pliable waveguide escapes from the pliable waveguide at the contact point between the pliable frustrating layer and the pliable waveguide. In some implementations, the frustrating layer is disposed on a first side of the pliable waveguide layer and the pliable frustrating layer is disposed on a second opposite side of the pliable waveguide layer. The pliable frustrating layer may include a structure configured to steer at least a portion of the radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide toward the imaging sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the touch-screen device includes a display device adjacent to the frustrating layer.

In some implementations, the touch screen device also includes a screen projection layer, in which the screen projection layer includes a structure configured to diffuse at least a portion of light emitted from the display device. In certain implementations, the touch-screen device includes a screen projection layer and a structure configured to diffuse at least a portion of light emitted from the display device on to the screen projection layer.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in a touch-screen device that includes: a radiation source; a pliable waveguide configured to receive radiation emitted by the radiation source and to cause at least some of the received radiation to undergo total internal reflection within the pliable waveguide; a frustrating layer disposed relative to the pliable waveguide so as to enable a top surface of frustrating layer to contact the pliable waveguide when the pliable waveguide is physically deformed; an image generating layer disposed adjacent to a bottom surface of the frustrating layer that is opposite to the top surface of the frustrating layer, in which the image generating layer has a top surface facing the bottom surface of the frustrating layer and a bottom surface that is opposite from the top surface of the image generating layer; an imaging sensor configured to detect at least some of the radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide; and a light-steering structure disposed adjacent to the bottom surface of the image generating layer, in which the light-steering structure is configured to steer at least a portion of the radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide toward the imaging sensor. The frustrating layer is configured to cause frustration of the total internal reflection of the received radiation within the pliable waveguide at a contact point between the top surface of the frustrating layer and the pliable waveguide when the pliable waveguide is physically deformed to contact the top surface of the frustrating layer such that some of the received radiation undergoing total internal reflection within the pliable waveguide escapes from the pliable waveguide at the contact point. The image generating layer is configured to emit output images towards the frustrating layer and pliable waveguide and to be transmissive to radiation emitted by the radiation source.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This and other implementations may optionally include one or more of the following features. For example, in some implementations, the light-steering structure may be bonded to the bottom surface of the image generating layer. In other implementations, the top surface of the image generating layer is bonded to the bottom surface of the frustrating layer. The top surface of the image generating layer may be in optical contact with the bottom surface of the frustrating layer.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A touch-sensitive system can receive an input from various sources of contact which include, for example, a human finger, a stylus, and/or a mechanical object. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> are diagrams of a user interacting with a multi-touch sensitive device <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, when a user contacts a touch-screen <b>102</b> of device <b>100</b> using one or more fingers, the device <b>100</b> detects the contact made by the user's finger(s) with the touch-screen <b>102</b> and tracks movement(s) made by the user's finger(s) along the surface of the touch-screen <b>102</b>. Based on a detected path or paths traced by the user's finger(s) on touch-screen <b>102</b>, device <b>100</b> can manipulate information in a corresponding display, whether the display is separate from touch-screen <b>102</b> or is integrated as part of touch-screen <b>102</b>. Given that device <b>100</b> can detect contact from multiple inputs, many users may operate device <b>100</b> concurrently.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One approach for sensing the contact of one or more objects on a surface of a touch sensitive device involves sensing contact points on a waveguide by detecting points along the waveguide from which light is escaping the waveguide due to frustrated total internal reflectance (FTIR) occurring as a consequence of the contact being made on the waveguide. When light traveling in a first medium (e.g., a waveguide) encounters an interface with a second medium having a lower refractive index (e.g., air), the light traveling in the first medium may, depending on its angle of incidence with the interface, refract as it passes through the interface. If the angle of incidence is greater than a critical angle, on the other hand, the light will undergo total internal reflection (TIR) within the first medium. For example, waveguides such as fiber optic cables employ TIR to transport light efficiently with very little loss. In some cases, however, such total internal reflection of light can be frustrated by replacing the medium having the lower refractive index with another material that allows the light to escape from the waveguide. By sensing the escaped light, it may be possible to detect the location at which the new material was introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Implementations of a touch sensitive device disclosed herein include a pliable waveguide that is configured to deform responsive to surface manipulation (e.g., pressure from a finger interacting with a display), which causes a portion of the waveguide at the location of the surface manipulation to physically contact a frustrating layer therebeneath. Light that travels along the waveguide, e.g., via total internal reflection, escapes at the point of contact to yield a detectable position of waveguide deformation, and hence surface manipulation (i.e., total internal reflection of light in the waveguide is frustrated at the point of contact between the waveguide and the frustrating layer).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional diagram of an example of a touch sensitive device <b>200</b>, in which a point of contact with device <b>200</b> is detected based on FTIR. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, device <b>200</b> includes a radiation source <b>202</b>, a pliable waveguide <b>204</b>, a frustrating layer <b>206</b> adjacent to waveguide <b>204</b> and an imaging sensor <b>208</b>. Frustrating layer <b>206</b> is positioned relative to the pliable waveguide <b>204</b> such that a small gap <b>212</b> exists between frustrating layer <b>206</b> and pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. In some implementations, protrusions <b>214</b> may be formed on or as part of frustrating layer <b>206</b> to maintain the gap <b>212</b> between the pliable waveguide <b>204</b> and the frustrating layer <b>206</b>. In such implementations, protrusions <b>214</b> (e.g., surface roughness) can be formed integrally with frustrating layer <b>206</b>, i.e., protrusions <b>214</b>, together with frustrating layer <b>206</b>, form a single mass of seamless, contiguous material. In some implementations, a micro-roughness layer having randomly (or semi-randomly) spaced protrusions may be formed on the surface of the frustrating layer <b>206</b>, which function substantially as protrusions <b>214</b>. In some cases, protrusions <b>214</b> are formed from material distinct from frustrating layer <b>206</b> and/or waveguide <b>204</b>. For example, glass spacers could be used to separate an acrylic waveguide from a polycarbonate frustrating layer. The spacing between protrusions <b>214</b> can be random, pseudo-random or periodic.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Electromagnetic radiation (e.g., infrared (IR) radiation) is emitted from radiation source <b>202</b> and coupled into pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. Due to the refractive index difference between pliable waveguide <b>204</b> and the medium surrounding waveguide <b>204</b>, at least some of the coupled radiation then undergoes TIR and proceeds to travel down pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. For example, waveguide <b>204</b> could be formed from a thin layer of compliant acrylic surrounded by air. Given the refractive index difference between acrylic (n=1.49) and air (n=1.0), radiation introduced by radiation source <b>202</b> into waveguide <b>204</b> at an appropriate angle of incidence propagates within and along the acrylic layer by TIR.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Waveguide <b>204</b> is formed from a material that is flexible enough to respond to pressure applied by an input such that sufficient contact can be made with frustrating layer <b>206</b>. For example, waveguide <b>204</b> can be formed from materials such as acrylic/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or transparent polyurethane (TPU). Other materials can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to frustrate TIR of radiation propagating in waveguide <b>204</b>, frustrating layer <b>206</b> is formed from material that has a refractive index comparable to or higher than compliant waveguide <b>204</b>. Thus, when compliant waveguide <b>204</b> comes into contact with frustrating layer <b>206</b>, at least a portion of the radiation propagating down waveguide <b>204</b> due to TIR is &#x201c;frustrated&#x201d; and escapes from waveguide <b>204</b>. In some cases, at least a portion of radiation <b>210</b> continues to propagate by TIR in waveguide <b>204</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Either a rigid or non-rigid material can be used to form frustrating layer <b>206</b>. In addition, when integrated as part of a display, frustrating layer <b>206</b> may be formed from a material that is transparent (or at least transmissive) to the range of wavelengths emitted by a display light source. For example, frustrating layer <b>206</b> may be formed from glass or from PMMA, both of which are generally transmissive in both the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum. Alternatively, frustrating layer <b>206</b> can be formed from relatively pliable materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl butyral (PVB), TPU, or from more rigid materials such as PET or PC. Other materials can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Locally depressing waveguide <b>204</b> may cause substantial local deformation of frustrating layer <b>206</b> as waveguide <b>204</b> comes into contact with frustrating layer <b>206</b>. In contrast, portions of frustrating layer <b>206</b> far from the region of contact between waveguide <b>204</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b> may experience little or no deformation. Such pronounced local deformation may lead to an increase in the area of physical contact between compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b>, thereby causing an increased amount of IR to escape from compliant waveguide <b>204</b> in the region of the point of contact.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some implementations, frustrating layer <b>206</b> may be configured to have a substantially uniform thickness that is within a range of approximately 100 &#x3bc;m through 300 &#x3bc;m. In selecting an appropriate thickness for frustrating layer <b>206</b>, the following considerations may be taken into account. If frustrating layer <b>206</b> is too thin, it may be difficult to manipulate and handle, for example, during manufacturing. On the other hand, if frustrating layer <b>206</b> is too thick, it may cause a parallax issue, where a user perceives a point of contact to be displaced (e.g., by the thickness of frustrating layer <b>206</b>) from the actual displayed object with which the user is attempting to interact. In alternative implementations, frustrating layer <b>206</b> may be configured to be thinner than 100 &#x3bc;m (e.g., about 10 &#x3bc;m or about 30 &#x3bc;m) or thicker than 300 &#x3bc;m (e.g., about 1 mm or about 2 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Due to the presence of air gap <b>212</b> between frustrating layer <b>206</b> and pliable waveguide <b>204</b>, little or no frustration of TIR within waveguide <b>204</b> occurs absent some external stimulus. However, when pliable waveguide <b>204</b> is depressed by, for example, a user's finger <b>220</b>, a portion of pliable waveguide <b>204</b> contacts frustrating layer <b>206</b> in a region <b>201</b> (identified by dashed line circle) corresponding to the point of depression. As described above, in some implementations, the contact between pliable waveguide <b>204</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b> may cause local deformation of frustrating layer <b>206</b>. When frustrating layer <b>206</b> contacts waveguide <b>204</b>, total internal reflection within waveguide <b>204</b> is frustrated within region <b>201</b> causing at least some radiation to escape from the pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. It should be noted that although protrusions <b>214</b> also contact waveguide <b>204</b>, the area of contact between protrusions <b>214</b> and waveguide <b>204</b>, when no pressure is applied to pliable waveguide <b>204</b>, is relatively small compared to the area of contact between frustrating layer <b>206</b> and pliable waveguide <b>204</b> when pliable waveguide <b>204</b> is depressed. Accordingly, frustration of TIR that might occur in the regions of contact between protrusions <b>214</b> and waveguide <b>204</b> is negligible when no pressure is applied to pliable waveguide <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, some of the radiation, represented by arrows &#x201c;A,&#x201d; escapes from surface <b>204</b><i>a </i>of pliable waveguide <b>204</b> and travels in a direction towards imaging sensor <b>208</b>. Imaging sensor <b>208</b> images the radiation that escapes from surface <b>204</b><i>a</i>. As a result, imaging sensor <b>208</b> can discriminately sense, for successive instants of time, points of contact that are sufficiently forceful to deform pliable waveguide <b>204</b> such that it contacts a substantial portion of frustrating layer <b>206</b> relative to the portion of frustrating layer <b>206</b> contacted by waveguide <b>204</b> when no pressure is applied. That is, for a &#x201c;single&#x201d; point of contact on waveguide <b>204</b>, such as contact by finger <b>220</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a single &#x201c;area&#x201d; of contact corresponding to the portion of frustrating layer <b>206</b> that contacts waveguide <b>204</b> is discriminately sensed by imaging sensor <b>208</b>. Likewise, when two or more objects (e.g., two or more fingers of a user) contact and depress waveguide <b>204</b> concurrently, multiple areas of contact are discriminately (and concurrently) sensed by imaging sensor <b>208</b>. For ease of discussion, the term &#x201c;a point of contact&#x201d; may be used throughout this disclosure to refer more generally to any region or area at which contact is made.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various detectors may be used as imaging sensor <b>208</b> including, for example, charge-coupled devices (CCDs), photo-diodes or complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors. In some cases, a lens is placed in front of imaging sensor <b>208</b> to focus light on sensor <b>208</b>. Alternatively, or in addition the imaging sensor <b>208</b> may include one or more waveguides and/or lenses to assist guiding the incident radiation towards a detection area of a sensing device. The output of imaging sensor <b>208</b> is supplied to a suitable computer (not shown) or other electronic device capable of handling image-processing operations, such as rectification, background subtraction, noise removal, and analysis for each video frame. Machine vision tracking techniques then may be employed by the computer or other electronic device to translate the captured images into discrete touch events and strokes. Such processing may be carried out by any suitable computing system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, touch sensitive device <b>200</b> also is combined with a rear-projection source <b>230</b> (e.g., a video projector) that is capable of displaying visible images. Accordingly, touch sensitive device <b>200</b> can function as both a sensing and display device at the same time. In implementations where a rear-projection source <b>230</b> is used to generate output images, frustrating layer <b>206</b> may be configured to be diffusive in the visible spectrum such that frustrating layer <b>206</b> may operate as a screen onto which the output images projected by rear-projection source <b>230</b> are projected. Alternatively, device <b>200</b> may be configured to include a separate screen that includes a diffusive material or layer, which is diffusive in the visible spectrum such that the diffusive material or layer may operate as a screen onto which the output images projected by rear-projection source <b>230</b> are projected. The diffusive material/layer of the projection screen can be combined either alone or in combination with another diffuser film.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows projection source <b>230</b> arranged alongside imaging sensor <b>208</b>, projection source <b>230</b> also can be disposed at other locations and/or away from imaging sensor <b>208</b>, generally with the aid of suitable optics devices. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, device <b>200</b> may include a single imaging sensor <b>208</b> and a single projection source <b>230</b>. In certain implementations, the distance between imaging sensor <b>208</b> and pliable waveguide <b>204</b> is large enough such that a field of view of sensor <b>208</b> is capable of imaging/detecting radiation escaping from waveguide <b>204</b> at substantially any point of contact along the surface of waveguide <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">However, in other implementations, multiple projectors can be employed so that different images/videos can be projected onto different respective portions of a display. Alternatively, or in addition, multiple imaging sensors can be employed so that each image sensor has a field of view capable of imaging/detecting radiation escaping from different portions of waveguide <b>204</b>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates one example of the use of multiple imaging sensors <b>208</b> within an FTIR-based touch sensitive device. Given the relatively small corresponding field of view, each imaging sensor <b>208</b> may be located closer to pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. Accordingly, in some cases, thinner FTIR-based touch sensitive devices may be manufactured. In implementations of FTIR-based touch sensitive devices containing multiple imaging sensors, the imaging sensors and projectors may be spaced apart from one another along a single axis, multiple axes, along a grid system, or in other suitable manners. For example, the imaging sensors can be arranged such that there is no overlap between the field of view of adjacent sensors <b>208</b>. Alternatively, the imaging sensors can be arranged such that the field of view of at least one sensor <b>208</b> overlaps with the field of view of one or more adjacent sensors <b>208</b>. The output generated by each sensor then may be supplied to a suitable computer (not shown) or other electronic device capable of handling image-processing operations, and modified to form a composite image/data map corresponding to all or substantially all of the area over which points of contact with pliable waveguide <b>204</b> can be made. The composite image/data map then may be used to determine where along waveguide <b>204</b> points of contact occur.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Radiation source <b>202</b> can include multiple light emitting diodes (LEDs), which are arranged directly against an edge of waveguide <b>204</b> so as to maximize coupling of electromagnetic radiation into total internal reflection. Other sources of electromagnetic radiation, such as, for example, laser diodes, may be used instead. In some implementations, source <b>202</b> can be selected to emit radiation in the infrared (IR) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum such that its emissions do not interfere with visible light if device <b>200</b> is integrated into a display.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, pliable waveguide <b>204</b> is formed from materials that support TIR of infrared light. In addition, when integrated as part of a display, pliable waveguide <b>204</b> may be selected so as to be transparent (or at least transmissive) to the range of wavelengths emitted by a display light source so as to minimize interference with the display. In some cases, the edges of pliable waveguide <b>204</b> are polished to maximize TIR coupling of radiation from source <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, waveguide <b>204</b> may be configured to have a substantially uniform thickness that is within a range of approximately 0.50 mm through 2 mm. In selecting an appropriate thickness for waveguide <b>204</b>, the following considerations may be taken into account. If waveguide <b>204</b> is too thin, an insufficient amount of radiation may be coupled into waveguide <b>204</b> from source <b>202</b>. In implementations that utilize one or more lasers for light source <b>202</b>, however, it may be possible to use a thinner waveguide <b>204</b> and still have a sufficient amount of radiation couple into the waveguide <b>204</b> than in implementations that utilize one or more LEDs as light source <b>202</b>. Alternatively, if waveguide <b>204</b> is too thick, the waveguide may degrade the quality of output images displayed by the device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some cases, contacting waveguide <b>204</b> with a finger, stylus or other object can cause inadvertent frustration of total internal reflection within waveguide <b>204</b> even if waveguide <b>204</b> is not depressed enough to come into contact with frustrating layer <b>206</b>. In addition, such objects may damage waveguide <b>204</b>. Accordingly, in some implementations, a cladding layer <b>205</b> is positioned on top of pliable waveguide <b>204</b>, either in optical contact with waveguide <b>204</b> or layered with a thin air gap between cladding layer <b>205</b> and waveguide <b>204</b>. If the cladding layer is in optical contact with the waveguide, cladding layer <b>205</b> is formed of a material that has a refractive index lower than waveguide <b>204</b> to maintain total internal reflection of radiation within waveguide <b>204</b>. Cladding layer <b>205</b> may prevent the occurrence of inadvertent FTIR and serves as a barrier between waveguide <b>204</b> and a contacting object. In addition, cladding layer <b>205</b> protects waveguide <b>204</b> from damage and/or contamination when waveguide <b>204</b> is contacted by an object such as a finger or stylus. When integrated as part of a display, cladding layer <b>205</b> also is transparent (or at least transmissive) to the range of wavelengths emitted by a display light source. For example, cladding layer can be formed of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or acrylic film.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the cladding layer includes multiple layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a cross-sectional schematic of an example of a cladding layer <b>205</b> positioned above a waveguide <b>204</b>, in which cladding layer <b>205</b> includes an anti-glare layer <b>205</b><i>a</i>, an infrared (IR) filter <b>205</b><i>b </i>and a non-wetting layer <b>205</b><i>c</i>. IR filter layer <b>205</b><i>b </i>functions to filter out ambient IR light incident on touch-sensitive device <b>200</b> so as to reduce (e.g., prevent) occurrences in which image sensors <b>208</b> detect the ambient IR light and erroneously detect contact with device <b>200</b>. An example of material that can be used in an IR filter layer includes CLEARAS, commercially available from Sumitomo Osaka Cement Co., Ltd. Anti-glare layer <b>205</b><i>a </i>is a scratch-resistant, low friction film disposed on a top surface of IR filter layer <b>205</b><i>b</i>. A film that can be used as an anti-glare layer includes, for example, a textured polyester film such as AUTOTEX, which is commercially available from MacDermid Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some cases, substantial regions of cladding layer <b>205</b> may contact the pliable waveguide such that cladding layer <b>205</b> appears to &#x201c;wet&#x201d; the pliable waveguide. Such regions of &#x201c;wetting&#x201d; may inadvertently induce frustration of total internal reflection within the waveguide <b>204</b>. Furthermore, the wetting regions may alter the amount of visible light that is reflected between waveguide and cladding layer resulting in portions of touch-sensitive device <b>200</b> that appear as blotches when dark images are displayed. By forming anti-wetting layer <b>205</b><i>c </i>on a bottom surface of IR filter layer <b>205</b><i>b</i>, however, the size and number of wetting regions may be reduced. Similar to anti-glare layer <b>205</b><i>a</i>, anti-wetting layer <b>205</b><i>c </i>also may be a polyester film, such as AUTOTEX.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The films in cladding layer <b>205</b> may be bonded together using, for example, an optical adhesive. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, an air gap exists between cladding layer <b>205</b> and pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. The air gap between cladding layer <b>205</b> and pliable waveguide <b>204</b> may be maintained using, for example, the surface roughness of the bottom surface of cladding layer <b>205</b> (e.g., surface roughness of the non-wetting layer <b>205</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, liquid crystal display (LCD) technology or light emitting diode (LED) display technology, which includes organic light emitting diode (OLED) display technology, may be used to generate output display images instead of rear projection technology. Employing LCD or LED display technology instead of rear projection technology enables a touch-sensitive device that has reduced volume and thickness compared to a device which utilizes projector technology. Using either LEDs, OLEDs or LCD panels also may increase portability. Such &#x201c;thin-panel&#x201d; touch-sensitive systems can be used in laptop screens, flat-panel displays, PDA's and cell phones, among other devices. LCD panels, LED and OLED arrays can be used as the light source in any of the examples and implementations described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic diagram of a cross-section of a touch sensitive device <b>270</b> that employs an LCD panel <b>240</b> and backlight <b>250</b> to generate a visible display. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the LCD panel <b>240</b> and backlight <b>250</b> are disposed beneath frustrating layer <b>206</b>. In the particular implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, LCD panel <b>240</b> is arranged so that it is fixed to a bottom surface of frustrating layer <b>206</b>. Although not shown, LCD panel <b>240</b> may include one or more components or layers such as, for example, a liquid crystal layer, a color filter layer, one or more polarizer layers, one or more electrode layers, and a substrate layer (e.g., a glass substrate). Other layers or components can be included as well. Similarly, LED and OLED panels can include, but are not limited to, one or more layers or components, such as a light emitting diode layer, an electrode layer, an adhesive/encapsulant layer and a substrate layer (e.g., a glass substrate).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some implementations, frustrating layer <b>206</b> is directly bonded to LCD panel <b>240</b> using, for example, optical adhesive (not shown) having an index of refraction substantially close in value, e.g., within about 0.1, to the index of refraction of both frustrating layer <b>206</b> and LCD panel <b>240</b> to provide an optical contact between frustrating layer <b>206</b> and LCD panel <b>240</b>. Optical adhesives, for example, may be optically clear pressure sensitive acrylics or silicones. In addition to adhering frustrating layer <b>206</b> to LCD panel <b>240</b>, the presence of the optical adhesive can, in some instances, reduce reflections and/or interference that would otherwise occur due to the refractive index contrast at the surfaces of LCD panel <b>240</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b>. In particular, air gaps, which have a relatively low refractive index (n=1), are replaced with optical adhesive having a higher refractive index (n&#x3e;1). Moreover, in some cases, the optical adhesive fills in roughness between the facing surfaces of panel <b>240</b> and layer <b>206</b>, which would otherwise lead to additional light scattering. By reducing the amount of light reflected back toward the viewer, the image contrast provided by touch sensitive device <b>270</b> can be improved. Although frustrating layer <b>206</b> is shown fixed to LCD panel <b>240</b>, frustrating layer <b>206</b> can, in some cases, be arranged in the FTIR-based touch sensitive device such that it does not adhere to the LCD panel <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Individual pixel portions within LCD panel <b>240</b> can be configured to block or transmit visible light, represented by arrows &#x201c;C,&#x201d; emitted by backlight <b>250</b> in order to display an image. Furthermore, LCD panel <b>240</b> may be transparent to infrared light so that infrared light that escapes from surface <b>204</b><i>a </i>of pliable waveguide <b>204</b> passes through LCD panel <b>240</b> and can be imaged by imaging sensor <b>208</b>. In some implementations, LEDs (or OLEDs) can be used as the light source in FTIR-based touch sensitive devices Because LEDs (OLEDs) themselves are emissive elements, in implementations in which LEDs (OLEDs) are used to generate output images, there may be no need for a backlight (e.g., backlight <b>250</b>). Similar to LCD panel <b>240</b>, such LEDs (OLEDs) may be transparent to infrared light and may be arranged in a layer that is bonded to frustrating layer <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some implementations, the display device can include one or more image sensors <b>208</b> as part of the display device (e.g., image sensors <b>208</b> may be embedded on or within the display device). In some cases, LCD panel <b>240</b> may include photosensors alternating with thin film transistors that drive the liquid crystal cells of LCD panel <b>240</b>. The photosensors may be made of photodiodes that are sensitive to IR light such as, for example, amorphous hydrogenated silicon germanium, a-SiGe:H photodiodes. The bandgap of such sensors is about 1.45 eV and could be used to detect light having a wavelength of approximately 850 nm. Alternatively, the photodiode material may have a bandgap tuned to match the wavelength of the source radiation. Given that the thin film transistors may also use an amorphous semiconductor, the photosensors can, in some implementations, be located on the same substrate that is used to support the thin film transistors. In order to detect primarily IR light as opposed to visible light, the photosensors may be covered with a filter that passes light in the IR wavelength range while reflecting or absorbing light having different wavelengths. An advantage of the foregoing implementation is that it enables touch sensitive devices that are thinner than devices that use discrete cameras situated beneath and apart from the display device. Other display devices also may include embedded photosensors. For example, an active matrix OLED device may include IR photodiodes alternating with OLED cells.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, radiation that escapes compliant waveguide <b>204</b> due to FTIR when the compliant waveguide <b>204</b> contacts frustrating layer <b>206</b> may travel in many different directions due to, for example, the surface texture of frustrating layer <b>206</b>, bulk scattering within frustrating layer <b>206</b> or incomplete contact between compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b>. For instance, some of the radiation that escapes from compliant waveguide <b>204</b> may travel in a direction away from frustrating layer <b>206</b>, while some of the escaped radiation may travel towards frustrating layer <b>206</b>. As a result, a portion of the escaped radiation, as shown by arrows &#x201c;B&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> (and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), may never reach imaging sensor <b>208</b>. One approach to enable capture of a sufficient amount of light from the frustrated TIR to yield position, despite the escaped radiation that never is imaged by imaging sensor <b>208</b>, may be to increase the intensity of the radiation injected into the pliable waveguide <b>204</b>. This approach, however, may cause operating efficiency to be diminished. Therefore, an alternative approach may be to configure frustrating layer <b>206</b> to collect and/or steer radiation that escapes compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and that is incident on frustrating layer <b>206</b> toward imaging sensor <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An additional alternative approach is to incorporate a light-steering layer <b>260</b> within the touch sensitive display device (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be configured to collect radiation that escapes from pliable waveguide <b>204</b> due to FTIR and modify the direction of the collected radiation. In some implementations, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be a diffusive layer (e.g., a surface diffuser or a volumetric diffuser). Additionally or alternatively, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be configured to steer incident light in one or more specific directions (e.g., toward imaging sensor <b>208</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Similar to frustrating layer <b>206</b>, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be formed of either a rigid or non-rigid material. In addition, when integrated as part of a display, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be formed from a material that is transparent (or at least transmissive) to the range of wavelengths emitted by a display light source. For example, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be formed from PMMA, TPU, PVC, PVB, PET, triacetate cellulose (TAC) or PC. Other materials can be used as well. In some implementations, a light diffuser, which is typically incorporated in the LCD backlight, also can function as the light-steering layer. In some implementations, light-steering layer <b>260</b> can be bonded to a bottom surface of LCD panel <b>240</b>. Light-steering layer <b>260</b> can be bonded to a bottom surface of LCD panel <b>240</b> using optical adhesive to provide an optical contact between light-steering layer <b>260</b> and LCD panel <b>240</b>. Alternatively, if LED (OLED) display technology is employed in place of LCD display technology, light-steering layer <b>260</b> can be bonded to a bottom surface of the LEDs (OLEDs) using, for example, optical adhesive to provide an optical contact.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In implementations in which frustrating layer <b>206</b> is configured to collect and/or steer radiation that escapes compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and that is incident on layer <b>206</b> toward imaging sensor <b>208</b>, frustrating layer <b>206</b> may be configured to steer escaped radiation to within a range of angles such that the escaped radiation is steered towards a position on the imaging sensor <b>208</b> that is substantially beneath the point of contact between compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b>. By collecting and steering radiation towards the optimal area of imaging sensor <b>208</b>, the operating efficiency of touch sensitive devices <b>200</b> and <b>270</b> may be increased. As a result, less powerful radiation sources <b>202</b> may be used, and stray light issues may be reduced. Furthermore, by steering more of the FTIR escaped radiation towards imaging sensor <b>208</b>, the probability of failing to sense contact with devices <b>200</b> and <b>270</b> may be reduced. The frustrating layer may be formed from an engineered material having light-steering microstructures formed within or on a surface of the engineered material, with the light-steering microstructures being configured to steer radiation/light in one or more particular directions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Similarly, in implementations in which light-steering layer <b>260</b> is configured to collect and/or steer radiation that escapes from compliant waveguide <b>204</b>, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be configured to steer escaped radiation to within a range of angles such that the escaped radiation is steered towards a position at least one of the imaging sensors <b>208</b> that is substantially beneath the point of contact between compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and frustrating layer <b>206</b>, as shown by arrows &#x201c;A&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Light-steering layer <b>260</b> may be formed from an engineered material having light-steering microstructures formed within or on a surface of the engineered material, with the light-steering microstructures being configured to steer radiation/light in one or more particular directions. Such light-steering microstructures may be adhered to or formed within or on the back surface of LCD panel <b>240</b>, such that radiation/light is steered in one or more particular directions after passing through LCD panel <b>240</b>. Similarly, engineered materials having light-steering microstructures may be adhered to or formed within or on the back surface of other light sources such as LED devices and OLED devices. Various implementations of such engineered materials and light-steering microstructure(s) for re-directing radiation that escapes from waveguide <b>204</b> may be employed within or on the frustrating layer <b>206</b> or light-steering layer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Light-steering layer <b>260</b> may include, in addition to or as an alternative to light-steering microstructures, a diffuser layer. The diffuser layer can be configured to collect and/or steer radiation escaping compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and incident on the light-steering layer <b>260</b> toward imaging sensor <b>208</b>. In particular, the diffuser layer may cause incident radiation to propagate in a direction generally beneath a point at which the radiation escapes compliant waveguide <b>204</b> or to generally spread in a broad range of directions instead of very limited or specific directions. The diffuser layer may be formed of material including, but not limited to, PET, PVC, PVB, PMMA or PC. The diffuser layer may have a substantially uniform thickness of about 100 microns, although other thicknesses may be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some implementations, diffuser layer can include surface diffusing structures that are formed on or within a surface of a material such as LCD panel <b>240</b>. In some cases, the surface diffusing structures are formed by roughening a surface of a material in LCD panel <b>240</b>. For example, surface diffusing structures may be formed by roughening a surface of a glass substrate or polarizer layer of LCD panel <b>240</b> to form a surface that diffuses radiation that has escaped from compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and is incident on LCD panel <b>240</b>. Similarly, if an LED or OLED device is used in place of LCD panel <b>240</b>, a surface of a material in the LED or OLED device such as, for example, a glass substrate can be roughened to form a surface that diffuses radiation that has escaped from compliant waveguide <b>204</b> and is incident on LCD panel <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The surface of components within or fixed to LCD panel <b>240</b> can be roughened using one or more methods. For example, in some implementations, a roughened &#x201c;master surface&#x201d; can be used as a mold for forming a rough surface on the material on or within LCD panel <b>240</b>. Initially, the master surface may be a smooth surface (e.g., a smooth glass or metal surface) that is roughened using abrasives including, for example, sandpaper, sandblasting, or hard powders. The roughened surface may also be created by treating the originally smooth master surface with an etchant (e.g., an acid) to create random pits in the smooth surface. For example, clear glass may be roughened by etching the surface with hydrofluoric acid. Other methods for roughening can be used as well. The roughened master surface then may be used to emboss the rough pattern into a plastic film, such as a polarizer of LCD panel <b>240</b>. Instead of using a master surface for embossing, the material within or on LCD panel <b>240</b> may be roughened directly using the same techniques as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some implementations, the roughened surface, whether as a part of a polarizer, glass substrate or other component within or on LCD panel <b>240</b>, has a level of average roughness (i.e., the arithmetic average of a surface deviation from average depth) in the range of about 0.2 to 50 microns Ra. In some cases, the roughened surface also has a root mean squared roughness of about 0.2 to 50 microns. A level of diffusion for light incident on a roughened surface may be measured in terms of light spreading angle (i.e., the approximate angular distribution of incident collimated light after it passes through the diffuser). In some implementations, diffusers with the foregoing levels of roughness have diffusion angles over approximately 160 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Alternatively, or in addition to surface diffusing structures, a diffuser layer can include volume diffusing structures that are formed integrally through at least a portion of the material bulk. In some implementations, the engineered microstructures may be employed within or on a surface of the diffuser layer.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some implementations, radiation that escapes from pliable waveguide <b>204</b> due to FTIR may become trapped within LCD panel <b>240</b> (or LED device) after being received by LCD panel <b>240</b> (or LED device). In such cases, light-steering layer <b>260</b> may, when placed in contact with or formed on or within a surface of LCD panel <b>240</b> (or LED device), function as a coupling layer to couple the trapped radiation out of LCD panel <b>240</b> (or LED device). In some implementations, LCD panel <b>240</b> (or LED device) can be placed in optical contact with light-steering layer <b>260</b> using, for example, an optical adhesive having an index of refraction substantially close in value to a bottom surface of LCD panel <b>240</b> (or LED device) and light-steering layer <b>260</b> to enhance out-coupling of trapped radiation. In addition to adhering LCD panel <b>240</b> to light-steering layer <b>260</b>, the presence of the optical adhesive can, in some instances, reduce reflections that would otherwise occur due to the refractive index mismatch and surface roughness at the surfaces of LCD panel <b>240</b> and light-steering layer <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some cases, the engineered microstructures which are employed on or within frustrating layer and/or light-steering layer include diffractive optical elements (DOEs). In general, a DOE structure is a structure that includes a pattern of refractive index variations on the order of a wavelength of light and which primarily diffracts incident radiation. A DOE structure can be generated digitally or recorded optically as an interference pattern between two wavefronts of coherent light. In some implementations, the patterns of refractive index variations in the DOEs may be formed by transferring an interference pattern to material such that a series of fringes representing intensity minima and maxima of the interference pattern correspond to the patterns of refractive index variation. For example, interference patterns can be transferred to a recording material using techniques such as interference lithography. The pattern can be represented by a periodic, random, semi-random, or mathematically complex, deterministic variation of refractive index or thickness across one or more different materials. In some cases, the fringes of the transferred interference pattern correspond to a grating structure. Depending on the design and construction, a DOE structure transmits or reflects incident radiation in one or more directions. DOE structures can include surface diffusing structures that are formed on or within a surface of a material, or volume diffusing structures that are formed integrally through at least a portion of the material bulk.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">DOE structures include a class of structures called holographic optical elements (HOE) that may be considered to fall within two categories: thin hologram structures and thick (volume) hologram structures. In general, thin hologram structures include surface structures or planes of refractive index variation that vary substantially perpendicularly to the surface on which the radiation is incident and are generally used to transmissively steer a range of wavelengths into one or more particular directions. They can be used in conjunction with a separate reflective means, such as a mirror, to operate reflectively. Thick hologram structures, on the other hand, can include planes of refractive index variations that run substantially parallel to the surface on which radiation is incident, and generally use Bragg selectivity to reflect or transmit a narrow range of wavelengths incident at one or more specific incident angles into one or more particular directions.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some implementations, the planes of refractive index variations in the HOEs may be formed by transferring an interference pattern to material such that a series of fringes representing intensity minima and maxima of the interference pattern correspond to the planes of refractive index variation. For example, interference patterns can be transferred to a recording material using techniques such as interference lithography. In some cases, the fringes of the transferred interference pattern correspond to a grating structure.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Optical modeling software packages are available to facilitate the design of thin or thick hologram structures to direct radiation in a desired direction. CODE V&#xae; is one example of such an optical modeling software package that can be used to design thin or thick hologram structures to direct radiation in a desired direction. Other optical modeling software packages also are available.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Examples of frustrating layers having several different types of thin hologram structures for steering escaped radiation are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>. The various different frustrating layers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> can be incorporated within touch sensitive devices, such as, for example, the touch sensitive devices <b>200</b> and <b>270</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a cross-section of a pliable waveguide <b>304</b> that includes cladding layer <b>305</b> and a frustrating layer <b>306</b> that includes a thin hologram structure <b>309</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, thin hologram structure <b>309</b> is formed on a surface of substrate <b>303</b> and comes into contact with compliant waveguide <b>304</b>. Thin hologram structure <b>309</b> has a 1-bit binary (or more generally square-wave) diffraction grating profile. Grating <b>309</b> may be formed from the same material as frustrating layer <b>306</b> or from a different material. Grating <b>309</b> may be formed from a series of regularly spaced structures <b>311</b> having thicknesses h and widths w that are spaced apart from one another by a distance d. Furthermore, the length of structures <b>311</b> extends uniformly across the surface of frustrating layer <b>306</b> (i.e., into and out of the page). The direction of radiation transmitted by grating layer <b>309</b> is a function of the periodicity, &#x3a0;=w+d, of grating structures <b>311</b> and the radiation wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some cases, grating layer <b>309</b> may include a cladding layer <b>313</b>. In such implementations, the cladding layer <b>313</b> protects grating structures <b>311</b> of grating layer <b>309</b> from damage and may fill the spaces between grating structures <b>311</b>. Grating structures <b>311</b> and cladding layer <b>313</b> may be formed from material that is transmissive to radiation having a wavelength equal to the wavelength of radiation <b>310</b> traveling through waveguide <b>304</b>. If the touch sensitive device incorporates a display, grating structures <b>311</b> and cladding layer <b>313</b> also may be transparent (or at least transmissive) to the wavelengths of radiation (e.g., visible light) used to generate the display. The cladding <b>313</b> can be formed of a material that has a refractive index comparable to or greater than the refractive index of waveguide <b>304</b> to allow FTIR to occur upon contact with waveguide <b>304</b>. In addition, cladding layer <b>313</b> can be formed to have a thickness t that is greater than thickness h of grating structures <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Protrusions <b>314</b> maintain a small gap <b>312</b> between frustrating layer <b>306</b> and compliant waveguide <b>304</b> when an external stimulus is not present. When pressure is applied by an input (not shown) to a portion of pliable waveguide <b>304</b>, pliable waveguide <b>304</b> is deformed and a surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of pliable waveguide <b>304</b> comes into contact with frustrating layer <b>306</b>. As a result, a portion of radiation <b>310</b> traveling through pliable waveguide <b>304</b> undergoes FTIR. The portion of radiation <b>310</b> which undergoes FTIR then escapes from compliant waveguide <b>304</b> in multiple directions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, transmissive thin hologram structure <b>309</b> steers radiation that escapes from pliable waveguide <b>304</b> in a direction generally perpendicular to a surface of frustrating layer <b>306</b> that is in contact with waveguide <b>304</b>, so that the escaped radiation is aligned with the point of contact between compliant waveguide <b>304</b> and frustrating layer <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates thin hologram structure <b>309</b> being formed on a surface <b>306</b><i>a </i>of frustrating layer <b>306</b> that comes into contact with waveguide <b>304</b>, a thin hologram structure additionally or alternatively can be formed on a surface of a frustrating layer that does not come into contact with waveguide <b>304</b>. Accordingly, in some implementations, interference between visible light, emitted from an LCD panel or display source, and the hologram structure can be reduced. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic diagram of a cross-section of a pliable waveguide <b>404</b> that includes cladding layer <b>405</b> and a frustrating layer <b>406</b> that includes a transmissive diffraction grating <b>409</b> formed on a surface <b>406</b><i>b </i>of frustrating layer <b>406</b> that is opposite from the surface <b>406</b><i>a </i>that makes contact with pliable waveguide <b>404</b>. Similar to grating <b>309</b>, grating <b>409</b> may include a series of regularly spaced grating structures <b>411</b>. A portion of radiation that escapes from waveguide <b>404</b> travels through frustrating layer <b>406</b> and then is re-directed by grating <b>409</b> in a direction that is generally perpendicular to a surface <b>406</b><i>a </i>of frustrating layer <b>406</b> and that is aligned with the point of contact between compliant waveguide <b>404</b> and frustrating layer <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Other variations of thin hologram structures having surface-relief profiles also may be incorporated within or added to a frustrating layer to steer radiation in a desired direction. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a grating structure <b>509</b> formed on a surface of a frustrating layer <b>506</b> in which the depth h of the surface-relief does not extend all the way to the surface of frustrating layer <b>506</b>. That is to say, grating structure <b>509</b> is offset from a surface of frustrating layer <b>509</b>. As in previous examples, at least a portion of radiation propagating by TIR in waveguide <b>504</b> may escape when waveguide <b>504</b> is depressed so as to come into contact with frustrating layer <b>509</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another example of a frustrating layer <b>606</b> which can be used to frustrate TIR in a waveguide <b>604</b>. Frustrating layer <b>606</b> includes a grating layer <b>609</b> having a multi-level or multiple-bit modulated binary profile. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the multiple-bit modulated binary profile includes ridges <b>611</b> and grooves <b>613</b> separated by shelves <b>615</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition to merely steering radiation in a desired direction, thin film hologram structures also can be used to improve the efficiency with which radiation is transmitted in a particular direction. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a frustrating layer <b>706</b> for frustrating TIR in a waveguide <b>704</b>, in which a blazed grating structure <b>709</b> is formed on a surface of frustrating layer <b>706</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the grooves of the diffraction grating <b>709</b> form a triangle profile with a blaze angle, &#x3b1;. The blaze angle &#x3b1; is a measure of the blaze slope with respect to a normal to the plane on which the blaze structure <b>709</b> is formed. Changing the spacing between the blazed ridges determines the output direction (the separation between diffractive orders) of the transmitted radiation while changing the blaze angle &#x3b1; affects the efficiency in which incident radiation is transmitted in a particular diffractive order.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Grating structures formed within or on frustrating layers can have other profile shapes besides binary and blazed profiles. For example, grating structures can be formed to have a sinusoidal profile (i.e., symmetrical, sine-wave shaped grooves) or semi-sinusoidal (i.e., symmetrical, half sine-wave shaped grooves) profile. A wide range of profiles can be fabricated using diamond-turning machines to generate master structures, which can then be replicated. Holographic optical elements can be considered as a generalized case of gratings, where the structure can be periodic, aperiodic, random or noisy, or some combination of these. In addition, they can also vary continuously or discretely (piecewise) across their aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Although the thin hologram structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-7</figref> are periodic, thin film holograms having aperiodic grating structures also can be formed within or on a frustrating layer to control radiation received by the frustrating layer. In some cases, the thin film hologram structure comprises a diffraction pattern in which fringes of the diffraction pattern are arranged in an aperiodic pattern. The fringes of the diffraction pattern may correspond to regions in which an intensity of light transmitted or reflected by the diffraction pattern is a minima or maxima. Alternatively, or in addition, the fringes may correspond to planes of refractive index variation. Such non-periodic hologram structures may further increase efficiency and/or wavelength selectivity. In some implementations, an aperiodic hologram structure designed to transmit a large portion of escaped radiation in a particular direction may include profiles that are semi-random or random. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a frustrating layer <b>806</b> for frustrating TIR in a waveguide <b>804</b>, in which frustrating layer <b>806</b> includes a thin hologram structure <b>809</b> having a random/aperiodic profile <b>809</b><i>a</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the height of structure <b>809</b> varies over frustrating layer <b>806</b>, thus acting as a diffuser or noise grating with air or other cladding in which incident radiation is exposed to a variation in refractive index. Furthermore, a semi-random diffuser pattern can be designed to diffract the light into a desired range of angles. Two examples of such designed diffusers are the LIGHT SHAPING DIFFUSERS&#xae; made by Luminit&#x2122; Corporation of Torrence, Calif. and MICRODIFFUSERS&#xae; by Wavefront Technology of Paramount, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The thin film hologram structures described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> can be formed from the same or a different material than the frustrating layer. For example, diffusers, thin holograms, and gratings can be embossed onto a substrate formed of PET, PMMA or PC. The embossing shims are made from diamond-turned, digitally or optically generated masters. Another common means of replication is to photo-cure impressions of the structures in resin on a PET or other substrate material. Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, a cladding layer (not shown) having approximately uniform thickness throughout may be disposed on a surface of the thin film hologram structures described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref>. The cladding layer may be formed from a material that is transparent (or at least transmissive) to visible light emitted by the display source and can protect the thin film hologram structures from damage.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As discussed above, thick hologram structures are another type of DOE structure that can be formed within or on a frustrating layer to steer radiation that escapes a waveguide due to FTIR when the waveguide comes into contact with the frustrating layer. One characteristic of thick holograms is that the hologram is made up of layers corresponding to a periodic variation of transmittance or refractive index that is, to at least some extent, parallel to the hologram surface on which the radiation is incident. In thick holograms, light is transmitted by means of Bragg diffraction, i.e., light having the correct wavelength and beam shape (e.g., beam direction, wavefront profile) will be preferentially transmitted by the thick hologram whereas other light will be reflected or absorbed. Thus, in contrast to thin hologram structures, a thick hologram structure serves to transmit a relatively small range of wavelengths across a narrow range of incident angles into a relatively small range of output angles. For example, radiation having a wavelength of 850 nm undergoing FTIR may be transmitted by a thick hologram structure towards a normal of the waveguide in which the radiation travels, whereas visible light can travel unaffected through the thick hologram structure.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Thick hologram structures lead to generally higher diffraction efficiency than in thin hologram structures. Diffraction efficiency corresponds to the amount of light diffracted by the hologram relative to the total amount of light incident on the hologram. Thick holograms can be replicated from optically generated masters into photopolymer by contact copying.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic diagram of a cross-section of an example frustrating layer <b>906</b> for frustrating TIR in a waveguide <b>904</b>, in which the frustrating layer <b>906</b> includes a thick hologram structure <b>909</b>. Thick hologram structure <b>909</b> includes layers of material having a variation in refractive index. Due to the refractive index variation, the layers of material form a series of fringe planes <b>930</b>. Fringe planes <b>930</b> control either the reflection or transmission of incident radiation in a manner similar to a multilayer dielectric film. The material and dimensions of the layers of refractive index modulated material in a thick hologram structure are configured to transmit radiation received by frustrating layer <b>906</b> within a particular range of angles. Example materials for a thick hologram structure include photopolymer and bleached silver halide. In some implementations, thick hologram structures are formed integrally with frustrating layer <b>906</b>, i.e., thick hologram structures, together with frustrating layer <b>906</b>, form a single mass of seamless, contiguous material. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, thick hologram structure <b>909</b> occupies the entire thickness of frustrating layer <b>906</b>. In some cases, however, thick hologram <b>909</b> can be formed separate from and on a surface of frustrating layer <b>909</b> instead of being incorporated within frustrating layer <b>909</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref> illustrate different hologram structures for steering radiation that escapes from the pliable waveguide. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>, these hologram structures are formed either on the surface of or within the volume of a frustrating layer. As an alternative (or in addition) to forming these hologram structures on the surface of or within the volume of the frustrating layer, each of these hologram structures may be formed on the bottom surface of an LCD layer (similarly to how light-steering layer <b>260</b> is formed on the bottom surface of LCD layer <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), within the volume of a diffusive layer (e.g., light-steering layer <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) that is adhered to the bottom surface of an LCD layer (e.g., LCD layer <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), or on the bottom surface of a diffusive layer (e.g., light-steering layer <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Locating the hologram structures beneath the LCD layer may result in less interference with output images generated by the LCD layer than locating the hologram structures on a surface of or within the frustrating layer because, when the hologram structures are located beneath the LCD layer, they are not in the optical path between the LCD layer and a viewer.</p>

Hologram structure <b>1009</b> is formed on a top surface of an LCD panel <b>1040</b> and is configured to re-direct radiation towards an imaging sensor. Similar to hologram structure <b>909</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, structure <b>1009</b> is a thick hologram and includes layers of material having a variation in refractive index. Due to the refractive index variation, the layers of material form a series of fringe planes <b>1030</b>. Other diffractive optical elements may be formed on LCD panel <b>1040</b>, as well.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In contrast to the implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, in some implementations, thick hologram structure <b>1009</b> is formed on a bottom surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b> (i.e., on a surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b> that is opposite from frustrating layer <b>1006</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. Locating the hologram structure <b>1009</b> beneath LCD panel <b>1040</b> may reduce interference with output images emitted by LCD panel <b>1040</b>. As shown in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10B</figref>, radiation undergoing TIR in waveguide <b>1004</b> having cladding layer <b>1005</b> is frustrated upon contact with frustrating layer <b>1006</b>. The frustrated radiation propagates through frustrating layer <b>1006</b>. Upon reaching hologram structure <b>1009</b> bonded to either the front or the rear surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b>, the radiation then is steered by the hologram structure <b>1009</b> within a narrow range of angles that are substantially orthogonal to the plane <b>1006</b><i>a </i>of frustrating layer <b>1006</b>. Accordingly, the radiation then proceeds towards a position on an imaging sensor that is substantially beneath the point of contact between compliant waveguide <b>1004</b> and frustrating layer <b>1006</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When frustrating layer <b>1006</b> is laminated to LCD panel <b>1040</b>, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, radiation that escapes from pliable waveguide <b>1004</b> due to FTIR may become trapped within LCD panel <b>1040</b> (e.g., by TIR) after being received by LCD panel <b>1040</b>. However, when hologram structure <b>1009</b> is placed in optical contact with a bottom surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, hologram structure <b>1009</b> can, in some implementations, serve to couple the trapped radiation out of LCD panel <b>1040</b>. Alternatively, if hologram structure <b>1009</b> is on a top surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b>, a coupling layer may be placed in contact with the bottom surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b> to couple trapped radiation out of LCD panel <b>1040</b>. In some implementations, hologram structure <b>1009</b> on a top surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b> is configured to steer radiation that escapes from pliable waveguide <b>1004</b> along angles that are less than a critical angle of LCD panel <b>1040</b>, as measured with respect to a normal to a bottom surface of LCD panel <b>1040</b>. Accordingly, the radiation can escape LCD panel <b>1040</b> without becoming trapped. In such implementations, a coupling layer such as, for example, a PET based diffuser, may still be placed in contact with LCD panel <b>1040</b> to supplement the light steering of hologram structure <b>1009</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In both examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A-10B</figref>, hologram structure <b>1009</b> can be bonded to LCD panel <b>1040</b> using optical adhesive. In addition to adhering LCD panel <b>1040</b> to hologram structure <b>1009</b>, the presence of the optical adhesive can, in some instances, reduce reflections that would otherwise occur due to the refractive index mismatch (which may occur, for example, at an air gap at the interface between LCD panel <b>1040</b> and hologram structure <b>1009</b>) and surface roughness at the surfaces of LCD panel <b>1040</b> and the hologram structure <b>1009</b>. Similarly, hologram structure <b>1009</b> and/or LCD panel <b>1040</b> can be bonded to frustrating layer <b>1006</b>, depending on the configuration employed. By reducing the amount of light reflected back toward a viewer, the image contrast provided by touch sensitive device can be improved. As an alternative to bonding hologram structure <b>1009</b> to LCD panel <b>1040</b>, in some implementations, hologram structure <b>1009</b> may be formed as a separate layer that is not in optical and/or physical contact with the frustrating layer <b>1006</b> or the LCD panel <b>1040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">By dividing the thick hologram into a number of sub-holograms, each of which directs light of the desired wavelength into a different direction, it is possible to efficiently &#x201c;position encode&#x201d; the light impinging upon the frustrating layer according to its position at the point of incidence on the hologram. Thus, light incident from a given point of contact can be directed toward a camera or into a waveguide with a direction corresponding to the point of contact.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition to, or as an alternative to, reflective layers and DOE structures, refractive optical elements (ROE) also may be employed as engineered microstructures on or within frustrating layer and/or light-steering layer to re-direct radiation that escapes from the waveguide when the frustrating layer contacts the waveguide. In general, ROE structures include a series of elements that are significantly larger than the wavelength(s) of incident radiation and direct radiation primarily by refraction. In some cases, the relatively small amount of diffraction that can occur in ROE structures may compensate for the dispersive properties of the material which forms the frustrating layer.

Light-steering layer <b>1460</b> may include DOE structures or ROE structures (e.g., a fresnel lens). Light-steering layer <b>1460</b> may be formed of materials including, but not limited to glass, PMMA, PET, PC, PVC, TPU, or TAC. Both light-steering layer <b>1460</b> and screen projection layer <b>1490</b> may be films such as Alpha and Beta screens, which are commercially available from DNP Denmark AS.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, visible light (indicated by arrow &#x201c;B&#x201d;) emitted from display device <b>1430</b> (e.g., a projection source such as a video projector) is emitted towards a top surface of touch sensitive device <b>1400</b> (i.e., toward frustrating layer <b>1406</b> and pliable waveguide <b>1404</b>) and is incident on light-steering layer <b>1460</b>. Due to the diffusive properties of screen projection layer <b>1490</b>, the visible light is diffused and imaged onto screen projection layer <b>1490</b> forming an image visible to a user viewing device <b>1400</b>. In some cases, the light-steering structures, which are incorporated in light-steering layer <b>1460</b>, may be configured to redirect radiation (e.g., IR radiation) that has escaped from waveguide <b>1404</b> due to FTIR upon contact with frustrating layer <b>1406</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, radiation (indicated by arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d;) which escapes waveguide <b>1404</b> passes through screen projection layer <b>1490</b> and is incident on light-steering layer <b>1460</b>. Light-steering layer <b>1460</b>, which includes light-steering structures, then redirects the incident radiation toward one or more imaging sensors <b>1408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Alternatively, light-steering layer <b>1460</b> may include two alternative types of light-steering structures: a first set of light-steering structures configured to diffuse visible light and a second set of light-steering structures configured to redirect the radiation which has escaped from waveguide <b>1404</b>. In some implementations, light-steering layer <b>1460</b> does not include light-steering structures configured to redirect radiation that has escaped waveguide <b>1404</b>. Instead, such light-steering structures may be formed on or within frustrating layer <b>1406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Alternatively, in implementations in which light-steering layer <b>1460</b> is not included in the touch-sensitive device, light-steering structures employed on or within screen projection layer <b>1490</b> also may be configured to diffuse radiation (e.g., IR radiation) that has escaped from waveguide <b>1404</b> due to FTIR upon contact with frustrating layer <b>1406</b>. For example, screen projection layer <b>1490</b> may include two alternative types of light-steering structures: a first set of light-steering structures configured to diffuse visible light and a second set of light-steering structures configured to redirect the radiation which has escaped from waveguide <b>1404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some implementations, screen projection layer <b>1490</b> and light-steering layer <b>1460</b> are bonded or laminated together. The bonding/lamination can be performed using an adhesive, such as an optical adhesive, to provide optical contact between screen projection layer <b>1490</b> and light-steering layer <b>1460</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, screen projection layer <b>1490</b> may be bonded to frustrating layer <b>1406</b> using an adhesive such as, for example, an optical adhesive. In some cases, an air gap may be present between frustrating layer <b>1406</b> and screen projection layer <b>1490</b> and/or between screen projection layer <b>1490</b> and light-steering layer <b>1460</b>.</p>

For example, although many of the implementations disclosed herein are described as employing LCD technology to generate output images, OLED or LED technology could be substituted for the LCD technology employed in each of these disclosed implementations to generate the output images. OLEDs and LEDs both generally are emissive elements. Therefore, in implementations that employ OLED or LED technology to generate output images, there may be no need for a backlight.
