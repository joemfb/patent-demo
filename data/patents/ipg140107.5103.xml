<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority of the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-76195, filed on Mar. 30, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments discussed herein are related to an information processing apparatus, a correction method, and a recording medium for correcting positioning using received signal strength indications.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the related art, there exist positioning systems using received signal strength indications (RSSIs). Technology is known in which, when positioning, radio waves from three access points, for example, are received by a device to acquire RSSIs, and a location is estimated by trilateration on the basis of the acquired RSSIs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, in the related art, there exists technology in which antennas are respectively disposed at one part and another part of the chassis such that high antenna emission characteristics are ensured irrespective of which part of the device the user is holding, and technology that calculates several provisional predicted locations by using the multiple calculation methods of triangulation, k-nearest neighbor, and minimum-perimeter polygon algorithms (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2004-179995 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2004-215258, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, in the related art, there exists technology in which many radio tags are dispersed and which estimates the present location of a mobile device subjected to positioning by communicating with a plurality of radio tags, and technology that monitors communication conditions with a wireless base station, and in the case of detecting irregular interference, uses the variation in communication conditions to estimate the distance between a device and a wireless base station in a state without interference (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2010-175374 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2009-200926, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, in the related art, technology is known in which the propagation delay time and received signal strength indication of a wireless signal is computed and which detects the presence of any moving bodies between a base station device and a rangefinder device or another base station device. Technology is also known in which a body's orientation is determined according to a match or mismatch of antenna polarizations (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2010-223593 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2009-250661, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, in the case of conducting trilateration, more suitable trilateration may not be achieved because of variations in received signal strength indication due to how a device or other information processing apparatus is held. Herein, the received signal strength indication (RSSI) from an access point to a device separated by a communication distance d may be computed with the following Equation (1).
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>RSSI=<i>Ptx+Gtx</i>&#x2212;Loss<sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>d+Grx</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In Equation (1) above, Ptx represents the transmitting power of the access point, Gtx represents the transmitting antenna gain of the access point, Loss_d represents the spatial loss over the communication distance d, and Grx represents the receiving antenna gain at the device. Also, the transmitting power Ptx and the transmitting antenna gain Gtx are parameters specific to the access point, the spatial loss Loss_d is a parameter determined by the distance, and the receiving antenna gain Grx is a parameter specific to the device (information processing apparatus).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In other words, by acquiring an RSSI, the device substitutes the acquired RSSI, the transmitting power Ptx, the transmitting antenna gain Gtx, and the receiving antenna gain Grx into the above Equation (1) to compute the spatial loss Loss_d. The device also acquires the distance to that access point according to the value of the computed spatial loss Loss_d. The device also conducts positioning of the device itself by acquiring the distance as above from three different access points.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the receiving antenna gain Grx described above varies according to factors such as the level of contact with a body or other dielectric body, for example. As the receive antenna included in the device nears a body, its antenna gain (directionality, etc.) worsens. Antenna gain also varies according to the level of contact with a body, worsening as the level of contact increases. Furthermore, a suitable distance may not be produced if the antenna gain is distorted.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. The information processing apparatus indicated hereinafter may be a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a notebook computer, an e-book reader, a music playback apparatus, a game console, a point of sale (POS) terminal, or a radio, for example. Also, although a human body is used as an example of a dielectric body in the embodiments indicated hereinafter, a dielectric body is not limited thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic configuration of an information processing apparatus in Embodiment 1. The information processing apparatus <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a wireless communication module <b>11</b>, a body contact information detector <b>12</b>, a recording module <b>13</b>, an antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>, a positioning module <b>15</b>, and a display <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The wireless communication module <b>11</b> receives signals from access points (hereinafter designated APs) <b>1</b> to <b>3</b>, for example, with a receive antenna <b>21</b>, and acquires received signal strength indications. The wireless communication module <b>11</b> also outputs the acquired received signal strength indications to the positioning module <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The body contact information detector <b>12</b> detects contact level information on the degree to which the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> and a body are in contact, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The recording module <b>13</b> records various data used to correct receive antenna gain in Embodiment 1. Specifically, the recording module <b>13</b> records gain correction data corresponding to contact level information, etc. detected by the body contact information detector <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The recording module <b>13</b> also records the parameters in Equation (1) discussed earlier, for example. Specifically, the recording module <b>13</b> records various data such as RSSIs, parameters specific to each access point (the transmitting power Ptx and the transmitting antenna gain Gtx, for example), one or more parameters determined by distance (the spatial loss Loss_d, for example), and one or more parameters specific to the device (the uncorrected receiving antenna gain Grx, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b> corrects one or more parameters specific to the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> on the basis of gain data, etc. obtained from the recording module <b>13</b>, such as body contact level information obtained from the body contact information detector <b>12</b>. Herein, the parameter to be corrected is the antenna gain data, for example. The antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b> also outputs corrected antenna gain data to the positioning module <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The positioning module <b>15</b> conducts trilateration on the basis of corrected gain data obtained from the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b> and respective received signal strength indications from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> obtained from the wireless communication module <b>11</b>. The positioning module <b>15</b> also outputs an estimated location result to the display <b>16</b> as a positioning result.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The display <b>16</b> displays an estimated location result for the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> obtained by using RSSIs obtained from the positioning module <b>15</b> on a display screen such as a liquid crystal display (LCD), for example. The display <b>16</b> is also able to display operable screens for executing functions of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, and to display various information recorded in the recording module <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, in Embodiment 1, the above recording module <b>13</b> may also be provided inside the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In other words, when positioning using received signal strength indications from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> in Embodiment 1, more suitable positioning can be realized by detecting contact information for the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> and a body and by using gain data corresponding to the detected contact information as well as the above received signal strength indications.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Exemplary Block Configuration in Embodiment 1</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, an exemplary block configuration in Embodiment 1 will be described using the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary block configuration of an information processing apparatus in Embodiment 1. In the exemplary block configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, specific block configurations are illustrated for the body contact information detector <b>12</b>, the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>, and the positioning module <b>15</b> in the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The body contact information detector <b>12</b> includes a sensor controller <b>121</b>, one or more capacitive sensors <b>122</b>, and a contact level determiner <b>123</b>. Also, the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b> includes a contact information detection controller <b>141</b> and a correction computing module <b>142</b>. Also, the positioning module <b>15</b> includes a positioning controller <b>151</b>, a distance estimator <b>152</b>, and a positioning result determiner <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sensor controller <b>121</b> in the body contact information detector <b>12</b> controls the switching on/off of the one or more capacitive sensors <b>122</b> on the basis of a control signal (Enable/Disable, for example) from the contact information detection controller <b>141</b> in the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The one or more capacitive sensors <b>122</b> acquire surrounding capacitance data on the basis of a control signal from the sensor controller <b>121</b>. The one or more capacitive sensors <b>122</b> also output acquired capacitance data to the contact level determiner <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The contact level determiner <b>123</b> determines a contact level from the capacitance data obtained from the one or more capacitive sensors <b>122</b>, and outputs the determined body contact level information to the correction computing module <b>142</b> of the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>. Herein, a contact level is determined in accordance with the magnitude of the surrounding capacitances obtained by capacitive sensors, for example. Specifically, the contact level is determined to be large in the case of large capacitance, and the contact level is determined to be small in the case of small capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The contact information detection controller <b>141</b> in the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b> outputs an on/off control signal to the sensor controller <b>121</b> on the basis of an on/off control signal from the positioning controller <b>151</b> in the positioning module <b>15</b>. Specifically, the contact information detection controller <b>141</b> switches on the sensor controller <b>121</b> at timings when detection of body contact information is appropriate, and then switches off the sensor controller <b>121</b> after detecting body contact information, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The correction computing module <b>142</b> references a gain table recorded in the recording module <b>13</b> and computes gain data correction on the basis of body contact level information obtained from the contact level determiner <b>123</b>. Specific details of correction computation are discussed later. The correction computing module <b>142</b> also outputs corrected gain data to the distance estimator <b>152</b> in the positioning module <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The positioning controller <b>151</b> in the positioning module <b>15</b> controls the switching on/off of the contact information detection controller <b>141</b>. Specifically, the positioning controller <b>151</b> switches on the contact information detection controller <b>141</b> at timings for executing a positioning process, for example. Also, the positioning controller <b>151</b> switches off the contact information detection controller <b>141</b> when processing in the positioning result determiner <b>153</b> ends, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The distance estimator <b>152</b> estimates the distances from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> on the basis of received signal strength indications (RSSIs) from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> obtained from the wireless communication module <b>11</b>. In this case, the distance estimator <b>152</b> estimates distance by adjusting the received signal strength indication (RSSI) on the basis of corrected gain data obtained from the correction computing module <b>142</b>. The distance estimator <b>152</b> also outputs estimated results for the distances from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> to the positioning result determiner <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The positioning result determiner <b>153</b> conducts positioning on the basis of estimated results for the distances from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b>. Herein, location information is position information (such as latitude/longitude information or 3D coordinates, for example) obtained by acquiring the distance from each AP from the received signal strength indications from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> and conducting positioning on the basis of the acquired information, for example. The positioning result determiner <b>153</b> also outputs a positioning result to the display <b>16</b> for display on the screen of the display <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Positioning Technique of Positioning Module <b>15</b> in Embodiment 1</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A positioning technique of the positioning module <b>15</b> in Embodiment 1 will now be specifically described. In Embodiment 1, trilateration using AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> is conducted as an example. First, radio waves from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> are received by the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> and RSSIs are acquired. Next, corrected receiving antenna gain data Grx for each AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> is extracted from the corrected gain data computed by the correction computing module discussed above. Also, the distance d from each AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> is computed from the above Equation (1). In other words, in Embodiment 1, by computing the spatial loss Loss_d in the above Equation (1), respective distances d corresponding to the spatial loss Loss_d of each AP are acquired. Herein, Ptx and Gtx in the above Equation (1) are calculated using predetermined, fixed values. Furthermore, in Embodiment 1, location is estimated by trilateration based on distances d from each AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> computed above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Processing Sequence in Embodiment 1</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A correction processing sequence in Embodiment 1 will now be specifically described using a flowchart. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary positioning correction processing sequence in Embodiment 1. The flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of an example where one capacitive sensor is used to conduct correction by contact level determination.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first the positioning controller <b>151</b> switches on the contact information detection controller <b>141</b> to enable the sensor controller <b>121</b> of the body contact information detector <b>12</b> and cause a body contact detection process to be executed (operation S<b>01</b>). Next, the sensor controller <b>121</b> of the body contact information detector <b>12</b> switches on the capacitive sensor <b>122</b> and acquires capacitance data (operation S<b>02</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, a body contact level is determined by the contact level determiner <b>123</b> on the basis of capacitance data obtained from the processing in operation S<b>02</b>, and the result is output to the correction computing module <b>142</b> (operation S<b>03</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the correction computing module <b>142</b> reads out a gain table recorded in the recording module <b>13</b> on the basis of body contact level information, corrects gain data using the gain table thus read out, and outputs corrected gain data to the positioning module <b>15</b> (operation S<b>04</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the distance estimator <b>152</b> reads in received signal strength indications (RSSIs) from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> and the corrected gain data, and estimates the distance from each AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> (operation S<b>05</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Next, the positioning result determiner <b>153</b> calculates the location of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> on the basis of distance information corresponding to each AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> (operation S<b>06</b>), and displays the calculated results on a display (operation S<b>07</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At this point, the positioning controller <b>151</b> determines whether or not to end the correction positioning process in Embodiment 1 (operation S<b>08</b>), returning to S<b>01</b> and repeating the processing thereafter in the case of not ending the process (operation S<b>08</b>&#x2014;No). Meanwhile, the positioning controller <b>151</b> ends the positioning correction process in Embodiment 1 in the case of ending the process in the processing of S<b>08</b> (operation S<b>08</b>&#x2014;Yes).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Specific Example Regarding Contact Level Information</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, the relationship between contact level information and a gain table according to Embodiment 1 discussed above will be specifically described using a drawing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> are diagrams for explaining the relationship between contact level information and a gain table in Embodiment 1. Herein, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a state of contact with a body (i.e., a dielectric body), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates relationships between contact levels and antenna gain directionality data, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates an example of the gain table discussed earlier. In Embodiment 1, an information processing apparatus <b>10</b> touching a body <b>31</b> has an increasingly large contact level as the contact surface with the body becomes stronger. For example, in the case of nothing nearby (the case of a &#x201c;small&#x201d; contact level), the receive sensitivity is high, whereas in the case where the body <b>31</b> is lightly touching the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> (the case of a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; contact level), the receive sensitivity weakens in the direction that is blocked by the person. In the case where the body is strongly touching (the case of a &#x201c;large&#x201d; contact level), the effect of being blocked by the person increases further and the receive sensitivity weakens further.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Consequently, in such cases, gain data corresponding to different contact levels is acquired from the gain table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, and the receiving antenna gain is corrected using the acquired gain data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the contact level determination herein, a measured value detected by the one or more capacitive sensors <b>122</b> in the body contact information detector <b>12</b> discussed earlier, for example, is used to determine to one contact level from among &#x201c;large&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d;, and &#x201c;small&#x201d; according to respectively measured capacitances under various carrying conditions, such as when the hand of the of the body <b>31</b> is touching the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> directly, when the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> is being stored inside the shirt pocket of a dress shirt being worn by the body <b>31</b>, or when the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> has been placed on a tabletop away from the body <b>31</b>, for example. Additionally, the capacitance ranges respectively corresponding to &#x201c;large&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d;, and &#x201c;small&#x201d; may be preset, or set capacitance ranges may be modified according to certain conditions. Also, the discrimination of contact levels is not limited to the above three (&#x201c;large&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d;, &#x201c;small&#x201d;), as long as discrimination is made between at least two contact levels.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, Embodiment 2 will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary block configuration of an information processing apparatus in Embodiment 2. In Embodiment 2 indicated hereinafter, like reference symbols are given to like elements from Embodiment 1, and detailed description thereof is reduced or omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The information processing apparatus <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a wireless communication module <b>11</b>, a body contact information detector <b>12</b>, a recording module <b>13</b>, an antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>, a positioning module <b>15</b>, and a display <b>16</b>. However, the above recording module <b>13</b> may also be provided inside the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The body contact information detector <b>12</b> includes a sensor controller <b>121</b>, a back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b>, a front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>, a contact level determiner <b>123</b>, and a contact surface determiner <b>124</b>. Also, the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b> includes a contact information detection controller <b>141</b> and a correction computing module <b>142</b>. Also, the positioning module <b>15</b> includes a positioning controller <b>151</b>, a distance estimator <b>152</b>, and a positioning result determiner <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In other words, compared to Embodiment 1, Embodiment 2 includes a plurality of capacitive sensors (two in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and a contact surface determiner <b>124</b> in the body contact information detector <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Consequently, the sensor controller <b>121</b> in the body contact information detector <b>12</b> controls the switching on/off of the back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> on the basis of a control signal (Enable/Disable, for example) from the contact information detection controller <b>141</b> in the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">However, the sensor controller <b>121</b> may also use either the back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> or the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>, and is able to switch one of the capacitive sensors on/off in that case.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Herein, the plurality of capacitive sensors <b>122</b> are provided at distance positions on the information processing apparatus <b>40</b> (on the front and back in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). However, in Embodiment 2, the locations of the plurality of capacitive sensors <b>122</b> are not limited to the front and back, and may also be provided on the sides, for example, or provided in at least two places from among the front, the back, and the sides. Furthermore, in Embodiment 2, the front surface is taken to be a liquid crystal surface (the display surface of the display <b>16</b>) as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this way, in Embodiment 2, capacitance can be more suitably acquired in different directions of the information processing apparatus <b>40</b>. Thus, according to the present embodiment, positioning correction can be more suitably conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> respectively acquire surrounding capacitance data on the basis of a control signal from the sensor controller <b>121</b>. The back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> also output their respectively acquired back capacitance data and front capacitance data to the contact level determiner <b>123</b> and the contact surface determiner <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The contact level determiner <b>123</b> determines a contact level from the back capacitance data and front capacitance data obtained from the back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. The contact level determiner <b>123</b> also outputs the determined body contact level information to the correction computing module <b>142</b> in the antenna gain data correcting unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The contact surface determiner <b>124</b> determines which surface of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> is contacting a body, on the basis of the magnitudes of the back capacitance data and front capacitance data obtained from the back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b>. In other words, in Embodiment 2, the capacitance from the capacitive sensor provided on the surface facing a body has a greater value than the capacitance from the other capacitive sensor. For this reason, the contact surface determiner <b>124</b> determines the surface upon which is provided the capacitive sensor that acquire the larger capacitance value as the body contact surface. The contact surface determiner <b>124</b> also outputs the determined contact surface information to the correction computing module <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Also, in Embodiment 2, the correction computing module <b>142</b> extracts a gain table from the recording module <b>13</b> in order to compute correction. At this point, the correction computing module <b>142</b> acquires gain data for back and front body contact levels, and computes contact surface correction and contact level correction in accordance with that gain data.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Contact Level Determining Method in Embodiment 2</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A contact level determining method in Embodiment 2 will now be described using a drawing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram for explaining a contact level determining method. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the way an information processing apparatus is held can be determined on the basis of device front and back capacitive sensors and LCD on/off information. Herein, in the case where the back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> are both &#x201c;small&#x201d;, it can be determined that nothing is near the information processing apparatus, whether the LCD is on or off.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary gain table in Embodiment 2. The gain table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes the items &#x201c;Body contact surface information&#x201d;, &#x201c;Body contact level information&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Gain data&#x201d; as an example, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With the body contact surface information, information on the back or front is acquired, for example. With the body contact level information, one from among a given number of categories such as &#x201c;small&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d;, and &#x201c;large&#x201d; is selected according to the strength of the capacitance (the maximum value, for example). Thus, one set of gain data can be acquired from body contact surface information and body contact level information. The correction computing module <b>142</b> is able to perform correction according to gain data given by contact surface correction and contact level correction on the basis of the acquired content of the correction computing module. Correction may involve storing given ratio values in the &#x201c;gain data&#x201d; of the gain table with respect to values of the receiving antenna gain Grx in the above Equation (1), and using such a ratio value to increase or decrease the original receiving antenna gain (Grx), for example. Correction may also involve directly storing the value of the receiving antenna gain Grx itself in the &#x201c;gain data&#x201d; and overwriting it with gain data acquired from the gain table at the time of correction.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">An exemplary gain table in Embodiment 3 will now be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> illustrate an exemplary gain table in Embodiment 3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates the relationship between an information processing apparatus <b>50</b> and a body <b>31</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates an exemplary gain table corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, angles are defined with the direction faced by the front of the body <b>31</b> being 0&#xb0;, and direction opposite the body <b>31</b> (the back) being 180&#xb0;. Also, the information processing apparatus <b>50</b> determines the contact surface to be the front in the case where the liquid crystal surface is contacting the body, with the contact level increasing with stronger contact (capacitance).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Meanwhile, items in the gain table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> include &#x201c;Angle&#x201d;, &#x201c;Body contact surface information&#x201d;, &#x201c;Body contact level information&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Gain data&#x201d;, for example.

In other words, gain data is set for individual types of body contact surface information and contact level information at respective angles. Thus, more suitable correction can be conducted according to the orientation of the information processing apparatus <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Exemplary Correction Computation by Correction Computing Module <b>142</b> in Embodiment 3</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, exemplary correction computation by the correction computing module <b>142</b> in Embodiment 3 will be described using a drawing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> are diagrams for explaining exemplary correction computation of a correction computing module in Embodiment 3. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates relative positions of a body <b>31</b> and a information processing apparatus <b>50</b> in order to explain exemplary correction computation, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates a gain table after correction by the correction computing module <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> herein, data in the gain table pre-recorded in the recording module <b>13</b> is shifted by 45&#xb0; in the case where information on the orientation (direction, angle) of the information processing apparatus indicates &#x201c;45&#xb0;&#x201d; as the angle of the information processing apparatus <b>50</b> with respect to due north and the body contact level is &#x201c;large&#x201d;. In other words, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, a gain table in which every angle from 0&#xb0; to 359&#xb0; is offset by 45&#xb0; is set as the corrected gain table.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In this way, in Embodiment 3, by correcting gain data recorded in the recording module <b>13</b> on the basis of the direction of the information processing apparatus <b>50</b> for AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> individually, correction can be conducted more suitably, and suitable trilateration can be realized using gain data corrected for AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A positioning technique of the positioning module <b>15</b> in Embodiment 3 will now be specifically described. In Embodiment 3, trilateration is conducted by way of example. First, radio waves from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> are received by a device and RSSIs are acquired. Next, the distance d from each AP is computed from the above Equation (1). At this point, Ptx, Gtx, and Grx are calculated with fixed values. Next, a location is estimated by trilateration on the basis of the above computed distances from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the above process, a rough device location is estimated on the basis of uncorrected gain data, but in Embodiment 3, a suitable device location is estimated on the basis of subsequently corrected gain data.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Specifically, the angles of AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> (the angles with respect to due north, for example) are first computed on the basis of rough device location information computed above. Next, the distances d from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> are computed from the above Equation (1). At this point, Ptx and Gtx in the above Equation (1) are taken to be preset, fixed values, whereas values computed with gain data corrected for each of AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> discussed earlier are used for Grx. Next, a location is estimated by trilateration on the basis of the distances from respective APs computed above.</p>

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the positioning controller <b>151</b> switches on the contact/direction information detection controller <b>143</b> to enable the body contact information detector <b>12</b> to enable the sensor controllers of the body contact information detector <b>12</b> and the orientation detector <b>51</b> (operation S<b>21</b>). Next, the sensor controller <b>511</b> of the orientation detector <b>51</b> switches on the geomagnetic sensor <b>512</b> and acquires data (operation S<b>22</b>). Also, the orientation (direction, angle, etc.) of the information processing apparatus <b>50</b> is determined by the orientation determiner <b>513</b> on the basis of the result obtained from the processing in operation S<b>22</b>, and the obtained results are output to the correction computing module <b>142</b> (operation S<b>23</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Also, the sensor controller <b>121</b> of the body contact information detector <b>12</b> switches on the one or more capacitive sensors (the back capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>1</b> and the front capacitive sensor <b>122</b>-<b>2</b> in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and acquires data as discussed earlier (operation S<b>24</b>). At this point, after the processing in operation S<b>24</b> ends, the contact surface determiner <b>124</b> determines the body contact surface and outputs the result to the correction computing module <b>142</b> (operation S<b>25</b>). Also, the contact level determiner <b>123</b> determines the body contact level and outputs the result to the correction computing module <b>142</b> (operation S<b>26</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The correction computing module <b>142</b> corrects data read out from the recording module <b>13</b> on the basis of body contact surface and contact level information as well as device direction information, and outputs the corrected data to the positioning module <b>15</b> (operation S<b>27</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Subsequently, the distance estimator <b>152</b> corrects the receiving antenna gain using the received signal strength indications (RSSIs) from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> and uncorrected gain information obtained by operation S<b>27</b>, and estimates the distance from each AP (operation S<b>28</b>). Also, the positioning result determiner <b>153</b> calculates a location by trilateration on the basis of information on the distances from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> (operation S<b>29</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Next, the positioning result determiner <b>153</b> computes the angle of each AP (angle with respect to due north) on the basis of the rough device location information thus computed, and extracts gain correction data for each AP from the corrected gain data computed by the correction computing module <b>142</b> (operation S<b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Also, the distance estimator <b>152</b> estimates the distance from each AP on the basis of received signal strength indications (RSSIs) from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> and the corrected gain data (operation S<b>31</b>). The positioning result determiner <b>153</b> calculates a location by trilateration on the basis of information on the distances from AP<b>1</b> to AP<b>3</b> (operation S<b>32</b>), and displays the results on the display <b>16</b> (operation S<b>33</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">At this point, the positioning controller <b>151</b> determines whether or not to end the positioning correction process in Embodiment 3 (operation S<b>34</b>), returning to S<b>21</b> and repeating the processing thereafter in the case of not ending the process (operation S<b>34</b>&#x2014;No). Meanwhile, the positioning controller <b>151</b> ends the positioning correction process in Embodiment 3 in the case of ending the process in the processing of operation S<b>34</b> (Yes in operation S<b>34</b>&#x2014;Yes).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">However, the positioning correction processes described in the foregoing embodiments may also be realized as a program executed by a computer. By installing such a program from a server or elsewhere and causing a computer to execute the program, the foregoing positioning correction processes can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Additionally, it is also possible to realize the foregoing positioning correction processes by recording the program onto a recording medium and causing a computer or mobile device to read the recording medium onto which the program is recorded. Various types of recording media may be used as the recording medium, including recording media that optically, electrically, or magnetically record information, such as with CD-ROMs, flexible disks, and magneto-optical discs, as well as semidielectric body memory that electrically records information, such as with ROM and flash memory.
