<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/407,512, filed Feb. 28, 2012, which claims the benefit of European Patent Application 11180467.0 filed Sep. 7, 2011.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane receptors in the cell. They transduce extracellular signals to intracellular effector systems and are involved in a large variety of physiological phenomena, therefore representing the most common target of pharmaceutical drugs although only a small percentage of GPCRs are targeted by current therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">GPCRs respond to a wide range of ligands. Due to the progress of human genome sequencing, for about 25% out of the more than 400 GPCRs (not including the olfactory GPCRs) that have been identified, a defined physiologically relevant ligand is still lacking. These receptors are known as &#x201c;orphan GPCRs&#x201d;. &#x201c;Deorphanization&#x201d; and identification of their in vivo roles is expected to clarify novel regulatory mechanisms and, therefore, to disclose novel drug targets. Whether GPR17 is such an orphan receptor is still a matter of debate. Phylogenetically, GPR17 is most closely related to the nucleotide P2Y receptors and the cysteinylleukotriene (CysLT1, CysLT2) receptors, with an amino acid sequence identity of between about 30 and about 35%, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multiple-tissue Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses indicate a predominant expression of GPR17 in the central nervous system (CNS) (Ciana et al., 2006, EMBO J 25(19): 4615; Blasius et al., 1998, J Neurochem 70(4): 1357) and additionally in heart and kidney, i.e. organs typically undergoing ischemic damage. Two GPR17 isoforms have been identified differing only by the length of their N-terminus. The short GPR17 isoform encodes a 339 amino acid-residue protein with typical rhodopsin type-seven transmembrane motifs. The long isoform encodes a receptor with a 28 amino acid longer N-terminus (Blasius et al., 1998). GPR17 is highly conserved among vertebrate species (&#x2dc;90% identity of amino acid sequence to both mouse and rat orthologs), which may constitute an advantageous feature for development of small molecule ligands and animal models in a drug discovery context.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the original deorphaning report, GPR17 was identified as dual receptor for uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes (cysLTs) LTC4 and LTD4, respectively based on <sup>35</sup>SGTP&#x3b3;S binding and cAMP inhibition assays as well as single cell calcium imaging (Ciana et al., 2006). Evidence for GPR17 functionality was provided in different cellular backgrounds such as 1321N1, COS7, CHO, and HEK293 cells (Ciana et al., 2006). Subsequently, an independent study confirmed activation of GPR17 by uracil nucleotides but failed to recapitulate activation by CysLTs (Benned-Jensen, 2010, Br J Pharmacol, 159(5): 1092). Yet another very recent report (Maekawa et al., 2009) suggested lack of GPR17 responsiveness to both uracil nucleotides and CysLTs across three different cellular backgrounds stably expressing GPR17 (1321N1, CHO, HEK293 cells). Instead a novel regulatory role for GPR17 was proposed: GPR17&#x2014;upon coexpression with CysLT1&#x2014;rendered CysLT1 unresponsive to its endogenous lipid mediators LTC4 and LTD4. Clearly, additional in vitro investigations are required to probe GPR17 pharmacology and function in more depth.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Drugs modulating the GPR 17 activity may have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and anti-ischemic effects and may thus be useful for the treatment of cerebral, cardiac and renal ischemia, and stroke (WO 2006/045476). WO 2005/103291 disclosed analgetic effects of a GPR 17 agonist and proposed the use of GPR 17 agonists for treating neuropathic pain. Moreover, evidence is accumulating that GPR 17 is involved in myelination processes and that GPR 17 antagonists can be valuable drugs for the treatment or alleviation of myelination disorders such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury (Chen et al, Nature neuroscience 2009, 12(11):1398-406; Ceruti et al; Brain: a journal of neurology 2009 132(Pt 8):2206-18). The identification of potent and selective GPR 17 modulators could thus be of significant relevance in the treatment of these serious diseases.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Identification of an activating ligand is a prerequisite to search for compounds that modulate GPR17 activity. Although activation by uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl-leukotrienes of GPR17 has been reported (Ciana et al., 2006; Pugliese et al., 2009, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 297: C1028), these endogenous signalling molecules do not display functional activity in different cell lines (1321N1, CHO, HEK) engineered to stably express the short isoform of GPR17 in our laboratory. In agreement with our observations, inactivity of these ligand classes has also been observed in a recent study (Maekawa et al., 2009, PNAS, US, 106(28): 11685). Another independent laboratory was also not able to confirm cysteinyl-leukotrienes as GPR17 agonists (Benned-Jensen, 2010), while depending on the GPR 17 isoform tested some functional activity of uracil nucleotides was seen, although only at low, or high micromolar concentrations, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 2005/103291 suggested the endogenous molecules 5 amino levulinic acid (5-ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) as activating ligands for GPR17, and a screening assay using these GPR 17 agonists. However, the reported affinity of 5-ALA and PBG is quite low and the amounts needed in the assays are significant, namely in the three digit micromolar range for 5-ALA or even in the mM range for PBG, which make both compounds not well suited for use in routine screening assays or even high throughput screenings. Moreover, PBG is a chemical unstable, reactive compound which rapidly decomposes after exposure to air and light, making it impractical to handle on a routine basis.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a need exists for the identification of improved GPR 17 agonists, which can be used as an easy and cheep but robust and reliable tool for the identification of GPR17 antagonists in various experimental settings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">3-(2-Carboxyethyl)-4,6-dichloro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid and some analogs had been previously described as allosteric inhibitors of fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (Wright et al, MBCL 2003, 13, 2055), and as antagonists of the NMDA receptor associated glycine binding site (Salituro, J Med Chem, 1992, 35, 1791; U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,786). However, these compounds have not yet been described as GPR17 modulators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">We have now detected that 3-(2-carboxyethyl)-4,6-dichloro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid (herein also referred to as RA-II-150) and other compounds of formula I, infra, are agonists for GPR17. In contrast to cysteinylleukotrienes and uracil nucleotides, we have found that RA-II-150 and other compounds of formula I and their salts activate GPR17 irrespective of the cellular background, i.e. they activate the receptor in a number of different cell lines such as 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> disclose concentration-effect curves for the mobilization of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in human GPR17 (hGPR17) transfected 1321 and CHO cells, respectively, by RA-II-150 and other compounds of formula I. None of these identified GPR17 agonists display activity in native cells that lack GPR17.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Potencies and efficacies of RA-II-150 and other compounds of formula I in the 1321N1-GPR17 and CHO-GPR17 cell systems were determined from the calcium mobilization assays described in Example 2, below. Data in recombinant 1321N1 and CHO cells are normalised to the response of 30 &#x3bc;M and 0.3 &#x3bc;M RA-II-150 (column 3), respectively. Unspecific effects of active compounds are tested on native 1321N1 or CHO-K1 cells. Here, data are normalised to the response of 100 &#x3bc;M carbachol or 100 &#x3bc;M ATP (column 4) (n=3&#x2212;4).</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A comparison of a representative GPR17 agonist of the present invention, RA-II-150, with the putative GPR 17 agonists 5-ALA and PBG (see WO 2005/103291) revealed a higher affinity and selectivity of the presently disclosed GPR 17 agonists. While the inventors of the present application were able to confirm the activation of GPR17 by 5-ALA, all attempts to activate GPR 17 with porphobilinogen failed. Also, a GPR17-independent inhibition of forskolin stimulated adenylylcyclase activity in GPR17 CHO cells was recognized after 5-ALA addition, thus questioning the specificity of GPR17 activation by 5-ALA. Irrespective of the quality of 5ALA to serve as a selective stimulus for GPR17, it is considerably less potent (10.000 fold) as compared with the presently disclosed small molecule agonist RA-II-150 and its structural analogs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In summary, we identified small molecules with the ability to activate GPR17 with high specificity and potency and significant superiority over published GPR17 agonists. The GPR17 agonists of the present invention can be used for establishing functional GPR17 assays to search for inhibitors of said receptor to treat/prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral, cardiac and renal ischemia, and preferably multiple sclerosis, ischemic damage and stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to small molecule GPR17 agonists, as chemically further defined below, and methods for using the agonists in the identification of and screening for GPR17 modulators, in particular GPR 17 antagonists.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One aspect of the present invention relates to screening assays comprising the GPR17 agonists of the present invention and cells, tissue or membrane fractions expressing the GPR17 receptor and/or functional active fragments thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, such screening assays may be provided, sold or offered in the form of a kit comprising all or substantially all of the components to be used in the assay described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of identifying a test compound's ability to modulate the GPR17 activity by contacting a compound with GPR17 (or a functional fragment thereof) in the presence of a GPR17 agonist according to the present invention, and comparing the activity of GPR17 in the presence of the agonist with and without the presence of said test compound.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating or alleviating a GPR17 mediated disease, said method comprising (a) in a first step identifying a GPR17 modulator, particularly an antagonist via the screening methods and assays disclosed herein, and (b) in a subsequent step administering the GPR17 modulators identified in the 1<sup>st </sup>step (a) to a patient suffering from such a GPR 17 mediated disease (such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebral, cardiac and renal ischemia, and preferably stroke or multiple sclerosis), preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0082">The term &#x201c;GPR 17&#x201d; as used herein means a polypeptide showing GPR 17 activity, namely a G protein-coupled receptor having Uracil nucleotide/cysteinyl leukotriene receptor activity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0083">Preferably, the term &#x201c;GPR17&#x201d; as used herein includes but is not limited to the human short splicing variant of GPR 17 (SEQ ID NO1), the human long splicing variant of GPR 17 (SEQ ID NO 2), the rat GPR 17 (SEQ ID NO 3), the mouse GPR 17 (SEQ ID NO 4), and any other natural occurring GPR 17.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0084">Further, the term also refers to functional fragments, fractions or subsequences of the above discussed polypeptides.</p>

        <li id="ul0013-0004" num="0089">(d) functional fragments, fractions or subsequences of any of the sequences discussed in (a), (b) or (c), and/or</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0091">The sequences set forth under (a)-(e) will also be called &#x201c;query sequences&#x201d; in the following.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0092">A &#x201c;functional fragment, fraction or subsequence&#x201d; comprises a polypeptide which represents a part of the amino acid sequence of GPR17 as further defined herein, wherein said functional GPR 17 fragment still shows GPR17 activity. One example of a functional GPR 17 fragment can be a truncated GPR 17, wherein a certain number of amino acids is missing at the N&#x2032; and/or C&#x2032; terminus of GPR17. Another example of a functional GPR 17 fragment is one of various subsequent parts of a &#x201c;splitted&#x201d; GPR 17 receptor, wherein said GPR17 parts are contained on individual expression plasmids and are physiologically inactive when expressed alone, but assemble to a functional GPR 17 receptor in an appropriate environment upon co-transfection of cells. Methods for the expression of &#x201c;split receptors&#x201d; are disclosed e.g. in Maggio R et al, FEBS Lett. 1993 Mar. 15; 319(1-2):195-200, and Sch&#xf6;neberg T et al, J Biol Chem. 1995 Jul. 28; 270(30):18000-6.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0093">The term &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; as used herein refers to the identity of one sequence (e.g., sequence A) to another sequence (e.g., sequence B) over the whole length of either of the sequences, i.e., to the percentage of residues that are identical in the two sequences to be compared. In general, the two sequences are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. If applicable, this may include inserting &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; in either one or both sequences, to enhance the degree of alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0094">Further, sequence alignment generally falls into two categories: global alignments and local alignments. Calculating a global alignment is a form of global optimization that &#x201c;forces&#x201d; the alignment to span the entire length of all query sequences. By contrast, local alignments identify regions of similarity within long sequences that are often widely divergent overall. In the present invention, either type of alignment can be performed when &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0095">Readily available computer programs can be used to aid in the analysis, such as ALIGN, Dayhoff, M. O. in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure M. O. Dayhoff ed.,* 5 Suppl. 3:353-358, National biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0096">The preferred way to determine &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; between two sequences is to count the exact number of matches between two sequences aligned as discussed above, dividing by the length of the shorter sequence, and multiplying the result by 100. This approach is a merely arithmetical approach which does not provide any kind of biological weighing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0097">Another approach to determine the &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; of two sequences which is likewise preferred is the GenePAST&#x2122; algorithm provided by GenomeQuest, Inc. This algorithm was formerly called &#x201c;Kerr&#x201d;, and is discussed, e.g., in Dufresne et al, Nature Biotechnology 20, 1269-1271 (2002), or Andree et al, World Patent Information, 2008, vol. 30, issue 4, pages 300-308. Again, this approach carries out a merely arithmetical determination of &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; without any biological weighing.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0098">In an exemplary case where (i) the query sequence has 339 residues (like SEQ ID No 1, which defines one possible GPR 17 polypeptide according to the invention), (ii) the subject sequence has 400 residues, and (iii) an alignment of 200 residues was found between both sequences with 4 mismatches comprised in the alignment (which means that a functional fragment of query sequences aligns with the subject sequence), the following approaches can be used to determine the &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; in accordance with the present invention:
<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0099">1. In a preferred embodiment, the &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; is calculated over the length of the entire query sequence (e.g. 339 residues). In this case, 143 mismatches have to be considered, which leads to a % sequence identity of (339&#x2212;143)/339=57.8%</li>
        <li id="ul0015-0002" num="0100">2. In another preferred embodiment which is used when a fragment of the query sequence is to be compared with a given subject sequence, the &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; is calculated over the alignment length of e.g. 200 residues (e.g., the functional fragment of the query sequence which aligns with the subject sequence serves as a basis for sequence identity calculation). In this case, both sequences share a % sequence identity of (200&#x2212;4)/200=98%</li>
        <li id="ul0015-0003" num="0101">3. In yet another embodiment, the &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; can be calculated over the length of the entire subject sequence (400 residues), 204 mismatches have to be considered, which leads to a % sequence identity of (400&#x2212;204)/400=49%. This option, which takes the subject sequence as a basis for sequence identity calculation, is however less preferred.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0102">An alternative method often used to determine the &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; between two polypeptide sequences, and which shall also be considered as an alternative means to determine % sequence identity according to the present invention, uses the BLAST algorithm (Tatusova and Madden, FEMS Microbiol Lett 174, 1999, 247; Altschul, et al, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990)), which is available e.g. through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; &#x201c;blastp&#x201d;), National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Building 38A, 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Md. 30 20894, USA (Wheeler et al., Nucleic Acid Res 35, 2007, D5; Pearson, Methods Enzymol 183, 1990, 63).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0103">However, The BLAST algorithm performs alignment scoring adjustments based on considerations of biological relevance between query and subject sequences. This involves the risk of mismatches between mere arithmetic sequence comparison, as preferred under the above mentioned &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; language, and biologically weighted sequence comparison, as performed, e.g., by BLAST. However, as the BLAST algorithm is frequently used, finds wide acceptance and is publicly available, it can as well be used in the context of the present invention to determine &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0104">Other algorithms which can also be used to determine &#x201c;% sequence identity&#x201d; within the meaning of the present invention comprise, but are not restricted to Smith &#x26; Waterman (Smith and Waterman, Journal of Molecular Biology 147: 195-197 and BLW (also known as &#x201c;Fragment Search&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0105">In a preferred embodiment, the &#x201c;polypeptide showing GPR 17 activity&#x201d; shows at least about 20%, more preferably at least about 30%, more preferably at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, and even more preferably at least about 80% or at least about 90% of the activity of the human GPR 17 receptor having the amino acid sequence of SEQ No1.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0106">The term &#x201c;identifying a compound that modulates GPR 17 activity&#x201d; includes determining the GPR17 activity (either wanted or unwanted) of a particular compound, as well as the screening of a multitude of compounds for the identification of GPR 17 antagonists showing a certain threshold of GPR 17 activity, and may also include the confirmatory testing of already known or suggested GPR17 functional activities of a given compound. The term &#x201c;identifying a compound that modulates GPR 17 activity&#x201d; also includes the determination or comparison of a test compound's functional activity towards GPR17 in a particular experimental setting, such as e.g. in a particular cell line, in a new experimental setup, or in cells or tissues from a particular disease state.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0107">The term &#x201c;screening assay&#x201d; or &#x201c;screening method&#x201d; as used herein refers to an assay or method which can be used and/or adapted to determine and/or analyze the GPR17 modulating properties of a single compound and/or of a variety or large number of compounds, such as e.g. in a high throughput screening format.

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">hGPR17 Expressing Cell Systems and Media</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0197">The sequence for the human GPR17 (short isoform) was subcloned into the vector pLXSN (Clontech Laboratories, CA 94043, USA), which can be used for retroviral transfection of the human astrocytoma cell line 1321N1. Since it was postulated by Ciana et. al. that GPR17 is activated by uracil nucleotides such as UDP, UDP-glucose and UDP-galactose, 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were chosen as an appropriate test system, because it was known that this cell line does not express endogenous nucleotide receptors. For the retroviral transfection of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells the packaging cell line GP+envAM12 was cultivated in HXM medium (50 ml of foetal calf serum (FCS), 5 ml of penicillin G/streptomycin solution (final concentration 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x3bc;g/ml streptomycin), 1% ultra glutamine, 0.75 ml of hypoxanthine (10 mg/ml), 12.5 ml of xanthine (10 mg/ml), 1.25 ml of mycophenolic acid (10 mg/ml) and 2 ml of hygromycin B (50 mg/ml) were added to 500 ml DMEM). One day before transfection 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells were seeded and incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and 95% humidity in a 25 cm<sup>2 </sup>cell culture flask containing medium without antibiotics. For at least two hours before transfection the medium was exchanged for 6.25 ml DMEM medium without any additive. Two solutions were prepared for the transfection. The first solution consisted of 25 &#x3bc;l of Lipofectamine&#x2122; 2000 (final concentration 2%) and 600 &#x3bc;l of DMEM medium without any additives while the second solution was composed of 6.25 &#x3bc;g of pLXSN-GPR17 and 3.75 &#x3bc;g of pLXSN-VSV-G vector DNA. The second solution was filled up with DMEM medium without any additives. Solution one was incubated for 5 min at room temperature before both solutions were combined and incubated for 20 min, also at room temperature. Afterwards the sample was added to the packaging cell line and incubated for 12-15 h. The medium was then replaced with 3 ml of fresh medium containing 30 &#x3bc;l of a 500 mM sodium butyrate solution. The virus production was stimulated by sodium butyrate and took place by incubation for 48 h at 32&#xb0; C. and 95% humidity. One day before infection 500,000 of 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were seeded in a 25 cm<sup>2 </sup>cell culture flask. After 48 h of virus production, the retroviruses were harvested and sterilised by filtration through a filter with a pore size of 45 &#x3bc;m. The host cell medium was replaced with the sterilized virus supernatant containing 6 &#x3bc;l of polybrene solution (4 mg/ml) and the infection of the host cells took place for further 48 h of incubation at 37&#xb0; C., 95% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After incubation, the transfected cells were transferred to a 175 cm<sup>2 </sup>cell culture flask and selected by adding medium containing G418. The efficiency of infection and stable transfection using this method was up to 95%.</p>

<heading id="h-0029" level="1">Measurement of Ligand Activity by Calcium Mobilization Assay</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0201">PLC activation and IP<sub>3 </sub>accumulation result in a release of calcium from intracellular calcium stores, for example the endoplasmic reticulum. In order to detect the released calcium, cells are loaded with a cell membrane permeable dye, which is converted within the cell into its active form by the cleavage of ester bonds. The active form of the dye binds the released calcium. The fluorescence properties of the dye change after calcium binds to the dye. These changes can be detected automatically and represent the ligand-dependent receptor activation. Cells from two confluently grown (80 to 90%) 175 cm<sup>2 </sup>cell culture flasks were needed for a calcium assay using the NOVOstar microplate reader (approximately 150,000 cells per well). Cells were harvested after removing the medium, washed once with PBS buffer and detached using a trypsin/EDTA solution. After incubation for 45 min at 37&#xb0; C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 200 g). Cells were resuspended in 994 &#x3bc;l of Krebs HEPES buffer (KHB; 118.6 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11.7 mM D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES (free acid), 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4 </sub>and 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) and loaded in the absence of light with fluorescent, namely Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1/AM dye, by incubating them for one hour at 28&#xb0; C. and 700 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer in the presence of Pluronic F-127. Pluronic F-127 was supplemented so that the cells could better absorb the dye. The cells were washed twice with 1 ml of KHB buffer (three centrifugation steps, each for 15 sec at 2700 rpm) before being seeded in a 96-well microplate in a total volume of 180 &#x3bc;l. A 10-fold concentrated agonist solution (35 &#x3bc;l) was added to another 96-well microplate with a V-profile. Both plates were placed into the NOVOstar microplate reader and incubated there for 20 min. After incubation, the required gain was determined by the microplate so that the fluorescence background of the cells was between 38,000 and 42,000 fluorescence units. This background is an optimal range for starting the measurement, because it is in the middle of the reader's detection range. Normally, the background in each well of a microplate should be the same. The background was determined by performing a so-called validation. A validation is performed to detect irregularities in cell densities between different wells, fluorescence or absorption properties as well as unspecific antagonist effects. These irregularities are noticeable when the background is significantly increased or decreased compared to the normal range. Afterwards, 20 &#x3bc;l of agonist were injected from the source plate to the measurement plate by the injector unit of the NOVOstar, and the increase in fluorescence was determined as a function of the calcium efflux resulting from receptor stimulation.</p>

<heading id="h-0031" level="1">Inhibition of Forskolin-Stimulated Intracellular cAMP Accumulation by Ligand</heading>
<p id="p-0091" num="0202">Two signal transduction pathways that influence the activity of the adenylyl cyclase in oppositional ways can be activated upon receptor activation. Whereas the Gs pathway stimulates the adenylyl cyclase-dependent catalysation of cAMP formation, the Gi pathway inhibits it. The detection of cAMP accumulation is based on the HTRF&#xae; technology described above. In this case a monoclonal antibody specific to cAMP was the donor fluorophore while the acceptor fluorophore d2 was fused to cAMP. The analysis of the Gi pathway was based on the direct activation of the adenylyl cyclase, for example, by forskolin. Upon activation, the Gi pathway inhibits the forskolin-dependent activation of the adenylyl cyclase, leading to decreased cAMP accumulation. The inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in 1321N1 or CHO cells was performed using the HTRF&#xae; cAMP dynamic kit (Cisbio Bioassays, BP 84175, France). Cells were resuspended in assay buffer with 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) supplemented and dispensed in 384-well microplates at a density of 50,000 cells/well in a volume of 5 &#x3bc;l. After preincubation in assay buffer for 30 min, the cells were stimulated by adding 5 &#x3bc;l of agonist in the respective concentration of forskolin. The final concentration of forskolin was dependent on the cell line which was employed in the assay. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated with 1 &#x3bc;M forskolin in 1321N1-GPR17 cells and with 10 &#x3bc;M forskolin in CHO-GPR17 cells, followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by lysis of the cells, which results from the addition of 5 &#x3bc;l of d2-conjugate followed by the addition of 5 &#x3bc;l of anti-IP1-cryptate (both supplements are diluted in conjugate and lysis buffer). The assay was incubated for 60 min at room temperature and time-resolved FRET signals were measured at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm using the Mithras LB 940 multimode reader (Berthold technologies, D-75323 Bad Wildbad). The evaluation of HTRFR data was performed following the instructions of the kit manufacturer. Data analysis was based on the fluorescence ratio emitted by labeled cAMP (665 nm) over the light emitted by the europium cryptate-labelled anti-cAMP (620 nm). Levels of cAMP were normalised to the amount of cAMP elevated by 10 &#x3bc;M or 1 &#x3bc;M forskolin alone.</p>
