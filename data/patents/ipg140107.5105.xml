<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless access systems typically include wireless access nodes, such as base stations, which provide wireless access to communication services for user devices over wireless links. A typical wireless access system includes many wireless access nodes to provide wireless access across a geographic region, with individual wireless coverage areas associated with each wireless access node. The wireless access nodes exchange user communications and overhead communications between wireless user devices and a core network of the wireless communication system over backhaul communication links.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The wireless access system also typically transfers information to the user devices to indicate incoming voice calls, text messages, network alerts, or other alerts and messages. This information, often referred to as pages, is routed through the wireless access nodes to reach the user devices via a paging channel. Indicators of available pages are sometimes shared by many user devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a system diagram illustrating communication system <b>100</b>. Communication system <b>100</b> includes user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b>, wireless access system <b>120</b>, and core network <b>130</b>. User devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b> are grouped into three sets, namely a first set including user devices <b>110</b>-<b>111</b>, a second set including user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b>, and a third set including user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b>. Although six user devices are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it should be understood that a different number of user devices could be included. User devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b> and wireless access system <b>120</b> communicate over wireless link <b>140</b>. Wireless link <b>140</b> could include many different portions, channels, or other sub-links, and wireless link <b>140</b> is shown as a single representative branching link in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for clarity. In other examples, a separate wireless link could be shown between each user device and wireless access system <b>120</b>. Wireless access system <b>120</b> and core network <b>130</b> communicate over link <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wireless access system <b>120</b> provides wireless access to communication services for each of user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b>. The communication services could include voice calls, messaging, data access, or other communication services provided through wireless access system <b>120</b>, such as communication services of core network <b>130</b>. As a part of the wireless access, each of user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b> can receive paging information, such as pages, from wireless access system <b>120</b>. These pages indicate incoming voice calls, text messages, network alerts, or other alerts and messages. In typical examples, user devices monitor a paging channel portion of wireless link <b>140</b> to check for the presence of pages pending on the paging channel portion. Wireless link <b>140</b> could also include a bit sequence over another channelized portion of wireless link <b>140</b>, where the bit sequence indicates pages pending on the paging channel portion of wireless link <b>140</b>. The bit sequence could include a series of bit flags, one-hot bit indicators, binary encoded indicators, such as a quick paging channel, among other representations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method of operating wireless access system <b>120</b>. The operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are referenced herein parenthetically. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wireless access system <b>120</b> exchanges (<b>201</b>) wireless communications with a plurality of user devices, such as user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b>, using a first communication mode that uses a first frequency spectrum and a second communication mode that uses a second frequency spectrum. The first communication mode and second communication mode include wireless communication modes, such as protocols, wireless spectrum, frequencies, channels, timeslots, or other communication features used to wirelessly exchange communications between wireless access system <b>120</b> and user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b>. In some examples, user devices which can communicate over at least two communication modes include dual-mode or multi-mode user devices. Separate transceiver equipment could be included for each of the two communication modes in wireless access system <b>120</b> or user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b>. The first frequency spectrum and the second frequency spectrum each include a set of frequencies used for wireless communication between wireless access system <b>120</b> and user devices <b>110</b>-<b>115</b>. In some examples, the two frequency spectrums employ different frequency sets, while in other examples, a portion of the frequency spectrum is shared between the two communication modes, and a portion of the frequency spectrum is not shared between the two communication modes.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Wireless access system <b>120</b> transfers (<b>202</b>) a first bit sequence using the first communication mode to a first set of the user devices to indicate the presence of first pages pending on a paging channel portion of the first communication mode. In this example, the first set of the user devices includes user devices <b>110</b>-<b>111</b>. In this example, the first bit sequence is transferred using the first communication mode, and the paging channel for the first pages is also transferred using the first communication mode. For example, if the first communication mode uses the Evolution Data Optimized (EVDO) communication mode, then the first bit sequence and the paging channel for the first pages is transferred using the EVDO communication mode. Other communication modes could be employed. The first bit sequence could comprise a first quick paging channel (QPCH). In some examples, the first set of the user devices could be selected based on a communication mode of user devices <b>110</b>-<b>111</b>, or among present communication performance or historical performance of user devices <b>110</b>-<b>111</b>. In other examples, user devices <b>110</b>-<b>111</b> could be selected based on a utilization level of the first communication mode, such as exceeding a utilization threshold, or could be operated by customers who pay for a higher grade of service, among other selections.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Wireless access system <b>120</b> transfers (<b>203</b>) a second bit sequence using the second communication mode to a second set of the user devices to indicate the presence of second pages pending on a paging channel portion of the second communication mode, where the second set of the user devices tune away from the first communication mode to the second communication mode to receive the second bit sequence. In this example, the second set of the user devices includes user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b>. In this example, the second bit sequence is transferred using the second communication mode, and the paging channel for the second pages is also transferred using the second communication mode&#x2014;not using the first communication mode as in operation <b>202</b>. For example, if the second communication mode uses the single-carrier radio transmission technology link (1xRTT) communication mode, then the second bit sequence and the paging channel for the second pages is transferred using the 1xRTT communication mode. Other communication modes could be employed. The second bit sequence could comprise a second quick paging channel (QPCH). In this example, the first communication mode and the second communication mode are different communication modes. In some examples, the second set of the user devices could be selected based on a communication mode of user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b>, or among present communication performance or historical performance of user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b>. In other examples, user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b> could be selected based on a utilization level of the first or second communication mode, such as exceeding a utilization threshold, falling below a utilization threshold, or could be operated by customers who pay for a medium grade of service, among other selections.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The tune away from the first communication mode to the second communication mode to receive the second bit sequence could include user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b> periodically switching from communicating over the first communication mode to communicating over the second communication mode to receive the second bit sequence. In this example, the second bit sequence is not available over the first communication mode, and indication of pending pages on the paging channel of the second communication mode is available by checking the second bit sequence. Tuning away to check the second bit sequence in the second communication mode may require a longer tune away time than merely checking the first bit sequence when user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b> are already communicating in the first communication mode. Tuning away could also include switching to different transceiver circuitry or equipment of user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b>, communicating with a different portion of wireless access system <b>120</b>, such as different base station equipment, or could include changing a frequency spectrum used by a transceiver portion of user devices <b>112</b>-<b>113</b>, among other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Wireless access system <b>120</b> configures (<b>204</b>) a third set of the user devices to tune away from the first communication mode to the second communication mode to check for the presence of third pages pending on the paging channel portion of the second communication mode. In this example, the third set of the user devices includes user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b>. As discussed above, in this example, the paging channel for the second pages is transferred using the second communication mode, not using the first communication mode as in operation <b>202</b>. In this example, the second communication mode and the paging channel portion of the second communication are the same as discussed in operation <b>203</b>. The third set of the user devices could be selected based on a communication mode of user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b>, or among present communication performance or historical performance of user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b>. In other examples, user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b> could be selected based on a utilization level of the first or second communication mode, such as exceeding a utilization threshold, falling below a utilization threshold, or could be operated by customers who pay for a low grade of service, among other selections. The tune away from the first communication mode to the second communication mode to check for third pages pending on the paging channel portion of the second communication mode could include user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b> periodically switching from communicating over the first communication mode to communicating over the second communication mode to check if the third pages are pending. In this example, user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b> are configured to check the paging channel portion of the second communication mode without first checking the first bit sequence or the second bit sequence, although other configurations could be employed. Tuning away to check the paging channel portion of the second communication mode may require a longer tune away time than merely checking the first bit sequence or the second bit sequence, and could also include switching to different transceiver circuitry or equipment of user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b>, communicating with a different portion of wireless access system <b>120</b>, such as different base station equipment, or could include changing a frequency spectrum used by a transceiver portion of user devices <b>114</b>-<b>115</b>, among other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a system diagram illustrating communication system <b>300</b>. Communication system <b>300</b> includes user devices <b>310</b>-<b>315</b>, base station <b>320</b>, base station controller (BSC) <b>330</b>, paging system <b>335</b>, and core network <b>340</b>. Base station <b>320</b> and base station controller <b>330</b> communicate over backhaul link <b>355</b>, where backhaul link <b>355</b> is a T1 link capable of carrying packet communications in this example.
