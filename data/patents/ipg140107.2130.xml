<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to systems and processes for CO<sub>2 </sub>capture entrained in flue gases. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to the efficient recovery of ammonia from the ammonium sulfate byproduct of the chilled ammonia process in the carbon capture system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most of the energy used in the world is derived from the combustion of carbon and hydrogen-containing fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. In addition to carbon and hydrogen, these fuels contain oxygen, moisture and undesirable contaminants such as SO<sub>x</sub>, e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3 </sub>and the like, NO<sub>x</sub>, mercury, chlorine, and other trace elements. Awareness regarding the damaging effects of the contaminants released during combustion triggers the enforcement of ever more stringent limits on emissions from power plants, refineries and other industrial processes. There is an increased pressure on operators of such plants to achieve near zero emission of contaminants</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Numerous processes and systems have been developed in response to the desire to achieve near zero emission of contaminants. Systems and processes include, but are not limited to desulfurization systems (known as wet flue gas desulfurization systems (&#x201c;WFGD&#x201d;) and dry flue gas desulfurization systems (&#x201c;DFGD&#x201d;)), particulate filters (including, for example, bag houses, particulate collectors, and the like), as well as the use of one or more sorbents that absorb contaminants from the flue gas. Examples of sorbents include, but are not limited to, activated carbon, ammonia, limestone, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been shown that ammonia, as well as amine solutions, efficiently removes CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as other contaminants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen chloride (HCl), from a flue gas stream. In one particular application, CO<sub>2 </sub>is absorbed in an ammoniated solution at temperatures lower than the exit temperature from the flue gas desulfurization system, for example, between 0 and 30 degrees Celsius (0&#xb0;-30&#xb0; C.). The SOx contaminants, e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>, remaining in the flue gas coming from the wet flue gas desulfurization (WFDS) and/or dry flue gas desulfurization (DFGD) is often captured by ammonia to produce an ammonium sulfate bleed stream. Ammonium sulfate is also produced in the ammonia reduction stages of the carbon capture from the exhaust flue gas Ammonium sulfate can be used as a commercial fertilizer, but processing of the ammonium sulfate byproduct can be energy and capital cost intensive. In some cases, the use of crystallization, evaporation, agglomeration equipment is needed in order to produce the fertilizer product for commercial use. In addition, a large area for silos\bins for indoor storage of the ammonium sulfate byproduct may be needed on-site to insure plant availability. In addition, trace metals may be present in the ammonium sulfate stream that may require further treatment or disposal of the ammonium sulfate stream as a hazardous waste. For example, for CO<sub>2 </sub>capture systems which use amine solutions, sulfur compounds present in the flue gas will react with the amine reagent and render it useless. The sulfonated amine must then be discarded and replenished with fresh reagent. The result is higher operating costs and capital costs because of the larger equipment needed to account for sulfur and the higher reagent make-up rates.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative approach to the handling and/or disposal of the ammonium sulfate byproduct from the carbon capture system utilizes a lime boil process, in which the ammonium sulfate is converted to calcium sulfate and the ammonia is recovered. This alternative process, however, uses a significant amount of heat in order to convert the ammonium sulfate and recover ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved systems and processes for handling the ammonium sulfate byproduct and recovering the ammonia in carbon capture systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein are processes and systems chilled ammonia based carbon dioxide capture, and particularly for recovering the ammonia utilized in the process. In one embodiment, an exemplary process for recovering ammonia from an ammonium sulfate stream includes reacting the ammonia sulfate stream with a lime slurry to form a slurry comprising calcium sulfate and ammonia; providing the slurry comprising calcium sulfate and ammonia to a stripper configured to recover the ammonia from the slurry; utilizing a heat source from a chilled ammonia process to the stripper; and extracting an ammonia vapor stream from the stripper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a process for recovering sodium hydroxide from a sodium sulfate stream includes reacting the sodium sulfate stream with a lime slurry to form a slurry comprising calcium sulfate and sodium hydroxide; providing the slurry comprising calcium sulfate and sodium hydroxide to a gypsum thickener configured to separate the calcium sulfate from the sodium hydroxide; extracting a sodium hydroxide stream from the gypsum thickener.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A system for recovering ammonia from an ammonium sulfate stream includes an ammonium sulfate stream produced by a sulfur removal device and/or a carbon dioxide removal system in a chilled ammonia process; a lime slake mill in fluid communication with the ammonium sulfate stream, wherein the lime slake mill is configured to slake the lime to form a lime slurry; at least one reaction tank in fluid communication with the lime slake mill, the at least one reaction tank configured to react the lime slurry with the ammonium sulfate stream and produce a slurry comprising calcium sulfate and ammonia; a stripper in fluid communication with the at least one reaction tank, wherein the stripper is configured to remove the ammonia from the slurry comprising calcium sulfate and ammonia and form an ammonia vapor stream; and a heat exchanger in fluid communication with the stripper and configured to exchange heat between a heat source stream from the chilled ammonia process and the slurry comprising calcium sulfate and ammonia.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Disclosed herein are systems and processes for efficiently handling the ammonium sulfate byproduct of the acid gas capture and ammonia reduction stages of the chilled ammonia processes (&#x201c;CAP&#x201d;) in a carbon capture system (&#x201c;CCS&#x201d;). The system and process generally includes the integration of certain CCS streams in a lime boil process for converting the ammonium sulfate byproduct in order to reduce the energy required by the lime boil process. More particularly, the integrated CCS streams can include sources of heat from the CAP, such as the overhead from the ammonia stripper or the carbon dioxide-lean solution from the regenerator. The use of such existing heat sources within the system to provide heat to the lime boil process reduces the energy penalties associated with use of the lime boil process for the handling/disposal of the ammonium sulfate byproduct. While reference will be made to CAP and apparatuses, the present disclosure can also be utilized in advanced amine and oxy-fuel processes and apparatuses configured as such.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As mentioned, ammonium sulfate can be produced in at least two locations within a CCS. For example, ammonium sulfate can be a byproduct stream from a sulfur dioxide removal stage in the Direct Contact Cooler or it can also be formed in the Direct Contact Heater stage of the CAP process, where the ammonia is being removed from the flue gas, which is leaner in carbon dioxide gas. Both sources of ammonium sulfate are described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which schematically illustrates a power plant <b>1</b>. The power plant <b>1</b> comprises a boiler <b>2</b>. During the combustion of a fuel, such as coal or oil, a hot process gas, often referred to as a flue gas, is generated in the boiler <b>2</b>. The flue gas, which contains polluting substances, including dust particles, sulfur dioxide, SO<sub>2</sub>, sulfur trioxide, SO<sub>3</sub>, and carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>, leaves the boiler <b>2</b> via a gas duct <b>4</b>. The gas duct <b>4</b> is configured to forward the flue gas to a conventional air pollution control system <b>6</b>. The conventional air pollution control system <b>6</b> includes a dust collector <b>8</b>, in the form of, e.g., an electrostatic precipitator or fabric filter. Furthermore, the conventional air pollution control system <b>6</b> comprises a duct <b>10</b> configured to forward the flue gas from the dust collector <b>8</b> to a sulfur dioxide removal device <b>12</b>, sometimes referred to as a Flue Gas Desulfurization system (FGD), in the form of a wet scrubber or dry scrubber. In a wet/dry scrubber, at least a portion of the sulfur dioxide is removed from the flue gas by means of contacting the flue gas with an alkali, typically lime/limestone or an ammonia-based scrubbing solution. Flue gas in coal or oil fired power plants contains sulfur dioxide, which is formed when sulfur-laden coal or oil is combusted. The reaction of the ammonia, sulfur dioxide and oxygen produces ammonium sulfate. As will be discussed in greater detail below, this ammonium sulfate byproduct stream is sent to a lime boil process where it can be converted to calcium sulfate and ammonia, the later of which can be recycled back through the system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The conventional air pollution control system <b>6</b> could comprise further devices, such as a selective catalytic reduction reactor, for removing nitrogen oxides from the flue gas, such further devices not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for reasons of clarity of illustration. The flue gas, which comprises very small amounts of most pollutants, but still most of the original concentration of carbon dioxide, leaves the conventional air pollution control system <b>6</b> via a duct <b>14</b>. The duct <b>14</b> is configured to forward the flue gas to a combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b>. The flue gas then leaves the combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b> via a duct <b>18</b>. The flue gas in the duct <b>18</b> has a temperature of about 0-30&#xb0; C., specifically 0-5&#xb0; C. The duct <b>18</b> is configured to forward the flue gas to a carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b>. As mentioned previously, the type of carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b> described herein is sometimes referred to as the Chilled Ammonia Process, CAP. Another exemplary embodiment of a CAP is described in WO 2006/022885, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b> comprises a CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber <b>22</b> in which the flue gas is brought into contact with an ammoniated slurry or solution. A pipe <b>24</b> is configured to forward, by means of a high pressure pump (not shown for reasons of clarity), a CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched slurry or solution from the CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber <b>22</b> to a regenerator <b>26</b>. Heat is provided to the regenerator <b>26</b> by heating stream <b>28</b> in heater <b>30</b>. The high pressure and high temperature in the regenerator <b>26</b> causes the release of high-pressure gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>, stream <b>32</b>. A pipe <b>34</b> is configured to return CO<sub>2</sub>-lean ammoniated solution or slurry, that has been cooled in a chiller (not shown), from the regenerator <b>26</b> to the CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber <b>22</b>. As will be described later, at least a portion of this CO2-lean ammoniated solution or slurry can be diverted to the lime boil process to provide heat to the endothermic reaction of lime with the ammonium sulfate. Heat exchangers <b>25</b> can be disposed between the absorber <b>22</b> and the regenerator <b>26</b> to control the temperatures of the streams in pipes <b>24</b> and <b>34</b> circulating between the two components and also to reduce the energy consumption in the regenerator <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A duct <b>36</b> is configured to forward the flue gas, now having a low concentration of carbon dioxide, from the CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber <b>22</b> to a water wash vessel <b>38</b>, which is operative for removing ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, from the flue gas that has been treated in the CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber <b>22</b>. A stream <b>40</b> of cold water or cold and slightly acidic solution is cooled in a heat exchanger <b>42</b> and is supplied to the water wash vessel <b>38</b>. A duct <b>44</b> is configured to forward the flue gas, which has been cleaned in the water wash vessel <b>38</b>, to the combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b> for further removal of the ammonia from the flue gas by means of sulfuric acid.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An ammonia stripper <b>45</b> can be disposed in fluid communication with the water wash vessel <b>38</b>. The ammonia stripper <b>45</b> is configured to recover the ammonia captured from the flue gas in the water wash vessel <b>38</b>. In the ammonia stripper <b>45</b>, water stream, now containing the ammonia removed from the flue gas, can be heated at a temperature which boils off the contaminants to form a stripper offgas stream <b>47</b>, while the remaining liquid phase can continue back through the water wash vessel <b>38</b>. The ammonia stripper is described in greater detail below, and as will be seen, can be used in other locations within the power plant. Similar to the absorber <b>22</b> and regenerator <b>26</b> pair, heat exchangers <b>43</b> can be disposed between the water wash vessel <b>38</b> and the ammonia stripper <b>45</b> to control the temperatures of the streams circulating between the two components and also to reduce the energy consumption in the stripper <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A duct <b>46</b> is configured to forward the flue gas, which has been cleaned further in the combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b>, to a stack <b>48</b> which releases the cleaned flue gas to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b> in more detail. The combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b> comprises a pre-conditioning section <b>100</b>, a post-conditioning section <b>150</b>, and is in fluid communication with the carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b>. The pre- and post-conditioning sections are arranged in liquid connection such that liquid used in one of the sections may be reused in another section as explained in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The pre-conditioning section <b>100</b>, which is arranged upstream of the carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b>, with respect to the flow direction of the gas stream, comprises a number of gas-liquid contacting devices for directly contacting the gas stream with a liquid. The post-conditioning section <b>150</b>, which is arranged downstream of the carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b>, with respect to the flow direction of the gas stream, similarly comprises a number of gas-liquid contacting devices for directly contacting the gas stream with a liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gas-liquid contacting devices of the pre- and post-conditioning sections may be integrated in vessels comprising more than one gas-liquid contacting device arranged in sequence, such that a gas stream which is fed to the vessel enters and exits each gas-liquid contacting device in sequence, before exiting the vessel. Alternatively, each of the gas-liquid contacting devices of the pre- and post-conditioning sections may independently be arranged as separate gas-liquid contacting vessels connected in series, such that the gas stream enters and exits each gas-liquid contacting vessel in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each gas-liquid contacting device is arranged to bring the gas stream into contact with a liquid. The contacting may be performed in counter current flow such that the gas enters the gas-liquid contacting device at one end (typically at the bottom) and the liquid solution enters the gas-liquid contacting device at the other end (typically at the top).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Liquid used in one gas-liquid contacting device is generally at least partly collected at the bottom of the gas-liquid contacting device or in a separate buffer or storage tank in liquid connection with the bottom of the gas-liquid contacting device, such that liquid exiting the gas-liquid contacting device is collected therein. In an integrated vessel as described above, liquid may be collected and withdrawn from one gas-liquid contacting device and optionally redirected to the same or another gas-liquid contacting device, located upstream or downstream of the first device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The flue gas is forwarded in the opposite direction and may pass through or alongside the collected liquid. In this case, a liquid collection receptacle may be arranged in between two gas-liquid contacting devices, whether arranged separately or integrated, and may, for example, comprise a sloped collection tray or bubble cap tray. Such liquid collection receptacles may further comprise one or more liquid outlets configured for removal of the collected liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The pre-conditioning section <b>100</b> of the system <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> receives a gas stream, such as flue gas, via a gas inlet <b>102</b> at the bottom <b>104</b> of a gas-liquid contacting device <b>106</b>. The gas-liquid contacting device, also referred to as the sulfur removal device <b>106</b>, is configured to remove SO<sub>2 </sub>from the flue gas. In the sulfur removal device <b>106</b>, flue gas, having a temperature of, for example, 40-80&#xb0; C., such as 45-60&#xb0; C., is forwarded upwards and contacted with a liquid comprising ammonia having a pH-value of approximately 4-6 at flue gas saturation temperature. The liquid is supplied via pipe <b>108</b> and distributed over the sulfur removal device by a set of nozzles <b>110</b> or pipes with holes for liquid distribution. The sulfur removal device <b>106</b> contains a structured packing, or another suitable gas-liquid contacting filling.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">SO<sub>2</sub>, and optionally other acidic gases such as HCl, HF, SO<sub>3</sub>, is removed from the flue gas by formation of ammonium sulfate upon contact with the ammonia comprised in the liquid. The used liquid, containing e.g. 40%, such as 15-40% ammonium sulfate by weight, is collected in a liquid collection receptacle at the bottom <b>104</b> of the sulfur removal device. Dissolved ammonium sulfate is removed by a bleed stream <b>112</b>. The remaining liquid is via pipe <b>108</b> directed for reuse in the sulfur removal device <b>106</b>. The pH-value of the liquid may be adjusted by addition of ammonia to the bottom <b>104</b> of the device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flue gas depleted in SO<sub>2 </sub>leaving the sulfur removal device <b>106</b> enters another gas-liquid contacting device <b>114</b> via the liquid collection receptacle <b>116</b>. The gas-liquid contacting device <b>114</b>, containing a structured packing, or another suitable gas-liquid contacting filling, is also referred to as the gas cooling device <b>114</b>. The flue gas thus passes through the liquid used in the gas cooling device before entering the gas cooling device <b>114</b>. In the gas cooling device <b>114</b>, the flue gas depleted in SO<sub>2</sub>, still having a high temperature of, e.g. 40-80&#xb0; C., specifically 45 60&#xb0; C., is, while forwarded upwards, directly contacted with a cooling liquid. The cooling liquid, having a temperature of, for example, 5-35&#xb0; C. depending on ambient conditions and for example process cooling tower operation, and consisting essentially of water, is supplied via pipe <b>118</b> and distributed by a set of nozzles <b>119</b>, or pipes with holes for liquid distribution, over the gas cooling device. The gas cooling device <b>114</b> thus functions as a heat-exchanging device by transferring heat from the flue gas to the cooling liquid. In addition, any water is condensed from the flue gas. The stream <b>118</b> can be sent to either cooling tower or mechanical chiller or the combination of both cooling tower and mechanical chiller before returning it back to the gas cooling device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The thus heated liquid formed in the gas cooling device <b>114</b> is collected in the liquid collection receptacle <b>116</b>, withdrawn via pipe <b>120</b> and forwarded for use in the post-conditioning section <b>150</b> as described below. A bleed stream, containing flue gas condensate liquid, is via pipe <b>122</b> withdrawn from the used liquid. The pre-conditioning section of the system <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> thus provides a cool and SO<sub>2 </sub>depleted flue gas for supply via duct <b>18</b> to the carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The carbon dioxide removal system <b>20</b> comprises the single CO<sub>2 </sub>absorber <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the system can include a series of CO<sub>2 </sub>absorbers. The flue gas is brought into contact with ammoniated liquid, supplied via pipe <b>34</b>. CO<sub>2 </sub>is captured into the ammoniated liquid and the resulting CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched slurry or solution <b>24</b> is passed, for example by means of a high pressure pump, from the absorber(s) <b>22</b> to the regenerator <b>26</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). High pressure and high temperature in the regenerator causes the release of high-pressure gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>. The CO<sub>2 </sub>lean ammoniated liquid or slurry resulting from regeneration is cooled and forwarded for reuse in the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorber <b>22</b> via pipe <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A duct <b>124</b> is operative for forwarding flue gas, having a low concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, from the CO<sub>2 </sub>absorber(s) <b>22</b> to the post-conditioning section <b>150</b>. Prior to processing in the post-conditioning section, the flue gas may optionally be subjected to water wash (not shown) in order to remove ammonia from the flue gas.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The post-conditioning section <b>150</b> thus receives CO<sub>2 </sub>depleted flue gas, having a temperature of, for example, 0-25&#xb0; C., such as 0-10&#xb0; C. or such as 0-5&#xb0; C., and an ammonia content of, for example, 200 ppm, from the CO<sub>2 </sub>removal system <b>20</b>. The post-conditioning section comprises at least a first gas-liquid contacting device <b>152</b>, also referred to as the ammonia removal device <b>152</b>, which is arranged to receive the flue gas supplied via duct <b>124</b> via the liquid collection receptacle <b>154</b>. The ammonia removal device <b>152</b> is arranged to, at least partly, remove ammonia from the flue gas by bringing the flue gas into direct contact with acidic liquid comprising ammonium sulfate and having a pH-value of approximately 3 4. The acidic liquid is supplied via pipe <b>156</b> and distributed over the ammonia removal device <b>152</b> by a set of nozzles <b>157</b>, or by pipes with holes for liquid distribution. The flue gas enters at the bottom of the device <b>152</b> and is forwarded upwards through the device <b>152</b>. In the ammonia removal device <b>152</b>, which contains a structured packing or another suitable gas-liquid contacting filling, the flue gas is contacted with the liquid having a low temperature. Ammonium sulfate at a concentration of, for example, 0-40%, such as 15-40% or 30-35% by weight, is formed in the liquid and removed by bleed stream <b>158</b>. The remaining acidic liquid is, via pipe <b>156</b>, directed for reuse in the ammonia removal device. If needed, the pH-value of the liquid may be adjusted by addition of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>to the bottom of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flue gas depleted in ammonia is forwarded from the ammonia removal device to a second gas-liquid contacting device of the post-conditioning section <b>150</b>. The second gas-liquid contacting device <b>160</b> is also referred to as the gas heating device <b>160</b>. The flue gas passes through the liquid collection receptacle <b>157</b>, in which the liquid used in the gas heating device <b>160</b> is collected. The gas heating device <b>160</b>, containing a structured packing or another suitable gas-liquid contacting filling, is arranged to bring the flue gas, having essentially the same temperature as when entering the ammonia removal device, into direct contact with a heating liquid. The heating liquid, supplied via pipe <b>120</b> and distributed over the device <b>160</b> by a set of nozzles <b>161</b> or by pipes with holes for liquid distribution, is essentially the same liquid as used for cooling in the gas cooling device <b>114</b> of the pre-conditioning section <b>100</b>. The liquid thus has a temperature of, for example, 40-80&#xb0; C., specifically 45-60&#xb0; C., that roughly corresponds to the temperature of the flue gas entering the gas cooling device <b>114</b>. When the liquid is contacted with the flue gas in the gas heating device <b>160</b>, heat is transferred from the liquid to the flue gas. The cleaned and heated flue gas, having a temperature of, e.g. 40-60&#xb0; C., leaves the gas heating device via duct <b>46</b> and is released to stack <b>48</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The used liquid, having a lower temperature after passing the device as compared to before entering the device, is collected in the liquid collection receptacle <b>157</b>, withdrawn via pipe <b>118</b> and directed for use in the gas cooling device <b>114</b> of the pre-conditioning section, optionally via a process cooling tower (not shown). The post-conditioning section <b>150</b> thus provides post-cleaning of the flue gas by removal of ammonia and heating of the flue gas, before releasing a cleaned and heated flue gas to stack.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ammonium sulfate streams, produced from the sources described above (e.g. the gas-liquid contacting device <b>106</b> and the gas-liquid contacting device <b>152</b> in the cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b>), can be directed to a lime boil system <b>200</b> for converting the ammonium sulfate. The lime boil system <b>200</b> is configured to produce calcium sulfate and recover ammonia from the ammonium sulfate byproduct streams. The ammonia is returned to the CAP, thereby reducing ammonia consumption in the system. The calcium sulfate byproduct produced by the lime boil process can be combined with a calcium sulfur byproduct stream from a sulfur removal device, such as a WFGD or DFGD, utilizing limestone to remove sulfur dioxide from the process gas stream. An ammonium sulfate feed stream <b>202</b>, such as from one of the gas-liquid contact devices <b>106</b>, <b>152</b> of the cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b>, is heated as it is fed to a lime slake mill <b>206</b> via a heat exchanger <b>204</b>. A steam condensate supply <b>208</b> from the CAP process can be utilized to heat the ammonium sulfate. The lime slake mill <b>206</b> is configured to slake the lime on-site into a slurry. Conventional lime slake mills are known in the art and the lime slake mill <b>206</b> described herein can by any conventional lime slake mill, such as a vertical mill, a ball mill, detention slaker, combinations thereof, and the like. The ammonium sulfate and lime slurry are combined in the reaction tanks <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the use of two reaction tanks, it is contemplated that lime boil system <b>200</b> may include less or more devices than are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A slurry <b>213</b> of calcium sulfate and ammonia produced by the reaction of the lime slurry with the ammonium sulfate stream are fed to a stripper <b>214</b>, whereby the ammonia is recovered. The ammonia is regenerated in the stripper <b>214</b> to form an ammonia vapor stream <b>216</b>. The ammonia vapor stream can be recycled back to the CAP, in order to reduce consumption of ammonia in the CAP process. A portion <b>217</b> of the ammonia vapor stream can be fed back to the pre-condition section <b>100</b> of the combined cooling and cleaning system <b>16</b> and/or a portion <b>219</b> of the ammonia vapor stream can be fed back to the CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber <b>22</b> for use therein. The reduction in the overall consumption of ammonia in the power plant <b>1</b> will result in both material and energy savings. The calcium sulfate is extracted from the bottom of the stripper <b>214</b> in a slurry stream <b>221</b> and is fed to a gypsum thickener <b>218</b> or reaction tank for further crystal growth. The solids of the calcium sulfate slurry settle in the thickener <b>218</b> and can be extracted from the bottom of the thickener <b>218</b> as gypsum <b>223</b>, which may then subject to further processing, such as filtering, dewatering, washing, and the like. An optional condenser <b>220</b> can be disposed between the stripper <b>214</b> and the gypsum thickener <b>218</b> to cool the calcium sulfate slurry stream <b>222</b> before entering the thickener <b>218</b>. An air stream <b>227</b> can be in fluid communication with the condenser <b>220</b>, wherein the air stream <b>227</b> is configured to extract any residual ammonia from slurry stream <b>221</b>. The extracted ammonia with air can then be transferred to the cooling and cleaning stage <b>16</b> of the CAP process.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As mentioned above, the lime boil system <b>200</b> represents an improvement over other systems, because the system utilizes heat sources <b>226</b> that exist in other areas of the power plant, mainly from the CAP, that provide the necessary heat for the endothermic reaction that permits recovery of the ammonia from the ammonium sulfate stream. In one embodiment, the stripper <b>214</b> utilizes heat from the CO<sub>2</sub>-lean ammoniated solution generated in the regenerator <b>26</b> of the CO<sub>2</sub>-removal system <b>20</b>. A heat exchanger <b>224</b> can be disposed in fluid communication with the stripper <b>214</b> such that the CO<sub>2</sub>-lean ammoniated solution <b>32</b> can heat the ammonium sulfate-lime slurry within the stripper. The stripper <b>214</b> then produces the ammonia vapor stream <b>216</b>, which can be directly utilized with the CAP. Conventional lime boil processes produce ammoniated liquid streams that require evaporation within the CAP direct contact cooler (pre-conditioning system <b>100</b>), thereby increasing the energy requirement of the CAP. Moreover, utilization of the heated CO<sub>2</sub>-lean ammoniated solution as a heat source for the stripper <b>214</b> further reduces the energy requirements of the power plant <b>1</b>. In another embodiment, rather than the CO<sub>2</sub>-lean ammoniated solution, the ammonia stripper overhead gas can be utilized as a heat source for the lime boil system <b>200</b>. The ammonia stripper overhead is a hot gas that exits the ammonia stripper of the CAP after the ammonia has been separated from the wash liquid. Again, this reduces the energy requirements of the power plant <b>1</b>, by utilizing a heat source from one system (CAP) of the plant in a different system (lime boil system <b>200</b>). In still another embodiment, the heat source <b>226</b> can be a low pressure steam directed from the power plant <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an alternative embodiment, the same lime boil system can be utilized in those gas purification systems and processes where sodium hydroxide is used for acid gas capture in the CAP, rather than ammonia or limestone, as was described above. In such a system, rather than an ammonium sulfate stream being produced in the sulfur removal device <b>12</b>, a sodium sulfate stream is produced. It is to be noted that a CCS operating with a sodium-based scrubbing solution to form sodium sulfate, the lime boil system is used to form calcium sulfate and caustic. The caustic can be returned to the CCS to allow additional acid gas capture. As such the water wash system is designed to achieve the desired ammonia emissions to the stack to avoid producing an ammonium sulfate stream. Similarly, the system can be further utilized with Advanced Amine carbon capture processes, instead of or in addition to CAP. In Advanced Amine process, an alkali and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxide reagent is introduced into the direct contact cooler <b>50</b> and reacts with any SOx (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>) entrained in the flue gas to form an aqueous alkali and/or alkaline earth metal sulfur salt solution. For example, if the flue gas includes SO<sub>2 </sub>and SO<sub>3 </sub>and the ammonia reagent is replaced with sodium hydroxide, the resulting reaction provides an aqueous sodium sulfite and/or sodium sulfate solution. After removal of the sulfur dioxide, the flue gas can be sent to the CO<sub>2</sub>-absorber and water wash section where the flue gas is contacted with a first wash liquid comprising an amine compound (instead of ammonia), e.g., by bubbling the flue gas through the first wash liquid or by spraying the first wash liquid into the flue gas. Exemplary amine compounds include, without limitation, monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), diisopropylamine (DIPA), and aminoethoxyethanol (diglycolamine), and combinations thereof The amine based wash solution may further include a promoter and/or an inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a lime boil system <b>300</b> is illustrated for use in a power plant utilizing sodium hydroxide for acid gas capture in the CAP or Advanced Amine carbon capture system. The system <b>300</b> operates similarly to system <b>200</b>, except that a separate ammonia recovery stripper <b>214</b> is not required. Rather, the sodium sulfate <b>302</b> is reacted in reactors <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> with the lime slurry. A steam condensate supply <b>308</b> from the CAP/Advanced Amine process can be utilized to heat the sodium sulfate in a heat exchanger <b>304</b>. A lime slake mill <b>306</b> is again configured to slake the lime on-site into a slurry. A slurry <b>313</b> of calcium sulfate and sodium hydroxide are produced in the reaction tanks an the slurry is then sent to a gypsum thickener <b>318</b>, where the regenerated sodium hydroxide <b>319</b> can be purged from an upper portion of the gypsum thickener <b>318</b>, while the calcium sulfate dihydrate solids settle to the bottom portion of the thickener, where the gypsum <b>323</b> can be removed and subjected to further processing, such as secondary dewatering, filtering, and the like. The gypsum solids can be disposed or sold, while the filtrate can be returned to the CAP/Advanced Amine for acid gas capture.</p>
