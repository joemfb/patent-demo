<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the national stage of International Application No. PCT/JP2010/059473 filed on Jun. 3, 2010 and claims the benefit of priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-134617 filed on Jun. 4, 2009, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor substrate and a manufacturing method thereof and a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, there is a demand for making a semiconductor substrate, which is used for forming a semiconductor device such as a power metal oxide semiconductor (MOS), thinner to reduce a manufacturing cost, and, thus, a thin-type semiconductor substrate has been manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, a thinned semiconductor substrate of 300 (&#x3bc;m) or less is close to a paper or a film, and it is difficult to be subjected to handling such as a conveyance in a semiconductor manufacturing process. Thus, in order to eliminate such a problem, there is known a wafer of which an inner area of a boundary line, which is at a position offset inwardly from the outer edge of the wafer, is thinned and a material having a rigidity higher than the wafer covers an inner wall of a thick part exiting on outer side of the boundary line to increase a strength (for example, refer to Patent Document 1). Additionally, as a manufacturing method of the wafer disclosed in the Patent Document 1, there is disclosed a manufacturing method including a trench forming process of forming a trench extending along the boundary line from a front surface of the wafer to a back surface by applying an anisotropic etching to a range along the boundary line, and a removing process of removing a semiconductor exiting inside the trench until the surface of the wafer existing inside the trench reaches a bottom surface of the trench.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the wafer disclosed in the Patent Document 1 and the manufacturing method thereof, the inner wall of the trench is formed in flat and smooth by continuing the etching to maintain the aspect ratio of the trench to 7 to 9 when forming the trench, and the trench of which a connecting part between the inner wall and the bottom surface is rounded is formed. Thereby, the wafer can be made so that the inner wall of the thick part is flat and smooth and a stress is hardly concentrated into a connecting part between the thick part and a thin part, and it is hardly destroyed and easy to handle.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">However, in the wafer disclosed in the above-mentioned Patent Document 1 and the manufacturing method thereof, because the inner wall of the thick part is formed to be substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface part, a supplied resist liquid is stored on the bottom surface part of the wafer in a film forming process such as a resist forming process in an actual semiconductor device manufacturing process, there is a problem in that a desired film thickness cannot be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">That is, in a normal semiconductor device manufacturing process, when forming a pattern, a resist liquid is supplied onto the semiconductor substrate and the resist liquid is supplied to the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate by rotating the semiconductor substrate, and an excessive liquid is spun off by rotation to form a resist film of a desired film thickness. At this time, in the wafer disclosed in the Patent Document 1, the resist liquid is not spun off from the wafer due to the thick part existing on the outer circumferential edge as a perpendicular wall, and the resist liquid remains on the wafer. Besides, other than the resist, there is the problem that a desired film thickness cannot be acquired in a process of forming a film on the wafer surface by supplying a processing liquid in a semiconductor manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor substrate and a manufacturing method thereof and a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof, which can maintain a strength of a thin-type semiconductor substrate while a desired film thickness can be acquired in a film forming process of a semiconductor device manufacturing process.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means to Solve the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">In order to achieve the above mentioned object, a semiconductor substrate according to an aspect of the present invention is a semiconductor substrate having a semiconductor device formable area, wherein a reinforcing part, which is thicker than said semiconductor device formable area and has a top part of which surface is flat, is formed on an outer circumference part of the semiconductor substrate, and an inner side surface connecting said top part of the reinforcing part and said semiconductor device formable area has a cross-sectional shape of which inner diameter becomes smaller in proportion to its closeness to said semiconductor device formable area.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">Accordingly, the semiconductor substrate can be reinforced by the reinforcing part of the outer circumference part, and a process liquid supplied to the semiconductor device formable area can be spun off by rotation because the side surface of the reinforcing part has an inclined surface, which expands as it approaches the top part.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">In said semiconductor device, said inner side surface may have a cross-sectional shape lineally connecting said top part and said semiconductor device formable area.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">Accordingly, the semiconductor substrate is made, in which the side surface of the reinforcing part can be formed by machining. With simple processing, a film formation process such as a resist forming process can be performed appropriately while a sufficient strength is maintained in conveyance, and thermal diffusion of the semiconductor manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">In said semiconductor substrate, said inner side surface may have a cross-sectional shape of which inclination angle becomes smaller in proportion to its closeness to said semiconductor device formable area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">Accordingly, the inner side surface of the reinforcing part can be formed by an etching process, and a side surface shape can be made which can easily spin off a process liquid supplied to the semiconductor device formable area in the semiconductor manufacturing process of forming a semiconductor device in the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">In said semiconductor substrate, said reinforcing part may be formed by a semiconductor and has a cross-sectional structure of a sandwich structure having an oxidation film in a portion of the same thickness as said semiconductor device formable area.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">Accordingly, the reinforcing part, which is a separate member, can be joined onto a thin-type semiconductor substrate using the oxidation film, and the reinforcing part having a different thickness can be easily formed in the semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">In said semiconductor substrate, said semiconductor device formable area and said reinforcing part may be integrally formed by a semiconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">Accordingly, the semiconductor substrate having a thin-type semiconductor device formable area can be formed from a single sheet of thick semiconductor substrate, and a thin-type semiconductor substrate can be provided while using an original thickness in the reinforcing part.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">In said semiconductor substrate, said semiconductor device formable area may have a thickness equal to or smaller than 300 &#x3bc;m, and said reinforcing part may have a thickness equal to or larger than 500 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">Accordingly, a strength necessary for conveyance and diffusion heat treatment can be given to the semiconductor substrate in a state close to a paper or a film, which results in a semiconductor device that can be manufactured at a low cost by using a thin-type semiconductor substrate, and a semiconductor manufacturing process can be performed appropriately in a usual manner.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">A manufacturing method of a semiconductor substrate according to another aspect of the present invention is a manufacturing method of a semiconductor substrate including a semiconductor device formable area and a reinforcing part in an outer circumference part surrounding the semiconductor device formable area, the reinforcing part being thicker than the semiconductor device formable area, comprising:</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0134">A description will be given below, with reference to the drawings, of bet mode for carrying out the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> are views illustrating an example of an outline structure of a semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to an embodiment 1 of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a view illustrating an example of a cross-sectional structure of the semiconductor substrate according to the embodiment 1 of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a top view illustrating a plan structure of the semiconductor substrate according to the embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0136">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1 comprises a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> to be reinforced and a reinforcing ring <b>40</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> to be reinforced has a semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> and an outer circumference part <b>12</b>. The outer circumference part <b>12</b> and the reinforcing part <b>40</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> to be reinforced constitute a reinforcing part <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0137">The semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> to be reinforced includes the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> in the center part where a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor chip is formed and the outer circumference part <b>12</b> where the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is provided. The semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> to be reinforced may be constituted by various kinds of semiconductor materials, and, for example, a substrate material such as silicon, SiC, etc., may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0138">The semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> is an area where a semiconductor apparatus including a semiconductor device, such as a power MOS transistor, is formable. In recent years, there are many cases where a semiconductor device is required to be of a thin-type in view of reducing a manufacturing const and reducing an ON resistance. For example, the semiconductor device deformable area <b>11</b> for forming a semiconductor chip is required to be equal to or smaller than 300 &#x3bc;m in many cases. On the other hand, also in view of reducing manufacturing cost, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> is required to have a large surface area so that a large number of semiconductor devices can be formed from one sheet of semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>. For example, the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced may have a size of 150 mm to 300 mm in many cases to form semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0139">The outer circumference part <b>12</b> is an outside portion containing an outer edge of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. The outer circumference part <b>12</b> may be of the same material as the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> and integrally formed as a single sheet of semiconductor substrate. Because the outer circumference part <b>12</b> is provided with the reinforcing ring <b>40</b>, it is in a state where a semiconductor device cannot be formed. In the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the present embodiment, a handling operation such as conveyance, etc., is made easy on the entire semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> by providing the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> to the outer circumference part <b>12</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0140">The reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is a member for reinforcing the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced, and may be formed of the same semiconductor material as the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. The reinforcing ring <b>40</b> increases the thickness of the outer circumference part <b>12</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced by being coupled with the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforces to achieve easy handling such as conveyance of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0141">The reinforcement ring <b>40</b> has a part <b>41</b> with a surface which is flat. Thereby, in a case where whichever surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> is on the bottom side, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> can be dealt with by contacting the flat surface, thereby performing handling such as conveyance of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> in a stable state. Additionally, the top surface <b>41</b> of the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> may be configured to have a width equal to or smaller than 10 mm. For example, if it is a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be processed has a diameter equal to or smaller than 200 mm, and if it has a width equal to or smaller than 10 mm, it will have sufficient strength, and conveyance of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> can be performed as usual.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0142">The inner side surface <b>42</b> of the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> has a cross-sectional shape of which inner circumference decreases as being closer to the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. That is, it is configured that the opening is smaller as it becomes closer to the bottom surface, and the opening is larger as it becomes closer to the top part. By making such a structure, when a processing liquid such as a resist liquid is supplied onto the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, the processing liquid can move easily on an inclined surface of the inner side surface by rotating the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, which enables spinning off the processing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0143">The reinforcing ring <b>40</b> integrally constitutes the reinforcing part <b>50</b> together with outer circumference part <b>12</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. The reinforcing part is configured to have, for example, a thickness equal to or larger than 500 &#x3bc;m in its entirety, and preferably be configured to have a thickness of about 600 &#x3bc;m. Although the reinforcing part <b>50</b> has a structure in which the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced and the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> are laminated with each other when viewing the cross-sectional structure as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, it has a structure in which the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> is configured to be thin and the reinforcing part <b>50</b> is formed in the outer circumference part <b>12</b> to surround the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b>. By having such a structure, the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced and the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> are not always be separate members, and may be integrally formed by a single sheet of semiconductor substrate, or may be formed by a combination of pieces of other shapes. This point will be explained later.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0144">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the top view of the semiconductor substrate according to the embodiment 1, the reinforcing ring <b>40</b>, which has the inner side surface <b>42</b> and the top part <b>41</b>, constitutes the reinforcing part <b>50</b> to surround the outer circumference part <b>12</b> of the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b>. Moreover, as to the outer edge of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, it is configured so that the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is coincident with the outer edge of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. In addition, although the case where the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> is a circular shape and the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is an annular shape is explained in the present embodiment, when, for example, an orientation flat or a notch is formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced, the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> may be formed to be arranged along the orientation flat or may be formed in a part excluding the orientation flat or the notch. That is, the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> can be of any shape if it is provided in the outer circumference part of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced, and can reinforce the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0145">Moreover, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, for the sake of easy understanding, the area of the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is illustrated larger to match <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, but in the actual semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, it can be configured at a ratio at which the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> equal to or smaller than 10 mm is provided in the above-mentioned semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> of a diameter of 200 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view illustrating a cross-sectional structure of a conventional semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> of a thin-type as a reference example for comparison. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, if, for example, it is configured to be a thickness equal to or smaller than 300 &#x3bc;m and has a diameter of 150 to 300 mm, it becomes in a paper-thin state, and it is not only difficult to grasp side surfaces but also in a state in which the semiconductor substrate is bowed when it is placed on a conveyance table smaller than the diameter of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, which may generate a slippage (displacement) of semiconductor elements. On the other hand, in view of forming a semiconductor device, in a case of a semiconductor device having a structure in which electrodes are formed on a back surface such as a power MOS transistor, there is a large demand for the thin-type semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> because there is an advantage in a manufacturing cost if the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is thin.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view illustrating an example in which a power MOS transistor <b>20</b> is formed in the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the power MOS transistor <b>20</b> includes a drain area <b>21</b>, which is a high-concentration N layer formed of a silicon substrate, an N layer <b>22</b>, which is epitaxially grown, a surface N layer <b>23</b>, a channel <b>24</b> of a P layer, a source area <b>25</b> of an N layer, a source contact <b>26</b>, a gate <b>27</b>, an oxidation film <b>28</b>, a drain electrode <b>21</b><i>a</i>, a source electrode <b>26</b><i>a </i>and a gate electrode <b>27</b><i>a</i>. When a positive voltage is applied from the gate electrode <b>27</b><i>a </i>to the source area <b>25</b>, the channel <b>24</b> is open and a current flows from the drain area <b>21</b> to the source area <b>25</b> and the power MOS transistor <b>20</b> is driven. In the power MOS transistor <b>20</b> of such a vertical type, the drain area <b>21</b> and the drain electrode <b>21</b><i>a </i>are formed on the back surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, and is necessary to form a diffusion layer over an entire cross section between the front surface and the back surface. Thus, because each semiconductor layer can be set thinner as the thickness of the semiconductor substrate is thinner, an amount of heat can be reduced in the heat treatment to form each semiconductor layer and a manufacture of the semiconductor device can be performed at a low-cost. Therefore, it is desirable to make the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> thin in respect of the manufacture of the semiconductor devices. However, if it is made thin, a difficulty in handling, such as during conveyance, may happen. Thus, such a difficulty in handling is eliminated while still responding to a demand for a thin-type, by configuring the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> for forming the semiconductor devices to be of a thin-type, and also configuring the circumference with the reinforcing part <b>50</b>.</p>

The semiconductor substrates <b>60</b> are supported by being sandwiched by the retaining grooves <b>131</b>, and the semiconductor substrates are retained in the reaction tube <b>120</b> and being heat-treated.

If the structure of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1 is set, such a phenomenon that a middle part of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> is lowered can be prevented according to the presence of the reinforcing part <b>50</b>, which can improve yield.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0150">As mentioned above, as explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, by performing manufacture of semiconductor devices by using the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the present embodiment, the manufacturing cost is reduced, and yield can be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0152">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1 has an oxidation film <b>30</b> formed between the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> and the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. Because the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced and the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> are constituted as separate members in the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the present embodiment, surfaces of both can be oxidized individually to generate the oxidation film <b>30</b>. Then, a heat treatment is performed while the oxidation films <b>30</b> are overlapped with each other, which results in the oxidation films <b>30</b> being joined to each other. The semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1 uses such a joint between the oxidation films <b>30</b> to join the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> to the outer circumference part <b>12</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced and form the reinforcing part <b>50</b>. Accordingly, the cross-sectional structure of the reinforcing part <b>50</b> is a sandwich-like three-layer structure in which the oxidation film <b>30</b> is formed at a position on the front surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced and the semiconductor layer is formed on the oxidation film <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0153">In addition, a thickness of 6-inch semiconductor wafer specified in the SEMI standard is 625 &#x3bc;m, and the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the present embodiment is suitable for a case where the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced is thinner than 625 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0154">Moreover, the inner side surface <b>42</b> of the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> has a shape to linearly connect the top part <b>41</b> and the surface of the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b>. Such a shape can be easily formed by machining.</p>

Although a substrate formed of various semiconductors may be applied to the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced, a description is given of an example to which a silicon substrate is applied in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. When a silicon substrate is used for the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced, the oxidation layer <b>31</b> is made of SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0158">A reinforcing ring <b>40</b> is provided above the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced.

Although a member formed of various semiconductors may be applied to the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> similar to the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced, a description is given of an example of the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> formed of a silicon material in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> similar to the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced. An oxidation layer <b>32</b> is formed on the bottom surface <b>44</b> of the reinforcing ring <b>40</b>, and is in a joinable state with the semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> to be reinforced.

The inner side surface <b>42</b> has a cross-sectional shape, which connects linearly the inner side of the top part <b>41</b> and the inner side of the bottom surface <b>44</b>.

<p id="p-0101" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is an illustration illustrating a laminating process of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor substrate according to the embodiment 1.

Because the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> can be formed in a thin-type of about 300 &#x3bc;m, it is possible to manufacture a semiconductor device of which manufacturing cost is reduced.

<p id="p-0104" num="0163">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1 is placed on a stage <b>80</b>.

Because the surface of the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b> and the inner side surface <b>42</b> formed by the reinforcing ring <b>40</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> are inclined surfaces having a cross-sectional shape opening outward, the processing liquid can move upward on the inner side surface <b>42</b> and reach the top part <b>41</b>.

Thus, by rotating the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, the supplied processing liquid can be spun off, and, thereby, a film formed by the processing liquid can be adjusted to have a desired thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0164">In addition, it is desirable to set an angle of the inclined surface formed by the inner side surface <b>42</b> to 60 degrees or smaller relative to the surface of the semiconductor device formable area <b>11</b>, which is a horizontal surface, and more preferably be set to 45 degrees or smaller, and most preferably be 30 degrees or smaller.</p>

<p id="p-0107" num="0166">Thus, according to the manufacturing method of a semiconductor device using the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> according to the embodiment 1, a film can be formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> and a process such as patterning can be performed in the same manner as a normal semiconductor wafer of a completely planar form.</p>

Accordingly, it is possible to form a diffusion layer having a sufficiently high-concentration, which is extremely effective in forming a high-concentration diffusion layer having a high electric conductivity.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0220"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref> is an illustration illustrating an example of a concave shape forming process of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device according to the embodiment 9. In the concave shape forming process, a concave shape of which a central part is thin and an outer circumference part is thicker than the central part is formed in the second surface <b>17</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>15</b>. The concave shape may be formed according to various methods, and, for example, the method of joining oxidation films to each other explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> may be used, or the method of etching the semiconductor substrate <b>15</b> explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be used.

<p id="p-0163" num="0222"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16D</figref> is an illustration illustrating an example of a damage layer removing process of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device according to the embodiment 9. The damage layer removing process is a process of removing a damage layer by etching when the damage layer is formed on the surface of the concave part <b>18</b>, which is the semiconductor device formable area. The damage layer removing process may be provided, if necessary, when the damage layer is generated on the surface of the concave part <b>18</b>. For example, when the concave shape forming process is carried out according to mechanical processing such as grinding, the surface of the concave part <b>18</b> becomes coarse, which results in a damaged state. In such a case, it is desirable to remove the damage layer of which surface is coarse by etching, and, thus, the damage layer removing process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0223">The damage layer removing process may be performed by, for example, wet-etching or may be performed by dry-etching using plasma.

The epitaxial growth process is performed while the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is fixed to a stage <b>81</b> of an epitaxial growth apparatus, and because the first surface <b>16</b> (back surface), which is a flat surface, is in contact with the stage, the epitaxial growth layer <b>19</b> can be formed in a state where the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is easily held and surely fixed on the stage <b>81</b>.</p>

In this regard, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is fixed to a stage <b>82</b> of a resist application apparatus, and because the first surface <b>16</b>, which is a flat surface, is in contact with the stage <b>82</b>, the resist <b>220</b> can be applied while surely fixing the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>on the stage <b>82</b>.</p>

In this regard, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is placed on a stage of a development apparatus and the development is carried out, and because the first surface <b>16</b>, which is a flat surface, is brought into contact with the stage <b>84</b>, the development can be carried out easily in a stable state.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0228"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16J</figref> is an illustration illustrating an example of a second diffusion layer forming process of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device according to the embodiment 9. In the second diffusion layer forming process, first, ion implantation is carried out from above the formed resist pattern <b>220</b> into the concave part <b>18</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h</i>. In this regard, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16J</figref>, the semiconductor substrate is placed on a stage while the first surface, which is a flat surface, is brought into contact with the surface of the stage <b>85</b>. Accordingly, ions can be appropriately implanted into the surface of the concave part <b>18</b> formed in the second surface <b>17</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>in a state where the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is fixed on the stage <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0229">After the ion implantation, the resist <b>220</b> is removed and the ions implanted into the concave part <b>18</b> are thermally diffused by heating and annealing the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>so that a second diffusion layer is formed from the surface of the concave part <b>18</b>. In this regard, in the removal of the resist <b>220</b> and the anneal, because the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is placed on a stage while the first surface <b>16</b>, which is a flat surface, is brought into contact with the surface of the stage, the process can be carried out always in a stable state.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0230">As mentioned above, the diffusion layers are sequentially formed in the concave part <b>18</b>, which is the semiconductor device formable area, from the side of the second surface <b>17</b> by repeating the process from the resist applying process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16F</figref> to the second diffusion layer forming process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16J</figref>. Then, all of the diffusion layers necessary for the semiconductor device such as a MOS transistor, an IGBT, etc., are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0231"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16K</figref> is an illustration illustrating an example of a back surface metal forming process of the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device according to the embodiment 9. In the back surface metal forming process, a metal film is formed on the first surface (back surface) of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h</i>. In this case, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is placed on a stage <b>86</b> of a sputtering apparatus while the second surface <b>17</b>, which is the opposite surface of the first surface <b>16</b>, is brought into contact with the surface of the stage <b>86</b>, and because the second surface <b>17</b> is formed in the concave shape, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>cannot be stably supported on the surface of the stage <b>86</b> of the sputtering apparatus. Accordingly, an attachment <b>87</b> of a convex shape is inserted between the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>and the stage <b>86</b> so that the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>is stably supported on the stage <b>86</b>. It is desirable to set the height of the convex part of the attachment <b>87</b> from the periphery to be coincident with a depth of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>or slightly higher than that. By using the attachment <b>87</b> of the concave shape, the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h </i>can be stably supported on the stage <b>86</b>, and the sputtering can be carried out. Thereby, a thin film of metal can be formed on the first surface <b>16</b> of the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b><i>h. </i></p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0232">It should be noted that the back surface metal forming process is not always necessary, and may be provided if it is needed. As explained in the first diffusion layer forming process, because the formation of the diffusion layer to the first surface <b>16</b> is performed first, it is possible to form the diffusion layer on the first surface <b>16</b> with a sufficiently high concentration. Accordingly, a sufficient conductivity can be obtained with only the diffusion layer, and there may be a case where it is not always necessary to form a metal for conduction on the first surface <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0233">Thus, according to the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, by forming the diffusion layer on the back surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>15</b> first, it renders unnecessary the formation of the back surface metal.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0234">Additionally, in the processes other than the back surface metal forming process, because the contact surface with the stage can be processed as the first surface <b>16</b>, which is a flat surface, the process in each process can be performed easily and surely.</p>
