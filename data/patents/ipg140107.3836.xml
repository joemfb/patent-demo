<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described herein are processes and devices that modify a display quality of an area of a virtual universe. Some embodiments include operations to determine a number of avatars that occupy the area, determine a display quality of the area that can be reduced to conserve a computing resource that processes data to present the area and modify the display quality of the area proportionally to the number of avatars that occupy the area. The operations can further modify usage of a computing resource to process data to present the area in response to modification of the display quality of the area.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Virtual universe applications allow people to socialize and interact in a virtual universe. A virtual universe (&#x201c;VU&#x201d;) is a computer-based simulated environment intended for its residents to traverse, inhabit, and interact through the use of avatars. Many VUs are represented using 3-D graphics and landscapes, and are populated by many thousands of users, known as &#x201c;residents.&#x201d; Other terms for VUs include metaverses and &#x201c;3D Internet.&#x201d;</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described herein are processes and devices that reduce a display quality of an area of a virtual universe to conserve computing resources. One of the devices described is a virtual resource conserver. The virtual resource conserver determines, or selects, an area in the virtual universe. A computing resource processes data for presenting the area in the virtual universe. The virtual resource conserver evaluates significance factors about the area to determine a significance of how the area is being used, or an extent to which an area is being viewed by an avatar. The virtual resource conserver reduces a display quality of the area based on the significance of how the area is being used or viewed. The virtual resource conserver thus reduces usage of the computing resource.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The description that follows includes exemplary systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences and computer program products that embody techniques of embodiments of the invention(s). However, it is understood that the described embodiments of the invention(s) may be practiced without these specific details. For instance, although examples refer to smart objects that can automatically recognize indications to conserve computing resources, other examples include devices that are not smart objects, but that also determine indications to conserve computing resources. In other instances, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obfuscate the description.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Virtual universes (VUs) are becoming increasingly popular for both social and business use. Unfortunately, VUs demand large amounts of computing resources from servers, clients, and almost any network device utilized in a VU network. For example, many objects within a VU are intended to draw attention, for example, by exhibiting flashy characteristics like emitting sparkles, spinning, glowing, changing color, etc. Processing data to render the flashy characteristics demands significant computer processing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows how some objects can work with a virtual resource conserver to conserve computing resources in a VU environment.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of an example virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> within an operating environment <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a server <b>128</b> is connected to a communication network <b>122</b>. A client <b>124</b> is also connected to the communication network <b>122</b>. The server <b>128</b> hosts a virtual universe <b>101</b>. The client <b>124</b> communicates with the server <b>128</b>, via the communication network <b>122</b>, to obtain data that the client <b>124</b> processes to render a perspective of the virtual universe <b>101</b>. A virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> is connected to the server <b>128</b>, although in another example, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could be connected to the communication network <b>122</b> or the client <b>124</b>. In addition, the virtual resource conserver can be embodied in a server and/or client. A database <b>131</b> is connected to the server <b>128</b>, although the database <b>131</b> could also be connected to the communication network <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;, detects an indicator to reduce usage of a computing resource in the virtual universe <b>101</b>. Examples of indicators include messages or signals, generated automatically or manually, that indicate resources on the network devices, such as the server <b>128</b> or the client <b>124</b>, are experiencing busy times, poor performance, usage maximization, etc. Computing resources include devices or system components that process, display, or otherwise compute data that can be used in the virtual universe <b>101</b>. Computing resources include any physical or virtual component of limited availability within a computer system or operating environment. Some examples of computing resources include any device of limited availability within the operating environment <b>100</b>, such as the server <b>128</b>, the client <b>124</b>, the database <b>131</b>, and other devices, not shown, that could be included in a communication network <b>122</b>, such as routers, domain controllers, etc. Other examples of computing resources include components of limited availability within devices, such as processors, memory (e.g., random access memory, virtual memory, etc.), hard disk space, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The client <b>124</b> displays a memory usage monitor <b>118</b> and processor usage monitor <b>119</b>, both of which indicate that the internal memory and processor resources are near a maximum usage level. Consequently, the client <b>124</b> generates an indicator that its resources are being overused, for example, when usage rises above a pre-determined level. As a result, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> detects the indicator and recognizes it as an opportunity to reduce usage of computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The virtual universe <b>101</b> includes an object <b>109</b> (depicted as a dog) and an object <b>110</b> (depicted as a jeweled box). The objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> have displayable characteristics, such as actions and properties, which can be displayed within the virtual universe <b>101</b>. Examples of some displayable characteristics include a number of triangles devoted to render the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, movements of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, physical characteristics of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> (e.g., color or texture), actions performed by the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> (e.g., communicating, using items, etc.), a sparkle effect, an amount of luminosity, a location of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> (e.g., inside or outside of an inventory), etc. The displayable characteristics can correspond to functions and operations provided by one of the computing resources, such as a refresh rate, Rs, or a sparkle rate S. The refresh rate Rs and sparkle rate S are rates at which the displayable objects are processed by the computing resources for display of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> on devices, such as the client <b>124</b>. When the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> slows down one of the rates, then the quality of the object as rendered or displayed (&#x201c;display quality&#x201d;) is reduced. For example, the refresh rate Rs or the sparkle rate S can be a function of a clock cycle rate (t<b>1</b>) of a processor clock <b>130</b> on the server <b>128</b>. The refresh rate Rs or the sparkle rate S can also be a function of the data transfer rate (DT) <b>132</b>, or the rate at which data that makes up the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> is transferred over the communication network <b>122</b> between the server <b>128</b> and the client <b>124</b>. Further, the refresh rate Rs or the sparkle rate S, can also be a function of a clock cycle rate (t<b>2</b>) of a processor clock <b>134</b> on the client <b>124</b>. The clock cycle rates (t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>), in some examples, affect rates of action, such as refresh rates, sparkle rates, rates of movement, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, selects a resource conservation setting for any one of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> in the virtual universe <b>101</b> to respond to the indicator. For example, the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> are smart, or intelligent, in that they have &#x201c;built in&#x201d; resource conservation settings (&#x201c;conservation settings&#x201d;) that can respond to the indicators on the network that indicate an opportunity to conserve resources. The conservation settings for the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> could be stored in the database <b>131</b> in records that correspond to the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. In another embodiment, conservation settings for an object are defined in the object and exported or pushed to clients. In another embodiment, a conservation setting is generic to objects or a category of objects and utilized for a group or category of objects. The smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> can include more than one setting, or levels of settings, that indicate degrees to which the display quality of the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d;, reduces a display quality of the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. For example, the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> recognize an indicator that the memory usage <b>118</b> and/or the processor usage <b>119</b> on the client <b>124</b> are near a maximum. Consequently, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> reduces a refresh rate of the object <b>109</b> or a sparkle rate of the object <b>110</b>, thus reducing the display quality of the displayable characteristics of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> can reduce the rates by selecting and activating instructions that reduce displayable characteristics. For example, the client <b>124</b> may have code used to display a perspective of the virtual universe <b>101</b> on the client <b>124</b>. The code includes subroutines (e.g., functions, methods, procedures, event handlers, etc.), to determine how displayable characteristics of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> are processed and rendered by the client <b>124</b>. The subroutines include parameters, or variables, that receive arguments, or values. The arguments are passed when the subroutine is called. For instance, the code may utilize a default argument to maintain the sparkle characteristic <b>111</b> on the sparkling object <b>110</b> at a high display quality. Likewise, the code may utilize a default argument to maintain the texture of the avatar object <b>109</b> at a high display quality. The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b>, however, could pass an alternative, or modified, argument, different from the default argument, to specific subroutines, which would affect the display quality of the sparkle characteristic <b>111</b> on the sparkling object <b>110</b> and/or the texture of the object <b>109</b>. The resource conservation settings on the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> could include references to the subroutines and parameters, as well as one or more alternative argument values, so that the virtual resource conserver could refer to, and utilize, the proper subroutines with the alternative arguments.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some instances, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> replaces a display of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, with substitute, reduced quality images. The reduced quality images may resemble the original image of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. On the other hand, the reduced quality image may be a placeholder image that does not represent the original image, but generically represents the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. The placeholder image could be related to categories, such as all animated objects are replaced with a triangle, whereas all inanimate objects are replaced with circle.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>4</b>&#x201d;, reduces usage of one or more computing resources, such as memory usage or processor usage, on the client <b>124</b> or on the server <b>128</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> reduces usage of the computing resources both directly and indirectly. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> can directly cause the clock <b>130</b> on the server <b>128</b> or the clock <b>134</b> on the client <b>124</b>, to slow down. By slowing the clocks <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could cause a temporal dilation, which can affect a refresh rates and action rates of objects in the virtual universe <b>101</b>. Likewise, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could reduce the data transfer rate (DT) <b>132</b>, which could also cause a temporal dilation in the virtual universe <b>101</b>. As a result of directly reducing usage of computing resources, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> indirectly causes reduction of the display quality of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b>, however, can also indirectly reduce usage of computing resources. For example, as described in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> reduces display quality of the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, such as by directly passing alternative arguments, the result being that the computing resources do not have to work as hard. Thus, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> indirectly causes computing resources to reduce in usage. In yet other examples, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could directly and indirectly reduce usage of computing resources, such as by directly slowing processor or memory usage (e.g., causing temporal dilation, causing overall display degradation), and by using the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> to directly reduce display quality, which indirectly reduces usage of computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could reallocate conserved computing resources to solve performance problems in the virtual universe operating environment <b>100</b>. If the virtual universe operating environment <b>100</b> is experiencing performance problems in an area of the virtual universe <b>101</b>, then the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could utilize the conserved computing resources to address the performance problem.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other examples, users can volunteer to utilize the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. For instance, the user could manually enable a user account setting indicating that the user agrees to utilize the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> reads the user account setting and accordingly enables the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, such as by updating the conservation settings for the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>. The enabled conservation settings indicate that the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> are in &#x201c;conservation&#x201d; mode, and, therefore, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> is authorized to reduce the display quality of the objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To incentivize users of the virtual universe <b>101</b> to conserve computing resources, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> can reward users of the virtual universe <b>101</b> who use smart objects. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could provide a user's virtual universe user account, or an avatar associated with the user, with a reward, such as special privileges, points, virtual currency, discounts, access to restricted functions, increased display quality to some objects, better performance, increased bandwidth, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the examples described above, the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> were reduced in display quality to conserve computing resources. Alternatively, energy-efficient objects may be rendered or displayed with lower display quality as a default. Users of the virtual universe may then &#x201c;upgrade&#x201d; the display quality of objects by paying a fee or performing a service. The virtual resource conserver <b>102</b> could update conservation settings of the smart objects <b>109</b>, <b>110</b>, to look at a user's account for indicators whether the user has paid the fees or performed the server, to be exempted from display quality reduction.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example Operating Environments</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically, this section includes discussion about virtual resource conserver operating environments and virtual resource conserver architectures.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example of Preparing a Virtual Object with Resource Conservation Settings</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an example illustration of preparing a virtual object with resource conservation settings. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an operating environment <b>200</b> includes a virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> connected to a communication network <b>222</b>. A server <b>228</b> is also connected to the communication network <b>222</b>. A client <b>224</b> is connected to the communication network <b>222</b> and processes data, provided by the server <b>228</b> or generated by the client <b>224</b>, to display a perspective of a virtual universe <b>201</b>. A database <b>231</b> is connected to the communication network <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The virtual universe <b>201</b> contains an object <b>209</b>. The object <b>209</b> possesses displayable characteristics, abilities and/or properties, which define how the object <b>209</b> acts and/or appears in the virtual universe <b>201</b>. For example, the object <b>209</b> could be a pet avatar that belongs to a virtual universe resident. The object <b>209</b> is created by a manufacturer of objects in the virtual universe <b>201</b>. When created, the object <b>209</b> is assigned one or more displayable characteristics <b>240</b> (e.g., functionality, properties, etc.), as well as metadata and settings (e.g., a unique universal identification (UUID)). The assigned displayable characteristics <b>240</b>, metadata, and settings define the object <b>209</b> and permit it to function in the virtual universe <b>201</b>. As part of the creation process, or any time thereafter, the object <b>209</b> can be made into a smart object by assigning one or more conservation settings <b>244</b> that store metadata concerning when, how, or to what degree, to reduce a display quality of the object <b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The virtual resource conserver <b>202</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;, selects the one or more displayable characteristics <b>240</b> of the object <b>209</b>. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> selects the one or more displayable characteristics <b>240</b> by referencing one or more entries in the database <b>231</b> that store information about the object <b>209</b>. In another example, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> selects the one or more displayable characteristics <b>240</b> by referring to code, such as subroutines, that control or define the displayable characteristics <b>240</b>. In yet another example, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> selects the one or more displayable characteristics <b>240</b> by utilizing a graphical user interface that refers to the database entry or code. The displayable characteristics <b>240</b> can be one of many different characteristics of the object <b>209</b> including texture, movement, color, object effects, luminosity, location, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The virtual resource conserver <b>202</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, determines a quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> to associate with a conservation setting <b>244</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> can subsequently utilize the quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> to reduce the display quality of the selected displayable characteristics <b>240</b> of the object <b>209</b>. The quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> can include subroutines, statements, variables, expressions, operators, arguments, values, constants, arrays, etc., that, when activated or applied, reduce a display quality of the selected displayable characteristics <b>240</b>. For example, the quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> could include state-based logic that recognizes and reacts to the state of a computing resource, such as in a proportional manner to a usage of the computing resource. For instance, as the usage for the computing resource rises above a pre-determined value, the quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> proportionally reduces the display quality of the displayable characteristics <b>240</b>. The quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> can be created and stored in, or selected from, a code repository <b>243</b>, such as a file, a script, a data library, a database record, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In stage &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d;, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b>, associates the quality reduction instruction <b>242</b> with the conservation setting <b>244</b> for the object <b>209</b>. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> could create one or more records or entries in the database <b>231</b> that together comprise the conservation setting <b>244</b>. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> could select, or create, a column <b>245</b> in the database <b>231</b>, and insert a reference <b>247</b> to the quality reduction instruction <b>242</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> could also select, or create, a column <b>246</b> and insert a setting value <b>248</b> to indicate whether the conservation setting <b>244</b> is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>4</b>&#x201d;, associates levels <b>250</b> of quality reduction instructions to the object <b>209</b>. For instance, the levels <b>250</b> represent degrees of quality reduction, which can also be stored in the database <b>231</b> in database columns. The levels <b>250</b> are associated with the conservation setting <b>244</b>. For instance, the levels <b>250</b> can be stored in a record of the database <b>231</b>. This record is related to, and consequently also comprises, the conservation setting <b>244</b>. The levels <b>250</b> can be assigned according to an agreed-upon standard of levels for smart objects, or can be a customized set of levels. A first level <b>206</b> could include a first reference <b>208</b> to one or more quality reduction instructions that reduce a number of triangles devoted to render an avatar's body. A second level <b>209</b> could provide further display quality reduction via a reference <b>211</b> to one or more quality reduction instructions that would reduce body movements of the object <b>209</b> and remove some display characteristics, like body hair, color, etc. A third level <b>212</b> could provide even further display quality reduction via a reference <b>214</b> to one or more quality reduction instructions that can stop all scripts and immobilize the object <b>209</b>. A final fourth level <b>215</b> could provide yet further display quality reduction via a fourth reference <b>217</b> to one or more quality reduction instructions that can remove the object <b>209</b> entirely from the virtual universe <b>201</b>, or by placing the object <b>209</b> in an avatar's inventory. The levels <b>250</b> represent a gradual reduction of display quality that the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> can apply to the object <b>209</b> when the opportunity arises to conserve computing resources. The gradual reduction of display quality can correlate to a degree of usage of a computing resource. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> can activate the levels <b>250</b>, according to their gradual order, to maintain a computing resource below levels of usage that would cause performance degradation in the virtual universe <b>201</b>. For instance, as a computing resource approaches a maximum usage level, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> could cause the object <b>209</b> to activate the first level <b>206</b>, which could cause the computing resource usage to stabilize. However, as a busy period increases the usage of the computing resource, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> could activate the second level <b>209</b>, and so forth, to continue to stabilize the computing resource. The levels <b>206</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>215</b> can also have respective setting values <b>207</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>213</b>, and <b>216</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> can enable the conservation settings (e.g., per user request, per administrator request, etc.) to authorize which levels the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> can apply.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> describes associating information to a conservation setting <b>244</b> of an object <b>209</b> that can be used to reduce the display quality of the object. In some examples, however, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> assigns information to the resource conservation setting <b>244</b> that can be used to increase, or augment, a display quality of the object <b>209</b>. For instance, in some examples the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> could update the conservation setting <b>244</b> of the object <b>209</b>, to utilize a quality augmentation instruction or value that can be used to improve the display quality of the object <b>209</b> from a degraded quality state to an improved quality state. The degraded quality state may occur because the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> caused the object <b>209</b> to be reduced in display quality, such as via using a quality reduction instruction or value, to reduce resource usage when resources were busy. On the other hand, the degraded quality state may occur because the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> sets the objects <b>109</b> to a reduced quality state as a default, to minimize usage of computing resources. A user account that uses the object <b>109</b>, however, may have &#x201c;upgraded&#x201d; their status, (e.g., paid a fee, performed a service, etc.) so that when the client <b>224</b> processes the virtual universe <b>201</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> reads the user accounts settings and determines that the user account is an &#x201c;upgraded&#x201d; account. Consequently, the virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> looks at the resource conservation setting <b>244</b> for information that can be used to augment the display quality of the object <b>209</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>202</b> then augments the display quality of the object <b>209</b> by applying quality augmentation instructions or values stored within the setting <b>244</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example illustration of modifying a display of an area based on a number of avatars in the area to conserve computing resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an operating environment <b>300</b> includes a virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> connected to a communication network <b>322</b>. A server <b>328</b> is connected to the communication network <b>322</b>. A client <b>324</b> is also connected to the communication network <b>322</b>. The server <b>328</b> hosts a virtual universe <b>301</b>. A database <b>331</b> is connected to the server <b>328</b>, although the database <b>331</b> could also be connected to the communication network <b>322</b>. All network devices described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such as the server <b>328</b>, the communication network <b>322</b>, and the client <b>324</b>, may be referred to as computing resources. Further, all components with limited availability within the devices, such as processors, memory, disk space, etc., are also computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The virtual universe <b>301</b> contains one or more areas, such as a first area <b>312</b>, a second area <b>314</b>, and a third area <b>316</b>. The areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> may have unseen boundary lines <b>313</b>. The boundary lines <b>313</b> may be predetermined and may correlate to boundaries where one computing resource's domain ends and another begins. The boundary lines <b>313</b> could correlate to virtual real-estate property boundaries. Further, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may generate the boundary lines <b>313</b> according to logical rules for determining areas. Each area <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> comprises one or more objects, such as buildings, landscaping, sidewalks, etc. The one or more objects have displayable characteristics, such as textures, colors, actions, etc. The first area <b>312</b> has multiple avatars <b>308</b> occupying the area <b>312</b>. The second area <b>314</b> has one avatar <b>307</b> occupying the area <b>314</b>. The third area <b>316</b> has no avatars occupying the area <b>316</b>. The areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> may have a refresh rate (Rt<b>1</b>) related to a clock cycle rate (t<b>1</b>) of a processor clock <b>330</b> on the server <b>328</b>. The refresh rate (Rt<b>1</b>) relates to a default display quality of the one or more objects in the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. Other functions and operations, such as a data transfer rate (DT) <b>332</b>, or other rates controlled by the network devices, can also affect the default display quality of the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;, selects one or more areas, such as the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, to potentially reduce in display quality. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may look at the computing resources that are used to display the virtual universe <b>301</b>. If those computing resources are experiencing performance issues, inefficiency, or over usage, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may select all areas under the computing resources' control to determine whether, and to what degree, some displayable characteristics may be reduced in display quality to conserve some of the computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, determines and evaluates one or more significance of use factors (&#x201c;significance factors&#x201d;) to determine whether, or to what degree, to reduce display quality of the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. Significance factors are information, conditions, or characteristics relating to the nature of an activity in, or a purpose for, an area in the virtual universe. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> determines that a number of avatars that occupy the areas, (&#x201c;avatar population&#x201d;) will serve as a significance factor. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can determine that an avatar occupies an area if the avatar is in, or is in close proximity to, the area. Based on the number of avatars, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can calculate a degree, or amount, that it can reduce the display quality for the area. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> determines that no avatars occupy the third area <b>316</b>, thus the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may decide to significantly reduce the display quality of the area <b>316</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> determines that one avatar <b>307</b> occupies the second area <b>314</b>, thus the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may decide to moderately reduce the display quality of the second area <b>314</b>, although not as much as the third area <b>316</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> determines that many avatars <b>308</b> occupy the third area <b>312</b>, thus the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may decide to not reduce the display quality of the area <b>312</b>. In some examples, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can use the significance factors to determine the areas to select in stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;. In other words, stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d; may precede as well as follow stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;, or may be performed at the same time as stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can patrol computing resources in the operating environment <b>300</b>, as part of a resource conservation plan. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> would look specifically for areas that can be reduced in display quality, even though the computing resources controlling those areas may not be experiencing performance issues. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could analyze areas in light of display quality reduction criteria (e.g., significance factors), and then select the areas based on the analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Other factors for determining whether, or to what degree, to reduce display quality of the areas could include whether the activity in the area has been flagged as being important, if the activity is sponsored or scheduled, if the activity has a strong monetary importance, or if the area has a significance that relates strongly to a goal or purpose of the virtual universe <b>301</b>. Examples of significant or important activities and/or purposes include a sponsored music concert, a public information kiosk, a dangerous trap, or a treasure.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d;, reduces the display quality of the selected area or areas based on the evaluated significance factors. For instance, because the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> calculated that no avatars were occupying the third area <b>316</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> significantly reduces the display quality of the third area <b>316</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> removes landscaping and other insignificant objects. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> reduces the image quality of the building in the third area <b>316</b> to have an outline, or frame, but displays little or no detail. The virtual resource conserver could also consider the number of avatars in nearby areas. For example, if there were no avatars occupying the second area <b>314</b>, which is adjacent to the third area <b>316</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may have entirely removed the image of the building from the third area <b>316</b> as it is a far distance from an area with any avatars (e.g., the first area <b>312</b>). In one example, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may remove the objects from the third area <b>316</b> simply because there are no avatars occupying the third area <b>316</b> (e.g., formulaically, zero avatars would equate to zero display quality, hence the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> would remove the display of all objects in the area).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> reduces the display quality of the second area <b>314</b>, although not as much as the third area <b>316</b> because the second area has one avatar <b>307</b> occupying the second area <b>314</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> reduces the display quality of the second area <b>314</b> by reducing the display quality of unimportant displayable characteristics, such as by removing textures or colors from the fa&#xe7;ade of the building, and minimizing the view of the landscaping. However, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> maintains a well defined structure to important displayable characteristics of some objects, like the building, entry ways, and sidewalks, so that the avatar <b>307</b> can use the building without hindrance or confusion. Some of the objects in the areas <b>316</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>312</b>, can be smart objects. Also, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can gradually reduce the display quality of the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> based on evaluated significance factors. For instance, as significance factors change, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can adjust the display quality to compensate for the changes. For example, as a computing resource degrades in performance, or as a computing resource becomes busier or over used, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can gradually reduce display quality of the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> to maintain computing resources below a specific level of usage.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>4</b>&#x201d;, reduces computing resource usage. For instance, regarding the third area <b>316</b>, the refresh rate R(t<b>1</b>), can be a function of the clock rate (t<b>1</b>) on the server <b>328</b>. Consequently, virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could reduce usage of the processor clock <b>330</b> on the server <b>328</b>, to a different rate (e.g., t<b>3</b>), which would cause the refresh rate on the third area <b>316</b> to be reduced, thus reducing display quality of the third area. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could instead use a clock rate from the client <b>324</b>, such as clock rate (t<b>3</b>) related to a clock cycle rate of a processor clock <b>336</b> on the client <b>324</b>, to process the refresh rate R(t<b>3</b>) on the third area <b>316</b>. Consequently, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could reduce usage of the processor clock <b>336</b> on the client <b>324</b>, thus reducing display quality of the third area <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to the second area <b>314</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could use a clock rate from the client <b>324</b>, such as clock rate (t<b>2</b>) related to a clock cycle rate of a second processor clock <b>334</b> on the client <b>324</b>, to process the refresh rate R(t<b>2</b>) on the second area <b>314</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could reduce usage of the processor clock <b>334</b>, thus reducing the display quality of the second area <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another example, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could reduce the data transfer rate (DT) <b>332</b> of data used to display the virtual universe <b>301</b>. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could throttle data, or cause the server <b>328</b> to throttle data, to reduce the display quality of the third area <b>316</b> or the second area <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The examples described so far in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> have described how a virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> reduces display quality of areas. The areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> start out with a detailed view. Then, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> reduces the display quality of the areas <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, based on evaluated significance factors. However, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could, alternatively, increase a display quality of an area, based on evaluated significance factors. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could initially present an area with a reduced display quality, but then increase the display quality area based on the number of avatars occupying the area. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may reduce the display quality of all areas that do not have avatars so that the area would have the display quality similar to the third area <b>316</b> as shown in stage &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d;. However, as an avatar approaches the area, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> may increase the display quality of the area. If more avatars occupy the area, then the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could increase the display quality until the area has no reduction in display quality. Mentioned previously in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> can reward and compensate users of the virtual universe <b>301</b> that use smart objects. One of the ways that the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could reward users of the virtual universe <b>301</b> would be to provide views that are not reduced in display quality. Furthermore, additional significance factors that the virtual resource conserver <b>302</b> could evaluate could include whether the user that controls the avatars <b>307</b>, <b>308</b> has volunteered to experience reduced views.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an example illustration of modifying a view of an area based on an avatar's perspective, to conserve computing resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an operating environment <b>400</b> includes a virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> connected to a communication network <b>422</b>. A server <b>428</b> is connected to the communication network <b>422</b>. A client <b>424</b> is also connected to the communication network <b>422</b>. The server <b>428</b> hosts a virtual universe <b>40</b>. A database <b>431</b> is connected to the server <b>428</b>, although the database <b>431</b> could also be connected to the communication network <b>422</b>. All network devices described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such as the server <b>428</b>, the communication network <b>422</b>, and the client <b>424</b>, may be referred to as computing resources. Further, all components with limited availability within the devices, such as processors, memory, disk space, etc., are also computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The virtual resource conserver <b>402</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;, determines one or more areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> in a peripheral view of an avatar <b>407</b>. In one example, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> determines areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> in a peripheral view of the avatar <b>407</b> by first determining the avatar's direct field of vision marked by a first set of boundary lines <b>418</b> and an angle of direct view <b>404</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> can determine the angle of direct view <b>404</b> based on multiple criteria. For instance, if the avatar <b>407</b> is engaged in an activity that requires a wider direct field of vision, such as fighting a battle, seeking an item or hunting a creature, shopping for virtual real estate, etc., then the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> can increase the angle of direct view <b>404</b> to be sufficiently wide. Wide angle views may be referred to as &#x201c;broad interest&#x201d; views. In other examples, if the avatar <b>407</b> is engaged in an activity that does not require a wider direct field of vision, such as engaging in a one-on-one conversation, playing a video game, observing a single object, waiting for a virtual item to respond, etc., then the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> can decrease the angle of direct view <b>404</b> to be fairly narrow. Such narrow angle views may be referred to as &#x201c;narrow interest&#x201d; views.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A second set of boundary lines <b>417</b> can indicate areas that are in front of the avatar, which are potentially viewable by the avatar <b>407</b> within the virtual universe <b>401</b>. Although the boundary lines <b>417</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as a straight line, the boundary lines <b>417</b> could be curved or set at an angle, depending on the display capabilities of the virtual universe <b>401</b>. Consequently, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> determines that any area in front of the second boundary lines <b>417</b>, but outside of the first boundary lines <b>418</b>, are areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> in the avatar's peripheral view. The areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> will be referred to as &#x201c;peripheral view areas.&#x201d; The peripheral views areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> therefore comprise the areas measured from the first boundary lines <b>418</b>, through the angles of peripheral view <b>405</b>, <b>406</b>, until reaching the second boundary line <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The virtual resource conserver <b>402</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, reduces the display quality of the one or more peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>. The objects, such as buildings <b>412</b> and <b>414</b>, within the peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>, can be reduced in display quality by removing textures, colors, actions, movements, etc. In one example, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> changes the refresh rate (t<b>1</b>) for the peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> so that in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, the refresh rates for the peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> have changed to a second, slower refresh rate (t<b>2</b>), thus reducing the display quality of the peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>. In one example, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> could determine that any one of the peripheral views <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> should not be reduced in display quality. For example, if an important activity is occurring in the area <b>442</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> may decide not to reduce the display quality of that area <b>442</b>, and instead only reduce the area <b>440</b>. In other words the angle of peripheral view <b>406</b> would become part of the angle of direct view <b>404</b>, so that the boundary line <b>418</b> over lays the boundary line <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The virtual resource conserver <b>402</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d;, reduces usage of computing resources. For example, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> reduces display quality by reducing the use of computing resources. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> could reduce usage of the processor clock <b>430</b> on the server <b>428</b>, to change the clock cycle rate (t<b>1</b>) to a slower clock cycle rate, which could cause the refresh rate on the peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b> to be reduced. The virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> could instead reduce the clock rate (t<b>2</b>) of processor clock <b>434</b> on the client <b>424</b>. In another example, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> could reduce the data transfer rate (DT) <b>432</b> of data used to display the virtual universe <b>401</b>. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> could throttle data, or cause the server <b>428</b> to throttle data, to reduce the display quality of the peripheral view areas <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>. By reducing the clock cycle rates and data transfer rates, the virtual resource conserver <b>402</b> can reduce computer resource usage.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some examples, users of the virtual universe <b>401</b> can volunteer to experience limited views.

The clients <b>523</b>, <b>524</b> process data, from the servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b>, <b>530</b> to respectively render a perspective of the virtual universe <b>501</b>. The servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b>, <b>530</b> can control different areas <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> in a region <b>560</b> of the virtual universe <b>501</b>. In other examples, portions, or sections of a single computing resource (e.g., partitions of a single database, processors of a single server, etc.) could instead control the areas <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> of the virtual universe <b>501</b>. The portions, or sections, of the single computing resource may be considered as separate computing resources for purposes of this description. The region <b>560</b> includes one or more topology objects <b>550</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>552</b>. Topology objects <b>550</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>552</b> are objects that that give the region <b>560</b> a look and feel. The topology objects <b>550</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>552</b> are useful to give the region <b>560</b> a consistent topology. However, topology objects <b>550</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>552</b> are non-interactive, meaning that the avatars <b>503</b>, <b>507</b> can see them, and possibly touch them, but the topology objects <b>550</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>552</b> do not meaningfully respond to, or interact with, the avatars <b>503</b>, <b>507</b>. The region <b>560</b> can also include interactive objects <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>. The interactive objects <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b> are objects with which the avatars <b>503</b>, <b>507</b> can meaningfully interact. The interactive objects <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b> generally relate to a purpose for the existence of the areas <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> in the virtual universe <b>501</b>. Some examples of interactive objects include reward items (e.g., treasures, scrolls, gifts, etc.) quest related items (traps, monsters, secrets, etc.), interactive avatars (e.g., quest givers, combatants, allies, social contacts, etc.), personal items (e.g., a weapon, a cell phone, a television, etc.), recreational items (e.g., vending machines, video games, puzzles, etc.), and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d;, determines one or more areas in the region <b>560</b> to collapse or coalesce. Coalescing, or combining, an area means to move objects of significance, such as avatars and/or interactive objects, from the area into another area in a region of the virtual universe <b>501</b>. Avatars that are controlled by a user are usually objects of significance, because the area exists primarily for the avatar's use. Interactive objects are also objects of significance depending on how an avatar is interacting, or could likely interact, with the interactive object. For instance, if an avatar is using the interactive object, then the interactive object is an item of significance. However, if there are a plurality of interactive objects in a area, like a row of identical vending machines, and only one avatar is near the vending machines, but the avatar is not interacting with any of the vending machines, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may determine that only one of the vending machines should be considered an object of significance, because the one avatar could potentially interact with one of the vending machines. However, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> would consider the remainder of the vending machines as non-significant objects. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could further analyze whether the avatar is likely to interact with the interactive object. For example, even though an interactive object may be near an avatar, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may analyze where the avatar is currently looking, or what the avatar is currently doing. If the avatar is not looking at the nearby interactive object, if the avatar is moving away from the nearby interactive object, or if the avatar is distracted by or using another interactive object, then the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may consider the nearby interactive object as a non-significant item. Coalescing is performed to clear out an area of significant objects so that the area can be collapsed. Collapsing an area means that after the significant objects are removed from the area, all other non-significant objects (e.g., topology objects) can be removed from display or significantly reduced in display quality, to conserve computing resources. In some embodiments, the entire area can be cropped from the virtual universe <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> analyzes the first area <b>510</b> and determines that the avatar <b>503</b> is occupying the area <b>510</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> also determines that the avatar <b>503</b> interacts with the interactive object <b>504</b>. Because one or more objects of significance, e.g., the avatar <b>503</b> and the interactive object <b>504</b>, occupy the first area <b>510</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b>, determines that the first area <b>510</b> could be coalesced with another area, or that another area could be coalesced with the first area <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Because there is an avatar in the first area <b>510</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines which of the servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b>, <b>530</b> controls the first area <b>510</b> so that the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> can determine session data used by the first client <b>523</b> to control the avatar <b>503</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> can subsequently transfer the session data to another computing resource when moving the avatar <b>503</b> from the first area <b>510</b>. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines that the first server <b>528</b> controls the first area <b>510</b>, or in other words the first server <b>528</b> processes data for displaying objects and controlling actions in the first area <b>510</b>. The first server <b>528</b> also processes session data for the first client <b>523</b> to control the avatar <b>503</b> within the first area <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> also analyzes the second area <b>512</b> and the third area <b>514</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> analyzes the second area <b>512</b> and determines that there are no avatars in the area <b>512</b> and determines that the second area <b>512</b> will be collapsed. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines that the second server <b>529</b> controls the second area <b>512</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> analyzes the third area <b>514</b> and determines that the avatar <b>507</b> occupies the third area <b>514</b>, and that the avatar <b>507</b> interacts with the interactive object <b>508</b>. Because one or more object of significance, e.g., the avatar <b>507</b> and interactive object <b>508</b>, occupy the third area <b>514</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b>, determines that the third area <b>514</b> could be coalesced with another area, or that another area could be coalesced with the third area <b>514</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines that the third server <b>530</b> controls the third area <b>514</b>, or in other words, the third server <b>530</b> processes data for displaying objects and controlling actions in the third area <b>514</b>. The third server <b>530</b> also processes session data for the second client <b>524</b> to control the avatar <b>507</b> within the third area <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> has detected two areas, the first area <b>510</b> and the third area <b>514</b>, which could be coalesced to conserve computing resources. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> analyzes the computing resources to determine whether coalescing and collapsing the areas would be a savings or efficiency enhancement of computing resource usage. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> analyzes information about the servers <b>528</b> and <b>530</b>, and may determines that coalescing the first area <b>510</b> and the third area <b>514</b> would require more computing resources to coalesce and maintain coalesced than would be saved. For example, if many avatars were occupying and moving in and out of the first area <b>510</b> and the third area <b>514</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may determine that coalescing the first area <b>510</b> and the third area <b>514</b> would be a drain on computing resources. On the other hand, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may analyze the server <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> and recognize other scenarios and metrics that indicate coalescing areas would be efficient and/or beneficial. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may determine (e.g., analyze resources, receive an indication from an administrator, etc.) that some important tasks should be processed by a single computing resource. Consequently, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could determine that the first area <b>510</b> should be coalesced with the third area <b>514</b> so that the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> can use the first server <b>528</b> to process the important tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Once determined that there would be a savings or efficiency enhancement of computing resource usage, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines which of the three servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b>, <b>530</b> can most efficiently process a single, coalesced area. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines that the third server <b>530</b> can most efficiently process the objects (e.g., the third server <b>530</b> is more powerful, the third server <b>530</b> is less busy, etc.) and, hence, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> determines that the first area <b>510</b> will be coalesced with, or combined into, the third area <b>514</b>, and that the first area <b>510</b> and the second area <b>512</b> will be collapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>2</b>&#x201d;, coalesces and collapses the areas. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> moves the first avatar <b>503</b> to the third area <b>514</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> also moves the interactive object <b>504</b> to the third area <b>514</b> because the first avatar <b>503</b> was interacting with the interactive object <b>504</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could move the avatar from the first area <b>510</b> to the third area <b>514</b> using one or many techniques, such as by using functions built into the virtual universe <b>501</b>, including teleportation, walk, run, fly, etc. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could re-draw and re-map the avatar <b>503</b> and the interactive object <b>504</b> into the third area <b>514</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could orient the avatar, such as by demonstrating to the avatar <b>503</b> where it will be moved before actually moving the avatar <b>503</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may demonstrate to the avatar <b>503</b> a proposed path of movement on a map, or with visual indicators, like arrows or lines, that show that movement will occur from a point in the first area <b>510</b> to a point in the third area <b>514</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> does not move the topology object <b>550</b> because it is an unimportant object that is consuming resources without a significant purpose other than to act as landscaping.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> collapses the first area <b>510</b> by removing a display of the topology object <b>550</b>, and any other non-significant objects. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> can remove objects by reducing the display quality of the objects until they are no longer displayed. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could remove some objects by moving the objects into an avatar inventory. Many techniques have been described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> which the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could utilize to reduce the display quality of objects. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> also collapses the second area <b>512</b> by removing any topology objects, such as topology object <b>551</b>, as well as any non-significant objects.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could cause a reduced display quality image of the interactive object <b>506</b>, from the second area <b>512</b>, to appear in the third area <b>514</b>. This reduced display quality image of the interactive object <b>506</b>, can be moved, or redrawn with a new image. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> may move, or redraw, the interactive object <b>506</b> into the third area <b>514</b> to indicate to other avatars that enter the region <b>560</b> that the third area <b>514</b> can accommodate other avatars that may want to interact with objects in the region <b>560</b>. However, the virtual resource conserver <b>506</b> reduces the display quality of the interactive object <b>506</b> to maximize resource conservation. Once an avatar comes close to the reduced display quality image of the interactive object <b>506</b> in the third area <b>514</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could increase the display quality of the interactive object <b>506</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could reduce the display quality of non-significant objects in the third area <b>514</b>, such as the topology object <b>552</b>, for additional resource conservation. The physical layout of the third area <b>514</b> can change because objects are moved into the third area <b>514</b>. Plus, the third area <b>514</b> can expand, if necessary, to accommodate the first avatar <b>503</b>, the interactive object <b>504</b>, and the reduced display quality image of the interactive object <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b>, in stage &#x201c;<b>3</b>&#x201d;, reduces usage of the computing resources that control the collapsed areas. For instance, since the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> moved the avatar <b>503</b> from the first area <b>510</b> to the third area <b>514</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> transfers any session data for controlling the first avatar <b>503</b> from the first server <b>528</b> to the third server <b>530</b>. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could use a virtual data transfer application or function, like functions provided by VMware&#xae;'s VMotion&#x2122; software application or IBM&#xae;'s Application Mobility software application. Because the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> moved all objects of significance, and removed the display of other objects, from the first area <b>510</b> and the second area <b>512</b>, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> can cause the first server <b>528</b> and the second server <b>529</b> to reduce resource usage. Reducing resource usage could include shutting down the servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b>, causing the servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b> to sleep or hibernate, reducing processor cycles, reducing memory usage, reducing disk usage, etc. In addition, the servers <b>528</b>, <b>529</b> could continue operating on other existing tasks, be assigned different tasks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, specific regions in the virtual universe <b>501</b> can be designed as energy-efficient regions which use the techniques described herein. The designer of the region can entice energy-conscientious residents to visit the regions by promoting the area as energy-efficient. Avatars that enter energy-efficient regions can expect that areas will be collapsed when not in use, or expanded to accommodate additional avatars. Designers may design the regions to have modular areas, with repetitious topologies, so that areas can be collapsed easily without disorienting avatars.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the examples described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> have shown regions with areas that are contiguous on a horizontal plane. However, other examples could include areas that are non-contiguous, or contiguous on a vertical plane, such as rooms on different floors of a building. For instance, the virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> would move one or more avatars from one floor of the building to another floor of the building while coalescing and collapsing areas. The virtual resource conserver <b>502</b> could orient the one or more avatars by showing the avatars a map of the building and demonstrating a proposed path of movement on the map.</p>

In the discussion below, the flow diagrams may be described with reference to the block diagrams presented above.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In certain embodiments, the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on one or more machine-readable storage devices (e.g., software), while in other embodiments, the operations can be performed by hardware and/or other logic (e.g., firmware).

<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an example flow diagram illustrating using smart objects in a virtual universe to conserve computing resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the flow <b>700</b> begins at processing block <b>702</b>, where a virtual resource conserver reads data that indicates that a resource conservation setting is to be selected for a smart object in a virtual universe. In one example, the virtual resource conserver detects an indicator that a computing resource is being over used, or that requires a reduction in usage. One such indicator could be that a computing resource, such as a server, is experiencing busy times, poor performance, or usage maximization. The virtual resource conserver queries the virtual universe to determine one or more smart objects that have displayable characteristics, such as actions and properties that can be reduced in display quality. The displayable characteristics can be properties of the object, like texture, color, sparkle, etc. The displayable characteristics can also be actions like movement, communication, travel, etc. The displayable characteristics correspond to functions and operations provided by one or more computing resources, like servers or client machines. The computing resources control property refresh rates and action rates. The virtual resource conserver can reduce the display quality of the smart objects, which in turns reduces usage of the computing resources, or vice versa. The smart objects have resource conservation settings that mark the object as being smart objects. The resource conservation settings include metadata that identifies whether the smart objects can respond to virtual universe conservation indicators, what displayable characteristics can be reduced, and references to code (subroutines, statements, parameters, etc.) that the virtual resource conserver can use to reduce the display quality of the displayable characteristics. The metadata could also include levels that the virtual resource conserver can use, or follow, to reduce the display quality gradually.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The flow <b>700</b> continues at processing block <b>704</b>, where the virtual resource conserver selects the resource conservation setting for the smart object. For instance, the virtual resource conserver selects the metadata associated with the resource conservation setting. In one example, the virtual resource conserver selects the metadata by reading a database entry for the object that stores the metadata.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The flow <b>700</b> continues at processing block <b>706</b>, where the virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of the smart object in accordance with the selected resource conservation setting. For example, virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of the object's displayable characteristics using the metadata. In some examples, the metadata contains references to quality reduction instructions that the virtual resource conserver processes to reduce display quality, such as sparkle characteristics, texture, color, movement, etc. of the smart object. The virtual resource conserver processes the quality reduction instructions to reduce usage of one or more computing resources, such as usage of memory, processors, disk space, etc. Thus, the virtual resource conserver conserves energy and power from the computing resources. Further, the virtual resource conserver can reallocate conserved computing resource usage to solve performance issues in the virtual universe. If the virtual universe is experiencing performance problems in an area of the virtual universe, then the virtual resource conserver can utilize the conserved computing resource, such as processing cycles on a server, to address the performance problems.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The flow <b>700</b> continues at processing block <b>708</b>, where the virtual resource conserver compensates a virtual universe user for using the one or more smart objects. To incentivize users of the virtual universe to use smart objects, the virtual resource conserver rewards users of the virtual universe that use smart objects. For instance, the virtual resource conserver could provide rewards to an avatar or a user account belonging to a user of the virtual universe that uses the smart objects. Examples of rewards include special privileges, points, virtual currency, discounts, access to restricted functions, increased display quality to some objects, better performance, increased bandwidth for data transfer, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Some operations may be omitted, such as processing block <b>708</b> for compensating, or rewarding, virtual universe users.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an example flow diagram illustrating preparing a virtual object with resource conservation settings. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the flow <b>800</b> begins at processing block <b>802</b>, where a virtual resource conserver selects a displayable characteristic of a virtual object. The virtual object possesses displayable characteristics, or abilities and properties, which define how the object acts and appears in the virtual universe. The displayable characteristics were assigned to the object when it was created. The virtual resource conserver, in one example, selects a displayable characteristic of the object by referencing an entry in a database that stores information about the object's characteristics, or by referring to code that controls or defines the objects abilities and characteristics. In other examples, a displayable characteristic can be selected using a graphical user interface that refers to the database entries or to the object's code.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The flow <b>800</b> continues at processing block <b>804</b>, where the virtual resource conserver determines, or creates, a quality reduction instruction to associate with a conservation setting. The virtual resource conserver can subsequently utilize the quality reduction instruction to reduce the display quality of the selected displayable characteristic of the object. The quality reduction instruction can be created and stored in, or selected from, a code repository, such as file, a script, a data library, a database record, etc. The quality reduction instruction can include subroutines, statements, variables, expressions, operators, arguments, values, constants, arrays, scales, etc., that, when activated or applied, reduce a display quality of the selected displayable characteristic. For example, the quality reduction instruction could include state-based logic that recognizes and reacts to the state of a computing resource, such as in a proportional manner to a usage of the computing resource. For instance, as the usage for the computing resource rises above a pre-determined value, the quality reduction instruction proportionally reduces the display quality of the displayable characteristic. The virtual resource conserver could create quality reduction instructions using various programming languages, like C#, Java, etc. The virtual resource conserver could also select pre-written quality reduction instructions. Further, the virtual resource conserver can store and process the quality reduction instruction on a client, a server, or any other computing resource on a virtual universe network that can process computer instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The flow <b>800</b> continues at processing block <b>804</b>, where the virtual resource conserver creates a resource conservation setting for the object. In one example, the virtual resource conserver creates a location for storing the resource conservation setting by creating one or more columns in a database. For instance, the virtual universe includes databases containing one or more tables with one or more records that relate to the object. The one or more records already contain data that characterize the object, such as a UUID, manufacturer information, and data regarding the objects properties and options. Thus, the virtual resource conserver adds columns specifically for storing resource conservation data. The virtual resource conserver can subsequently add data to the one or more columns as setting values, which indicate when, how, and to what degree an object can be reduced in display quality to conserve computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The flow <b>800</b> continues at processing block <b>804</b>, where the virtual resource conserver associates the quality reduction instruction with the conservation setting for the object. For instance, the virtual resource conserver writes a reference to the quality reduction instruction in one or more columns of a database record related to the object. The columns could, for example, include a reference to a subroutine related to the selected displayable characteristic, as well as pre-determined arguments that the virtual resource conserver can pass into the subroutine which would modify the display quality of the displayable characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The flow <b>800</b> continues at processing block <b>804</b>, where the virtual resource conserver associates levels of quality reduction instructions with the conservation setting. For instance, a level can include an order of degree of quality reduction, which the virtual resource conserver can store in a database entry. The virtual resource conserver can associate the levels according to an agreed-upon standard. The levels represent a gradual reduction of display quality that the virtual resource conserver can apply to the object when the opportunity arises to conserve computing resources. The gradual reduction of display quality can correlate to a degree of usage of a computing resource. For example, the virtual resource conserver can subsequently activate the levels of reduction in the gradual order to maintain a computing resource below levels of usage that would cause performance degradation in the virtual universe. For instance, as a computing resource approaches a maximum usage level, the virtual resource conserver causes the object to activate a first level of display degradation, which could cause the computing resource usage to stabilize. However, as a busy period increases the usage of the computing resource, the virtual resource conserver could activate a second level, and so forth, to continue to stabilize the computing resource. The levels can also have setting values, which the virtual resource conserver selects, such as per request of a user of the virtual universe or an administrator, to authorize which levels the virtual resource conserver can apply.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. For example block <b>806</b>, creating a resource conservation setting, can be performed before processing block <b>802</b>, and processing block <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an example flow diagram illustrating modifying a display of an area in a virtual universe based on a significance of use of the area, to conserve computing resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the flow <b>900</b> begins at processing block <b>902</b>, where a virtual resource conserver selects an area of a virtual universe to potentially reduce in display quality. In one example, the virtual resource conserver determines boundary lines that demarcate the area. The virtual resource conserver may determine the area based on predetermined boundary line values, or by creating the boundary lines according to logical rules. For instance, the virtual resource conserver determines boundary lines by determining any objects that are within a specified distance of an avatar. In other instances, the virtual resource conserver determines boundary lines by determining the boundary of a computing resources control over the virtual universe. The area contains one or more objects. The one or more objects have displayable characteristics, such as textures, colors, actions, etc. The area can also have avatars occupying the area. The virtual resource conserver may analyze the state of the computing resources that are used to display the area in the virtual universe. If those computing resources are experiencing performance issues, inefficiency, or over usage, the virtual resource conserver may select all areas under the computing resources' control to determine whether, and to what degree, some displayable characteristics may be reduced in display quality to conserve some of the computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The flow <b>900</b> continues at processing block <b>904</b>, where the virtual resource conserver evaluates one or more significance factors related to a significance of use of the area. For brevity, the term &#x201c;significance factors&#x201d; will be used in this description to mean &#x201c;one or more significance factors&#x201d;. Significance factors are information, conditions, or characteristics relating to the nature of an activity in, or a purpose for, an area in the virtual universe, such as whether or not the activity in the area has been flagged as being important, if the activity is sponsored or scheduled, if the activity has a strong monetary importance, or the area has a significance that relates strongly to a goal or purpose of the virtual universe.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some examples, the significance factors can even be evaluated to determine what area the virtual resource conserver selects at processing block <b>902</b>. In other words, processing block <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> may be processed simultaneously, or in reverse order. For instance the virtual resource conserver may patrol computing resources on the virtual network, as part of a resource conservation plan, looking specifically for areas that can be reduced in display quality, even though the computing resources controlling those areas may not be experiencing performance issues. The virtual resource conserver could evaluate significance factors to select areas for its resource conservation plan. In one example, the virtual resource conserver analyzes avatars that occupy an area. For instance, the virtual resource conserver counts the number of avatars in the area (&#x201c;avatar population&#x201d;). Based on the avatar population, the virtual resource conserver can calculate a degree, or amount, of significance of use for the area so that the virtual resource conserver can reduce the display quality for the area.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The flow <b>900</b> continues at processing block <b>906</b>, where the virtual resource conserver determines a significance of use value based on the evaluated significance factors. When the virtual resource conserver has evaluated the significance factors, the virtual resource conserver generates from the evaluation a quantifiable value indicating a significance (e.g. importance, degree, etc.) of use. In one example, the virtual resource conserver determines that an area has a certain number of avatars occupying the area. Thus, the virtual resource conserver converts the number of avatars directly into the quantifiable value, or weight, representing the significance of use, such as by using a predetermined conversion scale or chart. The conversion scale can be based on any kind of algorithm or formula (e.g. linear, exponential, etc.) with many factors or variables related to different significance factors. For instance, the virtual resource conserver determines, as described at processing block <b>904</b>, that zero avatars occupy an area, and thus, at processing block <b>906</b>, converts the &#x201c;zero&#x201d; number directly to a &#x201c;low&#x201d; significance of use value. Similarly, the virtual resource conserver determines that one to two avatars occupy an area, and thus convert the &#x201c;1-2&#x201d; number range directly to a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; significance of use value. Further, the virtual resource conserver may determine that more than two avatars occupy an area, and thus convert the &#x201c;&#x3e;2&#x201d; number range directly to a &#x201c;high&#x201d; significance of use value. In other examples, however, the virtual resource conserver evaluates significance factors other than, or in addition to, avatar population, and computes a significance of use value by using a combination of evaluated significance factors. For example, the conversion formula for determining a significance of use may compute a first significance factor, avatar population, and a second significance factor, &#x201c;event importance&#x201d;, which relates to an importance of a scheduled event in the area at a given date and time. The virtual resource conserver computes the evaluation of the event importance and the avatar population, to generate a significance of use value. For example, the area may be holding a sponsored event that, during the first two hours of the event, the significance of the event importance has a weighted value, which outweighs the significance of the avatar population, resulting in a &#x201c;high&#x201d; significance of use value. However, after a certain time period, such as after the first two hours of the event, the importance of the sponsored event diminishes linearly, so that the significance of the avatar population has a greater influence on the conversion scale formula. Further, the virtual resource conserver could determine significance of use values according to many different levels or scales of significance other than &#x201c;high&#x201d;, &#x201c;medium&#x201d; and &#x201c;low&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The flow <b>900</b> continues at processing block <b>908</b>, where the virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of the area based on the significance of use of the area. For instance, the virtual resource conserver determines a &#x201c;low&#x201d; significance of use value, and consequently reduces the display quality of the area to a &#x201c;high&#x201d; degree, or completely removes the display of the area. If, however, the virtual resource conserver determines a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; significance of use value, the virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of the area to a &#x201c;moderate&#x201d; degree. Alternatively, if the virtual resource conserver determines a &#x201c;high&#x201d; significance of use value, the virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality to a &#x201c;low&#x201d; degree, or not at all. Further, the virtual resource conserver could reduce display quality according to many different levels or scales of significance other than just &#x201c;high&#x201d;, &#x201c;moderate&#x201d; or &#x201c;low&#x201d;. The different levels could relate to many different display characteristics based on the significance factors. For instance, the virtual resource conserver analyzes the area characteristics and the area actions to assess an area situation or condition. In some situations or conditions for the area, for example, the virtual resource conserver determines that it would be logical or more efficient to reduce display quality in one way more than another way, such as removing texture of an object in a dark environment instead of removing luminosity, or vice versa for a light environment.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As the virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of areas, the virtual resource conserver can reduce usage of computing resources used to display the areas. For instance, as described in further detail herein, the virtual resource conserver can reduce processor usage, memory usage, disk space usage, data transfer, etc. by the computing resources. In some examples, the virtual resource conserver can gradually reduce the display quality of the area, such as by utilizing a set of levels for reducing display quality and by using smart objects with conservation settings that comprise levels of reducing display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, in some examples, the virtual resource conserver could perform a reverse procedure to increase display quality of areas that have already been reduced. For instance, areas of the virtual universe could be reduced, either as a result of the flow <b>900</b>, or because the default condition of the area could be reduced in quality. The virtual resource conserver, therefore, could evaluate significance factors for increasing display quality of areas based on a significance of use. For example, the virtual resource conserver could initially present an area with a reduced display quality, but then increase the display quality area based on the number of avatars occupying the area. For example, the virtual resource conserver may reduce the display quality of all areas that do not have avatars. However, as an avatar approaches, and occupies the area, the virtual resource conserver increases the display quality of the area. If more avatars occupy the area, then the virtual resource conserver could increase the display quality even more.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. For example, as described above, block <b>902</b> and <b>904</b> could be performed in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an example flow diagram illustrating modifying a view of an area based on an avatar's perspective to conserve computing resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the flow <b>1000</b> begins at processing block <b>1002</b>, where a virtual resource conserver determines a first area that is being viewed by an avatar in a virtual universe. For instance, the virtual resource conserver could calculate a directly facing field of vision for the avatar. Anything within the direct field of vision would represent the area that the avatar is viewing directly in front of the avatar. The virtual resource conserver could calculate the direct field of vision, for example, by calculating a direct angle of view. The direct angle of view represents the breadth, or width, of the area directly in front of the avatar. For instance, the virtual resource conserver could calculate the direct angle of view by considering a width of an area of interest, such as the width of coordinates that encompass an object that the avatar is using, or other objects connected to that object. The virtual resource conserver could further calculate the direct angle of view based on a pre-determined angle for all avatars in the virtual universe. The virtual resource conserver could also calculate the direct angle of view based on boundaries of an area that a computing resource controls. The virtual resource conserver could also determine the direct angle of view based on an activity that the avatar is engaged in. For instance, a significant activity may demand a wide direct angle of view, such as fighting a battle, seeking an avatar or hunting a creature, etc. Other activities, however, may be less significant and the virtual resource conserver could determine a narrower direct angle of view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> above illustrates this concept.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The flow <b>1000</b> continues at processing block <b>1004</b>, where the virtual resource conserver determines a second area adjacent to the first area, the adjacent area being in a peripheral view of the avatar. For instance, the virtual resource conserver could determine that any viewable area, or areas, adjacent to, or beyond, the avatar's direct field of vision are the avatar's &#x201c;peripheral view areas&#x201d;. In other words, peripheral view areas are viewable areas to the right and left of the area encompassed by the direct angle of view. Hence, the virtual resource conserver could determine more than one second area since there are peripheral views to the right and left of the direct angle of view. The peripheral view areas can be controlled by one or more computing resources. In one example, the one or more computing resources could be the same computing resource that control objects and activities in the first area. In another example, the one or more computing resources could be different computing resources than those that control the first area. In yet other examples, there could be a combination of computing resources that control the second and the first area simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The flow <b>1000</b> continues at processing block <b>1006</b>, where the virtual resource conserver reduces a display quality of the second, adjacent area to conserve computing resources in the virtual universe. The second area, for example, could be the areas in the avatar's peripheral view. The virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of objects within the second area. For instance, the virtual resource conserver reduces or removes textures, colors, actions, movements, etc. of the objects. The virtual resource conserver reduces usage of the one or more computing resources that process data for presenting the objects in the second area. For instance, as described in further detail herein, the virtual resource conserver can reduce processor usage, memory usage, disk space usage, data transfer, etc. by the computing resources that control the second area. By reducing usage of the computing resources, the second, peripheral view area, reduces in display quality. Alternatively, the virtual resource conserver reduces the display quality of the one or more second, peripheral view areas, by processing quality reduction instructions that reduce the display quality of objects in the peripheral view areas, which indirectly reduces usage of the computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some examples, users can volunteer to experience limited views. The virtual resource conserver, for example, rewards users for volunteering to experience limited views. In other examples, the virtual resource conserver imposes limited views upon users. In some examples, the virtual resource conserver reduces the display of areas as a result of the flow <b>900</b>, or as a default state, and then determines when areas enter an avatar's direct field of vision. The virtual resource conserver then increases the display quality of those areas that entered the avatar's direct field of vision. Also, in some examples, the virtual resource conserver can gradually reduce the display quality of the area, such as by utilizing a set of levels for reducing display quality and/or by using smart objects with conservation settings that comprise levels of reducing display quality.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. For example, processing block <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b> could be processed simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an example flow diagram illustrating collapsing areas and computing resources in a virtual universe to conserve computing resources. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the flow <b>1100</b> begins at processing block <b>1102</b>, where a virtual resource conserver determines a first area of a region in a virtual universe, the first area having one or more objects or avatars controlled by a first computing resource. In one example, the first computing resource processes data for presenting the first area and also processes session data for controlling the one or more avatars in the first area. In other examples, however, a combination of resources could process data for presenting the area and data for processing session data. In yet other examples, portions, or sections, of a single computing resource, (e.g., partitions of a single database, processors of a single server, etc.) could control the first area of the region, whereas other portions, or sections, of the same computing resource could control other areas of the region. The portions, or sections, can be considered as separate computing resources for purposes of this description. The region includes one or more avatars, one or more topology objects, and one or more interactive objects. Topology objects and interactive objects are described detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> above. The virtual resource conserver can evaluate characteristics of the objects in the area to determine if the objects are topology objects, interactive objects or avatars. For instance, the virtual resource conserver can look at the objects abilities. If the virtual resource conserver recognizes that the object can move or react, it may determine that the object is an interactive object. The virtual resource conserver can also determine a significance of an object, or rather, the significance of the object's use or purpose in the area. A significant object is an object that the virtual resource conserver does not remove from display, other than to move the object from one area to another area. For instance, a significant object can be an object with which an avatar may interact, or possibly interact, an object that plays a significant purpose of the area, an object that possesses a valuable or important characteristic, etc. The virtual resource conserver moves significant objects from area to area when coalescing and collapsing areas. Coalescing, or combining, an area means to move objects of significance, such as avatars and/or interactive objects, out of one area into another area in a region of the virtual universe. To collapse an area means to remove, or significantly reduce a display quality of, objects in the area. In some examples, collapsing an area means to temporarily crop the entire area from the virtual universe. Collapsing an area is also described in further detail above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>,</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The flow <b>1100</b> continues at processing block <b>1104</b>, where the virtual resource conserver determines a second area, within the region, that is similar in topology to the first area and is controlled by a second computing resource. The second computing resource processes data for presenting the second area. The second area is a part of the region and may be adjacent to, or near, the first area. The topology of the second area is consistent with the topology of the first area because they are both within a region that has common properties or functions, such as common landscaping or common activities that an avatar could perform.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The flow <b>1100</b> continues at processing block <b>1106</b>, where the virtual resource conserver analyzes factors about the first and second areas to be used to for deciding whether to coalesce the areas. For example, the virtual resource conserver analyzes factors about the first area and second area to determine which one of the two areas should be combined into, or coalesced with, the other area. For instance, the virtual resource conserver analyzes the first area and determines that the first area has one avatar engaged in an activity using an interactive object in the first area. The virtual resource conserver analyzes the second area and determines that two avatars are engaged in a similar activity using similar interactive objects in the second area. Consequently, the virtual resource conserver determines that it would be more efficient to combine the first area into the second area because moving one avatar would be more efficient than moving two. In addition, the virtual resource conserver could determine other factors, such as whether the computing resource that controls the second area can more efficiently process three avatars than the first area, or if one of the computing resources is experiencing performance problems. Thus, the virtual resource conserver can analyze multiple factors and combinations of factors to determine which area should be coalesced and which area should be collapsed. The virtual resource conserver can also analyze the computing resources controlling the first area and the second area to determine if there would be a savings to computing resources to coalesce and collapse areas.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The flow <b>1100</b> continues at decisional block <b>1108</b>, where the virtual resource conserver determines, based on the analysis of the first and second area, whether the first area should be coalesced with the second area. If the virtual resource conserver determines that the first area should be coalesced with the second area, the flow <b>1100</b> continues at processing block <b>1108</b>. If, however, the virtual resource conserver determines that the first area should not be coalesced with the second area, then the process ends.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The flow <b>1100</b> continues at processing block <b>1108</b>, where the virtual resource conserver coalesces the first area with the second area. The virtual resource conserver coalesces the first area with the second area by moving objects of significance from the first area to the second area, including any avatars in the area along with any interactive objects that the avatars are using. If there are no avatars, the virtual resource conserver may decide not to move any objects, or may move only a few interactive object to the second area. When moving an avatar from the first area to the second area, the virtual resource conserver can orient the avatar, such as by demonstrating to the avatar where it will be moved. The virtual resource conserver may demonstrate to the avatar the location on a map, or with visual indicators, like arrows or lines that show that movement will occur from a point in, or section of, the first area to a point in, or section of, the second area. The virtual resource conserver transfers data, for presenting the avatars and objects, from the first computing resource to the second computing resource. The virtual resource conserver also moves any session data from the first computing resource to the second computing resource. Session data includes data used to maintain a connection between a client and a virtual universe server so that the client can control the avatar's movements. Methods are known for transferring session data between servers and other computing resources, such as via a teleportation procedure within the virtual universe or by using a virtual data transfer application or function.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The flow <b>1100</b> continues at processing block <b>1110</b>, where the virtual resource conserver collapses the first area by reducing usage of the first computing resource. For instance, the virtual resource conserver removes all topology objects from the first area as well as any interactive objects that remained in the first area after coalescing the first and second areas. In some examples, the virtual resource conserver crops the area from the virtual universe view and connects the boundaries of adjacent areas. The virtual resource conserver reduces resource usage from the first computing resource in one of many ways. For example, the virtual resource conserver could shut off or reduce power, activate a sleep or hibernation mode, reduce processor cycles, reduce memory usage, reduce disk usage, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in series, while in other embodiments, one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel.
