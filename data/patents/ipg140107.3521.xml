<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a Hall effect measuring device.</p>

The chip is securely attached to the magnet, and positioned at the Gaussian zero point of said magnet. The magnet&#x2014;generally of roughly cylindrical shape&#x2014;is holed with a cylindrical and concentric hole,</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0008">the ferromagnetic target includes a measurement surface,</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0009">the chip is securely attached to the magnet, that is to say that any motions of the chip are integral with those of the magnet, and defines a measurement plane,</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0012">Such a device is known to those skilled in the art. However, according to the prior art, such a device is limited in its application to rotational frequency or speed measurements, in particular by switching Hall effect sensors, called &#x201c;switches&#x201d;, in which the target is circular and comprises a plurality of teeth; this makes it possible essentially to obtain an incremental sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0013">The aim of the present invention is to propose an alternative to such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0014">With this objective in view, the device according to the invention, also conforming to the preamble given above, is noteworthy in that:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0015">the Hall effect sensor (<b>1</b>) is linear,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0016">the device comprises a reference position corresponding to a given relative position of the chip (<b>20</b>) and of the target (<b>50</b>),</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0017">the relative motion is with two degrees of freedom, each of which respectively corresponds to a translational motion or to a rotational motion,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0018">the device is configured to detect a deviation from the reference position,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0019">the shape and/or the dimension of the target (<b>50</b>) according to a relative motion is different respectively from the shape and/or the dimension of the target (<b>50</b>) according to the other relative motion.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0020">In one embodiment, the device according to the invention also comprises means for measuring the deviation from the reference position, according to said relative motion, by measuring the measurement distance (d).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0021">By virtue of this configuration, the device according to the invention can be applied for a position measurement, complementing the detection of the deviation from the reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0022">To this end, the device is configured to measure the relative position of the ferromagnetic target and of the sensor. In the case in point, the device according to the invention includes means for deducing, from the measurement distance, the relative position of the ferromagnetic target and of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0023">Preferably, at least the shape and the orientation of the measurement surface of the ferromagnetic target are dependent on the type of relative motion, for the measurement distance (d) to vary during said relative motion under the action of displacement means acting for this purpose on the relative positions of the chip and of the measurement surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0024">In one embodiment, the relative deviation between the sensor and the target along the measurement axis is constant. This means that the deviation between the measurement plane and the rotation axis or the translation plane is constant when the relative motion is a rotational or translational motion respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0025">Preferably, the relative translational motion is performed in a plane parallel to the measurement plane.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0026">In one embodiment, the measurement surface of the ferromagnetic target is planar and not parallel to the measurement plane.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0027">Preferably, the relative rotational motion is performed about a rotation axis parallel to the measurement plane, and running vertical to the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0028">Preferably, the output signal of the sensor is proportional to the trend of the magnetic field of the magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0029">According to another of its subjects, the invention relates to a gearbox including the device according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0030">By virtue of the invention, it is possible, for example, to determine the position of a fixed target on the gear selection axis and determine whether the gearbox control is at the &#x201c;neutral point&#x201d;, the neutral point, in the case in point, constituting said reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0031">The sensor according to the invention gives position information concerning the gear lever and/or the gear selector depending on whether it is placed on the lever or on the gearbox.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0032">The advantage of the device according to the invention is that it can be adapted very easily to different gearboxes: it is sufficient to adapt the target to the motion and to the desired information; the sensor remains the same.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0033">Thus, by virtue of the invention, the measurement surface of the ferromagnetic target can be configured for the measurement distance to be variable according to the relative motion, in particular when the relative deviation between the sensor and the target on the measurement axis is constant.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0044">A conventional Hall effect sensor <b>1</b> applied in the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It comprises, positioned in a housing <b>30</b> (not represented), a magnet <b>10</b> and a chip <b>20</b> securely attached to the magnet and configured to measure the magnetic field of the magnet <b>10</b>, in the case in point its vertical component Bz, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> in which the magnet <b>20</b> is configured by way of example with the south face S on top and the north face N on the bottom.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0045">The magnet <b>10</b> is holed. Preferably, the hole <b>11</b> of the magnet is circular and the magnet has a disk-shaped cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0046">In the embodiment illustrated, the magnet has symmetry of revolution about an axis Z (vertical for example), so that the hole and the magnet are circular and concentric.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0047">The chip is preferably positioned on the side of the hole <b>11</b>, the hole <b>11</b> representing the sensitive area of the sensor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0048">For the devices according to the invention, there is a point called Gaussian zero point of the magnet, at which all the components (Bx, By, Bz) of the magnetic field of the magnet are zero.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0049">The advantage of the Gaussian zero point is that it is relatively stable over time and relatively independent of temperature, whereas the use of a full magnet leads to an offset in the measured magnetic field that then has to be compensated for. Furthermore, this offset is greatly affected by temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0050">According to the invention, the chip <b>20</b> is advantageously positioned at the Gaussian zero point of the magnet <b>10</b>. The stability of the Gaussian zero point is essential to the position measurement by a linear Hall effect sensor, which characteristic is much more negligible in the &#x201c;switch&#x201d; type Hall effect sensors for which the accurate measurement of the distance is not necessary (usually, such types of sensors are used in binary mode and make it possible to state whether a target is facing or not facing the sensor).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0051">For the deviation detection or the position measurement, there is usually a ferromagnetic piece <b>50</b>, called target, facing the housing <b>30</b>. In operation, the target <b>50</b> and the housing <b>30</b> are moved by a relative motion, and the sensor <b>1</b> is configured to measure the amplitude of this motion, that is to say, the relative position of the surface of the target and of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the operating principle of a Hall effect measurement device before (or after) the passage of a ferromagnetic target in front of the sensor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates the operating principle of a Hall effect measuring device during the passage of a ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> in front of the sensor <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0054">Comparing these two figures, the field lines <b>14</b> of the magnet are clearly deflected by the presence of the target <b>50</b>. The component Bz of the magnetic field of the magnet <b>10</b> is modified thereby, measured by the chip <b>20</b>, and an output signal representative of this measurement is emitted by the sensor (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0055">According to the invention, such a measuring device makes it possible to determine a position, and is advantageously implemented in motor vehicle gearboxes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0056">For example, the sensor <b>1</b> can be positioned either at the level of the gear lever, or directly at the level of the gearbox, for example in order to determine the position of the gear selector. The placement of the target <b>50</b> depends on that of the sensor and the placement of the target and of the corresponding sensor in a gearbox depends on the type of gearbox.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0057">In the case in point, according to the invention, the gearbox and the gear selector may be means for varying the measurement distance d during a relative motion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0058">Now, depending on the type of gearbox, in particular whether it is a manual or automatic gearbox, the mechanical link between the gear lever and the gear selector may be complex.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0059">Typically, the gear lever is linked to the gearbox by a system of linkages such that the motions of the latter lead to a translational and/or rotational motion of a gear ratio selection axis.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0060">For certain manual gearboxes, the clearances and tolerances of the linkage system may lead to the sensor preferably being positioned on the gear selection axis or on the gear lever depending on the desired accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0061">For an automatic gearbox, typically, the gear lever is displaced linearly. The invention makes it possible to know the position of the gear lever, so that this position information can, for example, be given to the gearbox control system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0062">However, regardless of the type of gearbox, a noteworthy position is the one called &#x201c;neutral point&#x201d; corresponding to a position that is usually substantially central. The invention is advantageously implemented for the detection of this neutral point position or for the measurement of the position relative to the neutral point, in particular for the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0063">The invention is advantageously implemented for motor vehicles equipped with a so-called &#x201c;stop &#x26; start&#x201d; system by virtue of which the engine is stopped automatically during a temporary stoppage of the vehicle and restarts automatically when the driver presses on the accelerator pedal (torque demand).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0064">To this end, it is necessary to determine the position of the gear selector. In practice, since the engine restarts automatically, it is necessary for the clutch pedal to be depressed and/or for the gear lever to be at the neutral point, otherwise the vehicle risks &#x201c;jumping&#x201d; forward or backward. The computer of the vehicle must therefore be informed of the position of the gear selector, which is possible by virtue of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0065">According to the invention, the shape of the measurement surface <b>51</b> of the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> is adapted to the type of relative motion.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the field variation B of the magnet according to a rotation angle R(&#xb0;) and a longitudinal displacement X (mm).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0067">The intensity of the field B depends on the value of the measurement distance d, which is the distance between the chip <b>20</b> and the measurement surface <b>51</b> of the target, along the measurement axis Z vertically in line with the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0068">This <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> corresponds to an embodiment in which the reference position corresponds to the neutral point of a gearbox, for which the field B is maximum (chip <b>20</b> and target <b>50</b> aligned on the measurement axis Z).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0069">In this embodiment, the Hall effect sensor <b>1</b> and the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> are able to be imparted with a relative motion with two degrees of freedom, one relative to the other, in which one corresponds to a translational motion and the other corresponds to a rotational motion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0070">In this embodiment, the target <b>50</b> has an asymmetrical shape, in the case in point a rectangular shape of dimensions 5&#xd7;3 mm. It is thus possible to obtain a different response according to one degree of freedom or the other, in the case in point a relative translational or rotational motion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0071">When the value of the field B is no longer maximum, it can be concluded therefrom that the gearbox is no longer at the neutral point and, for example, a signal to this effect can be emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0072">It is thus possible to detect a deviation from the &#x201c;neutral point&#x201d; reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0073">Furthermore, in another embodiment, the device according to the invention may include means for not only detecting but measuring the deviation from the reference position.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0074">To this end, the values of the magnetic field B of the magnet according to the relative motion can be recorded in a memory. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may illustrate a map. The instantaneous value of the magnetic field B depending for a given relative motion on the measurement distance d, it is possible to deduce therefrom the relative deviation between the chip <b>20</b> and the target <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0075">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C each illustrate an embodiment of the device according to the invention in which the relative motion between the Hall effect sensor <b>1</b> and the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> is a translational motion illustrated by a double arrow, on a translation plane <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0076">In one embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the translational motion is offset by an angle &#x3b1; relative to the axis X, or relative to the measurement plane <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0077">In another embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, the translational motion is parallel to the axis X, that is to say to the measurement plane <b>21</b>, so the relative deviation between the sensor <b>1</b> and the target <b>50</b> on the measurement axis Z is constant.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0078">The expression &#x201c;constant relative deviation between the sensor <b>1</b> and the target <b>50</b>&#x201d; should be understood, for example, to mean that the relative deviation between the respective centers of gravity on the measurement axis Z is constant.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0079">Thus, for a relative rotational motion, the deviation on the axis Z between the sensor (the measurement plane <b>21</b>) and the rotation axis R is constant.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0080">For a relative translational motion, this translation is performed preferably in a translation plane <b>22</b> parallel to the measurement plane <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, <b>3</b>C). The deviation on the axis Z between the sensor (the measurement plane <b>21</b>) and the translation plane <b>22</b> is therefore constant. When the translation is performed in a translation plane <b>22</b> secant to the measurement plane <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), the shift due to the angle &#x3b1; must be compensated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0081">The measurement surface <b>51</b> of the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> may have a planar surface (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A) or not (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C</figref>, <b>4</b>B), in the case in point, a graduated surface.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0082">According to the invention, during a continuous displacement of the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> in front of the sensor <b>1</b>, the trend of the measurement distance d is an exclusively increasing or zero function (respectively decreasing or zero depending on the direction of displacement).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0083">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the ferro-magnetic target <b>50</b> may be of substantially triangular shape in cross section. It may also be of parallelepipedal shape and inclined relative to the sensor, or of any other shape, as long as the measurement surface <b>51</b> is not continually parallel to the measurement plane <b>21</b> during the relative motion.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> each illustrate one embodiment of the device according to the invention in which the type of relative motion between the Hall effect sensor and the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> is a rotational motion, in the case in point, about the rotation axis R, perpendicular to the plane XOZ.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0085">In a manner similar to the embodiment relating to a relative translational motion, for a relative rotational motion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>), the measurement surface <b>51</b> may be progressive, that is to say, snail-shaped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), or stepped (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0086">In the case in point, the invention cannot implement ferromagnetic targets <b>50</b> that have a measurement surface <b>51</b> with cyclical shape, typically toothed wheels. On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> or <b>4</b>B, the measurement surface <b>51</b> of the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> is stepped, with each step in the case in point being parallel to the measurement plane <b>21</b> during the measurement and at a respective measurement distance d that is different from one step to another.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0087">For the stepped shapes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C</figref>, <b>4</b>B), the device according to the invention is advantageously configured for each step or level to correspond to a respective specific position of the gear selector or lever.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0088">To determine the relative position of the ferromagnetic target <b>50</b> and of the sensor <b>1</b>, the device according to the invention advantageously includes means for deducing said relative position, in the case in point in the form of a mapping table between the value of the magnetic field B measured by the sensor and a respective specific position of the gear selector or lever.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0089">The position information is then sent by communication means, for example, to the vehicle computer.</p>
