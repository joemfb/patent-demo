<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the housing <b>5</b> is divided into the first chamber <b>61</b> and the second chamber <b>62</b>. A structure (third wall portion <b>73</b>) that cuts off the flow of the air is provided between the first chamber <b>61</b> and the second chamber <b>62</b>. The first suction port <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the second suction port <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> are exposed to the first chamber <b>61</b>. The ejection port <b>24</b><i>c </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> is exposed to the second chamber <b>62</b>. That is, a partial sealing region in which the suction ports <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> are blocked is provided in the corner of the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the cooling fan <b>24</b>, air is sucked from the outside of the housing <b>5</b> through the first chamber <b>61</b>, and the air is ejected from the first chamber <b>61</b> to the second chamber <b>62</b>. The suction port of the cooling fan <b>24</b> is not exposed to the second chamber <b>62</b> and the third chamber <b>63</b>. Therefore, the cooling fan <b>24</b> sucks very little or almost no air in the second chamber <b>62</b> and the third chamber <b>63</b>, which are warmed by the heat generating elements such as the CPU <b>41</b>, the PCH <b>42</b>, and the power-circuit component <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The cooling fan <b>24</b> sucks low-temperature air from the outside of the housing <b>5</b> through the first chamber <b>61</b>, and ejects the low-temperature air toward the CPU <b>41</b> in the second chamber <b>62</b>. While, in the first embodiment, the air inlet ports are provided in the lower wall <b>7</b> and the peripheral wall <b>8</b> of the housing <b>5</b>, it will suffice if an air inlet port is provided in at least one of the upper wall <b>6</b>, the lower wall <b>7</b>, and the peripheral wall <b>8</b> of the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the ventilation path <b>91</b> (the first ventilation path <b>91</b><i>a </i>and the second ventilation path <b>91</b><i>b</i>) that guides cooling wind from the cooling fan <b>24</b> toward the heat sink <b>28</b> is formed by board components mounted on the circuit board <b>31</b> in the housing <b>5</b>. More specifically, the wall surfaces on both sides of the ventilation path <b>91</b> are formed by the first wall portion <b>71</b>. That is, the space surrounded by the first wall portion <b>71</b>, the circuit board device <b>38</b>, and the lower wall <b>7</b> and the upper wall <b>6</b> of the housing <b>5</b> (or the keyboard <b>9</b>) constitutes the ventilation path <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Therefore, the cooling wind ejected from the cooling fan <b>24</b> moves from the cooling fan <b>24</b> toward the heat sink <b>28</b> through the circuit board device <b>38</b> along an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. That is, the cooling wind ejected from the cooling fan <b>24</b> flows reliably through the CPU <b>41</b> and the heat sink <b>28</b> in a concentrated manner without spreading widely in the housing <b>5</b>, thereby efficiently cooling the CPU <b>41</b> and the heat sink <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">This structure can improve the cooling efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, a structure in which the suction port in the upper surface of the cooling fan has an opening in the housing while the suction port in the lower surface of the cooling fan faces the air inlet port in the lower wall of the housing is taken as an example of the air inlet structure. In this case, the suction port in the upper surface of the cooling fan sucks warmed air in the housing <b>5</b> while the suction port in the lower surface can take in low-temperature external air. Therefore, air ejected from the cooling fan <b>24</b> has a certain temperature and cannot efficiently cool the heat sink <b>28</b> exposed to the air.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">On the other hand, in the structure of the first embodiment, the wind shield portion <b>64</b> is provided between the suction ports <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the ejection port <b>24</b><i>c </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> to at least partially partition the space inside the housing <b>5</b>. Therefore, the air that is ejected from the ejection port <b>24</b><i>c </i>and warmed by the CPU <b>41</b> and the heat sink <b>28</b> is hardly sucked again from the suction ports <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the relatively-low-temperature air can be sent to the CPU <b>41</b> and the heat sink <b>28</b> to achieve the improvement of the radiation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the first embodiment, the wind shield portion <b>64</b> is provided in the housing <b>5</b> to at least partially partition the first chamber <b>61</b> to which the air inlet ports <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b> of the housing <b>5</b> and the suction ports <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> are exposed and the second chamber <b>62</b> to which the exhaust ports <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> of the housing <b>5</b>, the CPU <b>41</b>, the heat sink <b>28</b>, the heat pipe <b>34</b>, and the ejection port <b>24</b><i>c </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> are exposed.

On the other hand, heat generating elements such as the CPU <b>41</b> are housed in the second chamber <b>62</b> that is partitioned from the first chamber <b>61</b>. With this structure, in addition to the first suction port <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the lower surface <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b>, the second suction port <b>24</b><i>b </i>in the upper surface <b>53</b><i>b </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> can also suck not warmed air in the housing <b>5</b> but low-temperature external air.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, the lower-temperature air can be sent to the CPU <b>41</b> and the heat sink <b>28</b> to achieve the further improvement of the radiation efficiency. In other words, a structure in which the cooling fan <b>24</b> incorporated in the housing <b>5</b> sucks air 100% from the outside as much as possible to exhaust (send) the air 100% to the inside of the housing <b>5</b> is provided irrespective of the type of the cooling fan.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The cooling fan <b>24</b> is a relatively tall (thick) component in the components housed in the housing <b>5</b>. If the cooling fan <b>24</b> is located below the palm rest <b>18</b>, the cooling fan <b>24</b> can be housed by utilizing the space below the palm rest <b>18</b>, where there is a margin with respect to the thickness of the housing <b>5</b> compared to the space below the keyboard placing portion <b>17</b>. Thus, the housing <b>5</b> can be thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At this point, for example, the structure in which the suction port in the upper surface of the cooling fan has an opening in the housing while the suction port in the lower surface faces the air inlet port in the lower wall of the housing is taken again as an example of the air inlet structure. In this case, when the air inlet port in the lower wall of the housing is closed from any cause, the suction port in the lower surface of the cooling fan sucks warmed air in the housing. This possibly degrades the cooling efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">On the other hand, in the first embodiment, the first chamber <b>61</b> for the air inlet is provided in the housing <b>5</b> and comprises the second air inlet port <b>22</b> in addition to the first air inlet port <b>21</b>. In this structure, even if the first air inlet port <b>21</b> is closed, the first chamber <b>61</b> is communicated with the outside through the second air inlet port <b>22</b>. The suction ports <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the cooling fan <b>24</b> are opened to the first chamber <b>61</b>, and thereby low-temperature external air can be sucked from the first chamber <b>61</b>. Thus, the cooling efficiency is hardly degraded even if the air inlet port of the housing <b>5</b> is partially closed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">More specifically, if the first air inlet port <b>21</b> is provided in the lower wall <b>7</b> of the housing <b>5</b> while the second air inlet port <b>22</b> is provided in the peripheral wall <b>8</b> of the housing <b>5</b>, it is unlikely that the two air inlet ports <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are closed at the same time, and the first chamber <b>61</b> is easily communicated with the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The second heat generating elements, such as the PCH <b>42</b>, which can be cooled by natural heat release is further provided, and the wind shield portion <b>64</b> at least partially partitions the third chamber <b>63</b> including the second heat generating elements from the first chamber <b>61</b> and the second chamber <b>62</b> in the housing <b>5</b>. With this, the cooling wind of the cooling fan <b>24</b> can be concentrated in the second chamber <b>62</b> while air warmed in the third chamber <b>63</b> is hardly sucked by the cooling fan <b>24</b>. Thus, the cooling efficiency can be improved for the entire device.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In the first embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the CPU <b>41</b> is located at the outer peripheral portion of the L-shaped first ventilation path <b>91</b><i>a </i>in the second chamber <b>62</b>. When viewed from the side of the ejection port <b>24</b><i>c</i>, the impeller <b>54</b> of the cooling fan <b>24</b> is rotated in the direction (indicated by arrow X of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) from the outer peripheral portion of the first ventilation path <b>91</b><i>a </i>to the inner peripheral portion such that high-speed cooling wind reaches the CPU <b>41</b>. Thus, the cooling effect on the CPU <b>41</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In the first embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the heat pipe <b>34</b> is curved into a shape such that it is brought close to the cooling fan <b>24</b> on the way from the CPU <b>41</b> to the heat sink <b>28</b>, and is connected to the end of the heat sink <b>28</b> on the side of the cooling fan <b>24</b>. With this, the heat pipe <b>34</b> can efficiently be exposed to cooling wind. Alternatively, the heat pipe <b>34</b> may be formed into a shape such that it is separated from the cooling fan <b>24</b> from the CPU <b>41</b> toward the heat sink <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also illustrates an example of such a shape. In this case, a large amount of cooling wind can be sent to the heat sink <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the first embodiment, the first wall portion <b>71</b> and the second wall portion <b>72</b> are located in the housing <b>5</b> with the circuit board device <b>38</b> therebetween.

Accordingly, action of a shear force on the circuit board device <b>38</b> is suppressed between the first wall portion <b>71</b> and the second wall portion <b>72</b>. Thus, according to the first embodiment, it is possible to suppress an increase in load on the circuit board <b>31</b> as well as to improve the cooling efficiency by the cooling fan <b>24</b>.

In the first modification, the first width W<b>1</b> of the first abutment surface <b>71</b><i>g </i>is larger than the second width W<b>2</b> of the second abutment surface <b>72</b><i>c</i>. With this, even if there is a difference in shape between the second wall portion <b>72</b> and the first wall portion <b>71</b>, the difference is absorbed, and the second wall portion <b>72</b> and the first wall portion <b>71</b> can be arranged overlapping each other.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the second portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b> constitutes a support wall of the storage device <b>33</b> to support the storage device <b>33</b>.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">A first insulator <b>86</b> as a plate-like member and a second insulator <b>87</b> as a plate-like member are provided in the first modification. The first insulator <b>86</b> and the second insulator <b>87</b> are plate-like members having an insulation property. The first insulator <b>86</b> and the second insulator <b>87</b> also have a heat shield property and a sound insulating property. The first insulator <b>86</b> adheres to the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b> between the first portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the second portion <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b> by a double-sided adhesive tape.

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the first modification, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b> is fixed to the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b> by screws <b>93</b>.

That is, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>is screwed to the lower wall <b>7</b>. In this manner, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>can strongly be fixed to the lower wall <b>7</b> by fixing the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>to the lower wall <b>7</b> with the screws <b>93</b>.

The second insulator <b>87</b> is located between the second wall portion <b>72</b> and the inner surface <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the upper wall <b>6</b>. That is, the second wall portion <b>72</b> is attached to the housing <b>5</b> with the second insulator <b>87</b> interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A third modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>. In the third modification, the first insulator <b>86</b> is previously attached to the first wall portion <b>71</b> to constitute a wall unit <b>88</b>. The first insulator <b>86</b> is attached to the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>by, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape. The first insulator <b>86</b> is attached to the housing <b>5</b> by, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape. Accordingly, in the third modification, a wall unit <b>88</b> comprises the first insulator <b>86</b> as a plate-like member attached to the first wall portion <b>71</b> and the first member <b>71</b><i>c</i>, and the first insulator <b>86</b> is attached to the inner surface of the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The second insulator <b>87</b> is previously attached to the second wall portion <b>72</b> to constitute a wall unit <b>89</b>. The second insulator <b>87</b> is attached to the second wall portion <b>72</b> by, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape. The second insulator <b>87</b> is attached to the housing <b>5</b> by, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape. Accordingly, in the third modification, the wall unit <b>89</b> comprises the second insulator <b>87</b> as a plate-like member attached to the second wall portion <b>72</b>, and the second insulator <b>87</b> is attached to the inner surface of the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">With this structure, the first wall portion <b>71</b> and the second wall portion <b>72</b> can easily be attached to the housing <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">An insertion portion <b>71</b><i>h </i>in which the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>is inserted is provided in the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b>. The insertion portion <b>71</b><i>h </i>is formed in a groove shape. With this, the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>can easily attached to the first member <b>71</b><i>c</i>, and the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>can more strongly be supported by the first member <b>71</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A fourth modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In the fourth modification, the first portion <b>74</b><i>a </i>and the second portion <b>74</b><i>b </i>of the fourth wall portion <b>74</b> comprise overhang portions <b>74</b><i>c </i>and <b>74</b><i>d </i>extending from the heat sink <b>28</b> toward the circuit board <b>31</b>, respectively. The overhang portions <b>74</b><i>c </i>and <b>74</b><i>d </i>are each formed in a tapered and curved shape such that the thicknesses decreases in the extending direction. With this, the resistance of the fourth wall portion <b>74</b> against cooling wind can be decreased to efficiently guide faster cooling wind to the heat sink <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">A fifth modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.

More specifically, the fan case <b>53</b> comprises a curved portion <b>53</b><i>e </i>in the peripheral wall <b>53</b><i>c</i>, and the curved portion <b>53</b><i>e </i>is curved along the front wall <b>8</b><i>a</i>. The impeller <b>54</b> comprises a rectangular base <b>54</b><i>a </i>and an extended portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>that extends from the base <b>54</b><i>a </i>toward the peripheral wall <b>53</b><i>c</i>. The extended portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>is curved along the curvature of the front wall <b>8</b><i>a </i>such that the thickness of the extended portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>decreases toward the leading end.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this structure, the extended portion <b>54</b><i>b </i>is curved and extended along the curvature of the front wall <b>8</b><i>a</i>. Thus, an air volume by the impeller <b>54</b> can be increased by the extended portion <b>54</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A sixth modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In the sixth modification, curved portions <b>71</b><i>m </i>are formed in the corners of the L-shaped ventilation paths <b>91</b> in the first wall portion <b>71</b> and the second wall portion <b>72</b> (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). With this, the resistance against cooling wind flowing through the ventilation path <b>91</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">A seventh modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 and 24</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, in the seventh modification, a plurality of first members <b>71</b><i>c </i>are provided in the first portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b> while separated from one another. In other words, the first portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>is provided as being divided. The first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>is partially provided in the corner (i.e., a corner portion or a bent portion) of the first wall portion <b>71</b>. The first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>is provided at the end of the first wall portion <b>71</b> in the extended direction. The first members <b>71</b><i>c </i>are coupled by the second member <b>71</b><i>d</i>. The second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>connects between the first members <b>71</b><i>c</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the extended direction along the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b> is bent in one of the first members <b>71</b><i>c</i>, and the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>is located on the inner peripheral side, in particular, on the inner peripheral side of the second wall <b>71</b><i>j</i>. In the first members <b>71</b><i>c</i>, the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>may be located on the outer peripheral side, in particular, on the outer peripheral side of the second wall <b>71</b><i>j</i>. While the seventh modification is described by way of example as being applied to the first portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>comprising the L-shaped portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it may be applied to the first portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>having the vertical wall shape of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> or the first portion <b>71</b><i>a </i>comprising the recessed insertion portion <b>71</b><i>h </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>. That is, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>may be present on one side or on both sides in the width direction of the second member <b>71</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In this manner, the first members <b>71</b><i>c </i>are provided separate from one another in the corners of the first wall portion <b>71</b>. Thus, the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>can well be supported while the weight of the first wall portion <b>71</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">An eighth modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. A portion illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is equivalent to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> in the electronic device <b>1</b>. The first wall portion <b>71</b> of the eighth modification is basically the same as previously described in the seventh modification except that one of the first portions <b>71</b><i>a </i>includes a third projection (hereinafter designated by numeral <b>71</b><i>a</i>). The third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>as the first portion is provided in the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b>. For example, the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>is a boss that supports a component such as the circuit board <b>31</b> in the housing <b>5</b>. In this manner, in the eighth modification, the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>is substituted for the first portion. The second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>is curved along the outer periphery of the third projection <b>71</b><i>a</i>. That is, the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>is located on the inner peripheral side of the corner of the second member <b>71</b><i>d</i>. In other words, the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>is located at an internal angle of the second member <b>71</b><i>d</i>. In other words, the projection is a protrusion or a protruding portion.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As described above, the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>is located on the inner peripheral side of the corner of the second member <b>71</b><i>d</i>. Thus, the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>can be attached to the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>by adhesion while entrained about the third projection <b>71</b><i>a</i>. This facilitates the attachment of the second member <b>71</b><i>d</i>. In this case, since the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>is positioned as being hooked over the third projection <b>71</b><i>a</i>, it is not necessary to bond the third projection <b>71</b><i>a </i>and the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>together.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">A ninth modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. In the ninth modification, a case <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the storage device (for example, HDD) <b>33</b> serves as the first member of the second portion <b>72</b><i>b </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b>. That is, a side surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the case <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the storage device <b>33</b> supports the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>of the second portion <b>72</b><i>b</i>. The second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>is attached to a side surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the case <b>33</b><i>a </i>by, for example, a double-sided adhesive tape. The storage device <b>33</b> is an example of a relatively tall component. The storage device <b>33</b> is an example of a module. That is, the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>may be attached to not only the dedicated first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>but also another component. In other words, another component is used as the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>as a double-use portion, i.e., another component is substituted for the first member <b>71</b><i>c</i>. The double-use portion has the first function as well as the second function of supporting the second member <b>71</b><i>d</i>. In the case <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the storage device <b>33</b>, the first function is to store and protect a storage module of the storage device <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this manner, the second member <b>71</b><i>d </i>as the double-use portion is attached to the case <b>33</b><i>a </i>of the storage device <b>33</b>. Thus, the duct structure can be relatively simplified and thereby obtained at low cost. The use of the double-use portion is not limited to the storage device <b>33</b>, but the double-use portion may be used in the fan case <b>53</b> or the ODD <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">A tenth modification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. In the tenth modification, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>of the first wall portion <b>71</b> is integrally formed with the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b> as the inner surface of the housing <b>5</b>. For example, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>is a rib (protrusion or projection) projected from the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b>. The housing <b>5</b> and the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>are a resin integrated molding product. In this manner, the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>is integrally formed with the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b>, which further enhances the rigidity of the housing <b>5</b>. Besides, there is no need of attaching the first member <b>71</b><i>c </i>to the inner surface <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the lower wall <b>7</b>, which reduces burden on the operator.</p>

The second embodiment is of the same structure as the first embodiment except those described below.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the display device <b>111</b> comprises a housing <b>5</b> and a display panel <b>16</b> housed in the housing <b>5</b>. The display device <b>111</b> may be, for example, a television. The housing <b>5</b> has the same structure as previously described in the first embodiment or the modifications thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">With the display device <b>111</b> having this structure, the cooling efficiency can be improved as in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As described above, according to the first and second embodiments, it is possible to suppress an increase in load on the circuit board as well as to improve the cooling efficiency of the cooling fan.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Incidentally, for example, in the housing <b>5</b>, it is not always necessary to partition the third chamber <b>63</b>, but it is only necessary to partition the first chamber <b>61</b> and the second chamber <b>62</b>. It is not always necessary to form the ventilation path <b>91</b>. Instead of the wall portion, part (for example, rib) of the housing <b>5</b> may be used to partition the first chamber <b>61</b>, the second chamber <b>62</b>, and the third chamber <b>63</b>. It is not always necessary that the first suction port <b>24</b><i>a </i>be oriented toward the air inlet port <b>21</b> of the lower wall <b>7</b>. The first wall portion <b>71</b> and the second wall portion <b>72</b> may extend to the side of the cooling fan <b>24</b>.</p>
