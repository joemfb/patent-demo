<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of displaying aircraft traffic information on a display element of a host aircraft begins by displaying a lateral display and an in-trail procedure (ITP) display. The lateral display includes representations of tracks corresponding to flight path constraints, the host aircraft, and neighboring aircraft, wherein the host aircraft and the neighboring aircraft are displayed in alignment with the tracks. The ITP display includes representations of flight levels including a current flight level of the host aircraft. The method continues by receiving a command that indicates selection of one of the displayed tracks. In response to the command, the ITP display is rendered to display representations of neighboring aircraft traveling on the selected track, in the absence of neighboring aircraft traveling on tracks other than the selected track.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate generally to avionics systems such as flight display systems. More particularly, embodiments of the subject matter relate to the display of aircraft traffic on designated tracks, such as oceanic tracks.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Commercial aircraft flying over an ocean (or any geographic region where communication with air traffic control is limited or non-existent) may be restricted to certain predetermined oceanic tracks that are generally parallel to one another when viewed from above. Thus, the flight paths of commercial aircraft may be constrained to a designated set of oceanic tracks, and the tracks can be updated from time to time (such as every twelve hours) to contemplate traffic volume, weather conditions, and other factors. The in-trail procedure (ITP) is a protocol followed by aircraft flying in accordance with designated oceanic tracks. The ITP protocol is followed by an aircraft that desires to change its current flight level to a new flight level by descending or climbing in front of or behind one or more potentially blocking aircraft that are flying at an intervening flight level. In accordance with the ITP, certain conditions must be satisfied before the flight crew member issues a request for clearance to proceed with the flight level change. Whether or not the conditions are satisfied will depend on a number of dynamically changing factors associated with the host aircraft and other aircraft, such as the current geographic position of the aircraft, the current speed of the aircraft, the current heading of the aircraft, the desired new flight level, and the current flight level.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern flight deck instrumentation might include a vertical profile display or a vertical situation display (VSD) that provides a two-dimensional representation of an aircraft, the aircraft vertical flight plan, and neighboring aircraft. VSDs typically include a number of parameters and visual indicators that enable the pilot to form a quick mental picture of the vertical situation of the host aircraft. For example, VSDs may include displays of an aircraft symbol, the aircraft altitude, the vertical flight plan, and terrain. Thus, a member of the aircraft flight crew can obtain information related to the vertical situation of the aircraft relative to the terrain with a simple glance at the VSD.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A VSD could be used to identify the vertical position of potentially blocking aircraft for purposes of the ITP. Even if a VSD is deployed, however, the flight crew member will still need to mentally interpret the traffic situation and/or perform manual calculations related to the designation of potentially blocking aircraft and related to the determination of whether the conditions exist requiring the ITP protocol be used for a desired flight level change. Conventional VSDs display all air traffic within some predetermined maximum range relative to the host aircraft. Accordingly, a conventional VSD might become cluttered with many graphical representations of neighboring aircraft, whether or not such neighboring aircraft are relevant for purposes of the ITP.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; means &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Techniques and technologies may be described herein in terms of functional and/or logical block components, and with reference to symbolic representations of operations, processing tasks, and functions that may be performed by various computing components or devices. Such operations, tasks, and functions are sometimes referred to as being computer-executed, computerized, software-implemented, or computer-implemented. In practice, one or more processor devices can carry out the described operations, tasks, and functions by manipulating electrical signals representing data bits at memory locations in the system memory, as well as other processing of signals. It should be appreciated that the various block components shown in the figures may be realized by any number of hardware, software, and/or firmware components configured to perform the specified functions. For example, an embodiment of a system or a component may employ various integrated circuit components, e.g., memory elements, digital signal processing elements, logic elements, look-up tables, or the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more microprocessors or other control devices.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to graphics and image processing, navigation, flight planning, aircraft controls, aircraft data communication systems, and other functional aspects of certain systems and subsystems (and the individual operating components thereof) may not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures contained herein are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships and/or physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted that many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical connections may be present in an embodiment of the subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The subject matter described herein relates to an onboard flight deck display system and related operating methods and processes that display aircraft traffic information on a display element of a host aircraft. In certain embodiments, the display element is used to render a split-screen rendering that includes both a lateral view and a vertical profile view of aircraft traffic. The content of the display is updated in response to user interaction, e.g., data input, selection or highlighting of displayed items, or activation of graphical user interface (GUI) elements. For example, in response to the selection of an oceanic track displayed on the lateral view, the vertical profile view is updated to only show traffic that is currently traveling on the selected track. Moreover, the traffic on the selected track may be highlighted or otherwise visually distinguished on the lateral view. Thereafter, in response to the selection of a flight level (altitude) displayed on the vertical profile view, the lateral view and/or the vertical view are updated to highlight intervening traffic travelling at a flight level between the current flight level of the host aircraft and the selected flight level. Thereafter, in response to the selection of an intervening reference aircraft, the lateral view and/or the vertical view are updated to highlight the selected reference aircraft. At that time, the system may generate and render a message to enable the user to issue an ITP request for clearance to change flight levels.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment of a flight deck display system <b>100</b> that is suitable for use with a vehicle such as an aircraft. In exemplary embodiments, the display system <b>100</b> is located onboard the host aircraft, i.e., the various components and elements of the display system <b>100</b> reside within the host aircraft, are carried by the host aircraft, or are attached to the host aircraft. The illustrated embodiment of the display system <b>100</b> includes, without limitation: at least one processor <b>102</b>; an appropriate amount of memory <b>104</b>; a display element <b>106</b>; a graphics system <b>108</b>; a user interface <b>110</b>; a data communication module <b>112</b>; a traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b>; and at least one source of flight status data <b>116</b>. These elements of the display system <b>100</b> may be coupled together by a suitable interconnection architecture <b>118</b> that accommodates data communication, the transmission of control or command signals, and/or the delivery of operating power within the display system <b>100</b>. It should be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified representation of the display system <b>100</b> that will be used for purposes of explanation and ease of description, and that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not intended to limit the application or scope of the subject matter in any way. In practice, the display system <b>100</b> and the host aircraft will include other devices and components for providing additional functions and features, as will be appreciated in the art. Furthermore, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the display system <b>100</b> as a single unit, the individual elements and components of the display system <b>100</b> could be implemented in a distributed manner using any number of physically distinct pieces of hardware or equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The processor <b>102</b> may be implemented or realized with a general purpose processor, a content addressable memory, a digital signal processor, an application specific integrated circuit, a field programmable gate array, any suitable programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination designed to perform the functions described here. A processor device may be realized as a microprocessor, a controller, a microcontroller, or a state machine. Moreover, a processor device may be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a digital signal processor and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a digital signal processor core, or any other such configuration. As described in more detail below, the processor <b>102</b> and/or the traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> could be utilized to obtain, process, and &#x201c;filter&#x201d; aircraft data for purposes of generating and rendering the lateral and vertical displays having the characteristics described herein. In this regard, the processor and/or the traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> might identify aircraft that are located within certain altitude boundaries, identify aircraft that are located within certain lateral boundaries relative to the host aircraft, identify aircraft traveling on certain oceanic tracks, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The memory <b>104</b> may be realized as RAM memory, flash memory, EPROM memory, EEPROM memory, registers, a hard disk, a removable disk, a CD-ROM, or any other form of storage medium known in the art. In this regard, the memory <b>104</b> can be coupled to the processor <b>102</b> such that the processor <b>102</b> can read information from, and write information to, the memory <b>104</b>. In the alternative, the memory <b>104</b> may be integral to the processor <b>102</b>. As an example, the processor <b>102</b> and the memory <b>104</b> may reside in an ASIC. In practice, a functional or logical module/component of the display system <b>100</b> might be realized using program code that is maintained in the memory <b>104</b>. For example, the graphics system <b>108</b>, the data communication module <b>112</b>, or the traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> may have associated software program components that are stored in the memory <b>104</b>. Moreover, the memory <b>104</b> can be used to store data utilized to support the operation of the display system <b>100</b>, as will become apparent from the following description.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an exemplary embodiment, the display element <b>106</b> is coupled to the graphics system <b>108</b>. The graphics system <b>108</b> is coupled to the processor <b>102</b> such that the processor <b>102</b> and the graphics system <b>108</b> cooperate to display, render, or otherwise convey one or more graphical representations, synthetic displays, graphical icons, GUI elements, visual symbology, or images associated with operation of the host aircraft on the display element <b>106</b>, as described in greater detail below. An embodiment of the display system <b>100</b> may utilize existing graphics processing techniques and technologies in conjunction with the graphics system <b>108</b>. For example, the graphics system <b>108</b> may be suitably configured to support well known graphics technologies such as, without limitation, VGA, SVGA, UVGA, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an exemplary embodiment, the display element <b>106</b> is realized as an electronic display configured to graphically display flight information or other data associated with operation of the host aircraft under control of the graphics system <b>108</b>. The display element <b>106</b> is usually located within a cockpit of the host aircraft. The display element <b>106</b> could also be implemented as a virtual display of the type used with head up display technology. Moreover, the display element <b>106</b> could be integrated in equipment worn or carried by the user, e.g., a display mounted to eyewear, headwear, or the like. In practice, the processor <b>102</b> and/or the graphics system <b>108</b> produces image rendering display commands that are received by the display element <b>106</b> for purposes of rendering VSDs. It will be appreciated that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a single display element <b>106</b>, in practice, additional cooperating display devices may be present onboard the host aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The illustrated embodiment of the display system <b>100</b> includes a user interface <b>110</b>, which is suitably configured to receive input from a user (e.g., a pilot) and, in response to user-entered data, supply appropriate command, control, or instruction signals to the processor <b>102</b>. The user interface <b>110</b> may be any one, or any combination, of various known user interface devices or technologies, including, but not limited to: a cursor control device such as a mouse, a trackball, or joystick; a keyboard; buttons; switches; or knobs. Moreover, the user interface <b>110</b> may cooperate with the display element <b>106</b> and the graphics system <b>108</b> to provide a GUI. In other words, the user interface <b>110</b> could be implemented as a GUI rendered on the display element <b>106</b>. In certain embodiments, the display element <b>106</b> implements touch-sensitive technology for purposes of the user interface <b>110</b>. Thus, a user can manipulate the user interface <b>110</b> by moving a cursor symbol rendered on the display element <b>106</b> and/or by physically interacting with the display element <b>106</b> itself, and the user may use a keyboard to, among other things, input textual data. For example, the user could manipulate the user interface <b>110</b> to identify or select a displayed oceanic track, to identify or select a displayed flight level, to identify or select a displayed aircraft, to enter a desired or requested new flight level into the display system <b>100</b>, to enter lateral or altitude boundary (filtering) values, and to change the display modes of the display system <b>100</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment, the data communication module <b>112</b> is suitably configured to support data communication between the host aircraft and one or more remote systems. More specifically, the data communication module <b>112</b> is used to receive current flight status data <b>120</b> of other aircraft that are near the host aircraft. In this regard, the data communication module <b>112</b> represents instrumentation that obtains aircraft data used by the display system <b>100</b>. In particular embodiments, the data communication module <b>112</b> is implemented as an aircraft-to-aircraft data communication module that receives flight status data from an aircraft other than the host aircraft. For example, the data communication module <b>112</b> may be configured for compatibility with Automatic Dependant Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology, with Traffic and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) technology, and/or with similar technologies. In other embodiments the data communication module <b>112</b> may also be compatible with Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) technology.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">ADS-B technology is presently being evaluated and will soon integrate with onboard avionics systems. In this regard, ADS-B traffic can be displayed using the display system <b>100</b> (this application is referred to as Cockpit Display of Traffic Information or &#x201c;CDTI&#x201d;). The display of CDTI traffic promises various new procedures that enable better air traffic management, shorter routes, and fuel saving for the operators. However, currently proposed procedures and methodology associated with requests for clearances (such as ITP requests) through the CDTI application are textual or are only partially graphical. The methodology described in more detail below need not rely on textual data input, and is more efficient and intuitive than conventional approaches. As will become apparent from the following description, representing ITP traffic with additional cues and requesting clearances graphically reduces pilot workload and increases situational awareness.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The flight status data <b>120</b> of the neighboring aircraft may include, without limitation: airspeed data; groundspeed data; altitude data; attitude data, including pitch data and roll data; yaw data; geographic position data, such as GPS data; time/date information; heading information; weather information; flight path data; track data; radar altitude data; geometric altitude data; wind speed data; wind direction data; etc. The display system <b>100</b> is suitably designed to process the flight status data <b>120</b> in the manner described in more detail herein. In particular, the display system <b>100</b> can use the flight status data <b>120</b> when rendering a lateral display, an ITP display, and/or a VSD on the display element <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> is configured to perform various operations, calculations, data analysis, and other functions associated with the generation of traffic displays. For example, the traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> may be suitably configured to calculate or otherwise obtain altitude boundaries or lateral boundary criteria that influences the manner in which neighboring aircraft are rendered on a display view. As explained in more detail below, the traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> is also designed to determine the aircraft traffic travelling on a selected oceanic track, for purposes of selectively displaying traffic on an ITP display in a track-by-track basis. In certain embodiments, the traffic filtering and processing module <b>114</b> may be disabled or deactivated (by the user or automatically) if so desired such that the display includes graphical representations of all of the neighboring aircraft located within a designated or selected range relative to the host aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, the display system <b>100</b> also processes the current flight status data of the host aircraft. In this regard, the sources of flight status data <b>116</b> generate, measure, and/or provide different types of data related to the operational status of the host aircraft, the environment in which the host aircraft is operating, flight parameters, and the like. In this regard, the sources of flight status data <b>116</b> represent instrumentation that obtains aircraft data used by the display system <b>100</b>. In practice, the sources of flight status data <b>116</b> may be realized using line replaceable units (LRUs), transducers, accelerometers, instruments, sensors, and other well known devices. The data provided by the sources of flight status data <b>116</b> may include, without limitation: airspeed data; groundspeed data; altitude data; attitude data, including pitch data and roll data; yaw data; geographic position data, such as GPS data; time/date information; heading information; weather information; flight path data; track data; radar altitude data; geometric altitude data; wind speed data; wind direction data; etc. The display system <b>100</b> is suitably designed to process data obtained from the sources of flight status data <b>116</b> in the manner described in more detail herein. In particular, the display system <b>100</b> can use the flight status data of the host aircraft when rendering the various displays.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned previously, a VSD provides a graphical representation of the host aircraft and neighboring aircraft using a side or vertical profile perspective. As used herein, an ITP represents one type of VSD that can be utilized to assist the flight crew during oceanic travel and, in particular, to assist the flight crew during an ITP procedure. A lateral display corresponds to a plan view (top view) of the air traffic near the host aircraft. The exemplary embodiment described here employs a split-screen view that includes both an ITP display and a corresponding lateral display, both of which are refreshed or updated as needed to represent the current flight situation in real-time or near-real-time (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref>, which represent &#x201c;snapshots&#x201d; of a dynamic display taken at particular moments in time).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a process <b>200</b> for displaying aircraft traffic. The process <b>200</b> is suitable for use for use with a flight deck display system such as the display system <b>100</b>. Although not always required, this example assumes that the host aircraft and neighboring aircraft proximate the host aircraft are traveling on designated tracks, such as oceanic tracks. In this regard, the host aircraft and other traffic are constrained to a predetermined set of flight paths that correspond to a number of designated tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The various tasks performed in connection with a process described herein may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the description of a process may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In practice, portions of a described process may be performed by different elements of the described system, e.g., a processor or processing module, a graphics module, a display element, or a data communication component. It should be appreciated that a described process may include any number of additional or alternative tasks, the tasks shown in the figures need not be performed in the illustrated order, and a described process may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having additional functionality not described in detail herein. Moreover, one or more of the tasks shown in the figures could be omitted from an embodiment of a process as long as the intended overall functionality remains intact.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">During operation of the host aircraft, the process <b>200</b> can be performed in a virtually continuous manner at a relatively high refresh rate. For example, an iteration of the process <b>200</b> could be performed once every two seconds (or less) such that the displays are updated in real-time or substantially real time in a dynamic manner. This particular embodiment of the process <b>200</b> begins by obtaining the current flight status data of the host aircraft (task <b>202</b>). The process <b>200</b> may also obtain or retrieve a designated, desired, or maximum lateral display range for the lateral display and/or a designated or desired altitude range for the lateral and ITP displays. For the example presented here, the designated maximum lateral display range is eighty nautical miles, although other embodiments could use a different maximum selectable range. The altitude range represents a display filter that allows the user to declutter the displays by hiding aircraft that are outside of the designated altitude range. In practice, the altitude range may be defined between an upper flight level and a lower flight level, or between any two altitudes, or relative to the current flight level of the host aircraft. For example, an altitude filter of &#x2212;5000 feet will cause the system to include aircraft traveling 5000 feet (or less) below the current altitude of the host aircraft, while hiding or disregarding aircraft traveling more than 5000 feet below the host aircraft and while hiding or disregarding aircraft traveling above the host aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The process <b>200</b> also receives or otherwise obtains the current flight status data of one or more other aircraft near the host aircraft (task <b>204</b>). For this particular embodiment, task <b>204</b> obtains the current flight status data of neighboring aircraft located within the designated display ranges. In practice, the process <b>200</b> could collect additional aircraft data associated with neighboring aircraft located outside the designated display ranges, and thereafter discard or ignore that data if so desired. In preferred embodiments, task <b>204</b> is performed using an appropriate aircraft-to-aircraft data communication technology and related subsystem components located onboard the host aircraft. This enables the host aircraft to receive the current flight status data of the neighboring aircraft directly from those aircraft. Alternatively, the host aircraft could receive this information from a ground-based system. In yet other embodiments, aircraft-to-ground technology could be utilized (for example, data for surrounding aircraft is passed to the host aircraft via a data link to a ground facility using TIS-B).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, the process <b>200</b> generates appropriate image rendering display commands for the lateral display and the ITP display (task <b>206</b>). Notably, these image rendering display commands will be generated based upon the current flight status data of the host aircraft and the current flight status data of the neighboring aircraft located within the designated lateral and vertical boundaries. In other words, only those neighboring aircraft that are members of a filtered subset are considered for the displays.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The process <b>200</b> continues by generating and rendering an appropriate lateral display and an appropriate ITP display on the display element of the host aircraft (task <b>208</b>). The visual characteristics and content of the displays will be responsive or otherwise influenced by the image rendering display commands generated during task <b>206</b>. The lateral display and the ITP display will include a number of graphical features, visual elements, and graphical representations that are intended for viewing by the pilot and/or other flight crew members. The lateral display typically includes, without limitation, graphical representations of: the host aircraft; the neighboring aircraft located within the lateral boundaries; and the tracks corresponding to the flight paths of the host aircraft and the neighboring aircraft (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref>). Notably, the lateral display will be devoid of graphical representations of any neighboring aircraft that are located outside the display filter boundaries. The ITP display typically includes, without limitation, graphical representations of: the neighboring aircraft located within the vertical boundaries; an altitude or flight level scale; and an ITP (lateral) distance scale (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref>). In certain display modes, the ITP display also includes a graphical representation of the host aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-10</figref>, the lateral and/or ITP displays can be rendered with one or more active GUI elements that accommodate user interaction, selection, data entry, highlighting, or the like. Thus, a user can interact with a display to initiate commands, instructions, or requests associated with various filtering, selecting, or other control operations. To this end, if the process <b>200</b> receives a filtering, selection, control, and/or other command or instruction (query task <b>210</b>), then the system refreshes the current displays using the newest or most current flight status data, along with the new display criteria associated with the received commands or instructions (task <b>212</b>). Accordingly, the process <b>200</b> returns to task <b>202</b> to obtain updated flight status data and to refresh the display element in response to the updated data. In this way, the content of the rendered displays are dynamically updated as the host aircraft continues its flight path. If no user commands or instructions are received at query task <b>210</b>, then the system simply refreshes the current displays using the newest or most current flight status data (task <b>214</b>) by returning to task <b>202</b> and continuing as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, user-entered commands, instructions, or selections influence the content of the lateral display and/or the ITP display. Moreover, manipulation of elements displayed on the lateral display might influence the content of the ITP display, and vice versa. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-10</figref> illustrate the interactive nature of the displays in the context of one exemplary scenario. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart that illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a process <b>300</b> for displaying aircraft traffic, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref> are schematic representations of exemplary displays that depict lateral and vertical profile views of aircraft traffic at various times during the process <b>300</b>. The process <b>300</b> may be performed in conjunction with the process <b>200</b> (described above). Indeed, some of the tasks associated with the process <b>300</b> are similar to counterpart tasks described above for the process <b>200</b>. For the sake of brevity, common or similar aspects of the processes with not be redundantly described here in the context of the process <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The process <b>300</b> renders and displays the lateral display (task <b>302</b>) and the ITP display (task <b>304</b>) in a manner that accurately represents the current flight conditions of the host aircraft and the neighboring aircraft. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> may be rendered in a split-screen arrangement as shown. The process <b>300</b> assumes that appropriate lateral and vertical boundaries (e.g., filters) have already been designated and implemented. This particular embodiment of the lateral display <b>400</b> generally includes, without limitation, graphical representations of the following items: the host aircraft <b>402</b>; a range circle <b>403</b>; a plurality of neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b>, <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>; and a plurality of tracks <b>428</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. The displayed tracks correspond to flight path constraints for the host aircraft and for the neighboring aircraft (which are aircraft other than the host aircraft). The graphical representations of the host aircraft <b>402</b> and the neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>-<b>424</b> are displayed in alignment with the tracks <b>428</b>-<b>434</b>. More specifically, each aircraft is displayed along or overlying its respective track. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref> depict four parallel tracks <b>428</b>-<b>434</b>, any number of tracks may be rendered, depending on the particular embodiment, the specifications of the display element, the current lateral boundaries, user preferences, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with traditional plan view display techniques, the graphical representation of the host aircraft <b>402</b> remains in a fixed position (usually centered) on the lateral display <b>400</b>. Although not shown in the figures, the lateral display <b>400</b> may also include identifiers or labels for each neighboring aircraft. For example, each neighboring aircraft could be identified by carrier and tail number. In certain embodiments, the host aircraft <b>402</b> is rendered such that it is visually distinguishable from the neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>-<b>434</b>. In other words, the host aircraft <b>402</b> and/or the neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>-<b>434</b> can be rendered using certain visually distinguishable characteristics to make the host aircraft <b>402</b> noticeable or prominent in the lateral display <b>400</b>. In this regard, the different visually distinguishable characteristics may correspond to any of the following characteristics, individually or in any combination thereof: different colors; different brightness; different transparency levels; different translucency levels; different line patterns; different line thickness; different shapes; different sizes; different flicker patterns; different focus levels; different sharpness levels; different clarity levels; and different contrast levels. In preferred embodiments, for example, the graphical representation of the host aircraft <b>402</b> is rendered as a solid shape in a designated color (such as white) that is easily distinguishable from other color schemes that might be used for other items in the lateral display <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The ITP display <b>500</b> corresponds to a side view of the airspace near the host aircraft. The depicted state of the ITP display <b>500</b> is consistent with that shown in the lateral display <b>400</b>. Accordingly, the ITP display <b>500</b> includes graphical representations of all the neighboring aircraft located within the designated boundaries. This particular embodiment of the ITP display <b>500</b> generally includes, without limitation, graphical representations of the following items: the host aircraft <b>502</b>; an altitude scale <b>503</b>; a plurality of neighboring aircraft <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>; and a lateral distance scale <b>550</b> (which may be expressed in ITP distance or &#x201c;standard&#x201d; (range) distance using nautical miles as the unit of measurement). The ITP display <b>500</b> may also include graphical representations of a plurality of different flight levels <b>552</b>, <b>554</b>, <b>556</b>, <b>558</b>, <b>560</b>, <b>562</b>, <b>564</b>, <b>566</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref> depict eight different flight levels <b>552</b>-<b>566</b>, any number of flight levels may be rendered, depending on the particular embodiment, the specifications of the display element, the current vertical boundaries, user preferences, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The reference numbers assigned to the aircraft depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref> begin with &#x201c;4&#x201d; for the lateral display and begin with &#x201c;5&#x201d; for the ITP display; the following two digits identify the particular aircraft. For example, reference number <b>402</b> identifies the host aircraft in the lateral display, and reference number <b>502</b> identifies the host aircraft in the ITP display. As another example, reference numbers <b>410</b> and <b>510</b> identify graphical representations of one neighboring aircraft, and reference numbers <b>420</b> and <b>520</b> identify graphical representations of another neighboring aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The altitude (or flight level) scale <b>503</b> may include alphanumeric indicia of altitude values in any convenient scale (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the altitude scale <b>503</b> includes numerical values expressed in hundreds of feet, in increments of one thousand feet). In certain embodiments, the altitude scale <b>503</b> is rendered as a scrollable tape such that the host aircraft <b>502</b> is always rendered at the same vertical position on the ITP display <b>500</b>. At the time depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the current flight level of the host aircraft <b>502</b> is 35,000 feet. Accordingly, the host aircraft <b>502</b> is rendered on or overlapping its current flight level <b>556</b>. Similarly, each neighboring aircraft <b>504</b>-<b>524</b> (including any reference aircraft for purposes of the ITP procedure) is rendered on or overlapping its respective flight level.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The lateral distance scale <b>550</b> may include alphanumeric indicia of distance values in any convenient scale (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lateral distance scale <b>550</b> includes numerical values that represent distance relative to the host aircraft <b>502</b>, expressed in nautical miles). In this embodiment, the lateral distance scale <b>550</b> has a zero reference point that corresponds to the current position of the host aircraft. In other words, the graphical representation of the host aircraft <b>502</b> is aligned with the zero lateral distance mark on the lateral distance scale <b>550</b>. Consequently, the host aircraft <b>502</b> and the lateral distance scale <b>550</b> are rendered in fixed positions on the ITP display <b>500</b>. In contrast, during operation, the altitude scale <b>503</b>, the flight levels <b>552</b>-<b>566</b>, and the neighboring aircraft <b>504</b>-<b>524</b> can be rendered in a dynamic manner that reflects the changing flight conditions and aircraft positions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Notably, the graphical representations of the host aircraft and the neighboring aircraft are positioned in the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> in accordance with the current flight status data of the host aircraft and in accordance with the current flight data of the neighboring aircraft (which may be received by the host aircraft using, for example, ADS-B technology). Thus, graphical representations of the neighboring aircraft are positioned in a manner that indicates the actual respective altitudes of the neighboring aircraft relative to the host aircraft, and in a manner that indicates the actual distance of interest (e.g., a standard distance measure, the ITP distance, or other suitable distance metric) between the other aircraft and the host aircraft. Consequently, the current distance and vertical separation between the host aircraft and the nearby aircraft can be quickly and easily determined from the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> in their initial or &#x201c;default&#x201d; states, where the amount of rendered neighboring aircraft is determined by lateral and/or altitude filter boundaries. For example, the ITP display <b>500</b> is subject to an altitude filter setting of +2000/&#x2212;5000, relative to the current altitude of the host aircraft. Accordingly, the ITP display <b>500</b> is void of graphical representations of neighboring aircraft that do not satisfy the altitude filter setting. In other words, the ITP display <b>500</b> does not include any neighboring aircraft above 37,000 feet, or any neighboring aircraft below 30,000 feet.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although not shown in the figures, the ITP display <b>500</b> may also include identifiers or labels for each neighboring aircraft, such as carrier and tail number. In certain embodiments, the host aircraft <b>502</b> is rendered such that it is visually distinguishable from the neighboring aircraft <b>504</b>-<b>524</b>. For example, the host aircraft <b>502</b> may be rendered using one or more of the visually distinguishable characteristics listed previously. For this example, the graphical representation of the host aircraft <b>502</b> is rendered as a solid shape in a designated color (such as white), and in a manner that is consistent with the graphical representation of the host aircraft <b>402</b> in the lateral display <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lateral display <b>400</b> is generated and rendered to accommodate the selection of the displayed tracks. In practice, a user could select a track by manipulating a pointing device, by manipulating a keyboard or a keypad, by interacting with a touch-screen area, or the like. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if no track is selected (the &#x201c;No&#x201d; branch of query task <b>306</b>), then the process <b>300</b> may exit and return to an appropriate task. For example, the process <b>300</b> may wait for the next refresh or update time, or it may continue monitoring for a track selection command or instruction. If, however, the process receives a command that indicates selection of one of the rendered tracks (the &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch of query task <b>306</b>), then the system responds in an appropriate manner to update and refresh the lateral display and/or the ITP display, preferably both. In particular, the lateral display is updated to visually distinguish the selected track and to visually distinguish the aircraft on the selected track (task <b>308</b>). In addition, the ITP display is updated such that it includes graphical representations of neighboring aircraft having flight paths corresponding to the selected track, while being void of graphical representations of neighboring aircraft having flight paths that do not correspond to the selected track. In other words, the ITP display is refreshed such that it only depicts neighboring aircraft traveling on the selected track. These &#x201c;on-track&#x201d; aircraft are displayed in the absence of any neighboring aircraft traveling on tracks other than the selected track.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> following the selection of a displayed track. This example assumes that the selected track is the track on which the host aircraft is currently traveling. In other words, the host aircraft has a flight path that corresponds to the selected track. Accordingly, the lateral display <b>400</b> has been refreshed such that the track <b>430</b> is highlighted or is otherwise rendered in a visually distinguishable manner relative to the remaining tracks <b>428</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. For example, the track <b>430</b> may be rendered in a distinct color (such as cyan) and/or it may be rendered in a different thickness or weight relative to the lines that correspond to the other tracks <b>428</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. Moreover, the neighboring aircraft on the selected track <b>430</b> (namely, the neighboring aircraft <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b>) are highlighted or otherwise rendered in a visually distinguishable manner relative to the other neighboring aircraft (namely, the neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>418</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>422</b>, <b>424</b>). For this particular example, the neighboring aircraft <b>410</b> <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> are rendered using solid white outlines, while the &#x201c;unselected&#x201d; neighboring aircraft are grayed out, made transparent, or the like. These changes to the lateral display <b>400</b> enable the user to quickly and easily determine which aircraft are currently traveling on the selected track <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In response to the selection of the track <b>430</b>, the ITP display <b>500</b> is updated to hide or remove all aircraft other than the host aircraft <b>502</b> and the neighboring aircraft traveling on the selected track <b>430</b> (i.e., the neighboring aircraft <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>). In other words, the ITP display <b>500</b> is transformed such that it represents a side profile view of only the selected track <b>430</b>. The ITP display <b>500</b> may also be updated to highlight or otherwise visually distinguish the current flight level of the host aircraft (namely, the flight level <b>556</b>) relative to the other displayed flight levels. For example, the flight level <b>556</b> may be rendered in a distinct color (such as cyan) and/or it may be rendered in a different thickness or weight relative to the lines that correspond to the other displayed flight levels. These changes to the ITP display <b>500</b> make it easier for the user to focus on potentially blocking aircraft that are traveling in the same track as the host aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The ITP display <b>500</b> is generated and rendered to accommodate the selection of the displayed flight levels. In practice, a user could select a flight level by manipulating a pointing device, by manipulating a keyboard or a keypad, by interacting with a touch-screen area, or the like. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if no flight level is selected (the &#x201c;No&#x201d; branch of query task <b>312</b>), then the process <b>300</b> may exit and return to an appropriate task. For example, the process <b>300</b> may wait for the next refresh or update time, it may continue monitoring for a flight level selection command or instruction, or it may check for the selection of a different track. If, however, the process <b>300</b> receives a command that indicates selection of one of the rendered flight levels (the &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch of query task <b>312</b>), then the system responds in an appropriate manner to update and refresh the lateral display and/or the ITP display, preferably both. In particular, the displays are updated to visually distinguish or highlight a subset of the neighboring aircraft, namely, intervening aircraft located between the selected flight level and the current flight level of the host aircraft (task <b>314</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> following the selection of a displayed flight level. This example assumes that the flight level <b>560</b> has been selected. In practice, the selected flight level can be highlighted using a marker <b>570</b> and/or by rendering the selected flight level using visually distinguishable characteristics. This particular embodiment renders the selected flight level <b>560</b> in a bright green color, to make it easily distinguishable from the cyan-colored flight level <b>556</b> of the host aircraft <b>502</b> and from the remaining flight levels.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In response to the selection of the flight level <b>560</b>, the ITP display <b>500</b> is changed to visually highlight or otherwise distinguish the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>. For this particular example, the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> are rendered using solid white outlines, while the non-intervening neighboring aircraft are grayed out, made transparent, or the like. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> reside between the current flight level <b>556</b> of the host aircraft <b>502</b> and the selected flight level <b>560</b>, and the other neighboring aircraft <b>510</b>, <b>516</b> are now rendered in a less prominent manner. These changes to the ITP display <b>500</b> enable the user to quickly and easily focus on potentially blocking aircraft, which may need to be considered before maneuvering to the selected flight level <b>560</b>. In response to the selection of the flight level <b>560</b>, the lateral display <b>400</b> is also refreshed to visually highlight or otherwise distinguish the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, preferably following the scheme utilized for the ITP display <b>500</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> remain in view on the lateral display <b>400</b>, but the non-intervening neighboring aircraft <b>410</b>, <b>416</b> (on the same track <b>430</b>) are now rendered in a less prominent manner. These changes to the lateral display <b>400</b> make it easier for the user to focus on potentially blocking aircraft that are traveling in the same track as the host aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the process <b>300</b> may also update the lateral display and the ITP display to visually highlight, indicate, or distinguish any reference aircraft located between the current flight level of the host aircraft and the selected flight level (task <b>316</b>). In practice, therefore, a reference aircraft will by definition be one of the intervening aircraft. As used here, a &#x201c;reference aircraft&#x201d; is a neighboring aircraft of interest (i.e., a potentially blocking aircraft) that satisfies predetermined criteria. For example, the ITP specifies some minimum separation between aircraft at the current and requested flight levels to ensure safe altitude changes. Moreover, the ITP specifies certain criteria that must be satisfied before the host aircraft can issue a request for ITP flight level change (such requests are issued to Air Traffic Control (ATC)). Although different criteria could be utilized by an embodiment of the subject matter described here, exemplary embodiments may follow the accepted ITP initiation criteria, where at least one of two conditions must be met: (1) if the ITP distance to a reference aircraft is greater than or equal to 15 nautical miles, then the groundspeed differential between the two aircraft must be less than or equal to 20 knots; or (2) if the ITP distance to a reference aircraft is greater than or equal to 20 nautical miles, then the groundspeed differential between the two aircraft must be less than or equal to 30 knots. The ITP initiation criteria can be analyzed by the onboard system to determine whether or not a given intervening aircraft qualifies as a reference aircraft for purposes of issuing an ITP request.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">This example assumes that the system has identified one reference aircraft. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> after the reference aircraft has been identified and visually highlighted. For this example, the neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b> is the reference aircraft. Although any scheme can be employed to distinguish the reference neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b>, this example renders the reference neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b> using a bold outline color that is different than the remaining aircraft. In particular, the reference neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b> may be rendered using a thick and bright green colored outline to make it stand out from the host aircraft <b>402</b>, <b>502</b>, the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>414</b>, <b>514</b>, and all of the remaining neighboring aircraft (which remain grayed out). These changes to the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> enable the user to quickly and easily determine which (if any) of the intervening aircraft are eligible for the ITP procedure and which (if any) represent blocking aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The lateral display <b>400</b> and/or the ITP display <b>500</b> (preferably, both) can be generated and rendered to accommodate the selection of a displayed reference aircraft. In practice, a user could select a reference aircraft by manipulating a pointing device, by manipulating a keyboard or a keypad, by interacting with a touch-screen area, or the like. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if no reference aircraft is selected (the &#x201c;No&#x201d; branch of query task <b>318</b>), then the process <b>300</b> may exit and return to an appropriate task. For example, the process <b>300</b> may wait for the next refresh or update time, it may continue monitoring for the selection of a reference aircraft, it may check for the selection of a different flight level, or it may check for the selection of a different track.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If the process <b>300</b> receives a command or instruction that indicates selection of a reference aircraft rendered on either the lateral display or the ITP display (the &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; branch of query task <b>318</b>), then the system responds in an appropriate manner to generate and render an active GUI control element on the display element (task <b>320</b>). The display may also be refreshed to change the appearance of the selected reference aircraft. The GUI control element may be rendered in conjunction with a message, such as a pop-up message, that includes content associated with a flight level change request. In this way, the GUI control element enables a user to request a flight level change (e.g., an ITP request) from the current flight level of the host aircraft to the selected flight level.</p>

In certain embodiments, the reference neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b> is further highlighted or otherwise altered to reflect its selection. Alternatively, the lateral display <b>400</b> could remain unchanged in response to the selection of the reference neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b>. Likewise, most of the ITP display <b>500</b> remains unchanged in response to the selection of the reference neighboring aircraft <b>412</b>, <b>512</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a pop-up message <b>576</b> is rendered in a suitable location of the ITP display <b>500</b>. Alternatively (or additionally), the pop-up message <b>576</b> may be rendered in the lateral display <b>400</b>, on a different display element, in a reserved area of the display, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">This particular embodiment of the pop-up message <b>576</b> includes text that indicates the desired flight level change, namely, &#x201c;Request FL330 Following UAL123&#x201d; (where UAL123 identifies the reference aircraft and FL330 identifies the selected flight level). In practice, the content of the request may be formatted in accordance with any agreed upon standard, such as the requirements set forth in the ITP. Of course, an embodiment of the system described here may utilize different message types and may generate additional content in the pop-up message <b>576</b> if so desired. The pop-up message <b>576</b> may include any number of active GUI control elements, such as a &#x201c;Downlink&#x201d; button <b>578</b> and a &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; button <b>580</b>. The Downlink button <b>578</b> is activated to send the request from the host aircraft using an appropriate communication system such as the Datalink system. In this regard, the Downlink button <b>578</b> may also be considered to be a &#x201c;Send&#x201d; button, an &#x201c;Enter&#x201d; button, a &#x201c;Request&#x201d; button, or the like. The Cancel button <b>580</b> is activated to cancel the request without sending it.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> following the selection of a displayed track other than the host aircraft track. This example assumes that the track <b>428</b> is the selected track. Accordingly, the lateral display <b>400</b> has been refreshed such that the track <b>428</b> is highlighted or is otherwise rendered in a visually distinguishable manner relative to the remaining tracks <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. For example, the track <b>428</b> may be rendered in a distinct color (such as cyan) and/or it may be rendered in a different pattern or weight relative to the lines that correspond to the other tracks <b>430</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. If the host aircraft track <b>430</b> is rendered in a color (such as cyan), then the selected track <b>428</b> should be rendered in a manner that is visually distinguishable from the host aircraft track <b>430</b>. For example, the selected track <b>428</b> can be rendered as a cyan colored dashed line to distinguish it from the host aircraft track <b>430</b> and to distinguish it from the remaining tracks <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. As explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the neighboring aircraft on the selected track <b>428</b> (namely, the neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>) are highlighted or otherwise rendered in a visually distinguishable manner relative to the other neighboring aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In response to the selection of the track <b>428</b>, the ITP display <b>500</b> is updated to hide or remove all aircraft other than the neighboring aircraft traveling on the selected track <b>428</b> (i.e., the neighboring aircraft <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>). Notably, the host aircraft no longer appears in the ITP display <b>500</b> because the host aircraft is not aligned with the selected track <b>428</b> (i.e., the host aircraft has a flight path that does not correspond to the selected track <b>428</b>). In other words, the ITP display <b>500</b> is transformed such that it represents a side profile view of only the selected track <b>428</b>, and such that it is void of graphical representations of other aircraft, including the host aircraft. The ITP display <b>500</b> may also be updated to highlight or otherwise visually distinguish the current flight level of the host aircraft (namely, the flight level <b>556</b>) relative to the other displayed flight levels. For example, the flight level <b>556</b> may be rendered in a distinct color (such as cyan) and/or it may be rendered in a different pattern weight relative to the lines that correspond to the other displayed flight levels. The appearance of the host aircraft flight level <b>556</b> during the preview mode may be different than its appearance during the standard or normal mode. This example renders the flight level <b>556</b> as a solid cyan colored line for the normal mode (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and as a dashed cyan colored line for the preview mode (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). These changes to the ITP display <b>500</b> allow the user to visualize the vertical situation of neighboring traffic from the perspective of an adjacent track.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The preview mode also allows the user to select a displayed flight level and to preview potential reference aircraft associated with the selected flight level. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts the lateral display <b>400</b> and the ITP display <b>500</b> following the selection of a displayed flight level. This example assumes that the flight level <b>562</b> has been selected.

In response to the selection of the flight level <b>562</b>, the ITP display <b>500</b> is refreshed to visually highlight or otherwise distinguish intervening neighboring aircraft or potential reference aircraft located between the current flight level of the host aircraft and the selected flight level. For this example, the neighboring aircraft <b>506</b> is the only intervening aircraft. Accordingly, the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>506</b> is rendered using visually distinguishable characteristics. These changes to the ITP display <b>500</b> enable the user to quickly and easily determine ITP traffic on an adjacent track.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In response to the selection of the flight level <b>562</b>, the lateral display <b>400</b> is also refreshed to visually highlight or otherwise distinguish the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>406</b>, preferably following the scheme utilized for the ITP display <b>500</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the intervening neighboring aircraft <b>406</b> remains in view on the lateral display <b>400</b>, but the non-intervening neighboring aircraft <b>404</b>, <b>408</b> (on the same track <b>428</b>) are now rendered in a less prominent manner. These changes to the lateral display <b>400</b> make it easier for the user to focus on potentially blocking aircraft that are traveling on the selected track <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The methodologies described above allow a flight deck display system of a host aircraft to visually represent ITP traffic with additional graphical cues and interactive capabilities linking a lateral display with an ITP display. The methodologies described above also allow a user of the display system to send an ITP request in an easy and intuitive manner that reduces workload and increases situational awareness.</p>

It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.
