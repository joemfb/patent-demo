<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A non-volatile memory device includes a plurality of word lines, a plurality of bit lines, and an array of variable resistance memory cells each electrically connected between a respective word line and a respective bit line. Each of the memory cells includes first and second resistance variable patterns electrically connected in series between first and second electrodes. A material composition of the first resistance variable pattern is different than a material composition of the second resistance variable pattern. Multi-bit data states of each memory cell are defined by a contiguous increase in size of a programmable high-resistance volume within the first and second resistance variable patterns.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A claim of priority is made to Korean patent application no. KR 10-2009-0073390, filed Aug. 10, 2009, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The inventive concepts described herein generally relate to memory devices. In particular, the inventive concepts relative to memory devices which include programmable volumes of resistance variable material such as, for example, so-call phase-change memory devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain types of non-volatile memory devices rely on programmable resistive characteristics of memory cells to store data. These types of memory devices are generally referred to herein as resistance variable memory cell devices, and example of which is the phase-change memory cell device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A phase-change random access memory (PRAM), also known as an Ovonic Unified Memory (OUM), includes a phase-change material such as a chalcogenide alloy which is responsive to energy (e.g., thermal energy) so as to be stably transformed between crystalline and amorphous states. Such a PRAM is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,487,113 and 6,480,438.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The phase-change material of the PRAM exhibits a relatively low resistance in its crystalline state, and a relatively high resistance in its amorphous state. In conventional nomenclature, the low-resistance crystalline state is referred to as a &#x2018;set&#x2019; state and is designated logic &#x201c;0&#x201d;, while the high-resistance amorphous state is referred to as a &#x2018;reset&#x2019; state and is designated logic &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The terms &#x201c;crystalline&#x201d; and &#x201c;amorphous&#x201d; are relative terms in the context of phase-change materials. That is, when a phase-change memory cell is said to be in its crystalline state, one skilled in the art will understand that the phase-change material of the cell has a more well-ordered crystalline structure when compared to its amorphous state. A phase-change memory cell in its crystalline state need not be fully crystalline, and a phase-change memory cell in its amorphous state need not be fully amorphous.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, the phase-change material of a PRAM is reset to an amorphous state by joule heating of the material in excess of its melting point temperature for a relatively short period of time. On the other hand, the phase-change material is set to a crystalline state by heating the material below its melting point temperature for a longer period of time. In each case, the material is allowed to cool to its original temperature after the heat treatment. Generally, however, the cooling occurs much more rapidly when the phase-change material is reset to its amorphous state.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The speed and stability of the phase-change characteristics of the phase-change material are critical to the performance characteristics of the PRAM. As suggested above, chalcogenide alloys have been found to have suitable phase-change characteristics, and in particular, a compound including germanium (Ge), antimony (Sb) and tellurium (Te) (e.g., Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5 </sub>or GST) exhibits a stable and high speed transformation between amorphous and crystalline states.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various example embodiments are described with reference to the accompanying drawings, where like reference numbers are used to denote like or similar elements. The inventive concepts may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the drawings, the relative dimensions of device layers may be exaggerated for clarity. That is, for example, the relative thicknesses and/or widths of layers may be varied from those depicted. For example, unless the description clearly indicates otherwise, if a first layer is shown as being thicker than a second layer, the two layers may instead have the same thickness or the second layer may be thicker than the first layer.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">To facilitate understanding, a number of non-limiting descriptive terms may be utilized which are not intended to define the scope of the inventive concepts. For example, although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are simply used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and, similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from or limiting the scope of the inventive concepts. Likewise, the words &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;under&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, etc. are relative terms which are not intended to limit the inventive concepts to a particular device orientation. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the terminology utilized herein often makes reference to a &#x201c;layer&#x201d; of material. It will be understood that the inventive concepts are not limited to single-layer structures when reference is made to a layer of material. For example, an insulating layer can actually encompass multiple layers of insulating material which essentially achieve the same insulating functions as a single insulating layer of material. This same reasoning is to be applied to semiconductor and conductive regions as well.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including,&#x201d; when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> which schematically illustrate a non-volatile memory cell according an embodiment of one or more inventive aspects described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> corresponds to a cross-sectional view taken along line I-I&#x2032; of the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the non-volatile memory cell of this example includes an insulating layer (or mold layer) <b>130</b> having a diode element Dp formed in an aperture <b>131</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b>. The diode element Dp of this example includes a P-doped semiconductor layer <b>132</b> and an N+ doped semiconductor layer <b>131</b> stacked within the aperture <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An insulating layer (or mold layer) <b>140</b> is located over the insulating layer <b>130</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and an aperture <b>141</b> is defined within the insulating layer <b>130</b> and aligned over the aperture <b>131</b> of the mold layer <b>130</b>. A lower electrode <b>142</b> is contained within a lower portion of the aperture <b>141</b> in electrical contact with the N+ semiconductor layer <b>134</b> of the diode element Dp. Further, a first programmable volume <b>144</b> (also referred to herein as a first phase-change material pattern) is located in an upper portion of the aperture <b>141</b> in electrical contact with the lower electrode <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A second programmable volume <b>152</b> (also referred to herein as a second phase-change material pattern) is located over the insulating layer <b>140</b> so as to electrically contact the first programmable volume <b>144</b> within the aperture <b>141</b> of the insulating layer <b>140</b>. Finally, an upper electrode <b>154</b> is located over and electrically contacts the second programmable volume <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the example of this embodiment, the first and second programmable volumes <b>144</b> and <b>152</b> are respectively formed of different phase-change materials. Further, in the example of this embodiment, the phase-change material of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> has a higher resistance in an amorphous state then the phase-change material of the first programmable volume <b>144</b>. A non-limiting example of the phase-change material of the first programmable volume <b>144</b> is SbTe. Non-limiting examples of the phase-change material of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> include GeSbTe, BeBiTe, C-doped BeSbTe and N-doped GeSbTe.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The example embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is at least partially characterized by the first programmable volume <b>144</b> being spatially confined relative to the second programmable volume <b>152</b>. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> where the width W<b>1</b>_<b>2</b> of the first programmable volume <b>144</b> is less than a width W<b>2</b>_<b>1</b> of the second programmable volume <b>152</b>. In this example, the &#x201c;width&#x201d; extends parallel to a bit line or word line (not shown). Preferably, the width W<b>1</b>_<b>2</b> is 80% or less the width W<b>2</b>_<b>1</b>. More preferably, the width W<b>1</b>_<b>2</b> is 50% or less the width W<b>2</b>_<b>1</b>. Even more preferably, width W<b>1</b>_<b>2</b> is 30% or less the width W<b>2</b>_<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the length (perpendicular to the width) of the first programmable volume <b>144</b> may also be less than the length of the second programmable volume <b>152</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the width W<b>1</b>_<b>1</b> of the lower electrode <b>142</b> is the same as that first programmable volume <b>144</b>, and the width W<b>2</b>_<b>2</b> is the same as that of the second programmable volume <b>152</b>. However, the embodiment is not limited in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Spatial confinement of the first programmable volume <b>144</b> as described above is effective to increase the precision of programmable control of data states, such as during execution of the examples described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2dc;3D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As will be explained next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2dc;3D</figref>, the non-volatile memory cell Cp of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is capable of storing at least two-bits of data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2dc;3D</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views of the first and second programmable volumes <b>144</b> and <b>152</b>, where a darkly-shaded region denotes an amorphous state of the region, and a lightly-shaded region denotes a crystalline state of the region.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, this figure denotes a first state (e.g., a &#x201c;00&#x201d; state) in which both the first programmable volume <b>144</b> and the second programmable volume <b>152</b> are crystalline. In this state the memory cell Cp exhibits a relatively low cell resistance, e.g., between 1K and 100K&#x3a9;. A specific non-limiting example of the cell resistance in the &#x201c;00&#x201d; state is about 27K&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> denotes a second data state (e.g., a &#x201c;01&#x201d; state) in which the first programmable volume <b>144</b> is amorphous, and the second programmable volume <b>152</b> is crystalline. Here, the cell resistance is increased relative to that of the &#x201c;00&#x201d; state. For example, the cell resistance in the &#x201c;01&#x201d; state may, for example, be in the 10K to 1.0 M&#x3a9; range. A specific non-limiting example of the cell resistance in the &#x201c;01&#x201d; state is about 158K&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, a third data state (e.g., a &#x201c;10&#x201d; state) is shown in which the first programmable volume <b>144</b> is amorphous, a region &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> is amorphous, and a remaining region &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>144</b> is crystalline. As shown, the amorphous region &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> is contiguous with the amorphous first programmable volume <b>144</b>. Here, the cell resistance is increased relative to that of the &#x201c;01&#x201d; state. For example, the cell resistance in the &#x201c;10&#x201d; state may, for example, be in the 100K to 2.0M&#x3a9; range. A specific non-limiting example of the cell resistance in the &#x201c;00&#x201d; state is about 1.0M&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> denotes a fourth data state (e.g., a &#x201c;11&#x201d; state) in which the first programmable volume <b>144</b> is amorphous, a region &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> is amorphous, and a remaining region &#x201c;b&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>144</b> is crystalline. As shown, the amorphous region &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> is contiguous with the amorphous first programmable volume <b>144</b>. Further, as shown, the amorphous region &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the second programmable volume <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> occupies a larger area than the amorphous &#x201c;a&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. Thus, the cell resistance is increased relative to that of the &#x201c;10&#x201d; state. For example, the cell resistance in the &#x201c;11&#x201d; state may, for example, be in the 1.0M to 5.0M&#x3a9; range. A specific non-limiting example of the cell resistance in the &#x201c;11&#x201d; state is about 2.8M&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As can be seen with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2dc;3D</figref>, the multi-bit data states of the memory cell are defined by a contiguous increase in size of the programmable high-resistance amorphous volume within the first and second programmable volumes <b>144</b> and <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An example of a portion of a memory cell array according to one or more inventive concepts described herein will be described next with reference to the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the aperture <b>121</b> of the insulating layer <b>120</b> is filled with a conductive material forming a bit line BL<b>0</b>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an insulating layer <b>130</b> is deposited on the insulating layer <b>120</b>, and an aperture <b>131</b> is formed within the insulating layer <b>130</b> so as to expose an upper surface of the bit line BL<b>0</b>. The insulating layer <b>130</b> may, for example, be a silicon oxide layer, and the aperture <b>131</b> may, for example, be formed by masked etching of the insulating layer <b>120</b>. In this example, the aperture <b>131</b> is substantially circular in a plane parallel to an upper surface of the substrate <b>100</b>, although other aperture configurations may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a diode Dp is formed within the aperture <b>131</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b>. The diode Dp may be formed of a polysilicon material having different dopants types layered therein, for example, a polysilicon N+ type layer stack over a polysilicon P-type layer <b>132</b>. The polysilicon material of the diode Dp may, for example, be formed by SEG of the silicon-containing bit line BL<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, an insulating layer <b>140</b> is deposited on the insulating layer <b>130</b>, and an aperture <b>141</b> is formed within the insulating layer <b>140</b> so as to expose an upper surface portion of the diode Dp. The insulating layer <b>140</b> may, for example, be a silicon oxide layer, and the aperture <b>141</b> may, for example, be formed by masked etching of the insulating layer <b>140</b>. The aperture <b>141</b> is then at least partially filled with a lower electrode material <b>142</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Non-limiting examples of the lower electrode material <b>142</b>&#x2032; include titanium, hafnium, zirconium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, aluminum, copper, tungsten titanium, and molybdenum, a binary metal nitride, e.g., titanium nitride, hafnium nitride, zirconium nitride, vanadium nitride, niobium nitride, tantalum nitride, tungsten nitride, and molybdenum nitride; a metal oxide such as iridium oxide and ruthenium oxide, a ternary metal nitride, e.g., titanium carbon nitride, tantalum carbon nitride, titanium silicon nitride, tantalum silicon nitride, titanium aluminum nitride, tantalum aluminum nitride, titanium boron nitride, zirconium silicon nitride, tungsten silicon nitride, tungsten boron nitride, zirconium aluminum nitride, molybdenum silicon nitride, molybdenum aluminum nitride, tantalum oxide nitride, titanium oxide nitride, and tungsten oxide nitride, silicon, or a combination of the above. In the example of this embodiment, the lower electrode material <b>142</b>&#x2032; is titanium nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As depicted in the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the lower electrode material <b>142</b>&#x2032; material protrudes to a given height (within the aperture <b>141</b>) above the diode Dp. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, a blanket anisotropic etching process may then be carried out in order to remove a portion of the lower electrode material <b>142</b>&#x2032; and thus create an opening <b>143</b> within the aperture <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a first phase-change material layer <b>144</b>&#x2032; is then deposited to fill the opening <b>143</b> and to cover an upper surface of the insulating layer <b>140</b>. As suggested previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a non-limiting example of the first phase-change material layer <b>144</b>&#x2032; is SbTe. The deposition method for the phase-change material layer <b>144</b>&#x2032; is not limited, and examples include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, a first phase change material pattern is formed by planarization or blanket etching of the phase-change material layer <b>144</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). As a result, a top surface of the insulating layer <b>140</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, a second phase-change material layer <b>152</b>&#x2032; is deposited over the insulating layer <b>140</b>. Again, the deposition technique is not limited, and examples in CVD, PVD and ALD.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As suggested previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the second phase-change material layer <b>152</b>&#x2032; is formed of a different phase-change material than that of the first phase-change material pattern <b>144</b>. In particular, in this embodiment, the phase-change material layer <b>152</b>&#x2032; has a higher resistance in an amorphous state then the phase-change material of the first phase-change material pattern <b>144</b>. Non-limiting examples of the phase-change material of the second programmable material layer <b>152</b>&#x2032; include GeSbTe, BeBiTe, C-doped BeSbTe and N-doped GeSbTe.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Still referencing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, a conductive layer <b>154</b>&#x2032; is formed on the second phase-change material layer <b>152</b>&#x2032;. Material examples of the conductive layer <b>154</b>&#x2032; are the same as those listed previously in connection with the lower electrode <b>142</b>. In the example of this embodiment, the conductive layer <b>154</b>&#x2032; includes one or more layers of Ti and/or TiN.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, in the example of this embodiment the conductive layer <b>154</b>&#x2032; and the second phase-change material layer <b>152</b>&#x2032; are patterned using a common mask to form the phase change material pattern <b>152</b> and the top electrode <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As one skilled in the art will appreciate, the fabrication method described above may be subjected to a number of different variations. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a technique in which the second phase-change material pattern <b>152</b> is formed by filling an aperture in an upper insulating layer <b>150</b>, and thereafter the upper electrode <b>154</b> is formed by deposition and patterning over the second phase-change material pattern <b>152</b>. In this case, the phase-change material pattern <b>152</b> may, for example, be formed by deposition followed by planarization and/or blanket etching.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition to variations in fabrication, one skilled in the art will also appreciate that structural variations are available as well. Non-limiting examples of such variations in structure are described next with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17&#x2dc;20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which the aperture in the upper insulating layer <b>150</b> is narrower at the opening in the lower surface <b>150</b><i>a </i>thereof than at the upper surface <b>150</b><i>b </i>thereof. As a result, the second phase-change material pattern <b>254</b> exhibits a tapered or trapezoidal profile in which a lower width W<b>3</b> is less than upper width W<b>4</b>. This embodiment may be effective in increasing a difference in cell resistance between the D<b>10</b> and D<b>11</b> states described previously in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A&#x2dc;3D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> illustrate examples in which the basic shape of the second phase-change material pattern is altered.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">That is, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the second phase-change material pattern <b>352</b> has a U-shaped configuration which includes a bottom wall <b>352</b><i>c</i>, and opposite sidewalls <b>352</b><i>a </i>and <b>352</b><i>b </i>extending upwardly from the bottom wall <b>352</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, reference numbers <b>452</b> and <b>453</b> denote first and second upper phase-change material patterns and reference numbers <b>154</b> and <b>155</b> denote corresponding upper electrodes. This figure is representative of three variations from the previous embodiments, each independent of the other. First, the upper phase-change material patterns <b>452</b> and <b>453</b> are not centrally aligned over the corresponding lower first phase-change material patterns <b>144</b>. Second, the shape of the second phase-change material patterns <b>452</b> and <b>453</b> is not symmetrical about an axis normal to the surface of the substrate <b>110</b>. Third, the first upper phase-change material pattern <b>452</b> is effectively configured as a mirror image of the second upper phase-change material pattern <b>453</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates yet another variation in which one of the phase-change material patterns includes two sections of phase-change material. Namely, a first phase-change material pattern includes a first phase-change material section <b>144</b> stacked over the lower electrode <b>142</b>, and a second phase-change material second <b>146</b> stacked over the first phase-change material section <b>144</b>. Further, a second phase-change material pattern <b>552</b> is stacked over the second phase change material section <b>146</b>. Also, in this example, a width of the second phase change material section <b>146</b> is greater than that of the first phase-change material section <b>144</b>, and a width of the second phase-change material pattern <b>552</b> is greater than that of the second phase-change material section <b>146</b>. Further, in this example, a resistance in an amorphous state of the second phase-change material section <b>146</b> is greater than a resistance in an amorphous state of the first phase-change material section <b>144</b>, and a resistance in an amorphous state of the second phase-change material pattern <b>552</b> is greater than a resistance in an amorphous state of the second phase-change material section <b>146</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, the phase-change memory cell includes a first phase-change material pattern having a lower amorphous resistance that a second phase-change material pattern.
