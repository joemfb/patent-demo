<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Data processing systems and methods are disclosed for providing a payment using a Web service. In one implementation, a first computer is used for entry of data values into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form. Further, an identifier of the Web service, such as the uniform resource locator (URL) of the Web service, is entered into the first computer. Next, the first computer initiates data processing for providing the payment that is to be performed by a second computer on the basis of the data values entered into the electronic data entry form. The initiation and/or performance or completion of the data processing is signaled to the Web service by sending corresponding signaling data, which includes payment advice data of the payment. The Web service is coupled to a third computer that receives a result of the data processing from the second computer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to the field of data processing systems and related methods. More particularly, the invention relates to systems and methods for processing data in a Web service environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Web services are an emerging technology and offer the dual promise of simplicity and pervasiveness. Web services represent the next level of function and efficiency in e-business. A Web service may be viewed as any mechanism by which an application or data processing service may be provided to other applications on the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Web services may be informational or transactional. That is, some services provide information of interest to the requestor, while other services may actually lead to the invocation of business procedures. Examples of publicly available Web services today include stock quote services, services to retrieve news from Web news sources, and currency conversion services. By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,604,135 discloses a method and system for location-based Web services.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For more detailed information on Web services and technologies related thereto, reference is made to pages or documents on the websites of Microsoft Germany, W3.orq, and n.ethz.ch.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of Web services are the services responsive to simple object access protocol (SOAP) messages. SOAP is an application invocation protocol that defines a protocol for exchanging information encoded as XML messages. Normally, these services are described by WSDL (Web Service Description Language) notation stored in WSDL documents. A WSDL document may be stored in numerous ways such as in a file, in a DB2 XML registry/repository, or in a DB2 based UDDI registry, for example. UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, Integration) is a protocol for describing Web services such that interested parties may easily discover them. Specifications for this registry and use of WSDL in the registry are available at uddi.org. Service providers may register their services in a UDDI, specifying technical information about how to invoke the service. Often a WSDL document is stored in a UDDI registry in order to define the messages a particular Web service accepts and generates.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The design of UDDI allows enterprises that own Web service enabled applications to publish data about themselves and their services. By providing this information, UDDI implements a simplified form of searching for those interested in locating a particular Web service in which to fulfill an application process. The conventional UDDI search is focused on single search criteria, such as business name, business location, business categories, business identifier, service type by name, and/or discovery URL (Uniform Resource Locator).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various approaches for implementing Web services are known, such as described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2003/0093436A1, 2003/0055868A1, 2003/0055624A1, 2003/0018661A1, 2003/0110242A1, 2003/0163513A1, 2004/0064503A1, 2004/0045005A1, 2004/0003130A1, and 2003/0187841A1.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is a common disadvantage of conventional Web services that they usually require some degree of manual user interaction. Manual user interaction is tedious and error prone. Another disadvantage of manual interaction is that data, which is already available in electronic form, needs to be manually re-entered into the Web service. In particular, the level of manual interaction and monitoring required by known Web services is costly in terms of the required human resources.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, data processing systems and methods are disclosed for providing a payment using a Web service. A first computer is used for entry of data values into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form. Further, an identifier of the Web service, such as the uniform resource locator (URL) of the Web service is entered into the first computer. Next, the first computer initiates a data processing step for providing the payment that is to be performed by a second computer on the basis of the data values entered into the electronic data entry form. Alternatively, the data processing step is not to be performed by the second computer, but by the first computer or another component coupled to the first computer. The initiation and/or performance or completion of the data processing step is signaled to the Web service by sending of corresponding signaling data. The signaling data has payment advice data of the payment. The Web service is coupled to a third computer that receives a result of the data processing step from the second computer, e.g., in the form of an XML data stream.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One advantage of embodiments of the invention is that the third computer may be pre-warned regarding reception of the payment data resulting from the data processing step performed by the first or second computer. For example, the third computer may periodically query the Web service for signaling data that has been received by the Web service. Alternatively, the Web service may implement a push service for pushing information to the third computer in response to receipt of the signaling data. The signaling data that the third computer receives from the Web service may be used in various ways for controlling the data processing performed by the third computer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another embodiment, the payment advice data contains the incoming payment details required for assigning and clearing the relevant open item. Typically, payment advice data contains the payment amount, payment date, and other information about the payment. The payment advice data also includes advice data items that contain information on the paid items. They may also further contain information used for identification purposes, such as document number, reference number, billing document number, customer reference number, and so on. The payment advice data may be used during payment clearing to search for and assign open items automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention may avoid a need for transmission of payment advice notes from a payer to a payee by means of regular mail, e-mail, or by fax. Conventional transmission methods have the disadvantage that the data contained on the payment advice notes must be manually re-entered into the payee's financial computer system. An advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that such additional error prone and tedious manual interaction may be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also known from conventional solutions to transmit payment advice notes by means of an electronic message, such as EDIFACT. One of the problems associated with this is that the payer needs to know the exact address of the processing entity of the financial processing system of the payee, which is to receive the payment advice note in order to enable automatic processing. An advantage of embodiments of the present invention is that as the payer computer system does not need to be aware of the exact format used by that processing entity of the payee's financial computer processing system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, payment advice data is not only received for incoming payments, but also for outgoing payments. When a direct debiting procedure is used, the payment is initiated by the payee computer rather than by the payer computer. In this instance, payment advice notes are provided from the payee computer to the payer computer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Web service may be an integral part of the third computer. In this instance, the third computer has a Web services interface for receiving signaling data in accordance with the HTTP request-response protocol and an internal interface to a data processing and/or control application for synchronous or asynchronous further processing of the signaling data. Alternatively, the Web service may be implemented as an integral part of the first computer or the second computer. In this instance, the first or the second computer has an internal interface for providing signaling data to the Web service and the third computer has an external interface for receiving the data from the Web service, e.g., in accordance with the HTTP request-response protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the Web service is implemented on a separate Web-server computer that is loosely or closely coupled to the first, second, or third computer system. For example, the Web service stores the signaling data that is addressed to the third computer in a data file. The resultant data file with the accumulated signaling data is forwarded from the Web service to the third computer periodically, for example, when the size of the file has reached a predetermined limit or at scheduled time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Depending on the implementation, the Web service may be operated by the initiator of the data processing step, e.g., the payer's computer, or by the executor of the data processing step, e.g., the bank's computer, or by the recipient of the result of the data processing step, e.g., the payee's computer. In any case, the signaling data is transmitted to the Web services for reference by the third computer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention, the Web service is implemented as a hub and collects signaling data for a plurality of third computer systems. In this instance, the signaling data may be advantageously stored in a database of the Web-server using a unique identifier of the third computer to which the signaling data is addressed as a database key. The database is queried periodically for new signaling data that has been received for a given third computer in order to forward the new signaling data to the third computer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the invention may be utilized in different fields of application, such as financial transactions. For example, when a customer receives an invoice from a service provider, the invoice may be received by the customer in paper form or in electronic form, such as in the form of an XML document. The payment data is manually or automatically entered into the customer's computer for initiation of the payment procedure, and after completion of the data entry into the online payment transaction form, the payment data is transmitted to a second computer for execution of the payment. For example, the second computer may be a computer of the customer's bank.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The result of the data processing step performed by the bank's computer, i.e., the execution of the payment, is transmitted as corresponding payment data to the third computer, i.e., a computer of the payee. When the payment procedure is initiated the customer's computer and/or the bank's computer sends signaling data comprising payment advice data to the Web service that is coupled to the payee's computer. Alternatively, the customer mails a paper form for ordering payment from his or her account to his or her bank. In this instance, the payment order data is entered into the bank's computer that takes the role of the first computer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By way of example, the planned execution date of the payment procedure may be communicated to the Web service in order to announce the pre-scheduled payment. This has the advantage that the payee's computer may receive an early warning regarding the scheduled payment procedure, such that sending of an unnecessary payment reminder may be avoided. Another advantage is that the scheduled payment may be entered into the payee computer's financial planning system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As a consequence, the payee's computer is pre-warned that payment of an open invoice is imminent. This information may be used by the payee's computer to avoid sending unnecessary payment reminders, for the purpose of financial planning and/or other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the data values that are entered into the electronic data entry form provided by the first computer are received in electronic form, such as by means of an XML document. Further, the identifier of the Web service is also received in electronic form by the first computer. In addition to the identification of the Web service, the XML document may also comprise the WSDL (Web service description language) description of the identified Web service. It is to be noted that WSDL and UDDI are as such known and standardized, as is demonstrated by pages or documents on the websites of Microsoft Germany, W3.org, and n.ethz.ch.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, the signaling data for signaling initiation of the data processing step is directly sent from the first computer to the Web service. Alternatively, the signaling data is sent from the second computer to the Web service.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the signaling data comprises an identifier of the second computer. The signaling data is stored in the database provided by the Web service using the identifier of the third computer as a key. The third computer may periodically query the Web services database in order to check if signaling data has been received and stored in the database. This may be implemented both as a push or a pull service of the Web service.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is to be noted that a database is not necessary for most applications. Rather, the signaling data is stored in a data file by the Web service. The data file with the accumulated signaling data is transmitted, e.g., after pre-scheduled time intervals to the third computer.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, the signaling data comprises a time stamp that indicates the time when the data processing step for providing the payment has been initiated or performed. The time information may be used as an additional control parameter by the third computer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, a computer network, such as the Internet, an intranet, or an extranet, provides the communication means for operatively coupling the first, second, and third computers as well as the Web service to the third computer.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with still another embodiment of the invention, the XML document is received by the first computer from the third computer. The XML document comprises data values and mark-up data being descriptive of the assignment of the data values to respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form and an identifier of a Web service. The data values are read by the first computer and they are entered into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form identified by the mark-up data.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, a data processing step is initialized on the basis of the data values entered into the electronic data entry form by the first computer and the data processing step is performed using a second computer. The reading of the data values and entering the data values into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form may be performed as a result of a drag and drop action executed in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment. Then, the result of the data processing step is sent to the third computer by the second computer, and the signaling data is sent by the first computer to the Web service.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, XML document includes a control parameter utilized for execution of said data processing step and the identifier of the Web service is an Uniform Resource Locator (URL), wherein each signaling data further comprises at least one of the data values, a time stamp identifying a date and time when at least one of the data values is sent, and an identifier identifying the sender computer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with an additional embodiment of the invention, data processing includes an account payment procedure and the account payment procedure includes a rebate feature.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, an invoice is received in an electronic form, such as by means of an XML document. The XML document contains data that specifies one or more payments to be provided from the payer to the payee. In addition, the XML document may contain a link to a Web service provided by the payee for collection of payment advice data. The payment procedure and the sending of the payment advice data are initiated by the user by performing a drag-and-drop operation on the XML document.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the user selects the XML document and positions the XML document on an icon of the online banking software of his or hers first computer. This invokes the online banking software of the user's first computer. The online banking software automatically reads the data from the XML document that specifies the one or more payments to be provided to the payee as well as the link to the Web service.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On this basis, the online banking software generates an electronic payment order that is sent to the computer of the payer's bank, i.e., the second computer. In addition, the online banking software uses at least a sub-set of the data contained in the XML document and/or additional data as payment advice data and sends the payment advice data as signaling data to the Web service as identified by the link.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively or in addition, the online banking software includes the link of the Web service in the payment order that is transmitted to the computer of the payer's bank, such that the computer of the payer's bank may send the signaling data with the payment advice data to the Web service provided by the payee.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of embodiments of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary data processing system for providing a payment from a payer to a payee. The payer includes a first computer <b>104</b> that is coupled to a second computer <b>106</b> via a network <b>103</b>. The second computer <b>106</b> may comprise the computer of the payer's bank in the example considered here.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The payee has third computer <b>100</b> that is closely or loosely coupled to a Web service <b>108</b>. In the embodiment considered here, the Web service <b>108</b> is coupled to third computer <b>100</b> by means of network <b>103</b>. Web service <b>108</b> serves for collecting signaling data <b>132</b> comprising payment advice data of payments that have been initiated from the first computer <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First computer <b>104</b> serves for entry of data specifying one or more payments to be provided from the payer to the payee. The data entry may be performed manually, automatically or semi-automatically. In the embodiment considered here, first computer <b>104</b> may receive an XML document <b>102</b> that carries the data specifying the one or more payments to be provided from the payer to the payee.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The XML document <b>102</b> may be received on a data carrier, by email, or by means of another transmission channel from the third computer <b>100</b> of the payee or another entity that is used by the payee for its billing procedure. In the example considered here, the XML document <b>102</b> is transmitted from the payee's third computer <b>100</b> to the first computer <b>104</b> of the payer via network <b>103</b>. The network <b>103</b> may be any communication or computer network, such as the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The first computer <b>104</b> includes a processor <b>125</b> and a program <b>127</b>, which further comprises a reading module <b>120</b> and an initiation module <b>124</b>. The reading module <b>120</b> serves to capture data values <b>110</b> included in the XML document <b>102</b> and to enter these data values into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form <b>122</b>, identified by the mark-up data <b>112</b>. The initiation module <b>124</b> serves to invoke the second computer <b>106</b> in order to begin the data processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The XML document <b>102</b> comprises a set of data values <b>110</b> specifying the payment to be provided to the payee, and the mark-up data <b>112</b> being descriptive of the assignment of data values to data entry fields of an electronic data entry form.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The second computer <b>106</b> includes a processor <b>107</b> and a program <b>109</b>. The program <b>107</b> has a data processing module <b>111</b> responsible for processing of the data values <b>110</b>. When the second computer completes the data processing step, it sends the result <b>130</b> of the data processing step to the third computer <b>100</b> over the network <b>103</b>. Also, signaling data <b>132</b> is sent by the first computer <b>104</b> to the Web service <b>108</b>. The signaling data <b>132</b> comprises the payment advice data of the initiated payment. For example, at least a sub-set of the data values <b>110</b> and/or other information is used as payment advice data that is transmitted as signaling data <b>132</b> to the Web service. The other information contained in the payment advice data may be a time stamp indicating when the payment procedure has been initiated. Alternatively, the data processing step is not performed by the second computer but by the first computer.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In operation, the XML document <b>102</b> is received by the first computer <b>104</b> from the third computer <b>100</b>. The processor <b>125</b> executes the program <b>127</b>, which in turn starts the reading of data values <b>110</b> contained in the XML document <b>102</b>. Then, the data values are entered automatically into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form <b>122</b> identified by the mark-up data <b>112</b>. The capture of data values into the data fields of the electronic data form is accomplished by the utilization of reading module <b>120</b> allowing automatic capture of data values into the plurality of fields of an electronic data entry form <b>122</b>. Alternatively, the data is entered manually, in whole or in part.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Next, the program <b>127</b>, having an initiation module <b>124</b>, starts the data processing step by invoking the second computer <b>106</b>. The second computer's processor <b>107</b> executes the program <b>109</b> having a data processing module <b>111</b>, which on the basis of the data values entered into the electronic data entry form by the first computer, performs the data processing step, ending in the result <b>130</b> being sent to the third computer <b>100</b> over the network <b>103</b>. The result <b>130</b> is the payment amount provided from the payer to the payee.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Simultaneously, the first computer <b>104</b> may send the signalling data <b>132</b> to the Web service <b>108</b>, where the signaling data is stored in the database of the Web service <b>108</b>. The signaling data is then further utilized for the controlling of the processing of the result <b>130</b> by the third computer <b>100</b> where the processor <b>136</b> executes the program <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It is to be noted that the signaling data <b>132</b> may also be transmitted from the second computer <b>106</b> to Web service <b>108</b> via network <b>103</b>. Further, it is to be noted that XML document <b>102</b> may be provided by a fourth computer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In other words, the source of the XML document <b>102</b> and the receiver of result <b>130</b> do not need to be identical. In fact, the third and fourth computers may belong to different organizational entities.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, it is to be noted that it is not essential that the data values <b>110</b> are received in an electronic form. Embodiments of the present invention are also applicable when the data values are received in paper form for manual entry into the electronic data entry form <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another exemplary data processor system for providing a payment in a Web-based service environment. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> constitutes a logical continuation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where like elements are referenced by like reference numbers having added <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a third computer <b>200</b>, including a processor <b>236</b>, a program <b>238</b>, and a plurality of modules <b>240</b> to <b>244</b> is provided. The third computer <b>200</b> transmits an XML document <b>202</b> to a first computer <b>204</b>. The XML document may comprise a control parameter <b>216</b>, an identifier of the Web service (URL) <b>214</b>, a set of data values <b>210</b>, and mark-up data <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Alternatively, the document is received in ordinary paper form by a user of the first computer <b>204</b>. In this case, the user needs to scan the paper form or to manually enter the data values into the electronic form provided by the first computer <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The first computer <b>204</b> includes a processor <b>225</b> and the program modules <b>227</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>224</b>. The program module <b>227</b> has a reading module <b>220</b> that captures the data values <b>210</b> and allows them to be entered into respective data entry fields including the compulsory fields of an electronic data entry form <b>222</b>. The initiation module <b>224</b> serves to execute a data processing step on the basis of the data values <b>210</b> entered into the electronic data entry form <b>222</b> by the first computer <b>204</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Payment receiver <b>400</b> includes a processor <b>436</b>, a program <b>438</b> which comprises timer module <b>440</b>, accounts receivable module <b>442</b>, and reminder module <b>444</b>. Processor <b>436</b> serves to execute program modules <b>440</b>, <b>442</b>, and <b>444</b>. Program module <b>438</b> comprises an account receivable module <b>442</b> for processing of payment <b>430</b>. The payment receiver <b>400</b> sends payment request <b>402</b> utilizing a network <b>403</b> to a payment request receiver <b>404</b>. The payment request <b>402</b> comprises control parameter <b>416</b>, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) <b>414</b>, data values <b>410</b>, and mark-up data <b>412</b>. The mark-up data <b>412</b> being descriptive of the assignment of data values to their data entry fields of an electronic data entry form. Alternatively, payment request <b>402</b> is received in the form of a paper document. It is not essential that payment request <b>402</b> be received in electronic form.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In accordance with one embodiment, the first computer is a payment request receiver <b>404</b> comprising an interface <b>418</b>, a processor <b>425</b>, a program <b>427</b>, an initiation module <b>424</b>, and a reading module <b>420</b>. The payment request receiver <b>404</b> further comprises an electronic data entry form <b>422</b> with the plurality of data entry fields <b>423</b>, a graphical user interface <b>428</b>, a drag and drop functionality <b>426</b>, and a function <b>429</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">An interface <b>418</b> recognizes the format of the payment request <b>402</b>. The format contains such payment information as credit organization, bank connection, and the amount of the total payment. The processor <b>425</b> serves to execute the program modules <b>424</b> and <b>420</b>. The initiation module <b>424</b> initiates a data processing step on the basis of the data values entered into the electronic data entry form <b>422</b> by the first computer, in this case a payment request receiver <b>404</b>. The performance of the data processing step takes place using a second computer, in this embodiment the second computer being a bank computer <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Program module <b>427</b> includes a reading module <b>420</b>, which serves to capture the data values and enter them into respective data entry fields of an electronic data entry form <b>422</b>. The electronic data entry form has a plurality of data entry fields <b>423</b>. Program module <b>427</b> serves also to execute the function <b>429</b>, which allows on the base of format, to automatically fill out an electronic data entry form <b>422</b>. The reading of data values <b>410</b> and entering the data values <b>410</b> into respective data entry fields <b>423</b> of an electronic data entry form <b>422</b> is performed in a response to drag and drop functionality <b>426</b> used in a graphical user interface environment <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Bank computer <b>406</b> includes a processor <b>407</b>, which serves to execute program modules <b>409</b> and <b>411</b>. Program module <b>409</b> includes a payment processing module <b>411</b>, which performs an operation resulting in sending the payment <b>430</b> to the payment receiver <b>400</b>. The payment request receiver <b>404</b> or the bank computer <b>406</b> sends the signaling data <b>432</b> to the Web service <b>408</b> utilizing a network <b>403</b>. Each signaling data <b>432</b> comprises, e.g., at least one of the data values <b>410</b>, a time stamp <b>435</b> identifying a date and/or a time when at least one of the data values is sent, and an identifier <b>434</b> identifying the payment receiver <b>400</b>. Signaling data <b>432</b> may be stored in a database <b>405</b> of a Web service <b>408</b> in order to be used for controlling the processing of a payment <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In operation, payment receiver <b>400</b> sends payment request <b>402</b> to the payment request receiver <b>404</b> utilizing the network <b>403</b>. When the payment request receiver <b>404</b> receives a payment request <b>402</b> comprising an URL, a control parameter <b>416</b>, utilized for execution of payment processing step, and the mark-up data <b>412</b> being descriptive of the assignment of data values to data entry fields <b>423</b>, the reading of the data values <b>410</b> and entering of the data values <b>410</b> into respective data entry fields <b>423</b> takes place. The control parameter <b>416</b> provides a rule that is executed by the payment request receiver <b>404</b> in order to determine the payment amount. For example, the rule allows a discount of three (3) percent if the payment is performed within a week.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the payment processing step is initiated on the basis of the data values entered with the help of initiation module <b>424</b> which invokes the bank computer <b>406</b> to start payment processing. The automatic filling out of electronic data entry form <b>422</b> takes place when the user using graphical user interface <b>428</b> drags and drops the icon of payment request <b>402</b> into the online banking software. The program <b>427</b> then executes the function <b>429</b>, which allows on the basis of the format of the payment request <b>402</b> to automatically fill out the electronic data entry form <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Subsequently, the processor <b>407</b> of the bank computer <b>406</b> executes the program <b>409</b>, which includes a payment processing module <b>411</b> that completes the payment processing step and sends the payment <b>430</b> to the payment receiver <b>400</b> utilizing the network <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the next step, the payment request receiver <b>404</b> sends signaling data comprising at least one of the data values <b>410</b>, a time stamp <b>435</b> identifying a date and the time when at least one of the data values is sent to the database <b>405</b> of a Web service <b>408</b>, and a sender identifier <b>434</b> as payment advice data. The signaling data <b>432</b> also communicates the control parameter <b>416</b> with the respective rules containing information about the rebate amount to the Web Service. Subsequently, the signaling data <b>432</b> is stored in a database <b>405</b>, in order to be used for controlling of the processing of a payment by accounts receivable <b>442</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Alternatively to sending the signaling data after completion of the payment processing step, the signaling data is already sent when the order for performance of the payment processing step is generated or sent to the bank computer <b>406</b> by request receiver <b>404</b> or when the order is received by bank computer <b>406</b>. In this instance, the signaling data includes the date of the planned payment.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the reminder module <b>444</b> determines that the payment <b>430</b> is overdue, instead of sending the reminder right away, it attempts to find out if payment was initiated on the basis of the signaling data <b>432</b>. For example, the reminder module <b>444</b> downloads the most up-to-date signaling date <b>432</b> from the Web service <b>408</b>. If accounts receivable module <b>442</b> determines that the downloaded signaling data contains the information that the payment <b>430</b> was initiated, the reminder module invokes a timer module <b>440</b>, which is set for the predetermined amount of time to allow for the processing. However, if the predetermined amount of time expires and the payment still does not arrive, the reminder module <b>444</b> initiates sending a reminder.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Utilizing the signaling data <b>432</b>, which also communicates the control parameter <b>416</b> with the rules governing the payment amount, allows the incorporation of a rebate feature in the account payment procedure allowing different amount of a discount, for example, 3%, 5%, or 10% based on the amount of time that passes until the actual payment <b>430</b> is received.</p>
