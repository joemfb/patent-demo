<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A display includes: a display section; and a supporting section including a post and a base and supporting the display section. The post includes: a tubular upper post extending in a direction perpendicular to a horizontal plane; a tubular lower post separated from the upper post at a separating plane tilted with respect to the horizontal plane and having a variable mounting angle with respect to the upper post by rotating around a central line of the upper post on the separating plane; and a tilt mechanism disposed on a side opposite to the separating plane of the upper post and changing a tilt angle in an elevation direction of the display section. A tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane of the separating plane satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is a maximum tilt angle of the display section by the tilt mechanism.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2010-214274 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Sept. 24, 2010, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present technology relates to a display such as a television.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Liquid crystal displays allowed to be installed on both of a wall and a table with use of a common component have been proposed (for example, refer to Japanese Utility Model Registration No. 3068198).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, to convert such a liquid crystal display in related art from wall-mount installation to desktop installation, and vice versa, there is an issue that it is necessary to disassemble and reassemble a base, thereby complicating work.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is desirable to provide a display which is convertible between wall-mount installation and desktop installation by simple work.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment of the technology, there is provided a display including: a display section; and a supporting section including a post and a base and supporting the display section, in which the post includes: a tubular upper post extending in a direction perpendicular to a horizontal plane; a tubular lower post separated from the upper post at a separating plane tilted with respect to the horizontal plane and having a variable mounting angle with respect to the upper post by rotating around a central line of the upper post on the separating plane; and a tilt mechanism disposed on a side opposite to the separating plane of the upper post and changing a tilt angle in an elevation direction of the display section, and a tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane of the separating plane satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is a maximum tilt angle of the display section by the tilt mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The display according to the embodiment of the technology is convertible between wall-mount installation and desktop installation by rotating the lower post around the central line of the upper post on the separating plane to change a mounting angle with respect to the upper post of the lower post. Moreover, the tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane of the separating plane satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is the maximum tilt angle of the display section by the tilt mechanism; therefore, while the display section is tilted at the tilt angle &#x3b8; by the tilt mechanism in desktop installation, the tilt angle of the display section is 0&#xb0; in wall-mount installation. Therefore, when the display is converted from desktop installation to wall-mount installation, and vice versa, it is not necessary to adjust the tilt angle of the display section by the tilt mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the display according to the embodiment of the technology, the post is separated into the upper post and the lower post at the separating plane tilted with respect to the horizontal plane, and the mounting angle with respect to the upper post of the lower post is variable, and the tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane of the separating plane satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is the maximum tilt angle of the display section by the tilt mechanism. Therefore, the display is convertible between wall-mount installation and desktop installation by simple work.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary, and are intended to provide further explanation of the technology as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A preferred embodiment of the technology will be described in detail below referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an appearance of a display (television) according to an embodiment of the technology when viewed from a back side thereof. A display <b>1</b> has, for example, a configuration in which a display section <b>2</b> for image display is supported by a supporting section <b>3</b>. The display section <b>2</b> is a flat display panel using a display element such as a liquid crystal, plasma, organic EL, inorganic EL, electrodeposition or electrochromic display element. The supporting section <b>3</b> is disposed on a back surface of the display section <b>2</b> by a connection member <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an enlarged view of the supporting section <b>3</b> and the connection member <b>4</b>. The supporting section <b>3</b> includes a cylindrical post (neck) <b>3</b>A. An end (a lower end) of the post <b>3</b>A is fixed to a flat base <b>3</b>B. The connection member <b>4</b> is mounted at the other end (an upper end) of the post <b>3</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> illustrate sectional configurations of the post <b>3</b>A taken along a plane including a central line CL<b>3</b>A thereof. The post <b>3</b>A includes, for example, a tilt mechanism <b>10</b>, a swivel mechanism <b>20</b>, an upper post <b>30</b> and a lower post <b>40</b> in order from the top. The upper post <b>30</b> and the lower post <b>40</b> are separated from each other at a separating plane <b>50</b>, and are connected together by a screw <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The tilt mechanism <b>10</b> is disposed on a side opposite to the separating plane <b>50</b> of the upper post <b>30</b> to change a tilt angle in an elevation direction of the display section <b>2</b>. In other words, the display <b>1</b> is allowed to be changed, by the tilt mechanism <b>30</b>, from an initial state S<b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where the display section <b>2</b> is tilted backward at a maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; with respect to a horizontal plane H to a forward tilt state S<b>2</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, where the display section <b>2</b> is perpendicular (at a tilt angle of 0&#xb0;) to the horizontal plane H by being tilted forward as indicated by an arrow At. For example, the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the display section <b>2</b> by the tilt mechanism <b>10</b> is preferably approximately 6&#xb0;. The tilt angle of the display section <b>2</b> may be changed between two angles, that is, the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; and 0&#xb0;, or may be continuously variable (between the two angles).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tilt mechanism <b>10</b> includes a tilt plate <b>11</b>, two tilt brackets <b>12</b> with a L-shaped sectional surface and two tilt bases <b>13</b> with a L-shaped sectional surface in order from the top. Surfaces in a lateral direction of the tilt brackets <b>12</b> are fixed to the tilt plate <b>11</b>. Surfaces in a longitudinal direction of the tilt bases <b>13</b> are sandwiched between surfaces in a longitudinal direction of the tilt brackets <b>12</b>. A tilt shaft <b>16</b> penetrates through surfaces in the longitudinal direction of the tilt brackets <b>12</b> and the surfaces in the longitudinal direction of the tilt bases <b>13</b> with a tilt washer <b>14</b> and a wave washer <b>15</b> in between. Surfaces in the lateral direction of the tilt bases <b>13</b> are connected to an upper swivel plate <b>21</b> which will be described later of the swivel mechanism <b>20</b>. Therefore, the tilt mechanism <b>10</b> is laterally rotatable with the display section <b>2</b> by the swivel mechanism <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The swivel mechanism <b>20</b> is disposed between the upper post <b>30</b> and the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>, and as indicated by an arrow As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the swivel mechanism <b>20</b> changes a rotation angle in a lateral direction of the display section <b>2</b>. The swivel mechanism <b>20</b> has, for example, a configuration in which a ring-shaped upper swivel plate <b>21</b> and a lower swivel plate <b>22</b> with an inverted T-shaped sectional surface are fixed by a screw <b>24</b> with a washer <b>23</b> in between. The upper swivel plate <b>21</b> is a rotating component, and the lower swivel plate <b>22</b>, the washer <b>23</b> and the screw <b>24</b> are fixed components. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rotation amount of the upper swivel plate <b>21</b> (a swivel rotation angle of the display section <b>2</b>) is specified by a dowel <b>22</b>A disposed on an upper surface of the lower swivel plate <b>22</b> and an arc-shaped groove <b>21</b>A disposed on a lower surface of the upper swivel plate <b>21</b>. The lower swivel plate <b>22</b> is fixed to the upper post <b>30</b> by a screw (not illustrated). Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a dowel <b>22</b>B for positioning with respect to a groove <b>31</b> of the upper post <b>30</b> is disposed on a lower surface of the lower swivel plate <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The upper post <b>30</b> is a cylindrical member extending in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane H, and is formed by, for example, aluminum die casting. A screw hole <b>32</b> allowing the screw <b>51</b> to be threaded therethrough is disposed in the upper post <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lower post <b>40</b> is a cylindrical member formed by, for example, an aluminum die casting as in the case of the upper post <b>30</b>. Moreover, the lower post <b>40</b> is separated from the upper post <b>30</b> at the separating plane <b>50</b> which is a plane tilted with respect to the horizontal plane H, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the mounting angle with respect to the upper post <b>30</b> of the lower post <b>40</b> is variable by rotating around a central line CL of the upper post <b>30</b> on the separating plane <b>50</b>. The central line CL of the upper post <b>30</b> is a straight line which passes through an intersection of a central line CL<b>3</b>A of the post <b>3</b>A and the separating plane <b>50</b> and is perpendicular to the separating plane <b>50</b>. It is to be noted that a cutting plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is not a plane passing though the diameter of the post <b>3</b>A, but the cutting plane forms a sector shape with a central angle of smaller than 180&#xb0; when viewed from an end plane in a lengthwise direction of the post <b>3</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">More specifically, the lower post <b>40</b> rotates around the central line CL of the upper post <b>30</b> between a first position P<b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, where the upper post <b>30</b> and the lower post <b>40</b> form a straight line and a second position P<b>2</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, where the upper post <b>30</b> and the lower post <b>40</b> form a line bent at the separating plane <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the lower post <b>40</b> is at the first position P<b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the display <b>1</b> is allowed to be installed as desktop installation by mounting the base <b>3</b>B on the horizontal plane H. On the other hand, when the lower post <b>40</b> is at the second position P<b>2</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the display <b>1</b> is allowed to be used as wall-mount installation by mounting the base <b>3</b>B on a vertical plane V with use of a lock mechanism such as a pulley (not illustrated). Therefore, the supporting section <b>3</b> is allowed to be used as a so-called variable stand serving as both of a stand for mounting the display section <b>2</b> on the horizontal plane H and a wall-mount bracket for mounting the display section <b>2</b> on the vertical plane V perpendicular to the horizontal plane H.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>, a tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane H of the separating plane <b>50</b> satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is a maximum tilt angle of the display section <b>2</b> by the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>. For example, in the case where the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; of the display section <b>2</b> is 6&#xb0; as described above, the tilt angle &#x3b1; of the separating plane <b>50</b> is 42&#xb0;. Therefore, the display <b>1</b> is convertible between wall-mount installation and desktop installation by simple work.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">More specifically, a wall surface of an architectural structure is typically a vertical plane V perpendicular to a floor surface (the horizontal plane H); therefore, in the case where the tilt angle with respect to the horizontal plane H of the display section <b>2</b> is 0&#xb0;, when the tilt angle &#x3b1; of the separating plane <b>50</b> is 45&#xb0;, in wall-mount installation, the display section <b>2</b> is allowed to be parallel to the wall surface V. However, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the tilt angle &#x3b1; of the separating plane <b>50</b> is 45&#xb0; in the initial state S<b>1</b> where the display section <b>2</b> is tilted backward at the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; with respect to the horizontal plane H, even in wall-mount installation, the display section <b>2</b> is tilted backward at the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8;. Therefore, the display section <b>2</b> faces a ceiling, and to easily view a screen, it is necessary to execute an additional step of tilting the display section <b>2</b> to a direction parallel to the vertical plane V or to a downward direction with use of the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, in the case where the display section <b>2</b> in the initial state S<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is tilted backward at the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; with respect to the horizontal plane H by setting the tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane H of the separating plane <b>50</b> to &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2) as described above, when the display <b>1</b> is converted from desktop installation to wall-mount installation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the tilt of the display section <b>2</b> is corrected to allow the display section <b>2</b> to be parallel (at a tilt angle of 0&#xb0;) to the vertical plane (wall surface) V. The same applies in the case where the display <b>1</b> is converted back from wall-mount installation to desktop installation. Therefore, when the display <b>1</b> is converted from desktop installation to wall-mount installation, and vice versa, it is not necessary to adjust the tilt angle of the display section <b>2</b> with use of the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>, thereby improving convenience by work simplification.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the display section <b>2</b> is tilted forward at a maximum tilt angle &#x2212;&#x3b8; depending on a mounting position thereof to be changed to a forward tilt state S<b>2</b>, the screen is allowed to be viewed more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lower post <b>40</b> includes a recess <b>41</b> and a through hole <b>42</b> which both allow the screw <b>51</b> to be threaded therethrough in a position corresponding to the screw hole <b>32</b> of the upper post <b>30</b>. The through hole <b>42</b> has a screw portion <b>42</b>A in proximity to an inlet for the screw <b>51</b>, and a portion other than the screw portion <b>42</b>A is a free hole <b>42</b>B. Therefore, in the case where the screw <b>51</b> is loosened to change the mounting direction of the lower post <b>40</b>, the screw <b>51</b> is kept in the through hole <b>42</b> while being engaged in the screw portion <b>42</b>A. Therefore, the screw <b>51</b> is allowed to be tightened again in the screw hole <b>32</b> immediately after changing the mounting direction of the lower post <b>40</b>, thereby further simplifying work. Moreover, the screw <b>51</b> is less likely to fall from the through hole <b>42</b>, thereby preventing a drop, loss or the like of the screw <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is to be noted that a bottom plate <b>43</b> is mounted on a lower end of the lower post <b>40</b> by a screw <b>43</b>A. Moreover, a dowel <b>44</b> for temporary fixation to the base <b>3</b>B is disposed on the lower end of the lower post <b>40</b> to prevent the lower post <b>40</b> from falling over.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A tilt cover <b>61</b>, a central cover <b>62</b> and a lower cover <b>63</b> which are made of a metal or a resin are disposed on an external surface of the post <b>3</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>. The tilt mechanism <b>10</b> is contained in the tilt cover <b>61</b>. The swivel mechanism <b>20</b> and the upper post <b>30</b> are contained in the central cover <b>62</b>. The lower post <b>40</b> is coated with the lower cover <b>63</b>. The tilt cover <b>61</b> includes a clearance groove <b>61</b>A for preventing an interference with the central cover <b>62</b> in the case where the display section <b>2</b> is tilted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The connection member <b>4</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> connects the display section <b>2</b> to the supporting section <b>3</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the connection member <b>4</b> has a fixing section <b>4</b>A fixed to the display section and a hole <b>4</b>B allowing an upper end of the post <b>3</b>A to be contained therein and fixed thereto. In the fixing section <b>4</b>A, for example, screw holes <b>4</b>A<b>1</b> are disposed at, for example, three points. An upper end surface of the post <b>3</b>A is fixed to the hole <b>4</b>B by a screw <b>4</b>B<b>1</b> or the like. If necessary, cable holding sections <b>4</b>C for holding cables <b>70</b> may be disposed on both sides of the hole <b>4</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the display <b>1</b>, the screw <b>51</b> is loosened to loosen connection between the lower post <b>40</b> and the upper post <b>30</b>, and the lower post <b>40</b> rotates around the central line CL of the upper post <b>30</b> on the separating plane <b>50</b> to change the mounting angle with respect to the upper post <b>40</b>, and then the lower post <b>40</b> is fixed to the upper post <b>30</b> by the screw <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">More specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in the case where the lower post <b>40</b> is at the first position P<b>1</b> where the upper post <b>30</b> and the lower post <b>40</b> form a straight line, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the display <b>1</b> is allowed to be installed as desktop installation by mounting the base <b>3</b>B on the horizontal plane H. On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, in the case where the lower post is at the second position P<b>2</b> where the upper post <b>30</b> and the lower post <b>40</b> form a line bent at the separating plane <b>50</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the display <b>1</b> is allowed to be used as wall-mount installation by mounting the base <b>3</b>B on the vertical plane V with use of a lock mechanism such as a pulley (not illustrated). Thus, the supporting section <b>3</b> is allowed to be used as a so-called variable stand serving as both of a stand for mounting the display section <b>2</b> on the horizontal plane H and a wall-mount bracket for mounting the display section <b>2</b> on the vertical plane V perpendicular to the horizontal plane H.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, the tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane H of the separating plane <b>50</b> satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is the maximum tilt angle of the display section <b>2</b> by the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>; therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the display <b>1</b> is converted, in the initial state S<b>1</b> where the display section <b>2</b> is tilted backward at the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; with respect to the horizontal plane H, from the desktop installation to wall-mount installation, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the tilt of the display section <b>2</b> is corrected to be parallel (at a tilt angle of 0&#xb0;) to the wall surface V. On the other hand, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the display <b>1</b> is converted from wall-mount installation to desktop installation while the display section <b>2</b> is parallel (at a tilt angle of 0&#xb0;) to the wall surface V, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the display section <b>2</b> is changed to the initial state S<b>1</b> where the display section <b>2</b> is tilted backward at the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; with respect to the horizontal plane H. Accordingly, when the display <b>1</b> is converted from desktop installation to wall-mount installation, and vice versa, it is not necessary to adjust the tilt angle of the display section <b>2</b> with use of the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>, thereby simplifying work to improve convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, in the embodiment, the post <b>3</b>A is separated into the upper post <b>30</b> and the lower post <b>40</b> at a plane tilted with respect to the horizontal plane H, and the mounting angle with respect to the upper post <b>30</b> of the lower post <b>40</b> is variable, and the tilt angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal plane of the separating plane <b>50</b> satisfies &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;&#x2212;(&#x3b8;/2), where &#x3b8; is the maximum tilt angle of the display section <b>2</b> by the tilt mechanism <b>10</b>; therefore, the display <b>1</b> is convertible between wall-mount installation and desktop installation by simple work, and a variable stand with high convenience is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although the present technology is described referring to the above-described embodiment, the technology is not limited thereto, and may be variously modified. For example, in the above-described embodiment, the case where the maximum tilt angle &#x3b8; of the display section <b>2</b> is 6&#xb0; is described for ease of description; however, a tilt operation at any tilt angle &#x3b8; is achievable by the same mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Moreover, in the above-described embodiment, a flat television is described as the display <b>1</b>; however, the technology is not limited to televisions, and is applicable to any other electronic device such as a monitor for a personal computer, a display for a car navigation system or a digital photo frame. Further, the technology is widely applicable to a structure, such as a painting or a signboard, including a flat plate-like object-to-be-supported and a supporting section with a base and a post.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
