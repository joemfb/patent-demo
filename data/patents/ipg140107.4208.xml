<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to fixing devices for cooling systems, particularly to a cooling system of a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) of a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an electronic device, such as a computer, there are many peripheral component interconnects which generate heat when the electronic device operates. In designing an electronic device, cooling systems are used to dissipate heat generated by the peripheral component interconnects to prevent the peripheral component interconnects from failure from overheating. However, typical cooling system can not always efficiently cool all the peripheral component interconnects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electronic device <b>100</b>, such as a computer, includes a main board <b>10</b>, a peripheral component interconnect <b>20</b> (PCI), and a cooling system <b>30</b>. The main board <b>10</b> includes an interface <b>12</b> and a latching rib <b>14</b> opposite to the interface <b>12</b>. The PCI <b>20</b> is latched in the interface <b>12</b> and the cooling system <b>30</b> is secured on the latching rib <b>14</b> so the PCI <b>20</b> and the cooling system <b>30</b> are oppositely fixed on the main board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The cooling system <b>30</b> includes a fixing device <b>60</b> and two fans <b>90</b>. The fixing device <b>60</b> includes a fixing rack <b>62</b>, a latching rack <b>64</b> adjustably fixed to the fixing rack <b>62</b>, and two fasteners <b>66</b> fixing the latching rack <b>64</b> to the fixing rack <b>62</b>. The fans <b>90</b> are secured between the fixing rack <b>62</b> and the latching rack <b>64</b>. The number of the fans <b>90</b> may be varied according to different use conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The fixing rack <b>62</b> includes a first latching arm <b>622</b> and two opposite supporting arms <b>624</b>. Each supporting arm <b>624</b> protrudes from one of ends of the first latching arms <b>622</b>. The latching rack <b>64</b> includes a second latching arm <b>642</b> and two adjusting arms <b>644</b>. Each adjusting arm <b>644</b> protrudes from one of the ends of the second latching arm <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Two first latching boards <b>6222</b> protrude from the first latching arm <b>622</b>, a second latching board <b>6422</b> protrudes from the second latching arm <b>642</b> opposite to the first latching boards <b>6222</b>. The fans <b>90</b> are latched between the first latching boards <b>6222</b> and the second latching board <b>6422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each first latching board <b>6222</b> has a first latching plate <b>6224</b> protruding from its distal end. Two second latching plates <b>6226</b> protrudes from the first latching arm <b>622</b>. The first latching plates <b>6224</b> and the second latching plates <b>6226</b> cooperatively form a latching groove <b>626</b>, in which the latching rib <b>14</b> is latched to fix the fixing rack <b>62</b> to the main board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The second latching board <b>6422</b> defines two positioning holes <b>6424</b> in the longitudinal direction from one of the adjusting arms <b>644</b> to the other adjusting arm <b>644</b>. Each fan <b>90</b> has a positioning pin <b>92</b> located in one of the positioning holes <b>6424</b> to position the fans <b>90</b> to the second latching board <b>6422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Each supporting arm <b>624</b> defines a retaining hole <b>6242</b>, in which one of the fasteners <b>66</b> is fixed. Each adjusting arm <b>644</b> defines a sliding hole <b>6442</b> in its longitudinal direction. Each fastener <b>66</b> passes through one of the sliding holes <b>6442</b>, and then fixed in corresponding retaining hole <b>6242</b>, to fix the latching rack <b>64</b> to the fixing rack <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each supporting arm <b>624</b> further includes a sidewall <b>6244</b> protruding from one of its surfaces facing the first latching boards <b>6222</b>. The sidewalls <b>6244</b> are opposite.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each fastener <b>66</b> includes a fastening portion <b>662</b> and a head <b>664</b> protruding the fastening portion <b>662</b>. Each fastening portion <b>662</b> passes through one of the sliding holes <b>6442</b> and be fastened in one of the retaining hole <b>6242</b>. When the fastening portions <b>662</b> are fully fastened in the retaining holes <b>6242</b>, the heads <b>664</b> and the supporting arms <b>624</b> cooperatively fix the adjusting arms <b>644</b> to the fixing rack <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, to assemble a cooling system <b>30</b>, the sliding holes <b>6442</b> are aligned with the retaining holes <b>6242</b>, the fasteners <b>66</b> pass through the sliding holes <b>6442</b> and are partially fastened in the retaining holes <b>6242</b>. At this time, the latching rack <b>64</b> is capable of sliding relative to the fixing rack <b>62</b> as the fastening portions <b>662</b> slide in the sliding holes <b>6442</b> so a distance D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between an upper surface <b>6222</b>A of the first latching boards <b>6222</b> and a lower surface <b>6422</b>A of the second latching board <b>6422</b> can be adjusted. The distance D between the first latching boards <b>6222</b> and the second latching board <b>6422</b> is adjusted to adapt the dimension of the fans <b>90</b>. The fans <b>90</b> are placed between the first latching boards <b>6222</b> and the second latching board <b>6422</b> with the positioning pins <b>92</b> located in the positioning holes <b>6424</b>. Causing the latching rack <b>64</b> to move toward the fixing rack <b>62</b> until the fans <b>90</b> are tightly latched between the first latching boards <b>6222</b> and the second latching board <b>6422</b>. The fasteners <b>66</b> are fully fastened (tightened) in the retaining holes <b>6242</b> so the heads <b>664</b> and supporting arms <b>624</b> cooperatively fix the adjusting arms <b>644</b> to the fixing rack <b>62</b>, and an assembled cooling system <b>30</b> is yielded.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, to remove the fans <b>90</b> from the fixing device <b>40</b>, the fasteners are loosened from the retaining holes <b>6242</b>, allowing the latching rack <b>64</b> to move away the fixing rack <b>62</b> until the fans <b>90</b> are released so the fans <b>90</b> can be removed from the fixing device <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">To assemble an electronic device <b>100</b>, the latching rib <b>14</b> is latched in the latching groove <b>626</b> to fix the cooling system <b>30</b> to the main board <b>10</b>. The PCI <b>20</b> is inserted into the interface <b>12</b> to fix the PCI <b>20</b> to the main board <b>10</b> so an assembled electronic device <b>100</b> is yielded.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In above exemplary embodiment, the fans <b>90</b> are opposite to the PCI <b>20</b> so the heat generated by the PCI <b>20</b> can be efficiently dissipated by the airflow of the fans <b>90</b>, to cool and protect the PCI <b>20</b>. Additionally, the distance D between the fixing rack <b>62</b> and the latching rack <b>64</b> can be adjusted so different fans <b>90</b> having different sizes and powers can be latched between the fixing rack <b>62</b> and the latching rack <b>64</b> by adjusting the distance between the fixing rack <b>62</b> and the latching rack <b>64</b>, to satisfy cooling requirements at different conditions.</p>
