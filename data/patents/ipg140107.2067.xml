<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A process for making packer elements for use in sealing an area between surfaces in a wellbore and packer elements formed from that process. The process includes extruding an elastomeric material to form a tubular structure and machining the outer surface of the tubular structure to provide a desired surface geometry. The tubular structure may be machined to provide a contoured surface geometry. The tubular structure with a contoured surface geometry may be machined to form a plurality of packer elements, which are separated by cutting the tubular structure.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to packer elements, particularly packer elements for use in sealing an area between surfaces in a wellbore, and to methods for making packer elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In subterranean installations such as oil well installations in the oil and gas industry, geothermal wells, and the like, a pipe is typically located within a bore hole or casing and radially spaced from the wall of the bore hole or the inner wall of the casing. Downhole packers, also referred to as packer elements, are typically used for sealing the annular space between the pipe and the casing or bore wall. Packers may serve various functions including protecting the wellbore casing from corrosive fluids, protecting the casing from various pressures including well and stimulation pressures, holding kill fluids or treating fluids within the casing annulus, and/or isolating formations or leaks within the casing or multiple producing zones so as to prevent fluid from migrating between zones.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Packer elements heretofore have been formed from a thermoset rubber material. The packer element is installed by running the element into a wellbore where it is anchored typically by use of a mechanical compression setting tool or fluid pressure device. When the packer element is in place, compression in an axial direction will cause the packer element to expand radially and contact the inner surface of the casing or wellbore in a tightly sealed relationship.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the radial outer surface of the packer element is contoured to allow the packer element to adjust within the annular space and move into place as it is pressurized. The packer elements having a contoured radial outer surface heretofore have been formed by molding processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention provides a process for manufacturing packer elements for use in applications such as sealing the space between a pipe and casing or borehole in subterranean installations used within various industries. The process enables the avoidance of one or more drawbacks associated with the prior art practice of molding packer elements, including the avoidance of the cost of having to provide a separate mold for packer elements with different surface geometries, and the avoidance of structural weaknesses caused by voids, knit lines, or flow lines that result from previously used molding processes. Consequently, the present invention enables the provision of a packer element not plagued by defects commonly associated with prior art molding processes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the invention, a process for manufacturing a packer element includes extruding an elastomeric material to form a tubular structure, and machining the radial outer surface of the tubular structure to provide a desired surface geometry.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The surface geometry may be a contoured geometry. In particular, the contoured geometry may have one or more regions selected from an angled region, a curved region, a chamfered region, a shoulder, a groove, a depression, or combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The process may be used to form from a single extruded tubular structure, a plurality of packer elements having a contoured radial outer surface, where the packer elements are separated by cutting the tubular structure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The radial outer surface may be machined using a grinding tool, a forming tool, a cutting tool, or a combination of two or more thereof. In particular, a grinding wheel may be used as the grinding tool.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The machining process may be carried out on any suitable machining tool such as a lathe, a chucking lathe, a milling machine, or a specialized machine tool. A particularly suitable machining tool is a lathe.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The process may include machining the radial outer surface of the tubular structure to provide a substantially uniform outer surface. The tubular structure may be circular, and the process may include machining the radial outer surface of the tubular structure to provide a concentric cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The elastomeric material may be a rubber material and may be cured prior to machining.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also provides packer elements, in particular a packer element formed from a process according to the present invention. The packer element may be used for sealing an area between two surfaces, such as between concentric surfaces in a wellbore, by installing a packer element formed by the process according to the present invention between the surfaces.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A process in accordance with the present invention may be used to form packer elements suitable for use in sealing the area between surfaces in a wellbore such as between a well pipe and a casing or borehole wall as may be found in subterranean installations used within various industries, such as the oil and gas industries. Generally, the process comprises extruding an elastomeric material to form a tubular structure, and machining the radial outer surface of the tubular structure to provide a desired surface geometry. The tubular structure may be machined to form a plurality of packer elements having a radial outer surface with a contoured geometry, after which the packer elements are separated from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tubular structure&#x201d; refers to the tubular structure formed from the extrusion process and to any tubular workpiece formed from the extruded tubular structure prior to being formed as a finished packer element. An extruded tubular structure has a radial inner surface and a radial outer surface and wall thickness defined by the distance between the inner and outer surface. The tubular structure may have any shape as desired for a particular purpose or intended use including, but not limited to, circular, oval, elliptical, rectangular, square, triangular, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;surface geometry&#x201d; refers to the overall shape of a surface of the tubular structure or finished packer element. The term &#x201c;surface geometry&#x201d; may be used to refer to the configuration of the radial outer surface (radial outer surface geometry) or the radial inner surface (radial inner surface geometry). In one embodiment the radial outer surface may be substantially uniform or regular (non-contoured) over the entire length of the tubular structure or packer element. In one embodiment, the radial outer surface may have a contoured geometry. A contoured surface geometry may be defined by one or more angled regions, curved regions, chamfered regions, depressions, grooves, shoulders, and the like, and combinations of two or more thereof, along the radial outer surface of the tubular structure and/or the finished packer element. The regions defining the contoured geometry may run in the axial or radial direction of the tubular structure and/or the packer element. A contoured surface may also include one or more cylindrical regions in combination with one or more angled regions, curved regions, chamfered regions, depressions, and/or grooves. A contoured surface may include two or more cylindrical regions vertically offset from one another. Depressions or grooves may be rounded, squared, angled or any other configuration as desired. The contoured surface may also be a threaded surface formed by a groove or grooves running in a helical pattern about the radial outer surface. The surface geometry of the radial outer surface, including a contoured surface geometry, may be selected as desired for a particular purpose or intended use.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The tubular structure may be machined using any suitable tool including, for example, a grinding tool, a forming tool, a cutting tool, or combinations thereof. Suitable forming tools include, but are not limited to, right cut tools, left cut tools, curved tools, rounded tools, square nosed tools, tapered tools, knurling tools, and the like. In one embodiment, the grinding tool may be a grinding wheel having a desired profile or geometry to impart the desired contour to the radial outer surface of the tubular structure. An example of a suitable cutting tool is a knife or blade. The cutting tool may be angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the tubular structure to provide the desired contour.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The machining process may be carried out on any suitable machining tool. Suitable machining tools include, but are not limited to, a lathe, a chucking lathe, a milling machine, and/or a custom machine tool. In a machining process employing a lathe, an extruded tubular structure may be placed on a mandrel, positioned in a lathe, rotated at a selected speed, and the radial outer surface of the tubular structure may be contoured by indexing a grinding tool, a forming tool, a cutting tool, or combinations thereof, into the tubular structure to abrade material from the tubular structure. Generally, the grinding tool(s), forming tool(s) and/or cutting tool(s) are attached to a carriage assembly that may be moved axially and lineally in relation to the rotating mandrel and tube.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A plurality of packer elements may be formed from an extruded tubular structure by machining the tubular structure to provide a plurality of packer elements having a radial outer surface with a desired surface geometry, such as a contoured geometry, and cutting through the thickness of the tubular structure to separate the packer elements. The tubular structure may be cut at an angle perpendicular to the longitudinal axis to provide a packer element having a straight axial end face, or the tube may be cut at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of the tubular structure to provide a packer element having an angled end face.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The tubular structure may be formed by extruding an elastomeric material. Any elastomeric material may be used as desired for a particular purpose or intended use. In one embodiment the elastomeric material may be a rubber material. Suitable rubber materials may include natural or synthetic, thermosetting of vulcanizable rubbers including, but not limited to, nitrile rubber, polyisoprene rubber, buna-N rubber,ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), ethylene-propylene-diene-monomer (EPDM), nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), blends of rubbers, and the like. In one embodiment the elastomeric material is a thermoset material. In a process using a thermoset material, the extruded tubular structure may be cured to provide the material with the desired physical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary apparatus for carrying out a process for forming one or more packer elements in accordance with the present invention. Apparatus <b>10</b> includes feeding a rubber material, such as rubber strips <b>12</b> to an extruder <b>14</b> through an inlet <b>16</b>. The rubber material is conveyed through the extruder by a screw <b>18</b>. The extruder <b>14</b> includes a head <b>20</b> that includes a pin and die set <b>22</b> and an aperture (not shown), which establishes the shape of the extruded structure. The screw <b>18</b> conveys the uncured rubber material to the pin and die set at a high pressure and the rubber is extruded through the aperture to form a continuous tube or extruded tubular structure <b>24</b> having a central, longitudinal axis <b>25</b>, a radial outer surface <b>27</b>, and a radial inner surface <b>29</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>). The aperture is dimensioned to provide a tube having a shape (e.g., circular, oval, etc.), interior dimensions, and/or wall thickness as desired for a particular purpose or intended use. The extrusion process is not limited in any manner and may employ any type of screw configuration as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, the tubular structure may be formed as a single layer structure or as a multi-layer structure such as by a cross-head or co-extrusion process.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Optionally, the extruded tubular structure <b>24</b> may be cooled prior to curing the extruded tubular structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, extruded tubular structure <b>24</b> may be conveyed, via conveying device <b>26</b>, to a cooling tunnel <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The cooling tunnel lowers the temperature of the extruded tubular structure, which may increase the rigidity of the structure and/or impart thermal shrinkage to the material used to form the tube. The cooling may be accomplished by a spray process, a submersion process, or any other process suitable for cooling an extruded workpiece as is now known or later discovered by persons skilled in extrusion methods.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Typically, the extruded tubular structure is extruded as a long continuous tube, and it may be desirable to cut the tube into smaller sections to provide smaller length tubular structures that can be easily handled during further processing such as, for example, during the machining step. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> further includes conveying the extruded tubular structure, via conveying device <b>30</b>, to a cutter <b>32</b>, where the extruded tubular structure is cut into a plurality of tubular structure of a desired length.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">After being cut, the extruded tubular structure may then be cured. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an extruded tubular structure is placed on a curing mandrel <b>34</b> and placed in an environment, such as curing vessel <b>38</b>, suitable to effect curing the rubber material used to form the tubular structure. Any suitable method including, but not limited to, applying heat and/or pressure to the tubular structure may be used to cure the tubular structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of tubular structures loaded onto an apparatus such as curing truck <b>36</b> and placed in curing vessel <b>38</b> to be cured.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The use of a curing mandrel, such as mandrel <b>38</b>, is optional but may be desirable to establish a finished inside surface shape and/or dimension within a specified tolerance after curing. A curing mandrel may have any shape and size as desired for a particular purpose or intended use. The shape may be a regular geometric shape, an irregular shape, or may have depressions, grooves, projections, or the like. A curing mandrel may have a relatively smooth surface, or a curing mandrel may have a patterned surface to provide the inner radial surface with a desired surface geometry or pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After curing, the tubular structure(s) may be removed from the curing mandrel and subjected to any secondary or post-curing operations as desired. Such secondary or post-curing operations may be used to establish the final physical properties of the rubber compound used to form the tubular structure. Such secondary or post-curing operations are readily known and ascertainable by those skilled in the art of extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After curing, the tubular structures may be processed to form a tube having an outside surface, inside surface, and/or wall thickness within a desired dimensional tolerance. A tubular structure may be machined to provide a tubular structure having a substantially smooth or uniform (non-contoured) outer surface defining a regular geometric shape when viewing the axial end of the tube. The tube may be machined to provide an outside diameter with a roughness specification, wall thickness, or other dimensional feature within a desired dimensional tolerance. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, the circular tubular structure <b>24</b> is machined using a grinding lathe <b>42</b> to provide a tubular structure having a dimensioned outer diameter and to form a substantially concentric cylinder. The cured tubes are placed on a grinding mandrel and placed between centers <b>44</b> to hold the mandrel. The mandrel/tube assembly and grinding wheel <b>46</b> are rotated at a specified speed, and grinding wheel <b>46</b> is brought into contact the outer surface of the tubular structure to remove rubber from the outside of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After machining the tubular structure to provide a dimensioned tubular structure, the tubular structure is then machined to form packer elements having a contoured radial outer surface. The tubular structure may be machined using a grinding tool, a forming tool, and/or a cutting tool. The tubular structure may be machined (on a lathe, for example) to form a plurality of packer elements having a contoured radial outer surface and then cut and separated into individual packer elements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the radial outer surface of the tubular structure may be machined using a &#x201c;knife-cut&#x201d; process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a knife-cut process <b>48</b> may employ a lathe <b>49</b> with a carriage assembly <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the carriage assembly <b>50</b> includes knives <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, and <b>56</b>. Knife <b>54</b> is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tube <b>26</b> and knives <b>52</b> and <b>56</b> are oriented at angles relative to the longitudinal axis of the tubular structure. The carriage assembly <b>50</b> is shown as having three knives, but it will be appreciated that a multiple-knife assembly may include two or more knives as desired for a particular purpose or intended use. It will also be appreciated that the knives may be at a fixed angle (i.e., angled or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tube or mandrel) or may be adjustable and moved as necessary for machining a packer element with a desired contoured geometry. The knives may be independently controlled in a manner that allows axial movement in relation to the rotating mandrel and tube. The carriage assembly may be controlled to allow lineal and axial movement of the knives in relation to the rotating mandrel and tube. While the mandrel/tube assembly is rotating, the knives may be independently indexed into the tube to create cuts of a desired angle.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To provide a plurality of packer elements <b>60</b>, one of the knives cuts through the thickness of the tube <b>24</b> at a desired location to form an end (e.g., end <b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>c</i>) of the packer element. Depending on the orientation of the knife cutting through the tubular structure, the ends of the packer element(s) may be substantially straight or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the packer element, or the ends may be angled or beveled.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>c </i>illustrate a packer element <b>60</b> having a contoured surface geometry that is formed using a knife-cut machining process. Packer element <b>60</b> includes a radial outer surface <b>62</b>, a radial inner surface <b>70</b>, axial ends <b>72</b>, and a central, longitudinal axis <b>73</b>. Radial outer surface <b>62</b> is a contoured surface defined by a cylindrical region <b>64</b> (which is substantially parallel relative to the longitudinal axis of the packer element as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>) and angled regions <b>64</b> and <b>68</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>, the angled regions <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> have the same angle. It will be appreciated that the angled regions on the radial outer surface of the packer element may have the same or different angles. It will also be appreciated that a contoured radial outer surface may be defined by any number of angled regions, including one, two, three, or more angled regions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again, a contoured radial outer surface may be provided by utilizing a grind-cut process <b>80</b>. The tubular structure <b>26</b> is placed on a mandrel <b>40</b> and positioned between centers <b>83</b> of a lathe <b>82</b>. The lathe includes a carriage assembly <b>84</b> having a grinding tool <b>86</b> and a knife <b>88</b>. The grinding tool <b>86</b> and knife <b>88</b> are mounted to allow axial and lineal movement in relation to the rotating mandrel <b>40</b> and tube <b>26</b>. The grinding tool <b>86</b> may include any profile to provide the radial outer surface of the tube with a desired contour or geometry. For example, a grinding tool may be employed to provide grooves, shoulders, curved regions, or the like. The profile on the grinding tool is transferred to the outer surface of the tube as the carriage is indexed toward the mandrel axis and rubber is abraded from the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A carriage assembly in a grind-cut process may include one or more knives for use in machining the radial outer surface of the tubular structure to contour the radial outer surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the carriage <b>84</b> includes a single knife <b>88</b>. Knife <b>88</b> is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the mandrel <b>40</b> and tube <b>24</b>. Knife <b>88</b> may be used to contour the radial outer surface of the tubular structure and/or cut through the tube perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tube to form a plurality of packer elements. It will be appreciated that the knife <b>88</b> may be oriented at an angle other than perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tube to provide a particular contoured geometry and or configuration for the axial ends of the packer elements. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, carriage <b>84</b>&#x2032; includes a grinding tool (in this case a grinding wheel <b>86</b>&#x2032;) and knives <b>87</b> and <b>89</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, knives <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> are angled relative to the longitudinal axis of the tube <b>26</b>. The knives <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> may be independently controlled in a manner that allows axial and lineal movement in relation to the rotating mandrel and tube. The knives may be indexed independently into the rotating tube to form an angled region on the radial outer surface of the tube. Knives <b>87</b> and <b>89</b> may be used to machine the tubular structure in forming the contoured geometry and/or to cut through the thickness of the tubular structure to form a plurality of packer elements <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c </i>illustrate a packer element <b>100</b> having a contoured radial outer surface formed from a grind cut process. Packer element <b>100</b> includes a radial outer surface <b>102</b> having a contoured geometry, a radial inner surface <b>112</b>, and a central, longitudinal axis <b>114</b>. The contoured geometry is defined by region <b>104</b> (which is shown as a cylindrical region), angled regions <b>106</b>, and depressions or grooves <b>108</b>, which are defined by walls <b>107</b> and walls <b>109</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, the packer element includes axial ends <b>110</b>, which angle inward toward the inner radial surface <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the tubular structure is machined and cut to form a plurality of packer elements having a contoured geometry, the packer elements may be removed from the mandrel and recovered. The packer elements may be removed from the mandrel by any suitable method such as, for example, by stripping the packer elements off the mandrel with the assistance of a pneumatic air gun.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A process in accordance with the present invention enables the avoidance of one or more drawbacks associated with the prior art practice of molding packer elements, including the avoidance of the cost of having to provide a separate mold for packer elements with different surface geometries, and the avoidance of structural weaknesses caused by voids, knit lines, or flow lines that result from previously used molding processes. Consequently, the present invention enables the provision of a packer element not plagued by defects commonly associated with prior art molding processes. For example, a process in accordance with the present invention may avoid expenses associated with molding operations, which require a different mold for each different packer configuration. A process in accordance with the present invention is flexible in that a separate apparatus is not required for forming parts with different configurations. Grinding tools and cutting tools may be easily interchanged and their angle of orientation relative to the longitudinal axis of the tubular structure may be readily adjusted as needed to provide the desired cuts and angles.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Packer elements formed in accordance with the present invention may have a radial outer surface with any contoured geometry as desired for a particular purpose or intended use. Additionally, packer elements may have any outer diameter as desired for a particular purpose or intended use. While a contoured radial outer surface will have an outer diameter that varies depending on the contoured geometry, the size of the packer element may be defined by the largest radial surface dimension. For example, in a packer element formed from a circular tube, the size of the packer element may be defined by the largest diameter. Packer elements may have an outer diameter of, for example, 3 inches, 7 inches, 13 inches, or even larger.</p>
