<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is related to a wireless passive entry system for a motor vehicle. More particularly, this disclosure is related to a method to change driver identification for a passive entry vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In today's cars it is somewhat standard to have a specific key fob for a specific driver. In the vehicle, each fob is &#x201c;tied&#x201d; to potentially many functions and driver preference settings (e.g., radio presets, driver positioning, mirror positioning, and the like). In known passive entry systems, the driver preference settings are usually based on a fob identification found in a signal from the fob which allows entry into the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The current trend is to apply four-door passive entry to vehicles. With four-door passive entry, when the handle on the driver's door is grabbed, generally only the driver's door unlocks. When other points of access (e.g., passengers' doors and a tailgate) are triggered, all doors of the vehicle unlock. With four-door passive entry, the probability increases that the driver may keep his or her fob in their briefcase or bag, for example, and place the briefcase or bag in a rear seat of a vehicle by first opening a rear door or the tailgate. With current passive entry systems, the driver preference settings would not be changed if the driver accessed the vehicle through a point of access other than the driver's door and placed the briefcase or bag, in which the fob is located, in the rear of the vehicle. With current passive entry systems, the driver identification would default to the previous values set at the last grab of the driver's door handle with a valid key fob. This can create confusion and frustration for the driver of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a husband and wife own and share a vehicle equipped with four-door passive entry. The wife typically drives the vehicle during the day and keeps her fob in her purse. The husband then takes the vehicle on some evenings and keeps his fob in his backpack. If the husband puts his backpack in the cargo area by first opening the tailgate, the identification for the husband can be confused because the vehicle only recalls the identification of the wife, who was the last driver to grab of the front door handle carrying a valid key fob. Because the husband placed his backpack in the cargo area, there was no fob identification present at the driver's door handle when the husband entered the vehicle though the driver's door. As such, even though the wife is not operating the vehicle, the driver preference settings are set for the wife and not the husband.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for applying driver preference settings for a vehicle is disclosed. The vehicle includes a plurality of closures and a plurality of antennas. The plurality of closures includes a driver's door and at least one other closure mentioned above. The plurality of antennas includes a driver's door antenna associated with the driver's door and at least one other closure antenna associated with the at least one other closure.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a vehicle system <b>10</b> for setting driver preferences settings for a vehicle <b>12</b>. The vehicle system <b>10</b> includes a main control unit <b>14</b>, which can include hardware and/or software capable of performing operations that will be described in more detail below. The vehicle system <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are configured to wirelessly communicate with the main control unit <b>14</b>. The vehicle system <b>10</b> is capable determining driver preference settings in a manner such that the appropriate driver preference setting can be set for the driver of the vehicle. The vehicle system <b>10</b> can be part of a passive entry system where the operator of the vehicle <b>12</b> need not perform any active function, e.g., press a button on the fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, to gain access to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The main control unit <b>14</b> is in communication with a plurality of closure lock controllers, such as a driver's door lock controller <b>20</b><i>a</i>, a passenger's door lock controller <b>20</b><i>b </i>and a tailgate lock controller <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Each lock controller controls a respective lock for a respective closure. For example, the driver's door lock controller <b>20</b><i>a </i>controls a driver's door lock (not shown) for a driver's door <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the passenger's door lock controller <b>20</b><i>b </i>controls a passenger's door lock (not shown) for a passenger's door <b>22</b><i>b </i>and the tailgate lock controller <b>20</b><i>c </i>controls a tailgate lock (not shown) for the tailgate <b>22</b><i>c </i>of the vehicle. The passenger's door <b>22</b><i>b </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown on an opposite side of the vehicle <b>12</b> as the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The vehicle <b>12</b> can also include a first rear passenger's door <b>22</b><i>d </i>rearward from the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a </i>on the same side of the vehicle as the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a second rear passenger's door <b>22</b><i>e </i>rearward from the passenger's door <b>22</b><i>b </i>on the opposite side of the vehicle as the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a</i>. Door locks (not shown) and door lock controllers <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>e</i>, which can also be in communication with the main control unit <b>14</b>, can also be associated with these other passenger's doors <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>e</i>, respectively. Each lock controller <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, which can also be referred to as a closure lock controller, operates in a locked state, which places the respective closure lock in a locked position, and an unlocked state, which places the respective closure lock in an unlocked position.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The vehicle system <b>10</b> also includes a plurality of antennas <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>g</i>. The main control unit <b>14</b> is in communication with each antenna <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>f</i>. The plurality of antennas <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>f </i>includes a driver's door antenna <b>30</b><i>a</i>, which can be located on or adjacent to the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The plurality of antennas further includes a passenger's door antenna <b>30</b><i>b </i>located on or adjacent the passenger's door <b>22</b><i>b</i>, which is located on an opposite side of the vehicle as the driver's door and can typically be referred to as a front passenger's door. The plurality of antennas also includes a tailgate antenna <b>30</b><i>c </i>located on or adjacent to the tailgate <b>22</b><i>c </i>of the vehicle <b>12</b>. The plurality of antennas also includes rear passenger door antennas <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>30</b><i>e </i>located on or near respective rear passenger doors <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>e </i>of the vehicle. The antennas <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>f </i>that are associated with a respective closure are configured to transmit an exterior search signal to locate fobs near the respective closure and outside of the vehicle. The vehicle system <b>10</b> further includes an antenna <b>30</b><i>f</i>, which is configured to transmit an interior search signal to locate fobs within the vehicle. Although only one antenna <b>30</b><i>f </i>for transmitting an interior search signal is shown, multiple interior search antennas can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The plurality of antennas also includes a receiving antenna <b>30</b><i>g </i>in communication with the main control unit <b>14</b>. The receiving antenna <b>30</b><i>g </i>is configured to receive response signals transmitted from the fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The response signals are transmitted from the fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>in response to receiving a search signal, which is transmitted from the antennas <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>g</i>. The response signals can include an access code for changing the state of the lock controllers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>and an ID code unique to the fob that transmitted the response signal. The response signals can be RF transmissions. The search signals can be LF transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The vehicle system <b>10</b> further includes a memory <b>40</b>, which is in communication with the main control unit <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a table <b>42</b>, which can be stored in the memory <b>40</b>. The memory <b>40</b> is for storing at least two driver preference settings, e.g., Driver1 Preference Setting, Driver2 Preference Setting, DriverN Preference Setting, each associated with a different driver of the vehicle. The driver preference settings and identifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be stored in other manners that allow each different driver of the vehicle to be associated with a respective driver preference setting.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each driver of the vehicle <b>12</b> typically carries his or her own fob <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Only fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; however, a greater number of fobs can be employed in the vehicle system <b>10</b>. If greater than two fobs are provided, further identifications can be provided, which is denoted as IDN in table <b>42</b>. With reference back to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each fob <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be associated with a unique identification. For example, a first fob <b>16</b><i>a </i>can be associated with ID<b>1</b> (see table <b>42</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and a second fob <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be associated with ID<b>2</b>. The fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be similar to known fobs capable of transmitting signals to and receiving wireless signals from the vehicle. Moreover, the fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>can be other wireless communication devices such as a mobile phone and other devices capable of transmitting wireless signals to and receiving wireless signals from the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The vehicle system <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of door switches <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<b>50</b><i>e</i>, which are each in communication with the main control unit <b>14</b>. Each door switch <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<b>50</b><i>e </i>is for determining whether the respective door is open or closed. For example, the driver's door switch <b>50</b><i>a </i>can send a signal to the main control unit <b>14</b>, which allows the main control unit to determine whether the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a </i>has changed from open to closed. This allows for the changing of a door switch flag in a control routine, which will be described in more detail below. Each of the remaining door switches <b>50</b><i>b</i>-<b>50</b><i>e </i>can send similar signals to the main control unit <b>14</b> for detecting whether the respective closure is open or closed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The main control unit <b>14</b> is in communication with each closure lock controller <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e</i>, each antenna <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>g</i>, the door switches <b>50</b><i>a</i>-<b>50</b><i>e </i>and the memory <b>40</b>. The main control unit <b>14</b> is configured to initiate a search signal from at least one of the antennas <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<b>30</b><i>e </i>to locate at least one of the at least two fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>located outside of and adjacent to the vehicle <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The main control unit <b>14</b> is also configured to assign a driver preference setting based on an ID code in a response signal transmitted from one of the fobs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The response signal from each fob <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b </i>includes the ID code that is unique to the particular fob. The main control unit <b>14</b> can assign the Driver1 Preference Setting when the ID code ID<b>1</b> has been received in a response signal transmitted from the first fob <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The main control unit <b>14</b> can assign the Driver2 Preference Setting when the ID code ID<b>2</b> has been received in a response signal transmitted from the second fob <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The main control unit <b>14</b> can assign the respective driver preference setting based on a received response signal even when this response signal is in response to a search signal transmitted from an antenna other than the driver's door antenna <b>30</b><i>a</i>, e.g., antennas <b>30</b><i>b</i>-<b>30</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The main control unit <b>14</b> is also configured to update and apply the appropriate assigned driver preference setting The driver preference setting includes at least one of a vehicle seat setting, a rear view mirror setting, a side view mirror setting, a radio station setting and an HVAC setting. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the system <b>10</b> as including a seat control unit <b>60</b>, a rear view mirror control unit <b>62</b>, a side view mirror control unit <b>64</b>, a radio control unit <b>66</b> and an HVAC control unit <b>68</b>.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A method for applying driver preference settings for a vehicle will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Even though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> depict steps in a logical order, the order in which the steps are performed should not be limited to the order in which they are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> or the order in which they are described below. Additionally, the method for applying driver preference settings depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> will be described with reference to the vehicle system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; however, the method can be used with other similar vehicle systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a control routine having two branches, and these branches can be performed simultaneously by software found in the main control unit <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also depicts a control routine that can operate simultaneously with the control routine depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the method for applying driver preference settings begins at <b>100</b>. At <b>100</b>, the driver preference settings for the previous driver of the vehicle are applied by the control unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At <b>102</b>, the exterior search signal is transmitted from at least one of the antennas <b>30</b><i>b</i>-<b>30</b><i>e </i>that is associated with a closure of the vehicle <b>10</b> other than the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a</i>. As such, at <b>102</b>, the main control unit <b>14</b> transmits an exterior other closure search signal from an antenna, e.g., antennas <b>30</b><i>b</i>-<b>30</b><i>e</i>, not associated with the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At <b>104</b>, the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether another closure other than the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a </i>(i.e., closures <b>22</b><i>b</i>-<b>22</b><i>e</i>) is open. This can be determined by the door switches <b>50</b><i>b</i>-<b>50</b><i>e </i>associated with each respective closure. If another closure other than the driver's door <b>22</b><i>a </i>is found to be open at <b>104</b>, then the driver preference setting that was previously stored in the memory <b>40</b> is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>. If another closure is not found to be open, at <b>104</b>, then the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether a valid RF response signal has been received in response to the transmitted exterior other closure search signal at <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If a valid RF response signal is not received at <b>112</b>, then the driver preference setting that was stored in the beginning of the control routine at <b>100</b> is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>. If a valid RF response signal is received at <b>112</b>, then the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether the other closure associated with the exterior search signal transmitted at <b>102</b> is locked at <b>114</b>. For example, if the exterior other closure search signal was transmitted from the tailgate antenna <b>30</b><i>c</i>, at <b>114</b> the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether the tailgate <b>22</b><i>c </i>is locked based on an operating state of the tailgate lock controller <b>50</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">If it is determined that the other closure is locked at <b>114</b>, then the control unit <b>14</b> sends a command to UNLOCK ALL closure locks <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>associated with the respective closures and records a NO CHANGE to fob ID at <b>116</b>. The UNLOCK ALL command at <b>116</b> is sent prior to the transmission of an interior search by the antenna <b>30</b><i>f </i>to allow the carrier of a fob associated with the vehicle to enter the vehicle during the transmission of the interior search. NO CHANGE in fob ID is recorded at this time, because the driver of vehicle may not be carrying the fob that sent the valid RF response signal at <b>112</b>. With reference back to step <b>114</b>, if the control unit <b>14</b> determines that the other closure is not locked, then the routine skips step <b>116</b> and proceeds to step <b>118</b> to transmit the interior search signal.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">At <b>122</b>, the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether a fob is located inside the vehicle based on receiving a response signal in response to the interior search transmitted at <b>118</b>. The interior search signal is transmitted from the antenna <b>30</b><i>g</i>, for example. If it is determined that a fob is located inside the vehicle at <b>122</b>, then the driver preference setting that was stored at <b>100</b> is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>. If, however, it is determined at <b>122</b> that a fob is not located inside the vehicle, the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether a door switch flag allows for changing the driver preference setting at <b>124</b>. In the control routine depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the door switch flag is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, then the door switch flag does not allow for change in the driver preference setting. When the door switch flag is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, then the door switch flag does allow for changing the driver preference setting. As such, if it is determined at <b>124</b> that the door flag switch does not allow for change in the driver preference setting, then the driver preference setting that was stored at <b>100</b> is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>. If, however, at <b>124</b> it is determined that the door switch flag allows for changing the driver preference setting (i.e., the door switch flag is &#x201c;0&#x201d;), then at <b>126</b> a NO CHANGE LOCK STATUS command is sent from the main control unit <b>14</b> to the door lock controller <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>and the fob ID from the valid response signal received at <b>112</b> is recorded. Afterwards, the driver preference setting associated with the fob ID from the valid response signal received at <b>112</b> is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The control routine depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also transmits an exterior search signal from the driver door antenna <b>30</b><i>a</i>. As mentioned above, this search signal, which can be referred to as an exterior driver's door search signal, can be transmitted simultaneously with the exterior other closure search signal, which is transmitted at <b>102</b>. At <b>132</b>, the control unit <b>14</b> determines whether a valid RF response signal is received in response to the exterior driver's door search signal that was transmitted at <b>130</b>. If no valid RF response signal is received at <b>132</b>, then the driver preference settings that were stored at <b>100</b> are applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>. If a valid RF response signal is received at <b>132</b>, then the main control unit <b>14</b> determines whether the driver door <b>22</b><i>a </i>is locked at <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The determination that the driver door is locked can be based on the state of the driver door lock controller <b>20</b><i>a</i>, which is in communication with the main control unit <b>14</b>. If it is determined that the driver's door is not locked at <b>134</b>, then a NO CHANGE LOCK STATUS command is sent to the closure lock controllers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>and the fob ID from the valid response signal received at <b>132</b> is recorded by the main control unit <b>14</b> at <b>136</b>. After the fob ID from the fob that provided the valid RF signal at <b>132</b> is recorded at <b>136</b>, the driver preference setting associated with that fob ID is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>. If it is determined that the driver door is locked at <b>134</b>, then an UNLOCK ALL or a UNLOCK DRIVER DOOR command is sent. The UNLOCK ALL command would be sent to all closure lock controllers <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>20</b><i>e</i>. The UNLOCK DRIVER DOOR command would be sent only to the driver door lock controller <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Whether the UNLOCK ALL command or the UNLOCK DRIVER DOOR command is sent can be based on preferences set by the driver of the vehicle. At <b>138</b>, the fob ID associated with the valid response signal received at <b>132</b> is also recorded. The control routine then proceeds to change the door switch flag from 0 to 1, which results in the door switch flag to not allow the changing of the driver preference setting. The driver preference setting then associated with the fob ID in the valid response signal received at <b>132</b> is applied at <b>106</b> and the control routine ends at <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the method for applying driver preference settings for a vehicle determines whether the driver door has moved from open to closed at <b>150</b>. The determination as to whether the driver door <b>20</b><i>a </i>has moved from open to closed, results from a signal sent from the door switch <b>50</b><i>a</i>, which is associated with the driver door <b>22</b><i>a </i>and in communication with the control unit <b>14</b>. When it is determined that the driver door changed from opened to closed, the door switch flag is changed to 0, at <b>152</b>, which allows for changing the driver preference setting as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
