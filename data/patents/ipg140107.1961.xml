<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A seal for sealing an interface between a container and a lid of a process chamber. The seal comprises a first seal element and a second seal element that are arranged to seal the interface in series, with the second seal element being situated to encounter processing activity upstream of the fist seal element. The first seal element has a deflectable portion and a protrusion extending radially from the deflectable portion. The second seal element has a radially extending recess in which the protrusion of the first seal element is received. The protrusion and recess interlock to restrict separation and/or rotation of the first and second seal elements. Inclined surfaces of the first seal element interact with the second seal element to apply axial sealing forces to sealing surfaces of the second seal member.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A semiconductor process chamber commonly comprises a container, a lid, and a seal that seals an interface between the container and lid. The lid is usually movable between a position whereat it closes an access opening into the processing space, and a position whereat the access opening is uncovered for loading/unloading of the processing space. The container's interface surface and/or the lid's interface surface can include a circumferential groove in which the seal is situated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many semiconductor manufacturing methods now use processing chambers to create ultra-high-vacuum (UHV&#x2014;pressures lower than about 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>pascal and/or 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>torr) and/or ultra-high-purity (UHP&#x2014;total maximum contaminant level of 10 ppm) environments. These manufacturing methods can involve repeated opening and sealing process chambers so that substrates (e.g., wafers) can be continuously loaded, processed, and then unloaded therefrom. Slow production rates (e.g., caused by long pump-down times), significant equipment downtime (e.g., for seal replacement or interface cleaning) and/or substandard yields (e.g., due to particle generation) are generally viewed as undesirable by semiconductor manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Exemplary seals that are known in the art for sealing such processing chambers are disclosed in the following patent documents: U.S. Pat. No. 6,286,839, US 2009/00174152, US 2008/0018058, US 2007/0075503, WO 2009/038022. Such seal designs generally include first and second sealing elements in the form of an elastomeric sealing element and a metallic or polymeric sealing element, respectively. The metallic or polymeric sealing element is typically situated to shield the elastomeric sealing element from plasma within the chamber that may otherwise degrade the elastomer. Many of these designs lack a provision for interlocking the first and second sealing elements together, or provide an interlock that is significantly spaced apart radially and/or axially from the sealing surfaces of the second sealing element. Further, many of the designs employ voids between the first and second seal elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Contrary to prior art seals, the present invention provides a seal that operates to energize the sealing surfaces of its second sealing element in an entirely different manner. The seal employs an interlocking protrusion that is uniquely configured to energize the sealing surfaces of the second sealing element when the seal is subject to compression and represents an improvement over the prior art designs that generally do not provide efficient energizing of the second seal elements by the first seal element during compression. The seal thus comprises first and second interlocked seal elements that function in a substantially different way than prior art seals to achieve a superior sealing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The seal includes a first seal element having a protrusion and second seal element having a recess in which the protrusion is received. The protrusion and recess interlock to restrict separation and/or rotation of the first and second seal elements, and to provide the mechanism that operates to energize the sealing surfaces in an entirely different manner than prior art seals to provide a significantly different effect. More specifically, the protrusion of the first seal element includes an inclined surface that is radially coextensive with a major portion of a sealing surface of the second seal element. When the seal is deflected, the inclined surface assists in urging the sealing surface of the second seal element into sealing engagement with a surface to be sealed. This is contrary to some prior art seals wherein the first seal element tends to rotate the sealing surface away from the surface to be sealed under compression.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The seal can be constructed to achieve ultra high vacuum levels without compromising on cleanliness, and still allow a clamped (rather than bolted) container-lid interface. Thus, the seal can efficiently be used in UHV and/or UHP processing chambers with unbolted and/or dynamic interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An elastomeric first seal element and a polymeric second seal element can be arranged and adapted to seal the chamber's interface sequentially during its conversion to a sealed condition. The elastomeric seal element creates a seal during early evacuation stages, with the help of a clamping device. This maintains the chamber's vacuum, so that the pressure differential can continue to rise, and provide the sealing load necessary for the polymeric seal element to create a seal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The polymeric seal element can be positioned upstream of the elastomeric seal element relative to the processing chamber. (In cylindrical processing chambers, for example, the polymeric seal element can be positioned radially inward of the elastomeric seal element.) In this manner, the polymeric seal element shields the elastomeric seal element from gas permeation, thermal exposure, and reactive plasmas, and/or ion-impingement. The polymeric seal element can also shield the processing chamber from particles generated by the elastomeric seal element. In this manner, the disadvantages often associated with elastomeric seals (e.g., gas-permeation bulk, reactive degrade, thermal-exposure deterioration, shortened life span, impure-particle generation, electrical-discontinuity causation, etc.) are eliminated or at least minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the invention, a seal for sealing an interface between a container and a lid of a process chamber comprises a first seal element having a deflectable portion and a protrusion extending radially inwardly from the deflectable portion, and a second seal element having at least one sealing surface and a radially outwardly extending recess in which the protrusion of the first seal element is received, a radially inner surface of the protrusion abutting a radially inner surface of the recess. The protrusion and recess interlock to restrict separation of the first and second seal elements, and the protrusion has an inclined surface that is radially coextensive with a major portion of the sealing surface and extends to a maximum axial extent of the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The second seal element can have an abutment surface abutting the inclined surface of the protrusion whereby during compression of the seal, when a force is applied to the second sealing element tending to separate it from the first seal element, a reaction force is generated at the inclined surface that tends to apply an axial sealing force to the at least one sealing surface of the second sealing element. The inclined surface can extend to the radially outer extent of the protrusion. The sealing surface and the abutment surface of the second seal element can slope away from each other in the radially outward direction thereby forming a wedging portion of the second seal element for applying an axial sealing force to the sealing surface during compression of the first seal element. The at least one sealing surface can be configured to pivot about a point located radially inwardly and outside of the second seal member when the seal is deflected.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The recess and/or protrusion have an anti-rotatable fit to restrict rotation of the first seal element relative to the second seal element. The second seal member can further comprise upper and lower arms extending radially from a central axially extending body, the arms and body defining therebetween the recess and being adapted to engage opposing sides of the protrusion. The recess can be a dovetail-shape in cross-section. The second seal element can be supported by the first seal element, and the first seal element and second seal element can be adapted to seal in series. The first seal element can extend above and below the height of the second seal element an approximately equal distance when in an undeflected state. The first and second seal elements can also be generally symmetrical about a common central radial axis.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second seal element can have radially outwardly opening compression grooves spaced axially above and below the recess, the grooves defining upper and lower lip portions of the second sealing element adapted to seal against respective surfaces. The first seal element can be composed of an elastomeric material, while the second seal element can be composed of a polymeric material such as PEEK or PTFE or the like. The first seal element and second seal element can be bonded together.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect, a process chamber comprises a container defining a processing space and an access opening into the processing space, a lid convertible between a sealed condition whereat it seals the access opening into the processing space, and a loading/unloading condition whereat the access opening is uncovered for insertion/withdrawal of a substrate, and a seal as set forth above for sealing an interface between the container and the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect, a seal for sealing an interface between a container and a lid of a process chamber comprises a first seal element having a deflectable portion and a protrusion extending radially from the deflectable portion, and a second seal element having at least one sealing surface and a radially extending recess in which the protrusion of the first seal element is received. The protrusion and recess interlock to restrict separation of the first and second seal elements, and the protrusion has an inclined surface that is radially coextensive with a major portion of the sealing surface and extends to a maximum axial extent of the protrusion, such maximum axial extent being generally radially aligned with a midpoint of the sealing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to yet another aspect, a seal for sealing an interface between a container and a lid of a process chamber comprises a first seal element having a deflectable portion and a protrusion extending radially from the deflectable portion, and a second seal element having at least one sealing surface and a radially extending recess in which the protrusion of the first seal element is received. The protrusion and recess interlock to restrict separation of the first and second seal elements, and the protrusion has an inclined surface that is radially coextensive with a major portion of the sealing surface and extends to a maximum axial extent of the protrusion. The first and second seal elements are generally symmetrical about a common central radial axis.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a process chamber <b>10</b> comprises a container <b>12</b>, a lid <b>14</b>, and an interface <b>16</b> therebetween. The container <b>12</b> defines a processing space <b>20</b> (and an access opening <b>22</b> thereinto). The lid <b>14</b> is movable between a closed or sealed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), whereat it seals the access opening <b>22</b> into the processing space <b>20</b>, and a loading/unloading position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), whereat the access opening <b>22</b> is uncovered.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The process chamber <b>10</b> can be an ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) and/or ultra-high-purity (UHP) chamber which is part of a semiconductor manufacturing process. When the lid <b>14</b> is in its load-unload position, the substrate <b>24</b> (e.g., a wafer) can be inserted through the access opening <b>22</b> into the processing space <b>20</b> and staged on the pedestal <b>26</b>. Once the lid <b>14</b> is moved to its closed position, the interface <b>16</b> is sealed, the substrate <b>24</b> can be processed within the container <b>12</b>. The processing can comprise photo-masking, deposition, oxidation, nitridation, ion implantation, diffusion, and/or etching, for example. After the wafer-processing step, the vacuum can be released within the processing space <b>20</b>, and the lid <b>14</b> can be moved from its closed position to its load-unload position. The substrate <b>24</b> can be withdrawn from the processing space <b>20</b> (through the access opening <b>22</b>) and the steps repeated for the next substrate (e.g., the next wafer in the processing line).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The container <b>12</b> includes an interface surface <b>30</b> surrounding the access opening <b>22</b> and the lid <b>14</b> includes an interface surface <b>32</b> seated against the container's interface surface <b>30</b> when in its sealed position. These surfaces <b>30</b>/<b>32</b> together define the interface <b>16</b> between the container <b>12</b> and the lid <b>14</b>. A clamp <b>34</b> (or other suitable means) can be provided to brace, lock, or otherwise hold the lid <b>14</b> against the container <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The container's interface surface <b>30</b> and/or the lid's interface surface <b>32</b> includes at least one groove <b>36</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the groove <b>36</b> has a rectangular cross-sectional shape. But, the groove <b>36</b> can have a trapezoidal or dove-tail cross-section shape (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>), or any other suitable cross-section shape. The groove <b>36</b> is continuous around the rim (e.g, perimeter, circumference) surrounding the processing chamber <b>20</b> and/or the access opening <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, an exemplary seal <b>40</b> is situated in groove <b>36</b>, which in this embodiment has a dovetail shape cross-section. The seal <b>40</b> has a generally ring-like shape, so as to be seated in the continuous groove <b>36</b>. As will be appreciated, the seal <b>40</b> is shown in an undeflected state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and in a deflected state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The seal <b>40</b> generally comprises a first seal element, in the form of an elastomeric seal element <b>44</b>, and a second seal element, in the form of a polymeric seal element <b>48</b>. The elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> has a deflectable portion <b>52</b> adapted to be deflected directly by the lid <b>14</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The radially outer surface of the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> includes an axially central ridge <b>54</b> for retaining the seal <b>40</b> in the groove <b>36</b>. The ridge <b>54</b> can also be designed or shaped to complement the shape of the groove <b>36</b> so as to engage a sidewall of the groove <b>36</b> when the seal is deflected to thereby crowd the radially outer free space of the groove to provide better energizing of the polymeric seal element <b>48</b>. A protrusion <b>56</b> extends radially from the deflectable portion <b>52</b> of the elastomeric seal <b>44</b> and is received in a recess <b>60</b> of the polymeric seal <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The polymeric seal element <b>48</b> includes an upper arm <b>64</b> and a lower arm <b>68</b> extending radially from a central body <b>72</b>. The upper and lower arms <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> each have respective sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. The upper and lower arms <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> and central axially extending body <b>72</b> together generally define the recess <b>60</b> in which the protrusion <b>56</b> of the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As will be appreciated, the protrusion <b>56</b> may have a shape and/or size corresponding to the shape of the recess <b>60</b> prior to insertion therein, or may be deflected such that it conforms to the shape of the recess <b>60</b> when inserted therein. Compression of the protrusion <b>56</b> within the recess <b>60</b> can result in a preload being applied to the upper and/or lower arms <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> to achieve a desired sealing load. In the illustrated embodiment, the protrusion <b>56</b> completely fills the void space of the recess <b>60</b>. Moreover, the protrusion <b>56</b> and recess <b>60</b> interlock to restrict separation of the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> and the polymeric seal element <b>48</b>. This interlock is created due to the axial extent of the opening of the recess <b>60</b> being smaller than the axial extent of the protrusion <b>56</b> at a point radially inward of the opening of the recess <b>60</b>. The interlocking fit between the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> and the polymeric seal element <b>48</b> can also rotationally interlock the parts to restrict rotation of the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> relative to the polymeric part <b>48</b> to prevent rotation of the seal <b>40</b> in the groove <b>36</b> during seal compression.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The protrusion <b>56</b> has upper and lower inclined surfaces <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> that are generally radially coextensive with a major portion of the sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, respectively. The recess <b>60</b> has abutment surfaces <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> abutting the inclined surfaces <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> of the protrusion <b>56</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper and lower inclined surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> generally extend from a maximum axial extent of the protrusion <b>56</b>, that is generally radially aligned with a midpoint of the sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>, to a radially outer extent of the protrusion <b>56</b>. Sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> and respective abutment surfaces <b>84</b> and <b>86</b> generally slope away from each other in the radially outward direction thereby forming wedging portions <b>88</b> and <b>90</b> of the second seal element <b>48</b> which, along with inclined surfaces <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>, assist in applying an axial sealing force to the sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b> upon compression of the first seal element <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the lid <b>14</b> is converted to the sealed condition whereat it seals the access opening <b>22</b> into the processing space <b>20</b>, the seal <b>40</b> is deflected as shown. As will be appreciated, during conversion to the sealed condition the lid <b>14</b> contacts the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> prior to the polymeric seal element <b>48</b>. As the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b> is deflected, the lid <b>14</b> eventually contacts the sealing surface <b>74</b> on the upper arm <b>68</b> and compresses the polymeric seal element <b>48</b>. The sealing surface <b>76</b> on the lower arm seals against the bottom of the groove <b>36</b>. The size (e.g., the radial extent) of the sealing surfaces can be altered to alter the sealing load.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As will be appreciated, when the seal <b>40</b> is deflected by the lid <b>14</b>, the upper and lower arms <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> act on the protrusion <b>56</b> of the elastomeric seal element <b>44</b>. A reactionary force is therefore applied by the protrusion <b>56</b> to energize the upper and lower arms <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> to thereby maintain a tight seal at sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. As the deflectable portion of the elastomeric seal <b>44</b> is deflected axially into the groove <b>36</b> by the lid <b>14</b>, it tends to expand radially and apply a force in the radially inward direction to the radially outer surfaces <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> of the wedge portions <b>88</b> and <b>90</b>. This force is at least in part reacted by the inclined surfaces <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> of the protrusion <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As a result, the wedging portion <b>88</b> is forced upward and the wedging portion <b>90</b> is forced downward thereby applying, respectively, axial sealing forces to sealing surfaces <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. This interaction between the elastomer seal element <b>44</b> and polymer seal element <b>48</b> is opposite to the function of seals in the prior art where radial forces applied to the second seal element by the first seal element tend to rotate the sealing surfaces away from the surfaces to be sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As will also now be understood, during compression of the seal <b>40</b> the upper and lower arms <b>64</b> and <b>68</b> pivot of the polymeric seal element <b>48</b> about pivots points P that are located outside of the body of the polymeric seal element <b>48</b>. Unlike conventional sealing elements that pivot about a point within their bodies, the sealing element <b>48</b> provides a sealing surface with a larger radial extent for a given seal element size.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, another exemplary seal <b>140</b> is situated in a groove <b>36</b>, which in this embodiment also has a dovetail shape cross-section. The seal <b>140</b> has a generally ring-like shape, so as to be seated in the continuous groove <b>36</b>. As will be appreciated, the seal <b>140</b> is shown in an undeflected state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and in a deflected state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The seal <b>140</b> generally comprises a first seal element, in the form of an elastomeric seal element <b>144</b>, and a second seal element, in the form of a polymeric seal element <b>148</b>. The elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> has a deflectable portion <b>152</b> adapted to be deflected directly by the lid <b>114</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A protrusion <b>156</b> extends radially from the deflectable portion <b>152</b> of the elastomeric seal <b>144</b> and is received in a recess <b>160</b> of the polymeric seal <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The polymeric seal element <b>148</b> includes an upper arm <b>164</b> and a lower arm <b>168</b> extending radially from a central body <b>172</b>. The upper and lower arms <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> each have respective sealing surfaces <b>174</b> and <b>176</b>. The upper and lower arms <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> and central axially extending body <b>172</b> together generally define the recess <b>160</b> in which the protrusion <b>156</b> of the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the illustrated embodiment, the recess <b>160</b> has a generally dovetail shape cross-section, and the protrusion <b>156</b> has a corresponding shape when inserted therein. As will be appreciated, the protrusion <b>156</b> may have a shape and/or size corresponding to the shape of the recess <b>160</b> prior to insertion therein, or may be deflected such that it conforms to the shape of the recess <b>160</b> when inserted therein. Compression of the protrusion <b>156</b> within the recess <b>160</b> can result in a preload being applied to the upper and/or lower arms <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> to achieve a desired sealing load. Moreover, the protrusion <b>156</b> and recess <b>160</b> interlock to restrict separation of the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> and the polymeric seal element <b>148</b>. This interlock is created due to the axial extent of the opening of the recess being smaller than the axial extent of the protrusion at a point radially inside of the opening of the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The interlocking fit between the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> and the polymeric seal element <b>148</b> can also rotationally interlock the parts to restrict rotation of the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> relative to the polymeric part <b>148</b> to prevent rotation of the seal <b>140</b> in the groove <b>136</b> during seal compression.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Similar to the seal <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the protrusion <b>156</b> has upper and lower inclined surfaces <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> that are generally radially coextensive with the sealing surfaces <b>174</b> and <b>176</b>, respectively. The recess <b>160</b> has abutment surfaces <b>184</b> and <b>186</b> abutting the inclined surfaces <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> of the protrusion <b>156</b>. Each sealing surface <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> and respective abutment surface <b>184</b> and <b>186</b> generally slope away from each other in the radially outward direction thereby forming wedging portions <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> of the second seal element <b>148</b> which assist in applying an axial sealing force to the sealing surfaces <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> upon compression of the first seal element <b>144</b>, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the lid <b>114</b> is converted to the sealed condition whereat it seals the access opening <b>122</b> into the processing space <b>120</b>, the seal <b>140</b> is deflected as shown. As will be appreciated, during conversion to the sealed condition the lid <b>114</b> contacts the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> prior to the polymeric seal element <b>148</b>. As the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> is deflected, the lid <b>114</b> eventually contacts the sealing surface <b>174</b> on the upper arm <b>168</b> and compresses the polymeric seal element <b>148</b>. The sealing surface <b>176</b> on the lower arm seals against the bottom of the groove <b>136</b>. The size (e.g., the radial extent) of the sealing surfaces can be altered to alter the sealing load.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As will be appreciated, when the seal <b>140</b> is deflected by the lid <b>114</b>, the upper and lower arms <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> act on the protrusion <b>156</b> of the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b>. A reactionary force is therefore applied by the protrusion <b>156</b> to energize sealing lips of the upper and lower arms <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> to thereby maintain a tight seal. Deflection of the arms <b>164</b> and <b>168</b> during compression can also contribute to a sealing force applied to the sealing surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The polymeric seal element <b>148</b> is supported by the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b>, and the seal elements are adapted to seal in series. The elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> has a height, h<b>1</b>, that is larger than a height, h<b>2</b>, of the polymeric seal element <b>148</b>, with the elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> extending above and below the height of the polymeric seal element <b>148</b> an approximately equal distance when in an undeflected state. The elastomeric seal element <b>144</b> and polymeric seal element <b>148</b> are generally symmetrical about a common central axis perpendicular to their respective heights, giving the seal <b>140</b> symmetry about the same axis. As will be appreciated, such symmetry enables the seal <b>140</b> to be reversible such that it can be installed in the groove <b>136</b> in either orientation. This feature eliminates the possibility of a seal being installed upside down, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the illustrated embodiment, the polymeric seal element <b>148</b> has radially outwardly opening compression grooves <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> spaced axially above and below the recess <b>160</b>. These grooves <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> define the upper and lower lip portions <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> of the polymeric seal element adapted to seal against respective surfaces. Such compression grooves <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> are optional and may be omitted in some applications. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a seal <b>140</b> without compression grooves <b>180</b> and <b>182</b>. Generally, the compression grooves <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> will decrease the sealing pressure applied by the protrusion <b>156</b> to the sealing surfaces <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> when the seal <b>140</b> is deflected, since the lips will have a reduced thickness in an axial dimension.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The elastomeric seal elements can be made from a wide variety of materials including Fluorocarbon (FKM, FPM), High Performance Fluoroelastomers (HiFluor), Perfluoroelastomers (FFKM, Elastomeric PTFE), Polyacrylate (ACM), Ethylene Acrylate (AEM), Isobutylene-Isoprene (IIR), Polychloroprene Rubber (CR), Ethylene Propylene Rubber (EPM, EPR, EPDM), Fluorosilicone (FVMQ), Acrylonitrile-Butadiene (NBR), Hydrogenated Nitrile (HNBR, HSN), Polyurethane (AU, EU), Silicone (VMQ, PVMQ), and Tetrafluoroethylene-Propylene (AFLAS registered trademark). The polymeric seal can be made from polymeric materials including Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Polyamide (PA), Fluoropolymers (PFA), Polyetherimide (PEI aka Ultem), nylon, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the first and second seal elements of seals have been described as an elastomeric seal element and a polymeric seal element, other materials can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. Further, the individual seal elements can be snapped together to form the seals. To this end, the wedge shape of the radially inner portion of the protrusion as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> can assist in axially expanding the recess to allow the seal elements to snap together. In some instances, the seal elements can be bonded together to restrict separation thereof in addition to the mechanical interlock between the protrusion and recess.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although the processing chamber, the seals, the elastomeric seal elements, the polymeric seal elements, and/or associated methods have been shown and described with respect to certain embodiments, it is obvious that equivalent alterations and modifications will occur to others skilled in the art. In regard to the various functions performed by the above described elements (e.g., components, assemblies, systems, devices, compositions, etc.), the terms (including a reference to a &#x201c;means&#x201d;) used to describe such elements are intended to correspond, unless otherwise indicated, to any element which performs the specified function of the described element (i.e., that is functionally equivalent), even though not structurally equivalent to the disclosed structure which performs the function. In addition, while a particular feature of the invention may have been described above with respect to only one or more of several illustrated embodiments, such feature may be combined with one or more other features of the other embodiments, as may be desired and advantageous for any given or particular application.</p>
