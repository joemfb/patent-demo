Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements. In the description of the present invention, if it is determined that a detailed description of commonly-used technologies or structures related to the invention may unnecessarily obscure the subject matter of the invention, the detailed description will be omitted.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram of an X-ray detecting system <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the X-ray detecting system <b>1</b> includes an energy source <b>10</b>, an X-ray detector <b>100</b>, a controller <b>200</b>, a signal processor <b>300</b>, and a display device <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The energy source <b>10</b> is a radiation emitter which emits radiation, such as an X-ray or the like, onto a subject <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The X-ray detector <b>100</b> includes a plurality of light sensing pixels for sensing X-rays in a flat panel. The X-ray detector <b>100</b> includes a plurality of photodiodes (PDs) and a plurality of switching devices which detect a transmitted amount of the X-ray. If the X-ray is applied to the photodiodes when a reverse bias is applied to the photodiodes, an electric signal corresponding to the transmitted amount of the X-ray is generated in each of the photodiodes. The electric signal is read out through a data line and then input into a readout integrated circuit (IC)</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The controller <b>200</b> controls operations of the energy source <b>10</b>, the X-ray detector <b>100</b>, and the display device <b>400</b> to form an X-ray image which has been offset-corrected. The controller <b>200</b> controls a time when the energy source <b>10</b> is to emit the X-ray and a time for which the X-ray detector <b>100</b> is to detect the X-ray.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The signal processor <b>300</b> converts the electric signal output from the X-ray detector <b>100</b> into a digital signal. The signal processor <b>300</b> generates an offset image and an X-ray image from the digital signal. The offset image may be updated by averaging a previously generated offset image and a currently generated offset image. The signal processor <b>300</b> subtracts an offset image, which has been generated before the X-ray is emitted, from the X-ray image to generate an X-ray image which has been offset-corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The display device <b>400</b> displays the X-ray image which has been offset-corrected. The display device <b>400</b> may be a liquid crystal display (LCD), an organic light-emitting diode display, a plasma display device, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of an X-ray detector <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the X-ray detector <b>100</b> includes a panel <b>110</b>, a gate driver <b>130</b>, and a readout IC <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The panel <b>110</b> senses the X-ray emitted from the energy source <b>100</b>, converts a sensed signal into an electric signal through a photoelectric transformation, and outputs the electric signal. The panel <b>110</b> includes a plurality of light sensing pixels PX, which are arrayed in a matrix form, a plurality of gate lines GL and a plurality of data lines DL. The plurality of gate lines GL are arrayed to be orthogonal to the plurality of data lines DL. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <b>20</b> light sensing pixels PX are exemplarily arrayed in 5 columns and 5 rows, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each of the light sensing pixels PX includes a photodiode (not shown), which senses an X-ray and outputs an electric signal (e.g., a photo-detection voltage), and a transistor (not shown) which switches the electric signal output from the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The photodiodes are amorphous silicon (a-Si) PIN photodiodes which receive visible rays. The X-ray detector <b>100</b> applies a reverse bias to both ends of each of the photodiodes to use the a-Si PIN photodiodes as light-receiving devices. However, when the reverse bias is applied to the photodiodes for a long time, diode characteristics degraded according to material characteristics of amorphous silicon (a-Si).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order to solve the degradation of the diode characteristics, both ends of a conventional photodiode are made equipotential using a method of turning on an electroluminance (EL) sheet before the conventional photodiode receives light (Optical Flashing Method). However, if the EL sheet is inserted, the EL sheet requires a time to sufficiently make both ends of the photodiode equipotential. Also, a capacitance of the photodiode is filled with external light, not with an electric signal. In this case, a load is applied to the photodiode by the capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Before a photodiode receives light, i.e., although the photodiode is degraded in an idle section, an X-ray detector not using an EL sheet continuously applies a reverse bias to the photodiode (Scrubbing Method). In this case, if the reverse bias is continuously applied to the photodiode, characteristics of the photodiode are degraded, thereby shortening a lifespan of the photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Accordingly, an equipotential voltage is formed by an electric signal at a photodiode in an idle section without giving a simulation such as external light using an EL sheet. Also, transistors are added so that a reverse bias is not excessively applied to the photodiode so as not to give stress. This will be described in more detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gate driver <b>130</b> sequentially applies gate voltages to the plurality of gate lines GL. If the gate signals are applied to the gate lines GL, the transistors are turned on. If the gate signals are not applied to the gate lines GL, the transistors are turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If the transistors are turned on, the electric signal provided from the photodiodes is output to the readout IC <b>150</b> through the data lines DL. The gate driver <b>130</b> may be formed in an IC form to be installed on a side of the panel <b>110</b> or may be directly formed through a thin film process.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The readout IC <b>150</b> includes a signal detector <b>160</b> and a multiplexer <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The signal detector <b>160</b> includes a plurality of amplifiers which correspond to the plurality of data lines DL one-by-one, and each of the amplifiers includes an operational amplifier OP and a capacitor CP.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The operational amplifiers OP include input ports connected to the data lines DL, second input ports receiving reference voltages Vref, and output ports. The reference voltages Vref may be ground voltages 0V. The first input ports may be negative terminals of the operational amplifiers OP, and the second input ports may be positive terminals of the operational amplifiers OP. The output ports are connected to the multiplexer <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Ends of the capacitors CP are electrically connected between the first input ports and the output ports of the operational amplifiers OP.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The multiplexer <b>170</b> receives voltage signals from the operational amplifiers OP of the signal detector <b>160</b> and sequentially outputs the voltage signals to the signal processor <b>300</b>. The multiplexer <b>170</b> includes switches which respectively correspond to the amplifiers OP.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The voltage signals output from the multiplexer <b>170</b> are input into the signal processor <b>300</b>. The signal processor <b>300</b> includes a control circuit (not shown) which converts the voltage signals into image signals and provides the image signals to the display device <b>400</b> via controller <b>200</b>. Therefore, an image captured by the X-ray detector <b>100</b> is displayed on the display device <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an internal circuit of a pixel of X-ray detector panel <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
