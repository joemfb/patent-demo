<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a method for customizing a secondary device, the method being directed primarily at, but not exclusively to, redefining at least one user interface element in the secondary device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">We are currently in an era where individuality is a trait highly desired by the masses. There are countless expressions of individuality in the media, especially on the world wide web in the form of blogs, podcasts, online journals, and the like. In this information age, originality and individuality are some factors which ensure that interest in a particular expression of individuality is sustainable. Similarly, players in popular online games like Second Life and World of Warcraft use the games as outlets to express their individuality in terms of defining their game characters' skills, appearance and persona.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A consequence of the advent of the information age has been the increasing adoption of portable digital devices by the masses. While there are certain devices, such as, for example, mobile phones and portable media players that have become nearly ubiquitous, many of the users would prefer that their own device is different (special) compared to other users' devices. There are already ways to differentiate an exterior aspect of such devices, such as by using paint on casing, adhering shimmery bits to the casing, adhering decals, using coloured silicone skins and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are also ways to differentiate an appearance of an interface for such devices, but the current ways to do so are limited to only changing themes, wallpaper and shortcuts, which effectively minimizes the possible variations of changing the interface appearance of such products. It is thus difficult to obtain a unique interface for such devices. The users also currently face difficulty in altering a usability of their devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is provided a host implemented method for redefining at least one user interface element on a secondary device. The method may include connecting the secondary device to the host for communication between the host and the secondary device; redefining the at least one user interface element using an application running on the host; reviewing the at least one user interface element as redefined using the application (possibly including a visual preview of the at least one user interface element as redefined when viewed on the secondary device); determining whether the secondary device is able to support the at least one user interface element as redefined using the application; and incorporating the at least one user interface element redefined using the application onto the secondary device. Support for the at least one user interface element may depend on parameters such as, for example, amount of onboard memory, amount of onboard storage capacity and display capability for the secondary device. The application running on the host either may be manually activated or may be automatically activated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The secondary device may be connected to the host via either a wired connection or a wireless connection. The wireless connection may be using wireless technologies such as, for example, Wifi, Bluetooth, WiMax, infra-red and UWB.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is preferable that the at least one user interface element may be selected from for example, controls, cursors, background, text font, icons, progress bars, selector bars, and hierarchy of accessing data.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The host implemented method may further include approving transfer of the at least one user interface element as redefined using the application to the secondary device, after determining whether the secondary device is able to support the at least one user interface element as redefined using the application. It is preferable that user interface elements of the secondary device not being redefined using an application running on the host are unaffected subsequent to the incorporation of the at least one user interface element redefined using the application.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is advantageous that the secondary device may be able to transfer at least one user element to a second host to redefine least one user interface element on the second host. The first and second hosts may be either a PC or a server.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the secondary device may be, for example, mobile phone, media player, PDA, and handheld games console.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously, redefining user interface elements may include actions such as, for example, changing controls, changing radio frequency ranges, changing radio frequency preset lists, changing animation sequences, cropping backgrounds, enlarging backgrounds, changing text font, changing text content, changing text location, changing cursors, changing icons, changing progress bars, changing selector bars, and changing hierarchy of accessing data. It is advantageous that the at least one redefined user interface element may form part of a theme for the secondary device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is provided a host implemented method <b>20</b> for redefining at least one user interface element on a secondary device. The host may be a PC, a server or any apparatus which is able to facilitate processing and transfer of data. The secondary device may be a portable digital device, such as, for example, mobile phone, media player, PDA, handheld games console and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>show some representative examples of user interface elements found on the secondary device. The user interface element may be background <b>80</b>, cursors <b>81</b>, text font <b>82</b>, icons <b>84</b>, progress bars <b>86</b>, selector bars <b>88</b>, descriptive text <b>90</b> (eg &#x201c;Now Playing&#x201d; replacing &#x201c;Current Song&#x201d;), hierarchy of accessing data (not shown) and the like. The at least one redefined user interface element may form part of a theme for the secondary device, the theme generally affecting an appearance and usability of an interface of the secondary device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method <b>20</b> may include connecting the secondary device to the host for communication <b>22</b> between the host and the secondary device. The secondary device may be connected to the host via either a wired connection (cables) or a wireless connection. The wireless connection may be using wireless technologies such as, for example, Wifi, Bluetooth, WiMax, infra-red and UWB.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A user may access an application on the host which is able to redefine the at least one user interface element on the secondary device <b>24</b>. The application on the host either may be manually activated by the user or may be automatically activated when the secondary device is connected to the host. The application may reside on any particular operating system. It is preferable that the application is activated only when the secondary device is connected to the host. However, the application may still be activated when the secondary device is not connected to the host if there is a database storing various themes for the secondary device (the database need not be on the host and may be stored in a remote server), with each of the various themes having user interface elements that are customizable using the application even when the secondary device is not connected to the host. Alternatively, there may be templates in the application to assist in creating a new theme for the secondary device. Thus redefining of the at least one user interface element on the secondary device may be enabled without having the connection to the secondary device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a representative sample of a GUI <b>40</b> for the application for redefining a user interface element. In this instance, the application may be known as the &#x201c;Device Customisation Tool&#x201d;. In this instance, the application is being used to redefine a user interface element for a Zen Vision M media player by Creative Technology Ltd. A visual representation <b>41</b> of an existing interface of the Zen Vision M media player is shown in a first half <b>42</b> of the GUI <b>40</b>. In the instance when the secondary device is not connected to the host, the visual representation <b>41</b> may be of a theme stored in the database mentioned earlier. A pull down menu <b>44</b> may show a list of secondary devices which are recognized by the application. The list of secondary devices need not be restricted to a particular type of device or devices made by a particular manufacturer. The list of secondary devices may be enlarged if the application detects connection of a compatible secondary device that is not in the list. A second half <b>46</b> of the GUI <b>40</b> may include tabs for redefining various aspects of the user interface elements. While the GUI <b>40</b> is shown to be split into two halves <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>, it should be noted that the GUI <b>40</b> may have as many portions as required.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The representative non-limiting tabs shown are Theme <b>48</b>, Mode <b>50</b>, Radio <b>52</b>, Layout <b>54</b> and Startup <b>56</b>. The tab currently being shown in the second half <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the Theme <b>48</b> tab. Selecting the Theme <b>48</b> tab allows the user to customize a most commonly viewed interface for the secondary device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It can be seen that there are sub-tabs in the Theme <b>48</b> tab. A Background selection <b>58</b> sub-tab is shown for the Theme <b>48</b> tab. The user selecting a change button <b>60</b> would be re-directed to a background sub-window <b>62</b> showing various backgrounds available for selection as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The background may be images in file formats such as, for example, jpg, bmp, gif, tiff, png and the like may also be used as backgrounds. Selecting a desired image from a selection window <b>64</b> would be required for background selection. The background sub-window <b>62</b> also includes a preview portion <b>66</b> which enables cropping using selector bar <b>68</b> of the desired image for use as the background of the most commonly viewed interface for the secondary device. The cropped view of the desired image is then shown in a central screen <b>59</b> of the Background selection <b>58</b> sub-tab. While the background sub-window <b>62</b> shown is of a MS Windows-centric format, it should be noted that it should not be deemed to be a limiting representation. The user may also be able to select a colour of text when not highlighted by a highlight bar by selecting a first change button <b>72</b>. Selecting the first change button <b>72</b> may activate a colour palette <b>120</b> for colour selection of the colour of text as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The user may also be able to select a colour of title bar text by selecting a second change button <b>122</b>. Selecting the second change button <b>122</b> may also activate the colour palette <b>120</b> for colour selection of the colour of title bar text as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It can be seen that there is a sub-tab for highlight bar selection <b>70</b> for the Theme <b>48</b> tab. The user selecting the highlight bar <b>70</b> sub-tab may be directed to an interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. It can be seen that a colour of the highlight bar and text colour when within the highlight bar may be varied using respective change buttons <b>124</b> which individually activate the colour palette <b>120</b> for colour selection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">There is also another sub-tab for scroll bar selection <b>74</b> for the Theme <b>48</b> tab. The user selecting the scroll bar <b>70</b> sub-tab may be directed to an interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It can be seen that a colour of the scroll bar and a colour of a thumb within the scroll bar may be varied using respective change buttons <b>126</b> which individually activate the colour palette <b>120</b> for colour selection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Another sub-tab for the Theme <b>48</b> tab is a Message Box <b>76</b> sub-tab. The user selecting the Message Box <b>76</b> sub-tab may be directed to an interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It can be seen that a background colour of a message box and colour of text in the message box may be varied using respective change buttons <b>128</b> which individually activate the colour palette <b>120</b> for colour selection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">There is also shown a Search Bar <b>78</b> sub-tab with the Theme <b>48</b> tab. The user selecting the Search Bar <b>78</b> sub-tab may be directed to an interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. It should be noted that the Search Bar (as shown) is an alphabet-based facility enabling access of files stored in a media player. The Search Bar may also be numeric based. It can be seen that a colour of text in the search bar and a colour of a highlight ball may be varied using respective change buttons <b>130</b> which individually activate the colour palette <b>120</b> for colour selection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a similar manner, selecting the Mode <b>50</b> tab allows the user to customize usability in specific modes when using the secondary device. The modes available may be dependent on the secondary device. The modes are, for example, radio, video player, picture frame, shuffle, party, audio recorder, audio book reader and the like. The user selecting the Mode <b>50</b> tab may be directed to an interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The user may select a mode (functionality) from a list of modes <b>140</b> and may be able to define functions for each control on the secondary device in the particular mode. A representation of controls for the secondary device is provided, and a pull-down menu <b>144</b> is available to allocate a function for each control in the particular mode. The pull-down menu <b>144</b> may generally include standard options in the particular mode, such as, for example, record, delete, or playback in audio recorder mode. In this regard, the user is able to customize usability of the secondary device in each particular mode in accordance with the user's preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, selecting the Radio <b>52</b> tab allows the user to set radio presets for various countries/states. The user would then be able to access pre-set radio stations in various countries/states which may have different frequency ranges. This assists the user where a majority of the radio stations make broadcasts in a language(s) that are not familiar to the user, and the user is able to zero-in on the radio stations which make broadcasts in a language(s) that is familiar to the user. Alternatively, the user may only want a list of radio stations broadcasting a particular genre of music in various countries/states which may have different frequency ranges. The user is able to specify bandwidth <b>150</b> such as, for example, FM, AM, SW, MW and the like. The country/state may also be specified <b>152</b>. Finally, an editable listing <b>154</b> of the pre-set radio stations is also shown.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the user selects the Layout <b>54</b> tab, the user is able to define layouts of screens in various modes of the secondary device. When the sub-tab Title Bar <b>160</b> is selected (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), it can be seen that an alignment for the title bar may be defined to be aligned <b>162</b> either at a top or bottom of a screen of the secondary device. The user may also select for text to be read in a right-to-left order rather than in an Anglicized left-to-right order by checking box <b>164</b>. This facility of changing the order of reading text may enable the secondary device to be usable for users of languages other than English.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The user selecting a Context Menu <b>166</b> sub-tab may be directed to an interface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. It can be seen that an alignment for the context menu may be defined to be aligned <b>168</b> either at a left or a right side of the screen of the secondary device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the user selects a Now Playing Screen <b>170</b> sub-tab that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the user is able to rearrange a location of representations in the Now Playing Screen, the representations being, for example, Audio track information <b>172</b>, status and playback progress bar <b>174</b>, current mode <b>176</b>, album art <b>178</b>, track counter <b>180</b> and so forth. Rearranging the location of the representations on a template <b>182</b> by drag and place actions would enable the representations in the Now Playing Screen on the secondary device to be correspondingly rearranged. Similarly, when the user selects a Radio Screen <b>184</b> sub-tab that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the user is able to rearrange a location of representations in the Radio Screen, the representations being, for example, antenna icon <b>186</b>, current mode <b>188</b>, tuning frequency information <b>190</b>, preset station location <b>192</b>, station name <b>194</b> and so forth. Rearranging the location of the representations on a template <b>196</b> by drag and place actions would enable the representations in the Radio Screen on the secondary device to be correspondingly rearranged. The user is also able to rearrange a location of representations in a Recording Screen when a Recording Screen <b>198</b> sub-tab is selected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The representations may be, for example, time elapsed for recording <b>200</b>, remaining storage space for recording <b>202</b>, scale denoting clarity of recorded sounds <b>204</b>, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that when the user selects the Layout <b>54</b> tab, the user is also able to remove representations depicted in the sub-tabs <b>160</b>, <b>166</b>, <b>170</b>, <b>184</b>, <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another tab that may be selected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is the Startup <b>56</b> tab. The user may change a startup animation sequence for the secondary device by selecting the Startup <b>56</b> tab. A sequence <b>210</b> of image frames is shown. A first image frame <b>212</b> denotes a first image shown during the startup animation sequence, with consecutive image frames being laid over the first image frame <b>212</b> in sequence. The image frames may be rearranged in the sequence <b>210</b> using drag and place actions. The images need not be related in any manner to each other, ie it may be a slide show of images of any type. The image in each frame may be varied by selecting respective change buttons <b>214</b>. The user may also be able to preview a sequence of images during the startup animation sequence of the secondary device by selecting a start preview button <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Another tab that may be selected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is the Text <b>300</b> tab. The user may amend text strings in the secondary device by selecting the Text <b>300</b> tab. An &#x201c;original&#x201d; window <b>302</b> denotes the default text strings used in the secondary device. A &#x201c;my text&#x201d; window <b>304</b> denotes the text strings that will replace those in the secondary device. For example, the terms &#x201c;Music Library&#x201d; and &#x201c;FM Radio&#x201d; are replaced by &#x201c;My Songs&#x201d; and &#x201c;My Radio&#x201d; respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> denotes other amendments as well. The text strings in the &#x201c;original&#x201d; window <b>302</b> are locked and may not be amended. However, the text strings in the &#x201c;my text&#x201d; window <b>304</b> may be amended by selecting and amending the text strings. The side-by-side arrangement of the &#x201c;original&#x201d; window <b>302</b> and the &#x201c;my text&#x201d; window <b>304</b> enables the user to confirm that a correct text string is amended when compared to the default text strings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A final tab that may be selected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is the Option Menu <b>320</b> tab. Selection of the Option Menu <b>320</b> tab may enable the user to customize various menus in the secondary device. A pull-down menu <b>322</b> may be available to select a menu which the user would like to customize. The user may be able to add/remove different options from a menu and rearrange their order in the menu. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> depicts a selection of the &#x201c;Now Playing&#x201d; menu. A first list <b>324</b> shows default options and a default arrangement of the options in the &#x201c;Now Playing&#x201d; menu. A second list <b>326</b> shows amended options (removal of a &#x201c;Main Menu&#x201d; option) and an amended arrangement of the options in the &#x201c;Now Playing&#x201d; menu. An &#x201c;add&#x201d; button <b>328</b> may be triggered to add an option(s) from the first list <b>324</b> to the second list <b>326</b>. Similarly, a &#x201c;remove&#x201d; button <b>330</b> may be triggered to remove an option(s) from the second list <b>326</b>. A &#x201c;move up&#x201d; button <b>332</b> and a &#x201c;move down&#x201d; button <b>334</b> may be triggered to arrange the options in the second list <b>326</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the GUI <b>40</b>, a &#x201c;new&#x201d; button <b>71</b> may be triggered when the user would like to define a new theme for the secondary device. An &#x201c;open&#x201d; button <b>73</b> may be triggered when the user would like to amend at least one user interface element of an existing theme for the secondary device. Triggering a &#x201c;save&#x201d; button <b>75</b> may be to store a theme as amended while triggering a &#x201c;save as&#x201d; button <b>69</b> may be to save a theme using an alternative moniker. Consequently, triggering a &#x201c;close&#x201d; button <b>63</b> would cease operations of the GUI <b>40</b> for the application for redefining a user interface element. A &#x201c;restore default&#x201d; button <b>79</b> may be selected to restore all factory settings in relation to the user interface elements for the secondary device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Subsequent to redefining at least one user interface element using the application, the at least one user interface element as redefined may be reviewed <b>26</b>. Reviewing the at least one user interface element may include a visual preview of the at least one user interface element as redefined when viewed on the secondary device. The visual preview of the at least one user interface element as redefined may be one aspect of the application and may be enabled by pressing a transfer preview button <b>77</b> in the GUI <b>40</b> for the application for redefining a user interface element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a global preview screen <b>100</b> that is activated when the transfer preview button <b>77</b> is triggered in the GUI <b>40</b>. The global preview screen <b>100</b> shows the various appearances of the interface (as defined by the user) of the secondary device subsequent to the changes made to the at least one user interface element using the application. If the user is not satisfied with the changes made to the at least one user interface element, the user may revert back to the various tabs <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> of the GUI <b>40</b> to make further changes to the at least one user interface element. It should be noted that reviewing the at least one user interface element may include a simulation of usability of the secondary device in relation to accessing different modes or switching between modes.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, a set of instructions running on the host may determine whether the secondary device is able to support all changes <b>28</b> made to the at least one user interface element. Checks to determine adequate support for all the changes made to the at least one user interface element may include, for example, amount of onboard memory, amount of onboard storage capacity, display capability (screen size and resolution) for the secondary device and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the user approves of all the changes made to the at least one user interface element based on a review of the global preview screen <b>100</b>, the user may trigger a &#x201c;transfer&#x201d; button <b>61</b> to activate transfer of the redefined at least one user interface element to the secondary device <b>30</b>. Subsequent to the transfer of the redefined at least one user interface element to the secondary device, the redefined at least one user interface element may be incorporated onto the secondary device <b>32</b>. This may require the secondary device <b>32</b> to be restarted. It should be noted that the &#x201c;transfer&#x201d; button <b>61</b> may be omitted from the GUI <b>40</b> as the transfer of the redefined at least one user interface element to the secondary device may be activated once it has been ascertained that the secondary device is able to support all the changes made to the at least one user interface element. The user interface elements of the secondary device that have not been redefined using the application running on the host may be unaffected subsequent to the incorporation of the at least one user interface element redefined using the application.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It may be possible for the secondary device to transfer the at least one user element to a second host to redefine at least one user interface element on the second host, such that the theme of the secondary device is carried over to the second host. The secondary device would need to be connected to the second host to enable inter-device communication. The secondary device may be connected to the second host via either a wired connection (cables) or a wireless connection. The wireless connection may be using wireless technologies such as, for example, Wifi, Bluetooth, WiMax, infra-red and UWB. The process of transferring the theme from the secondary device to the second host would be more direct as the second host would conceivably have better hardware resources and would be able to support nearly all themes transferred by the secondary device. A porting application running on the second host may be activated once a connection to the secondary device has been detected, and the porting application may include a control to activate transfer of the theme from the secondary device.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Whilst there has been described in the foregoing description preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the technology concerned that many variations or modifications in details of design or construction may be made without departing from the present invention.</p>
