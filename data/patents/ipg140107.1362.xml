<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation-in-Part of copending U.S. Nonprovisional application having Ser. No. 11/514,822, filed on Aug. 31, 2006. The entirety of the aforementioned application is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Athletic performance is a function of both an athlete's physical condition as well as cognitive condition. Many sports demand that the athlete accurately perceive and respond to the position and motion (such as velocity, acceleration, deceleration) of teammates, competitors, and sport-specific objects such as footballs, basketballs, baseballs, pucks, or other objects in both central fields of vision and peripheral fields of vision. In order to increase personal performance, athletes have become interested in vision training as another avenue toward enhanced performance. For example, baseball batters want to improve their vision in general, and their central field of vision in particular, so at to be able to see the seams on a 90+ mph fastball. An additional example includes an American football receiver that is attempting to catch an incoming football may look over his should while maintaining his running stride. While looking over a shoulder to identify the incoming football, the receiver may be relying on a portion of his peripheral field of vision. Therefore, athletes are targeting achieving superior visual dexterity in both central field of view and peripheral fields of view to complement their physical dexterity.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A flat lens that is generally parallel to a wearer's frontal plane and offset from the wearer's eyes may cause an angle of peripheral view perceived through the lens to be reduced. Consequently, flat lenses may cause a wearer to re-orient his or her head in order to receive the intended benefit (e.g., optical correction, controlled spectral transmittance) of the lenses in portions of the peripheral field of vision that are not perceived without reorientation. Additionally, a flat lens that is angled within a curved frame, to increase an amount of peripheral field of vision, may cause eyelash contact between the wearer's eyelashes and the flat lens. Additionally, angling a flat lens within a curved frame may also introduce distortion of the central field of view as an object in the central field of view will be perceived through a greater angle of the lens resulting in an image shift as perceived by the wearer (e.g., as opposed to viewing an object directly in front of a wearer at a normal angle through the lens, the object will be perceived through the lens at the angle the lens is positioned within the frame). Angling of a flat lens within a curved frame also limits the variety of wearer head forms that comfortably fit the eyewear.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The subject matter of embodiments of the present invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways, to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present invention relate to curved eyewear having an electrically switchable spectral transmittance lens. The lens is curved in orientation, which reduces eyelash contact while increasing a peripheral field of view for a wearer of the curved eyewear. The electrically switchable spectral transmittance lens, in an embodiment, includes a plurality of zones that may be switched in-phase or out-of-phase with each other depending on an activity being performed. Another embodiment utilizes a shatter-resistant material for constructing the lens. Further embodiments utilize a frame member that includes a curved channel for forming the curved orientation of the lens and for maintaining the lens in a desired position relative to a wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides a curved eyewear comprised of a curved lens with electrically variable spectral transmittance. The curved eyewear is also comprised of a lens driver associated with the curved eyewear that controls the electrically variable spectral transmittance of the curved lens. Additionally, the curved eyewear is comprised of a frame configured to retain the curved lens relative to a face of a wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another aspect, the present invention provides a curved eyewear with a curved lens comprised of at least two portions, a first portion and a second portion. The first portion is electrically switchable from a first light transmittance state to a second light transmittance state. Similarly, the second portion is electrically switchable from the first light transmittance state to the second light transmittance state. The curved eyewear is also comprised of a lens driver associated with the curved eyewear that controls electrically switching from the first light transmittance state to a second light transmittance state. Additionally, the curved eyewear also includes a frame configured to retain the curved lens in a curved orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A third aspect of the present invention provides a curved eyewear with a curved lens electrically switchable between a substantially light obscuring state and a substantially transparent state using liquid crystals. The curved lens is constructed from a flat (i.e., non-curved) polymer that is shatter resistant. The curved eyewear is comprised of a lens driver, the lens driver controls switching the lens between the substantially light obscuring state and the substantially transparent state at an adjustable frequency. The curved eyewear is further comprised of a power source effective for switching between the substantially light obscuring state and the substantially transparent state in response to the lens driver. Additionally, the curved eyewear has a curved frame comprised of a lens curving channel, the lens curving channel effective for maintaining the curved lens in a curved orientation having a particular diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Having briefly described an overview of embodiments of the present invention, an exemplary operating environment suitable for implementing embodiments hereof is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plural forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Additionally, the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; means &#x201c;comprises.&#x201d; The described systems, apparatus, and methods should not be construed as limiting in any way. Instead, the present disclosure is directed toward all novel and nonobvious features and aspects of the various disclosed embodiments, alone and in various combinations and sub-combinations with one another. The disclosed systems, methods, and apparatus are not limited to any specific aspect or feature or combination thereof, nor do the disclosed systems, methods, and apparatus require that any one or more specific advantages be present or problems be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although the operations of some of the disclosed methods are described in a particular, sequential order for convenient presentation, it should be understood that this manner of description encompasses rearrangement, unless a particular ordering is required by specific language set forth below. For example, operations described sequentially may in some cases be rearranged or performed concurrently. Moreover, for the sake of simplicity, the attached figures may not show all the various ways in which the disclosed systems, methods, and apparatus can be used in conjunction with other systems, methods, and apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Curved switching lenses for use with eyewear are provided. Representative eyewear comprise at least a first lens defining a plurality of zones having selectable optical transmittance, and a frame configured to retain the first lens and to support the lens in front of a wearer's eye. One or more zone connection conductors are coupled to one or more zones of the first lens and adapted to provide control signals to the zones. In typical examples, the eyewear further comprise a second lens defining a plurality of zones and retained in the frame so as to position the first lens and the second lens in front of respective eyes of the wearer. Zone connection conductors are coupled to one or more zones of the first lens and the second lens. In other examples, a lens driver is secured to the frame and coupled to the first and second lenses so as to provide control signals to the zones of the first and second lenses. In some examples, the lenses comprise a flexible liquid crystal device on which the zones are defined, and the flexible liquid crystal device is secured to a lens substrate. The lens has an anterior surface and a posterior surface in an as worn position, and the anterior surface and the posterior surface have curvatures of at least four diopters.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In additional examples, the eyewear comprises a level selector configured to adjust a level of visual difficulty provided by one or both lenses. In some examples, the level of difficulty is associated with a duration during which a zone pattern is substantially light blocking. In further representative examples, a zone selector is configured to select a predetermined set of zones for reduced optical transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one example, eyewear comprise first and second lenses defining respective pluralities of zones and retained in a frame so as to position the first lens and the second lens in front of respective eyes of a wearer. At least one zone connection conductor is coupled to the zones of the first and second lenses, and is configured to receive a control signal so as to selectively vary an optical transmission of sets of zones. A lens driver can be secured to the eyewear (or provide separately) and configured to actuate a first set of zones on the first lens and a second set of zones of the second lens to alternately substantially transmit and substantially attenuate a light flux directed through the first lens and the second lens. The eyewear also includes a pattern selector configured to select the first set of zones and the second set of zones and a user input for selection of an interval during which the first set of zones and the second set of zones are substantially attenuating. The zones of the first lens and the second lens can be arranged in rows and columns, and the pattern selector can include a row selector and a column selector configured to select one or more rows and/or one or more columns of zones in each lens for inclusion in the first set of zones and the second set of zones.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Vision training systems comprise eyewear configured to selectively obscure a portion of a trainee's field of view, and a pattern generator configured to select and temporally vary the obscured portion of the trainee's field of view. A computer readable medium such as random access memory (RAM) can be configured to record the obscured portions of the field of view selected by the pattern generator, or to store a sequence of field obscuration patterns to which the trainee is to be exposed. In some examples, the pattern generator temporally varies the obscured portion of the field of view by keeping a transmissive state duration approximately constant and altering a substantially non-transmissive state duration. Obscuration patterns can be selected to obscure portions of a visual field at or near a line of sight (such as a normal line of sight or an activity specific line of sight), or to obscure portions of the visual field displaced from the line of sight. In some examples, moir&#xe9; patterns are used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, training eyewear <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>102</b> that is adapted to retain a first lens <b>104</b> and a second lens <b>106</b>. In some examples, the lenses <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can provide optical power such as typically used to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, or other visual defects, but the lenses <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can also be configured to provide little or no optical power for such corrections. The lenses <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> include respective pluralities of segments or zones such as representative zones <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> that are labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For convenience in the following description, all zones of the lenses <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are referred to occasionally as zones <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, respectively. The zones <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> have optical properties that can be adjusted, selected, or established with, for example, electrical signals applied to the segments (zones). For example, the segments can be defined with liquid crystal materials such as polymer dispersed liquid crystals, nematic liquid crystals, cholesteric liquid crystals, or other electrically switchable optical materials that are situated between transparent conductive layers that are patterned to produce selected segment geometries. Liquid crystal materials are convenient due to their relatively low drive voltages, but other electro-optical materials such as, for example, electrophoretic materials or so-called &#x201c;electronic inks&#x201d; that have been developed for flexible flat panel displays can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the eyewear of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes separate lenses for a left eye and a right eye, in other examples a single lens pane can be provided that is situated appropriately with respect to each eye. In some examples, a lens or portions of a lens pane for one eye is configured to substantially obscure vision through the associated eye. Such obscuration can be achieved with, for example, opaque, translucent, or other light blocking and/or light scattering lens regions or lens pane regions. In some examples, one of the lenses or lens pane regions can be patterned so as to be selectively switchable to be substantially obscuring or substantially transparent without being configured to display patterned obscurations.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The zones <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can be electrically coupled to a lens driver that is secured to, for example, a temple piece <b>112</b> or other portion of the eyewear, or that is independently locatable so that the driver can be secured to, for example, an armband, a pocket, or a waistband as may be convenient. A lens driver can provide electrical control signals that actuate some or all of the zones to become substantially opaque, transparent, or otherwise vary a zone transmittance. The zones can be configured to provide electrically variable spectral transmittances, so that a spectrum of transmitted light varies with the applied electrical drive. Stated differently, adjustable spectral transmittance is adjusting, along a spectrum of light intensity, an amount of light that is conveyed through a lens. Therefore, adjusting the spectral transmittance may range from completely transparent (no electronic adjustment/full electrical adjustment) to completely obscuring (full electronic adjustment/no electrical adjustment). A pattern or arrangement of zones and a manner of actuation can be selected by the lens driver with a pattern generator or controller that is provided as part of the lens driver or provided separately. A remote lens driver or pattern generator can be coupled to the eyewear with an electrical cable. In some examples, patterns can be transmitted wirelessly to the eyewear so that a trainer can select an appropriate zone actuation pattern without interfering with the wearer's activity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The zones <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can be activated in a variety of zone actuation patterns based on a geometrical arrangement of activated zones, a temporal sequence in which zones are actuated, a rate of zone actuation, a progression of zone patterns, or other spatially and/or temporally variable or fixed configurations. For example, some or all zones can be activated to obscure a wearer's vision in a temporal sequence so that initially the relative duration of obscuration is small and the duration of the obscuration gradually increases. Zones can be selected to provide obscuration based on selected activity-specific or sport-specific situations. For example, in training a batter for improved central vision to track a baseball, a central portion of a field of view can be partially or completely obscured with a static or time varying adjustment of zone transmittances. Although in this example, central vision is trained, the activated zones may not be central zones of eyewear lenses, but can be selected based on the relative head position and line of sight of the batter with respect to pitch trajectory.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Zones or selected groups of zones (e.g., lens portions) can be selected to obscure portions of a wearer's field of view. For convenience, an arrangement of one or more zones is referred to herein as an obscuration pattern. An extent to which a zone or an obscuration pattern modulates light transmission or light emission is referred to as an obscuration intensity. A series of one or more activated obscuration patterns is referred to as a sequence. A rate at which an activation pattern or patterns in a sequence are activated can be referred to as a strobe rate. A strobe rate can be a fixed or variable frequency. In some examples, the same or similar patterns and sequences are directed to a left lens and a right lens, but different patterns, sequences, and timings can be provided to the different lenses. Sequences and patterns can also be applied to lenses with different phases. For example, a pattern can be activated at a left lens, and then, upon partial or complete deactivation of the pattern, a corresponding or different pattern can be activated at a right lens. In some examples, actuation of patterns on a left and right lens is substantially simultaneous (in phase), while in other examples one is activated only when the other is deactivated (out of phase).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A representative vision training system that includes switchable eyewear <b>202</b> (also referred to herein as curved eyewear) and a control system <b>204</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The control system <b>204</b> is coupled to the eyewear <b>202</b> with a flexible electrical cable <b>206</b> that is configured to communicate electrical signals to and from the eyewear <b>202</b>. The eyewear <b>202</b> includes temple pieces <b>208</b>, <b>209</b>, lenses <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> and a bridge <b>212</b>. The lenses <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> are typically retained by lens rims defined in a frame front that also includes the bridge <b>212</b>, but other eyewear configurations such as rimless eyewear can be used. A light sensor <b>214</b> can be situated in or on the bridge <b>212</b> or other location on the eyewear <b>202</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the lenses <b>210</b>, <b>211</b> include zones <b>216</b>, <b>217</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>219</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>221</b>, respectively, but more zones or different arrangements of zones can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The control system <b>204</b> includes a remote lens driver/decoder <b>234</b> that is adapted to provide suitable electrical signals to the lens zones <b>216</b>-<b>221</b>. In some examples, the lens driver <b>234</b> is configured to provide electrical signals by selectively addressing the zones row by row or column by column as is customary in addressing liquid crystal display panels. For lenses having only a few zones, each zone can be individually addressable with dedicated conductors. It can be convenient to provide signal decoding or distribution on the eyewear to simplify electrical connections to the control system <b>204</b> to avoid, for example, the need to provide multiple row and column signals over the cable <b>206</b>. In some examples, the control system <b>204</b> or some portions thereof are secured to or integrated into the bridge, temple pieces, or other portions of the eyewear <b>202</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a frame-mounted decoder <b>235</b> is situated on the left temple piece <b>209</b>. In other examples, the control system or portions thereof are configured for attachment to an eyewear user's clothing, body, or equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control system <b>204</b> can also include a memory <b>222</b> and a pattern generator/sequencer <b>224</b>. The memory <b>222</b> can be configured to store obscuration patterns and temporal sequences for activation of such patterns as well as to record training data corresponding to the durations and sequences in which the eyewear has been used in training sessions. The pattern generator/sequencer <b>224</b> can be configured to determine pre-established pattern sequences or obscuration patterns for use. In addition, patterns and sequences can be modified or adapted in response to, for example, input commands or other use inputs received via a user interface <b>226</b>. In some examples, the user interface <b>226</b> is configured for selection of patterns and sequences, and can include one or more user controls such as knob, sliders, push buttons, or other input devices. Typical adjustments relate to a rate at which a particular pattern is repeated or a rate at which a sequence of patterns is provided. For example, an obscuration pattern can be strobed at a high rate (greater than about 30 Hz) so that the strobing is noticed by the wearer primarily as a reduced transmitted light intensity. Alternatively, a pattern can be strobed at a rate at which the wearer notices an interval in which her vision is impeded. Typically rates less than about 5 Hz are associated with noticeable obscurations. A constant strobe rate is unnecessary. For example, a strobe rate can vary from a high rate to a low rate so that the visual obscuration presented to the wearer increases, increasing the visual demands on the wearer. Such variable frequency drive can be referred to as a &#x201c;chirped&#x201d; drive.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">An external input/output connection <b>228</b> such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) or other communication connection can be provided. Such a connection can be coupled to the pattern generator/sequencer <b>224</b> to provide or adjust patterns and sequences available for use. Additional patterns and sequences can also be received from the connection <b>228</b> for storage in the memory <b>222</b>. In some examples, a vision training schedule can be transferred to the control system <b>204</b> for one or more future training sessions. The training schedule can be transferred from the athlete's computer, or forwarded to the athlete from a trainer over a network such as the Internet. In addition, data concerning usage can be delivered to the connection <b>228</b> for inclusion in, for example, a record of an athlete's training schedule. Such a record can be forwarded to a coach or trainer via a network such as the Internet or using email or instant messaging.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A display controller <b>230</b> is configured to control a display portion <b>232</b> of the lens <b>211</b>. The display portion <b>232</b> typically includes a plurality of display pixels so that information concerning current eyewear or training settings or conditions can be presented in a user's field of view. In some examples, the display portion includes a single pixel that can be strobed or otherwise actuated to indicate eyewear status. For example, a rapidly strobing display portion <b>232</b> can indicate a pattern rate or a duration of a training session.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The light sensor <b>214</b> is in communication with a sensor processor <b>238</b> that can provide an indication of, for example, ambient lighting in an environment in which the eyewear <b>202</b> is situated, or direct lighting received by the eyewear <b>202</b>. Obscuration patterns, sequences, and intensities can be varied based on the indication. The processor <b>238</b> generally includes an amplifier or buffer that can receive an electrical signal from the light sensor <b>214</b> and provide an output signal indicative of light received. For example, an overall illumination level can be established so that, for example, a wearer's eyes receive a similar light flux regardless of ambient illumination conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Differing obscuration patterns and sequences can be supplied to the left and right lenses. In some examples, vision from a single eye is to be trained, and only the corresponding lens is used. In other examples, the lenses are selected at random intervals to serve as distractions such as might be encountered due to, for example, fan motion, or other regular or irregular movements at a sporting event.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, any number of components may be employed to achieve the desired functionality within the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Although the various components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are shown with lines for the sake of clarity, in reality, delineating various components is not so clear, and metaphorically, the lines would more accurately be grey or fuzzy. Further, although some components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are depicted as single blocks, the depictions are exemplary in nature and in number and are not to be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates representative vision training eyewear <b>300</b> that includes a temple piece <b>302</b>, a frame front <b>304</b>, and a lens <b>306</b>. The lens <b>306</b> includes zones such as representative zone <b>308</b>. A control switch <b>310</b> is provided and is electrically coupled to the lens zone with an interconnect <b>312</b> that is included in the frame front. The control switch <b>310</b> can be adapted to activate the zones or select patterns or pattern sequences. For example, the switch <b>310</b> can include a rotating portion that can select pattern strobe rate, and a push mechanism for turning the eyewear on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Lenses for vision training eyewear can include a lens substrate, such as a lens blank of glass, polycarbonate, acrylic, or other suitable optical material. The substrate can be configured to define both a left and a right lens or separate substrates can be used for each. Substrates can be tinted or colored to control total transmittance and/or provide a predetermined spectral transmittance, or can be made of photochromic materials. A lens substrate typically has a posterior surface (facing the wearer) and an anterior surface (facing away from the wearer) in an as worn position. Curvatures and centers of curvature of one or both of these surfaces can be selected to provide a preferred optical correction, or to be substantially optically neutral. For convenience, a positive curvature is defined as a curvature whose center is on a posterior side of a lens substrate in an as worn position. Curvatures of the surfaces typically are selected to be between about 0 diopter and +14 diopters.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Diopter, also sometimes referred to as dioptre, can be a measurement of curvature equal to the reciprocal of the radius of the curve measured in meters. For example, a circle with a radius of &#xbd; meter (i.e., diameter of 1 meter) has a curvature of two diopters. Consequently, as indicated previously, exemplary embodiments include a lens having a curvature between 0 and +14 diopters, which is equivalent to a lens having a curvature that is defined by a diameter up to and possibly greater than 1/7 meter (0.1428 meter) (i.e., radius possibly greater than 1/14 meters). However, it is understood that the curvature of the lens as a whole or portions of a lens may be defined by a diameter such as between 120 and 200 millimeters (i.e., 0.12 to 0.2 meters). In an additional exemplary embodiment, the curvature of a lens may also range between 130 and 180 millimeters in diameter. Or, in an additional embodiment, it is contemplated that the curvature of a lens ranges from 130 to 140 millimeters in diameter in at least portions of the lens.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Vision training lenses also include a zone-switchable optical modulator that can be conformed to or bonded to an anterior surface or a posterior surface of the lens substrate. Such optical modulators can be flexible for attachment to surfaces having optical curvatures of 4 diopters or more. Optical modulators can be bonded to both surfaces if desired. The modulator generally includes an optically active (i.e., switchable) area and an interconnection portion (typically at a perimeter) that is adapted to receive control signals and deliver the control signals to the switchable zones directly or to a zone driver decoder that establishes, for examples, appropriate row and column conductor signals for matrix addressing. Flexible liquid crystal-based modulators are convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While frame-based eyewear can be convenient for general use and activity-specific training, activity-specific eyewear, visors, face shields, or protective shields can be similarly configured. For examples, obscuration zones can be provided on a face shield adapted for a football, hockey, or lacrosse helmet or other head protector. Goggles and facemasks for racquet sports, lacrosse, and baseball can also be configured to include vision shield portions on which pluralities of switchable zones can be defined.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The examples include obscuration patterns or zones that block or partially block a portion of a field of view. However, other kinds of obscuration patterns and obscuration zones can be used. For example, light emitting zones can be provided so that a wearer's field of view is presented with regions of increased light emission that tend to obscure view. Such emission zones can be configured to provide temporally varying light emission, including spectrally varying light emission. If desired, such light emission can also be configured to have a spatially and/or temporally varying polarization. The zones can occupy substantially the entire area of a lens, or can be configured to occupy only a small portion of the lens area. For examples, lenses that include opaque light emission regions can be configured so that the lenses are largely transparent. Accordingly, light attenuating zones and/or light emissive zones can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a temple piece <b>400</b> for exemplary vision training eyewear. The temple piece <b>400</b> includes a power button <b>402</b> and level adjust buttons <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> that can be used to decrease or increase the visual challenge (i.e., the level of difficulty) that the eyewear provides. These buttons are located on the temple piece <b>402</b> for convenient adjustment while in use. The power button <b>402</b> can be configured to initiate and terminate operation of the vision training eyewear. In addition, the power button <b>402</b> can be configured so that pressing the button can be used to toggle among strobing of a right lens only, strobing of a left lens only, or strobing of both lenses. The power button <b>402</b> can also be configured to sequence through a predetermined menu of zone patterns or sequences, but it can be more convenient to provide an additional selection button to facilitate these or other user adjustments. The level adjust button <b>404</b> can be configured so that pressing the level adjust button <b>404</b> increases a difficulty level until a maximum available difficulty level is reached at which point additional button presses may have no effect. Operation of the level adjust button <b>406</b> can be similar at a minimum difficulty level.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an additional exemplary embodiment, a subsequent activation of a mode button that is currently set to an extreme (i.e., highest or lowest level) cycles to the next extreme (e.g., cycle of difficulty levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3 . . . ). For example, if a difficulty level is currently set to a highest extreme (e.g., level 8), a subsequent activation (e.g., depressing, manipulation, wearer provided feedback) of a mode button causes the difficulty to switch to the lowest level of difficulty (e.g., level 1).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, it is contemplated that vision training eyewear include fewer or more controls (e.g., buttons). For example, when vision training eyewear is intended to be used solely for 3D viewing purposes, a difficulty selection control may not be utilized. In this example, the flicker rate may be controlled by an external controller (e.g., synchronization signal provided by a display device). Similarly, controls may be limited to a power (e.g., on/off) control and a mode control that cycles through difficulty levels or modes of operation (as discussed above). Therefore, it is contemplated that one or more controls may be implemented in various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an arrangement of zones in a left lens <b>502</b> and a right lens <b>504</b> that can be controlled with a temple piece such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the left lens <b>502</b> and the right lens <b>504</b> are formed as a unitary lens assembly <b>500</b>, but can be provided separately as well. A display region <b>510</b> is also provided to permit communication of eyewear settings to the user. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a seven segment display is convenient. The lenses <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> include representative zones <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, respectively. The remaining zones are unlabeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In some examples, the zones provide variable light attenuation. While the zones can be controlled to be substantially clear, substantially opaque, or have intermediate values of light transmission, example operation of eyewear that includes the temple piece <b>402</b> and the lenses <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> is described with zones that are referred to as configurable to be in a &#x201c;clear&#x201d; state or a &#x201c;dark&#x201d; state.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Operation of the lenses of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>. When the lenses are powered on using the power button <b>404</b>, an initial or default difficulty level is displayed in the display region <b>510</b> and the lenses remain in the clear state. The default difficulty level can be an easiest level and assigned an indicator of &#x201c;1&#x201d; that is displayed when the lenses are powered on. After a brief interval (for example, 2-10 sec), the zones of the lenses <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> begin to strobe at a rate associated with the initial difficulty level, and the display <b>510</b> can be switched off. Strobing of one or both lenses can be set as an initial mode of operation that can be controlled with the power button <b>404</b>. Additional presses of the power button <b>404</b> cycle through selection of a left lens, a right lens, and power off. Typically, with the eyewear switched off, pressing the power button <b>404</b> initiates the eyewear with both a left and a right lens alternating between a clear state and a dark state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrate the eyewear during a clear state and a dark state, respectively, in which all zones are switched. Alternatively, the zones of only one lens can be switched as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Difficulty level can be adjusted at any time, and a new difficulty level displayed in the display region <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Difficulty levels may be changed by altering a duration of being in a dark state or by altering a duration of being in a clear state, or a combination of both. For example, a difficulty level may have a fixed duration of 0.1 sec, while dark state intervals and have durations that increase with increasing level of difficulty. For example, the most difficult level may provide a 0.9 second interval of obscuration during which the wearer's vision is obstructed. In an additional exemplary embodiment, a repetitive sequence of clear state/dark state intervals are provided and a clear state/dark state intervals for a representative 1 second time period are shown. Durations of dark state intervals for levels 1-8 are listed in the following table.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additional arrangements are contemplated for affecting a perceived level of difficulty by a wearer of vision training eyewear. For example, the duration of a dark state and the duration of a light state may be altered in combination or independently. For example, a one-to-one ratio may be maintained between a dark state and a light state while changing the duration used for the one-to-one ratio (e.g., 75 millisecond dark state and a 75 millisecond light state). Additionally, it is contemplated that a dark state maintains a fixed duration while the light state duration is altered to affect a perceived level of difficulty. Further, any combination of (1) fixed duration light state/variable duration dark state, (2) fixed duration light state/fixed duration dark state, and (3) variable duration light state/fixed duration dark state may be implemented in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">This arrangement of clear state/dark state intervals is an example, and other arrangements can be used, including those in which both clear state and dark state interval durations are varied, or a frequency at which clear state/dark state intervals are switched. At frequencies greater than about 10-20 Hz, alternating clear and dark levels tend to merge and can be perceived as gray. This merger occurs at different frequencies for central vision and peripheral vision, and peripheral vision tends to note flicker at higher frequencies. Durations of dark/light intervals can be selected based on such merger. Visual challenges can be more noticeable at rates at which flicker is observed, or at lower rates. It is understood that in certain embodiment, the merger of the clear and dark may be desirable, such as when viewing a video display presenting three-dimensional imagery, to be discussed in more detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Levels of difficulty can also be associated with the pattern or sequence of zones that are controlled to be in a clear state or a dark state, and level adjustment is not limited to clear state/dark state interval durations. Level adjust buttons can be configured to alter obscuration patterns, sequences, and/or timings to select visual challenges.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a temple piece <b>1000</b> is provided with a power switch <b>1002</b>, a row selection switch <b>1004</b>, and a column selection switch <b>1006</b>. Repeated actuations of the switches <b>1004</b>, <b>1006</b> permitting selection of different rows or columns of zones, respectively. Zone timing can be altered with repeat actuations of the power switch <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The low power lens may have any amount of minus power, up to that for a concentric lens for a given base curvature. Low power lenses may, for example, have more minus power than &#x2212;0.005 diopter, for example more than &#x2212;0.01 or &#x2212;0.02 diopter and particularly in the range of &#x2212;0.01 to &#x2212;0.12 diopter, for example &#x2212;0.04 to &#x2212;0.09 diopter. Such low power lenses achieve a number of advantages. The low power lenses have less taper, and can be thinner than zero power lenses. The reduction in taper produces a corresponding reduction in peripheral prism that would otherwise be induced by the excessively non-parallel surfaces of the plano lenses. Thinner lenses also provide better physical stability, improved optical quality, lower weight, and more uniform light transmission than plano lenses. A physiologic advantage of the low minus lens is that it better matches the accommodative posture of athletes and other persons engaged in highly visually demanding and/or stressful activities.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Patterns or sequences for a left eye and a right eye can be activated at different frequencies, amplitudes (different light transmissions), duty cycles (different relative on/off durations), and phases. Patterns need not be switched at a constant frequency but can be at chirped or other variable frequencies or can be switched at random intervals. While lens transmittance is varied in some examples, a transmitted light state of polarization can be varied as well. Such polarization modulation can be conveniently provided with zones defined by nematic liquid crystals. The lenses can also be tinted or neutral gray to statically control light transmission, or photochromic substrates can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Eyewear and eyewear systems are conveniently configured to present predetermined patterns and pattern sequences at fixed or variable rates. Typically, a user or trainer can select additional patterns, pattern sequences, obscuration extents, variable or fixed pattern rates, pattern colors or color sequences, or other vision obscurations. These additional training selections can be selected using a personal computer or other computer system that is configured to present a range of customization options for selection based by the user or trainer using a keyboard or pointing device such as a mouse. After these additional training sequences are designed, the sequences can be stored in a memory and communicated to the eyewear system for storage at an eyewear controller that may or may not be integral with the eyewear. Customization and pattern selection can be based on sport-specific functions, specific training goals, wearer physiology (eye separation, orbit asymmetry) or otherwise configured.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, illustrates an exemplary curved eyewear <b>1100</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The curved eyewear <b>1100</b>, as seen from a frontal perspective, includes a superior member <b>1102</b> and an inferior member <b>1104</b> that both comprise a portion of a frame. The frame is effective for maintaining a lens having two portions <b>1106</b> and <b>1108</b> in a curved orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As discussed herein, a lens may include a substrate, one or more coating materials, or components, all of which work together to allow transmission of light or obscure the transmission of light as perceived by a wearer of the curved glasses. Additionally, as used herein, a lens may constitute a single portion effective for controlling light transmission perceived by a single eye. Further yet, as used herein, a lens may constitute a common member having two portions, where each portion of the common member is effective for controlling light transmission perceived by a unique eye of a wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the portion <b>1106</b> may, in an exemplary embodiment, be a separate member from the portion <b>1108</b>. However, in an additional exemplary embodiment, the portion <b>1106</b> and the portion <b>1108</b> are a common member, but serving different portion of a wearer's visual spectrum (e.g., a common lens serving two different eyes).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an exemplary embodiment, the superior member <b>1102</b> forces the portion <b>1106</b> to have a defined curve. For example, the portion <b>1106</b> may naturally be a flat substrate that lacks an appreciable curve. However, the superior member <b>1102</b> may guide the portion <b>1106</b> into a curved orientation and maintain the portion <b>1106</b> in that curved orientation. As will be discussed in detail hereinafter, the superior member <b>1102</b> may include a channel (not shown) that is adapted to receive a superior edge of the portion <b>1106</b>. The channel may have a curve that is similar to or approximately the same as a desired curved orientation of the portion <b>1106</b> (or a lens in general).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additionally, it is contemplated that a channel within the superior member <b>1102</b> is slightly smaller in diameter than the desired curve of a received lens, but the width of the curved channel is wider than the width of the received lens that is to be maintained within the channel. Further yet, it is contemplated that a channel within the superior member <b>1102</b> is slightly greater in diameter than the desired curved of a received lens, but with a width of the curved channel that varies with respect to the location in the curve. Both of these examples are contemplated in an effort to provide a receiving channel in which a lens having electrically variable spectral transmittance may be maintained in a curved orientation while not interfering with the ability of the lens to consistently, across a whole surface, vary light transmittance. As will be discussed in more detail below, adjusting the curve of a channel and the width of the channel prevents pinch points, which disrupt the electrically variable spectral transmittance of a lens near a pinch point.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an exemplary curved eyewear <b>1200</b> from an exploded posterior perspective in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The curved eyewear <b>1200</b> is comprised of a superior member <b>1202</b>, an inferior member <b>1204</b>, a left lens portion <b>1206</b>, a right lens portion <b>1208</b>, a superior channel <b>1210</b>, an inferior channel <b>1212</b>, a power source <b>1214</b>, a programmable control board (PCB) <b>1216</b>, and maintaining member receiving slots <b>1218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The superior member <b>1202</b> may be constructed from a shatter resistant polymer capable of withstanding an impact. For example, when the curved eyewear <b>1200</b> is used in an athletic activity (or any activity) that presents a possibility of an object (e.g., ball) contacting the curved eyewear <b>1200</b>, the ability of the materials to resist breaking is beneficial for both the wearer's safety and the longevity of the curved eyewear <b>1200</b>. Consequently, the right lens portion <b>1208</b> and the left lens portion <b>1206</b> may also be constructed from a shatter-resistant material, such as a polymer or other similarly characterized material.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an exemplary embodiment, a curved lens is not made with glass. As will be appreciated, glass may shatter upon impact and potentially cause damage to a wearer's vision. Therefore, in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a curved lens is not made from glass, but instead from a plastic material having characteristics (e.g., transparency) suitable for use as a lens. Further yet, in an exemplary embodiment, the lens is constructed from a malleable plastic material that is bendable and therefore able to be curved at ambient temperatures and with reasonable pressure. For example, a lens is constructed, in an exemplary embodiment, from a flat plastic substrate (i.e., physical material onto which electrically variable transmittance materials may be adhered) that, at room temperature, may be curved to form a curved lens. The plastic substrate in this example is then maintained in a curved orientation (e.g., position) by a typical force that may be exerted by a typical eyewear frame. However, it is contemplated that a lens may also be constructed of glass in an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The curved eyewear <b>1200</b> is depicted having two distinctly separate lens portions, the right lens portion <b>1208</b> and the left lens portion <b>1206</b>. However, as previously discussed, it is contemplated that a single lens may be utilized in embodiments of the present invention, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> hereinafter. A lens portion, regardless if it is a single or part of a pair of lenses, may have a number of zones, as previously discussed and depicted with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-9</figref>. Therefore, in an example where a single lens serves both eyes of a wearer, because multiple zones may be included, light perceived by each of a wearer's eyes may be in phase or out of phase, or another combination of zone configurations with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The superior member <b>1202</b> is a portion of a frame that maintains the left lens portion <b>1206</b> and the right lens portion <b>1208</b> in a position relative to a wearer's face and eyes. As is typical of an eyewear frame, the superior member <b>1202</b> is effective for maintaining the curved eyewear in a desired location relative to a wearer of the curved eyewear <b>1200</b>. The curved eyewear <b>1200</b> incorporates both the superior member <b>1202</b> and the inferior member <b>1204</b>, in combination, to maintain the left lens portion <b>1206</b> and the right lens portion <b>1208</b>. However, in an exemplary embodiment, it is contemplated that a superior member, an inferior member, or neither (e.g., rimless) may be implemented with a curved lens(es).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The superior member <b>1202</b> includes the superior channel <b>1210</b>. The superior channel <b>1210</b> is a recessed portion within the superior member <b>1202</b> that is adapted for receiving and maintaining an edge portion of a lens. As previously discussed, the width of the superior channel <b>1210</b> may coordinate with the width of an edge that will be received and maintained therein. Or, in an exemplary embodiment, the width of the channel <b>1210</b> is wider, at least along one or more sections, than the width of a lens that is to be maintained therein. The depth of the superior channel <b>1202</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, is sufficiently deep to maintain a lens, while minimizing an amount of the lens that is recessed within the superior channel <b>1210</b>. The superior channel <b>1210</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, also provides a cavity in which one or more electrical leads are placed. The electrical leads may be used for controlling the electrically variable transmission state of a lens and/or for connecting the power source <b>1214</b> with the PCB <b>1216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Similar to the superior channel <b>1210</b>, the inferior channel <b>1212</b> is a recess in a frame member, such as the inferior member <b>1204</b>, that is functional for receiving and maintaining one or more lenses. The curved eyewear <b>1200</b> is an exemplary embodiment of the present invention in which the left lens portion <b>1206</b> and the right lens portion <b>1208</b> are maintained in a curved orientation by both the superior channel <b>1210</b> and the inferior channel <b>1212</b>. However, it is contemplated that a single channel is effective for maintaining a curved orientation for one or more lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The PCB <b>1216</b> is a programmable computing board that includes a processor and computer readable storage media. In an exemplary embodiment, the PCB <b>1216</b> is an exemplary control system <b>204</b> as previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The PCB <b>1216</b> is functional for controlling one or more states of a lens. Examples of a state include a transparent state. A transparent state is a state of light transmission through a lens with minimal disruption by electrically variable spectral transmittance manipulation. Stated differently, an electrically variable spectral transmittance lens, when supplied power, may be in a &#x201c;dark&#x201d; state or a &#x201c;light&#x201d; state, depending on the inherent characteristics of the material relied upon to alter the spectral transmittance characteristics of the lens. A dark state is one that obscures light transmittance through the lens to a greater degree than when spectral transmittance is not reduced (e.g., power applied, power not applied). Similarly, a light state is one that does not additionally obscure light transmittance through the lens than when spectral transmittance is reduced (e.g., power applied, power not applied). Therefore, as used herein, a transparent state is a state that allows a greater percentage of spectral transmittance to occur than an obscured state. Similarly, as used herein, an obscured state is a state that allows a lesser percentage of spectral transmittance to occur than a transparent state. Consequently, a transparent state and an obscured state are relative terms to one another as used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The PCB <b>1216</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, is adapted to synchronize an out-of-phase flicker (e.g., strobe effect) between a transparent state and an obscured state for the left lens portion <b>1206</b> and the right lens portion <b>1208</b>. The synchronization of the out-of-phase flicker is coordinated with a refresh rate of a display device. For example, a display device, such as a monitor, television, and/or a projector (and associate viewing surface), refresh a displayed image a particular number of times per unit of time. This is commonly measured in hertz, which are cycles per second.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, curved eyewear are synchronized with a refresh rate of a display device. The synchronization allows one portion of the curved lens to be transparent while another portion of the curved lens is obscuring. The cycle from transparent to obscuring coordinates with the display device so that an image intended to be perceived by a right eye is displayed on the display device as the lens associated with the right eye of a wearer is transparent in state. Similarly, the cycle from transparent to obscure is coordinated so that when an image intended to be perceived by the left eye of a wearer is displayed on the display device, the lens associated with the left eye is transparent. Conversely, the lens associated with the eye that is not intended to perceive a given image at a particular time is obscured.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, a television that has a refresh rate of 240 Hz (240 images per second are displayed) may be synchronized with curved eyewear so that a left lens is transparent 120 times per second and obscured the other 120 times per second. Similarly, the 120 per second that the left lens is obscured, the right lens is transparent and vice versa. Therefore, the television may show 120 images per second intended for the left eye to perceive and an alternating 120 images per second intended for the right eye to perceive. This process of synchronizing two lens portions out of phase with each other and a television refresh rate allows for three-dimensional (3D) viewing experience of the content displayed by the television.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Advantages of curved eyewear having a curved lens when viewing 3D include allowing a wearer of the curved eyewear to utilize a greater range of peripheral vision in a 3D viewing experience. For example, when viewing a large display device from relatively close distance (e.g., front row of a movie theater) a portion of the displayed content is outside of the wearer's central vision that is served by standard flat lens 3D viewing glasses. Further, in an IMAX type viewing environment that intends to take advantage of a viewer's peripheral visions, non-wrapping 3D glasses fail to provide the necessary augmentation to the wearer's vision. Consequently, a curved lens that wraps around a wearer's field of vision provides an enhanced and complete 3D viewing experience.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Curved eyewear, in an exemplary embodiment, includes a receiver component (not shown). The receiver component receives a synchronization signal from a display device in order to synchronize the out-of-phase cycle of two lens portions of the curved eyewear with the refresh rate of the display device. For example, an infrared receiver that receives an infrared signal from the display device or an associated content source. Additional examples of a receiver component include a radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) receiver. For example, BLUETOOTH (IEEE Standard 802.15), is a short range RF specification that is contemplated as being utilized in embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition to aiding in the synchronization of curved eyewear and a display device, the receiving module may also (or in the alternative) function to receive one or more remote control signals to control the curved eyewear. For example, functionality that is adjustable directly from the curved eyewear may also be adjusted remotely. For example, the flicker rate of the electrically adjustable spectral transmittance of a curved lens may be adjusted (e.g., frequency, duration, intensity, on/off) by a remote control that communicates with the curved eyewear by way of the receiving module.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">For example, an athletic trainer may adjust the intensity level (e.g., change a duration of obscured state or transparent state of one or more lens portions) using a remote control while an athlete is training with the curved eyewear. Consequently, the athlete may be running a receiving route with the curved eyewear at an easy intensity level, and after the athlete initially identifies an incoming ball, the trainer may increase the intensity level of the curved eyewear to enhance the training experience.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The receiving module, in an exemplary embodiment, is coupled, either directly or indirectly, to the PCB <b>1216</b>. As a result, processing of received signals may be accomplished in whole or in part by one of the receiving module or the PCB <b>1216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the superior member <b>1202</b> may have two maintaining member receiving slots <b>1218</b>. The maintaining member receiving slots <b>1218</b> are functional for receiving a maintaining member, such as a strap. For example, when the curved eyewear <b>1200</b> is used in an athletic or moving activity, a strap allows the curved eyewear to be maintained in a desired position relative to the face of a wearer. In an additional exemplary embodiment, the maintaining member received at the maintaining member receiving slots <b>1218</b> includes a temple, such as the temple piece <b>302</b> previously illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a portion of a curved eyewear frame <b>1300</b> having a curved channel <b>1302</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As previously discussed, a channel for receiving and maintaining a curved lens within a curved eyewear may not have the same curve diameter as the frame. For example, in an embodiment, in order to increase an amount of &#x201c;wrap,&#x201d; which is an amount of extension around a wearer's head away from a medial line, the frame may have a smaller diameter curve than a curved lens associated with the frame. In this example, in an effort to reduce the amount of strain placed on a curved lens while maximizing an amount of wrap provided by the curved eyewear as a whole, the curved lens diameter is get greater than the curved frame diameter. An analogy of this concept for illustration purposes comes from a race driver's path when taking a corner on a race track. In this analogy, the driver reduces the amount of turning within a corner by starting on the outside of the corner cutting to the inside of the corner near the apex and exiting the corner toward the outside edge of the track.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The curved channel <b>1302</b> follows the analogy provided above such that the diameter of the curved channel <b>1302</b> is greater than the general diameter of the frame <b>1300</b>. For example, the distance between the &#x201c;inside&#x201d; edge of the frame <b>1300</b> and the curved channel <b>1302</b> changes from a first distance <b>1304</b>, to a smaller distance <b>1306</b> near the apex of the curve. Finally, the distance between the inside edge of the frame <b>1300</b> and the curved channel <b>1302</b> increases from the distance <b>1306</b> to a distance <b>1308</b> at the &#x201c;exit&#x201d; of the curve. Therefore, a desired amount of peripheral field of vision for a wearer of the curved eyewear is achieved while reducing the curve of the actual lens within the curved eyewear. It is understood that in an exemplary embodiment, the diameter of a curved lens may be similar to that of a frame in which it is maintained. Further, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a curved channel <b>1302</b> that accommodates a lens that services only one eye, a curved channel may extend along a frame to similarly accommodate a lens that services both eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts a front perspective view of a curved eyewear <b>1400</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present application. The curved eyewear <b>1400</b> is suitable for providing a wrap effect around a wearer's field of vision. Consequently, the curved eyewear <b>1400</b> are functional for allowing a wearer to have electrically switchable spectral transmittance that affects light perceived in peripheral fields of view.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Unlike typical flat lenses placed in a curved frame, eye lash contact by a wearer of the curved eyewear may be reduced. For example, when a flat lens is angled within a curved frame to provide the appearance, but not the benefits, of a curved lens and frame solution, the wearer may contact the un-curved, but angled, lens with his or her eye leash. In an effort to force a non-curved lens in a curved frame to provide peripheral field of view electrically switchable spectral transmittance, the lens is angled so a medial edge is pushed away from a wearer's face to allow a lateral edge of the lens to extend as posterior as possible in an attempt to cover a portion of the peripheral field of view. However, this angling of the lens causes the lens to come closer in proximity to the eye, and therefore eyelashes, of a wearer. When utilizing curved eyewear having electrically switchable spectral transmittance, the wearer does not desire for the distracting and interfering contact of eyelashes with the lens. Therefore, a curved lens avoids the severity of eyelash contact realized with a flat lens.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a control portion <b>1402</b> for controlling functionality of the curved eyewear (e.g., electrically variable spectral transmittance) is illustrated on a right temple of the curved eyewear <b>1400</b>. The control portion <b>1402</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, is similar to the level adjust buttons <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The curved eyewear <b>1400</b> also includes a power supply <b>1404</b>. A previously discussed, the power supply <b>1404</b> may include a battery or other replaceable or rechargeable power supply. In an exemplary embodiment, the power supply <b>1404</b> is recharged through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection (not shown) associated with the curved eyewear <b>1400</b>. For example, in addition to updating computer readable instructions for a PCB of the curved eyewear <b>1400</b>, a USB connection may also be utilized to charge the power supply <b>1404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts a curved lens <b>1500</b> effective for manipulating perceived light by two eyes of a human wearer in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The curved lens <b>1500</b> is a unitary substrate to which an electrically variable spectral transmitting material is coupled. For example, an LCD material may be incorporated within, thereon, or otherwise positioned relative to a polymer substrate having shatter-resistant characteristics that are better than glass. The curved lens <b>1500</b> is effective to manipulate light perceived by both a left eye and a right of a wearer. However, it is understood that, as previously discussed, one or more zones (e.g., portions) of electrically variable spectral transmittance are contemplated as being implemented on the curved lens <b>1500</b> to allow for localized manipulation of perceived light.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts a top view of a curved eyewear <b>1600</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The curved eyewear includes a curved frame <b>1602</b> and a curved lens <b>1604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">An exemplary illustration of a field of view provided by a flat lens is limited to the exemplary central field of view <b>1606</b>. However, by providing the curve lens <b>1604</b> that wraps around a wearer, the field of view is increased to include the peripheral field of view <b>1608</b>. Therefore, it is desirable for athletic vision training and 3D applications to increase a field of view to include the peripheral field of view <b>1608</b> in addition to the central field of view <b>1606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> depicts an exemplary curved lens <b>1700</b> in accordance with embodiment of the present invention. A curve <b>1702</b> is depicted along the general curve of the lens <b>1700</b>. The curve <b>1702</b> has a diameter (&#xd8;) <b>1704</b>. The diameter <b>1704</b> of the curve <b>1702</b> defines a curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1700</b>, where the curved orientation of the lens <b>1700</b> has a diameter of <b>1704</b>. However, as is illustrated at positions <b>1706</b>-<b>1712</b>, the curved lens <b>1700</b> does not adhere to a perfect circle defined by the curve <b>1702</b>, but instead, the curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1700</b> is defined as a whole by the curve <b>1702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, the curved lens <b>1700</b> actually intersects the illustrated curve <b>1702</b> at points <b>1706</b> (a left temple region), <b>1708</b> (a bridge region), and <b>1710</b> (a right temple region). However, the curved lens <b>1700</b> diverges, for example, at point <b>1712</b> from the curve <b>1702</b>. The divergence of the curved lens <b>1700</b> is sometime referred to herein as an approximate curve as it is not consistently defined by a particular diameter, but instead as a whole is defined by a diameter. As previously discussed, the curvature of the curved lens <b>1700</b> may diverge to provide additional clearance from a wearer's eyelashes and/or to reduce stress on the curved lens <b>1706</b> to minimize negative effects to the electrically switchable characteristics of the curved lens <b>1700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The diameter <b>1704</b> is between 120 millimeters and 200 millimeters in an exemplary embodiment. It is contemplated that the diameter is greater than or less than this range in other embodiments. In yet other embodiments, the diameter <b>1704</b> is 130 millimeters to 180 millimeters. An exemplary embodiment includes a curved lens with a curved orientation approximately defined by a curve having a diameter of 175 millimeters, which may also be expressed as 11.42 diopters. In yet another exemplary embodiment, as will be discussed in more detail hereinafter, a curved orientation may be defined by a curve having a diameter between 130 and 140 millimeters. For example, a curved lens, in an exemplary embodiment, has a curved orientation defined by an approximate curve having a diameter of 135 millimeters, which may also be expressed as 14.81 diopters.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> depicts an exemplary curved lens <b>1800</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The curved lens <b>1800</b> includes a left portion <b>1802</b>, a right portion <b>1804</b> and a bridge portion <b>1814</b>. A previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a curved lens may be defined, in part, by an approximate curve; however, in an exemplary embodiment, the curved lens <b>1800</b> is defined by a curve of a particular portion (e.g., left portion <b>1802</b>, right portion <b>1804</b>). Consequently, a curve <b>1806</b> is depicted along the general curve of the left portion <b>1802</b>. The curve <b>1806</b> has a diameter (&#xd8;<sub>1</sub>) <b>1810</b>. The diameter <b>1810</b> of the curve <b>1806</b>, in an embodiment, defines a curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1800</b> as a whole, where a portion of the curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1800</b> has a diameter of <b>1810</b>. Similarly, a curve <b>1808</b> is depicted along the general curve of the right portion <b>1804</b>. The curve <b>1808</b> has a diameter (&#xd8;<sub>2</sub>) <b>1812</b>. The diameter <b>1812</b> of the curve <b>1808</b>, in an embodiment, also may define a curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1800</b> as a whole, where a portion of the curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1800</b> has a diameter of <b>1812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The bridge portion <b>1814</b> may have less of a curved orientation (i.e., a greater diameter curve defining the curved orientation) than the left portion <b>1802</b> and the right portion <b>1804</b>. Therefore, defining the curved orientation of the curved lens <b>1800</b>, as a whole, is done by utilizing a diameter of a portion of the curved lens <b>1800</b>. In this example, the curved lens <b>1800</b> is defined by a first curve (curve <b>1806</b>) and/or a second curve (curve <b>1808</b>) having respective diameters &#xd8;<sub>1 </sub><b>1810</b> and &#xd8;<sub>2 </sub><b>1812</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the diameters &#xd8;<sub>1 </sub><b>1810</b> and &#xd8;<sub>2 </sub><b>1812</b> are between 130 and 140 millimeters.</p>
