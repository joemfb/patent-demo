<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Static random access memory (SRAM) is commonly used in integrated circuits. SRAM cells have the advantageous feature of holding data without a need for refreshing. SRAM cells may include different numbers of transistors, and are often referred to by the number of transistors, for example, six-transistor (6T) SRAM, eight-transistor (8T) SRAM, and the like. The transistors typically form a data latch for storing a bit. Additional transistors may be added to control access to the transistors. SRAM cells are typically arranged as an array having rows and columns. Each row of the SRAM cells is connected to a word line, which determines whether the current SRAM cell is selected or not. Each column of the SRAM cells is connected to a bit line (or a pair of complementary bit lines), which is used for writing a bit into, or reading a bit from, the SRAM cell.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recent advances in finFET transistor technology have made advanced SRAM cells using finFET transistors possible. In contrast to the prior planar MOS transistor, which has a channel formed at the surface of a semiconductor substrate, a finFET has a three dimensional channel region. In the finFET, the channel for the transistor is formed on the sides, and sometimes also the top, of a &#x201c;fin&#x201d; of semiconductor material. The gate, typically a polysilicon or metal gate, extends over the fin and a gate dielectric is disposed between the gate and the fin. The three-dimensional shape of the finFET channel region allows for an increased gate width without increased silicon area even as the overall scale of the devices is reduced with semiconductor process scaling, and in conjunction with a reduced gate length, providing a reasonable channel width characteristic at a low silicon area cost.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The making and using of the present embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the disclosed subject matter, and do not limit the scope of the different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments will be described with respect to a specific context, namely a memory cell, such as a static random access memory (SRAM) cell. Other embodiments may also be applied, however, to other circuits and layouts of circuits where a greater uniformity of the layout is desired. Throughout the various views and illustrative embodiments, like reference numbers are used to designate like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a circuit diagram of a single port SRAM bit cell according to an embodiment. The cell includes pull-up transistors PU<b>1</b> and PU<b>2</b>, pull-down transistors PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b>, pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b>, and isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b>. As show in the circuit diagram, transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, IS<b>1</b>, and IS<b>2</b> are p-type transistors, such as planar p-type field effect transistors (PFETs) or p-type fin field effect transistors (finFETs), and transistors PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>, PG<b>1</b>, and PG<b>2</b> are n-type transistors, such as planar n-type field effect transistors (NFETs) or n-type finFETs.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The drains of pull-up transistors PU<b>1</b> and pull-down transistor PD<b>1</b> are coupled together, and the drains of pull-up transistor PU<b>2</b> and pull-down transistor PD<b>2</b> are coupled together. Transistors PU<b>1</b> and PD<b>1</b> are cross-coupled with transistors PU<b>2</b> and PD<b>2</b> to form a data latch. The gates of transistors PU<b>1</b> and PD<b>1</b> are coupled together and to the drains of transistors PU<b>2</b> and PD<b>2</b>, and the gates of transistors PU<b>2</b> and PD<b>2</b> are coupled together and to the drains of transistors PU<b>1</b> and PD<b>1</b>. Sources of the pull-up transistors PU<b>1</b> and PU<b>2</b> are coupled to power voltage Vdd, and the sources of the pull-down transistors PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> are coupled to a ground voltage Vss.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Storage node N<b>1</b> of the data latch is coupled to bit line BL through pass-gate transistor PG<b>1</b>, and storage node N<b>2</b> is coupled to complementary bit line BLB through pass-gate transistor PG<b>2</b>. Storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> are complementary nodes that are often at opposite logic levels (logic high or logic low). Gates of pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> are coupled to a word line WL. The source and gate of the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> are coupled together and to the storage node N<b>1</b>, and the source and gate of the isolation transistor IS<b>2</b> are coupled together and to the storage node N<b>2</b>. Drains of the isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b> are depicted as floating, but may be coupled to respective isolation transistors in adjacent cells, as will be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an array of bit cells, one example of a bit cell being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The array has n number of columns and m number of rows. The array comprises m&#xd7;n number of bit cells, with m number of bit cells in each column and n number of bit cells in each row. Each column has a bit line BL-n and a complementary bit line BLB-n, and each row has a word line WL-m. As a person having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand, a selection of a word line and a bit line will read from or write to a bit cell at the intersection of the selected word line and bit line. A power line Vdd and a ground line Vss are depicted in each column, but these lines may be in each row or in a combination of a row and a column, as will be discussed later.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an example of a four bit cell column according to an embodiment. The column, as depicted, comprises four bit cells C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and C<b>4</b>, each of which being the bit cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with boundaries indicated by the dashed lines. The bit line BL and complementary bit line BLB extend through each bit cell C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and C<b>4</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The drain of the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> in each cell is coupled to the drain of another isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> in an adjacent cell. For example, the drain of transistor IS<b>1</b> in bit cell C<b>1</b> is coupled to the drain of transistor IS<b>1</b> in bit cell C<b>2</b>, and the drain of transistor IS<b>1</b> in bit cell C<b>3</b> is coupled to the drain of transistor IS<b>1</b> in bit cell C<b>4</b>. Further, the drain of the isolation transistor IS<b>2</b> in each cell is coupled to the drain of another isolation transistor IS<b>2</b> in an adjacent cell. For example, the drain of transistor IS<b>2</b> in bit cell C<b>2</b> is coupled to the drain of transistor IS<b>2</b> in bit cell C<b>3</b>. A person having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that the drains of the isolation transistors IS<b>2</b> in bit cells C<b>1</b> and C<b>4</b> can be coupled to isolation transistors in further adjacent cells, although four cells are depicted for illustration purposes. Isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> in cells at a beginning or end of a column can be coupled to transistors in dummy cells and/or left in a floating state.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate example bit cell layouts for the bit cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, four active areas that make up the source/drain regions and channel regions of the various transistors extend longitudinally parallel across the width of the bit cell. For reference, longitudinal axes of the active areas extend in the y-direction of the bit cell. Four gate patterns of the various transistors extend longitudinally parallel along the length, e.g., the x-direction, of the bit cell. It should be noted that the terms width and length and the various directions are used for ease of reference and do not imply that a cell requires any particular dimensions or orientation. For further ease of reference, the dashed rectangle (as opposed to the two dashed lines intersecting the dashed rectangle) circumscribing the bit cell indicates a boundary of the bit cell.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dashed lines that intersect the cell indicate boundaries between a p-type well in the substrate and an n-type well in the substrate in which respective active areas are formed. The active area of transistors PG<b>1</b> and PD<b>1</b> is formed in a p-type well, as these transistors are n-type transistors. The two active areas of transistors IS<b>1</b>, PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, and IS<b>2</b> are formed in an n-type well, as these transistors are p-type transistors. The active area of transistors PD<b>2</b> and PG<b>2</b> is formed in a p-type well, as these transistors are n-type transistors. As person having ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that source/drain regions of the active areas of the transistors are generally doped an opposite dopant type from that of the well. For example, a source/drain region is generally p-type doped when the well in which the active area is formed is an n-type well.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A single gate pattern is used as the gates of transistors PD<b>1</b>, PU<b>1</b>, and IS<b>2</b>, and another single gate pattern is used as the gates of transistors PD<b>2</b>, PU<b>2</b>, and IS<b>1</b>. In this manner, each single gate pattern electrically couples the gates of the respective three transistors. A gate pattern for pass-gate transistor PG<b>1</b> extends beyond a cell boundary so that the gate pattern can be shared by an adjacent bit cell, as does a gate pattern for pass-gate transistor PG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Various contacts couple components in the bit cell. A word line contact WL is coupled to the gate of pass-gate transistor PG<b>1</b>, and another word line contact WL is coupled to the gate of pass-gate transistor PG<b>2</b>. A bit line contact BL is coupled to the drain of pass-gate transistor PG<b>1</b>, and an complementary bit line contact BLB is coupled to the drain of pass-gate transistor PG<b>2</b>. A power contact Vdd is coupled to the source of pull-up transistor PU<b>1</b>, and another power contact Vdd is coupled to the source of pull-up transistor PU<b>2</b>. A ground contact Vss is coupled to the source of pull-down transistor PD<b>1</b>, and another ground contact Vss is coupled to the source of pull-down transistor PD<b>2</b>. A node contact N<b>1</b> couples together the sources of transistors PG<b>1</b> and IS<b>1</b> and the drains of transistors PD<b>1</b> and PU<b>1</b>, and a node contact N<b>2</b> couples together the sources of transistors PG<b>2</b> and IS<b>2</b> and the drains of transistors PD<b>2</b> and PU<b>2</b>. A butted contact BC<b>1</b> couples the source of isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> to the gate of the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b>, and a butted contact BC<b>2</b> couples the source of isolation transistor IS<b>2</b> to the gate of the isolation transistor IS<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a second example of a bit cell layout. The cell layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and includes transistors in the p-type wells with a double pitch. In this example, a double pitch refers generally to a transistor comprising two active areas. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, two active areas extend across the width of the cell in a p-type well to form components of transistors PG<b>1</b> and PD<b>1</b>, and similarly, two active areas extend across the width of the cell in a p-type well to form components of transistors PG<b>2</b> and PD<b>2</b>. Various modifications can be made to contacts and gates to extend to cover and/or contact appropriate components. By having a double pitch to transistors PG<b>1</b>, PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>, and PG<b>2</b>, the channel width of each transistor can be effectively doubled thus increasing the driving ability of each transistor. Other embodiments contemplate various different pitches for various transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an example 2&#xd7;2 array of bit cells C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and C<b>4</b> with each bit cell using the bit cell layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> according to an embodiment. It should be noted that the bit cell layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> or other layouts may be similarly used. For ease of reference, a column is referred to as being in the y-direction in this example. Thus, bit cells C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are in a first column, and bit cells C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> are in a second column. As depicted, adjacent cells in the array are mirror images along a border between the adjacent cells.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each active area in a bit cell extends through multiple bit cells in a column. In an embodiment, each active area in a bit cell extends through all of the bit cells in a column. In other embodiments, each active area extends through less than all of the bit cells in the column. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the active area for transistors IS<b>2</b> and PU<b>2</b> in bit cell C<b>1</b> extends through bit cell C<b>2</b> as the active area for transistors PU<b>2</b> and IS<b>2</b>. In this configuration, the drains of the isolation transistors IS<b>2</b> in adjacent bit cells C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are coupled together (such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> between bit cells C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>) because the drains share a common node along the same active area. Similarly, the active area for transistors IS<b>2</b> and PU<b>2</b> in bit cell C<b>3</b> extends through bit cell C<b>4</b> as the active area for transistors PU<b>2</b> and IS<b>2</b>. Although not illustrated, each of the active areas of isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> in each bit cell extends into an adjacent bit cell to be the active area of respective isolation transistors ISI in the adjacent bit cell, thereby forming the coupling between isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> in adjacent bit cells, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, the bit cells in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> generally operate as a conventional single port SRAM cell operates. When write operations are performed, pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> are turned on, and a voltage to which the bit line BL and the complementary bit line BLB are driven will be sensed through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> by the cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b>. The cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b> drive the storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> to a high or low state based on the sensing (with the storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> being complementary of each other). The data is thus written into the bit cell through bit lines BL and BLB. Conversely, when read operations are performed, pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> are turned on, and the data is read onto the bit line BL and complementary bit line BLB through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b> may have a negligible effect on the operation of the bit cell. When the node to which the source and gate of the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> is coupled is at a high voltage, e.g., a logic high, the voltage at the gate of the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> is also high, and the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> will be in an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state. When the node is at a low voltage, e.g., a logic low, the voltage at the gate will also be low, and the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> will be in an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state. However, because the voltage at the source is also low, such as coupled to ground, no current will flow away from the node through the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b>. In some instances, a small amount of leakage may flow through the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> when the voltage at the node is switched, e.g., from low to high and vice versa. With fast switching times and/or low voltages, the leakage current can be very small and negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By having the bit cells in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, active areas can be uniformly spaced and can uniformly extend throughout an array of bit cells. For example, the spacing between active areas in the x-direction can be uniform, although in embodiments comprising double pitch or other multiple pitch transistors, the spacing may not be uniform, particularly because of the spacing between the active areas of the multiple pitch transistors. Further, the active areas can extend longitudinally across multiple bit cells without being interrupted by an isolation area. This configuration can improve the uniformity of an array layout, and thereby, avoid lithography problems that may arise in forming the active areas, particularly fins for finFET active areas and in small technology nodes.</p>

It should be noted that the bit cell layout of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or other layouts may be similarly used. For ease of reference, a column is referred to as being in the y-direction in this example. Thus, bit cells C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are in a first column, and bit cells C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> are in a second column. As depicted, adjacent cells in the array are mirror images along a border between the adjacent cells.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each active area in a bit cell extends through multiple bit cells in a column. In an embodiment, each active area in a bit cell extends through all of the bit cells in a column. In other embodiments, each active area extends through less than all of the bit cells in the column.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In operation, the bit cells in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 14</figref> generally operate as a conventional dual port SRAM cell operates. When write operations are performed on a first port, pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> are turned on using the first word line AWL, and a voltage to which the first bit line ABL and the complementary first bit line ABLB are driven will be sensed through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> by the cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b>. When write operations are performed on a second port, pass-gate transistors PG<b>3</b> and PG<b>4</b> are turned on using the second word line BWL, and a voltage to which the second bit line BBL and the complementary second bit line BBLB are driven will be sensed through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>3</b> and PG<b>4</b> by the cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b>. The cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b> drive the storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> to a high or low state based on the sensing (with the storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> being complementary of each other). The data is thus written into the bit cell through bit lines ABL, ABLB, BBL, and BBLB. Conversely, when read operations are performed through a first port, pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> are turned on by the first word line AWL, and the data is read onto the first bit line ABL and complementary first bit line ABLB through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b>. When read operations are performed through a second port, pass-gate transistors PG<b>3</b> and PG<b>4</b> are turned on by the second word line BWL, and the data is read onto the second bit line BBL and complementary second bit line BBLB through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>3</b> and PG<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 14</figref> may have a negligible effect on the operation of the bit cell. During operation, current generally may not flow through the isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b>, and in some instances, a small amount of leakage may flow through the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> when the voltage at the node is switched, e.g., from low to high and vice versa. With fast switching times and/or low voltages, the leakage current can be very small and negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By having the bit cells in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, active areas can be more uniformly spaced and can uniformly extend throughout an array of bit cells, as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

For ease of reference, a column is referred to as being in the y-direction in this example. Thus, bit cells C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are in a first column, and bit cells C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> are in a second column. As depicted, adjacent cells in the array are mirror images along a border between the adjacent cells.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each active area in a bit cell extends through multiple bit cells in a column. In an embodiment, each active area in a bit cell extends through all of the bit cells in a column. In other embodiments, each active area extends through less than all of the bit cells in the column. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the active area for transistors IS<b>2</b> and PU<b>2</b> in bit cell C<b>1</b> extends through bit cell C<b>2</b> as the active area for transistors PU<b>2</b> and IS<b>2</b>. In this configuration, the drains of the isolation transistors IS<b>2</b> in adjacent bit cells C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> are coupled together (such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> between bit cells C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>) because the drains share a common node along the same active area. Similarly, the active area for transistors IS<b>2</b> and PU<b>2</b> in bit cell C<b>3</b> extends through bit cell C<b>4</b> as the active area for transistors PU<b>2</b> and IS<b>2</b>. Although not illustrated, each of the active areas of isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> in each bit cell extends into an adjacent bit cell to be the active area of respective isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> in the adjacent bit cell, thereby forming the coupling between isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> in adjacent bit cells, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In operation, the bit cells in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 through 20</figref> generally operate as a conventional two port SRAM cell operates. When write operations are performed on a write port, pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> are turned on using the write word line WWL, and a voltage to which the write bit line WBL and the complementary write bit line WBLB are driven will be sensed through the pass-gate transistors PG<b>1</b> and PG<b>2</b> by the cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b>. The cross-coupled transistors PU<b>1</b>, PU<b>2</b>, PD<b>1</b>, and PD<b>2</b> drive the storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> to a high or low state based on the sensing (with the storage nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> being complementary of each other). The data is thus written into the bit cell through bit lines WBL and WBLB. Conversely, when read operations are performed through a read port, read pass-gate transistor RPG is turned on by the read word line RWL, and the data is read onto the read bit line RBL through the transistor RPG.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 through 20</figref> may have a negligible effect on the operation of the bit cell. During operation, current generally may not flow through the isolation transistors IS<b>1</b> and IS<b>2</b>, and in some instances, a small amount of leakage may flow through the isolation transistor IS<b>1</b> or IS<b>2</b> when the voltage at the node is switched, e.g., from low to high and vice versa. With fast switching times and/or low voltages, the leakage current can be very small and negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">By having the bit cells in the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, active areas can be more uniformly spaced and can uniformly extend throughout an array of bit cells, as discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Further, the active areas can extend longitudinally across multiple bit cells without being interrupted by an isolation area.</p>

Each of the traces in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> can transverse multiple cells in the respective directions in which the traces longitudinally extend.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates a memory layout according to an embodiment. The memory layout comprises a first array of bit cells A<b>1</b> and a second array of bit cells A<b>2</b>. The arrays A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> are each surrounded by dummy bit cells. For example, a first dummy column DC<b>1</b> and a second dummy column DC<b>2</b> are on opposite horizontal sides of each array A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. A first dummy row DR<b>1</b> and a second dummy row DR<b>2</b> are on opposite vertical sides of array A<b>1</b>, and the second dummy row DR<b>2</b> and a third dummy row DR<b>3</b> are on opposite vertical sides of array A<b>2</b>. Various patterns of dummy rows or columns can be dispersed throughout a memory layout. Dummy bit cells in this configuration can allow edge effects, such as from lithography patterning, to be absorbed by the dummy cells rather than by operational memory bit cells.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the substrate <b>10</b> is etched to form fins <b>12</b>.
