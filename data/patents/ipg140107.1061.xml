<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally directed to dispensing systems. In particular, the present invention is directed to keyed dispensers that allow only designated refill units to be installed therein. More specifically, the present invention is directed to electronically keyed fluid dispensing systems including an infrared radiation readable taggant dispersed within at least a portion of the refill unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is well known to provide fluid dispensers for use in restaurants, factories, hospitals, bathrooms and the home. These dispensers may contain one of a number of products such as, for example, soap, anti-bacterial cleansers, disinfectants, lotions and the like. The dispensers may include some type of pump actuation mechanism where the user pushes or pulls a lever to dispense a quantity of fluid, as is known in the art. Alternatively, &#x201c;hands-free&#x201d; automatic dispensers may also be utilized where the user simply places one or both hands underneath a sensor and a quantity of fluid is dispensed. Similar types of dispensers may be used to dispense powder or aerosol materials.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Product dispensers are commonly configured to be mounted on to a wall or other vertical surface, with product being dispensed from an outlet near the bottom of the dispenser. It is also known that dispensers may be integrated into a countertop near a sink basin, with certain components of the dispensing system being located beneath the countertop, and other components, including an outlet, being located above the countertop. These types of dispensers are often referred to as counter-mount dispensing systems. Various other configurations of dispensers are also known, including table-top style dispensers that rest on a horizontal surface such as a counter or table top, or stand mounted dispensing systems that attach to a mounting pole.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Dispensers may directly hold a quantity of product, but such dispensers have been found to be both messy and difficult to service. These bulk fill systems may also pose contamination and health concerns. As a result, refill units or containers that hold a quantity of fluid and provide a pump and nozzle mechanism have become increasingly popular. The sanitary refill units or containers are advantageous in that they are easily installed and replaced and create virtually no mess.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For varying reasons, manufacturers of fluid materials commonly wish to control the type of refill put in a dispenser. It is often of concern that the correct refill unit (type of product, concentration, product form, etc.) is put in the correct dispenser housing. In many cases, installing the correct refill unit is crucial to the customer. For example, it is imperative to hospital personnel to have anti-bacterial soap dispensed in a pre-surgical cleaning area, rather than another fluid such as, for example, moisturizing lotion. Therefore, manufacturers often provide keyed nozzle and pump mechanisms for each type of fluid refill unit so that only the appropriate refill unit can be installed in corresponding fluid dispensers. Manufacturers and associated distributors also rely upon keying systems to ensure that the dispensers can only be refilled with their own products and not products that may be inferior or have poor quality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although mechanical keys are helpful in ensuring that the proper refill unit is installed into the proper dispenser and that high quality product remains in the dispensers, these keying systems also have a number of disadvantages. For example, mechanical keys are often easily removed or altered. Thus, inferior fluid may be installed into a particular dispenser and the manufacturer and distributor may lose the ability to control quality of the product in the dispenser. Mechanical keying also necessitates significant tooling costs underwritten by the manufacturer to design special nozzles and dispensers that are compatible with one another. In other words, each dispenser must be keyed for a particular product, a particular distributor and perhaps even a particular location. Accordingly, the inventory costs for maintaining refill units with a particular key is significant. In addition, the lead time for manufacturing such a refill unit may be quite lengthy. Moreover, the identification of a particular keying device in a dispenser may be lost or damaged so that it is difficult to determine which type of keying configuration is needed for the refill units.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One non-mechanical attempt at controlling the type of product associated with a dispenser is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,431,400B1. This patent discloses a refill unit that utilizes a wafer with an embedded magnet that must be properly oriented into a housing in order for the magnet to be detected and effectively close an on/off switch. If the magnet is not detected then the dispenser is disabled. Although effective in its stated purpose, the device disclosed in the patent suffers from the disadvantage that a specific orientation is required for installation of the refill unit. The patent also discloses the use of a spiral coil on a printed circuit wafer on the bag which is inductively coupled to a similar spiral coil on the housing's base supporting surface. A capacitor connected to the spiral coil on the bag establishes a resonant frequency for a conventional frequency-measuring circuit to provide identification. It is believed that this design is lacking because it provides no teaching for adaptability for use with multiple dispensers. It is also believed that the disclosed configuration is subject to a mis-alignment of the coils which may lead to mis-identification of the bag. In addition, the use of a single coil as the emitting and receiving coils may lead to mis-identification of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another non-mechanical attempt at controlling the type of product associated with a dispenser is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,621,426. This patent discloses a dispensing system that utilizes a near field frequency response to determine whether a refill unit is compatible with a dispensing system. In particular, the refill unit is provided with a coil terminated by one of a number of capacitors. The refill unit is received in a housing that provides a pair of coils that are in a spatial relationship with the installed refill unit's coil. By energizing one of the housing's coils, the other coil detects a unique electronic signature generated by the refill unit's coil. If the signature is acceptable the dispensing system is allowed to dispense a quantity of material. This dispensing system, however, suffers from the disadvantage that it is not easily recycled. The metal coils prevent recycling of the component in which they are located, namely a collar of the refill unit. Given the increasing desire to provide eco-friendly products and reduce the consumption of natural resources, the copper coils provided in this dispensing system may present a disadvantage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the need exists for a sustainable electronic keying system for a fluid dispenser and refill unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In light of the foregoing, it is a first aspect of the present invention to provide an electronically keyed dispensing system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a dispensing system, as above, that is environmentally friendly and recyclable.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is still another aspect of the present invention to provide a dispensing system, as above, that includes an infrared radiation (IR) sensor in the housing and an IR readable taggant dispersed within at least a portion of the refill unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be appreciated from reading the background of the invention that a primary concern in the field of fluid dispensing systems is the ability to prevent unauthorized refill units from being installed in a manufacturer's dispenser or in dispensers serviced by a distributor authorized by the manufacturer. The dispensing system disclosed herein fills this need by providing the refill unit with a unique identifier, and providing the dispenser housing with a sensor adapted to sense the presence of only that unique identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A microprocessor based controller is associated with either the refill unit, or the dispenser housing. The controller may be used to control any number of operational mechanisms that permit use of the dispensing system. The dispenser disclosed herein may utilize operational mechanisms such as a push bar mechanism or a &#x201c;hands-free&#x201d; automatic sensor mechanism for dispensing a quantity of product. The push bar mechanism may be actuated by pushing a bar that actuates a pump mechanism carried by the refill unit to dispense a measured quantity of fluid. The &#x201c;hands-free&#x201d; device, an example of which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,390,329, and which is incorporated herein by reference, utilizes a sensor that detects the presence of an individual's hand and then dispenses a measured quantity of fluid. The controller may also be operative with a mechanism that controls a pump associated with the refill unit, wherein incompatibility of the refill unit with the dispenser housing may preclude actuation of the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to operate the hands-free dispenser and other dispensers it is known to provide a power source, such as low voltage batteries, within the fluid dispenser housing. The batteries contained within the fluid dispenser may be utilized to operate the controller and/or the communication device associated with the dispenser housing. In the alternative, power may be externally provided via an electronic key inserted into the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be appreciated from the description to follow, the various features of the different embodiments of the invention may be utilized in any number of combinations and with one or multiple dispensers. Accordingly, while the following detailed description and figures set out preferred embodiments of the invention, the scope of the invention should not be unduly limited to the specific components or arrangements discussed herein. It is noted that the figures show an illustrative embodiment using a wall-mounted style soap dispenser, configured to mount on a vertical surface, the invention expressly includes and can be applied to dispensing systems of other configurations, including but not limited to counter-mount, table top, stand mounted and other fluid dispensing systems. It is also contemplated that invention may apply to any dispensing system wherein a refill unit is accepted into a dispensing unit and is not limited by the configuration of the dispensing unit or the product dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a dispensing system is shown, generally indicated by the numeral <b>10</b>. Dispensing system <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>12</b> which encloses and protects the internal components of dispensing system <b>10</b>. Housing <b>12</b> includes a back plate <b>14</b> adapted to be secured to a vertical surface, and a cover <b>16</b> that is pivotable relative to back plate <b>14</b>. Cover <b>16</b> allows access to the internal components of dispensing system <b>10</b> to facilitate replacement of a refill unit. A latching mechanism (not shown) secures cover <b>16</b> to back plate <b>14</b> during normal operation of dispensing system <b>10</b>, and is releasable to allow cover <b>16</b> to pivot relative to back plate <b>14</b>. The cover <b>16</b> may include an observation window <b>18</b> so that the interior of the dispenser <b>10</b> can be viewed, if desired. An LED indicator <b>20</b> may also be provided, wherein illumination of the indicator <b>20</b> shows that the dispenser is on and non-illumination of the LED indicates that the unit is inoperative.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A refill unit <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is received in housing <b>12</b> and is adapted to be replaceable. Refill unit <b>22</b> includes a product reservoir <b>24</b> and a pump mechanism <b>26</b> that is in fluid communication with the product reservoir. Product reservoir <b>24</b> retains the material to be dispensed by the system. The material may be any fluid or other form of product known to those skilled in the art including, for example, liquid soap, hand sanitizer, gels, foams or lotions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Pump mechanism <b>26</b> may be any pump known to those skilled in the art and capable of dispensing a metered amount of fluid from product reservoir <b>24</b>. For example, pump mechanism <b>26</b> may be a plunger or piston pump, a diaphragm pump, a bellows pump, a peristaltic pump, or any other known positive displacement pump. Pump mechanism <b>26</b> is operatively engaged with the actuating mechanism of the dispenser when refill unit <b>22</b> is installed. Thus, activation of the actuating mechanism causes the pump to dispense a metered volume of fluid. Actuating mechanisms suitable for use with dispenser, and methods of operatively connecting the actuating mechanism to a pump, are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Refill unit <b>22</b> further includes a collar <b>28</b> that may be positioned around pump mechanism <b>26</b>. Collar <b>28</b> is adapted to be received in housing <b>12</b> to secure the refill unit therein. In the embodiment shown in the figures, collar <b>28</b> is generally cylindrical in shape. However, collar <b>28</b> may be provided in any form that is adapted to be received within housing <b>12</b>. Collar <b>28</b> may optionally include a mechanical key <b>30</b> projecting therefrom (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Key <b>30</b> is adapted to be received in a keyway <b>32</b> in housing <b>12</b>, with the keyway <b>32</b> having a shape corresponding to key <b>30</b>. Key <b>30</b> and keyway <b>32</b> further help to prevent the insertion of an incorrect refill unit into housing <b>12</b>. Key <b>30</b> and keyway <b>32</b> may have any desired shape or arrangement so long as keyway <b>32</b> is adapted to receive key <b>30</b> therein.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain embodiments, collar <b>28</b> may be formed from any known thermoplastic polymer resin. For example, collar <b>28</b> may be formed from a polyester resin. More specifically, collar <b>28</b> may be formed from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family. The thermoplastic resin may also include any known fillers to improve or enhance the characteristics of the resulting collar <b>28</b>. According to the concepts of the present invention, collar <b>28</b> is formed from a thermoplastic resin including an identifying agent, also referred to herein as a taggant, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The taggant may be mixed with the thermoplastic resin during the manufacturing process of collar <b>28</b>, thereby producing a collar having a taggant dispersed therein. The taggant identifies the collar, and the refill unit <b>22</b> associated therewith, as an appropriate and authorized refill for the dispenser. The taggant dispersed in collar <b>28</b> is adapted to be detected by an infrared (IR) sensor <b>34</b> provided in housing <b>12</b>. Thus, when the taggant dispersed within collar <b>28</b> is subjected to infrared radiation it emits detectable wavelengths of energy.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The taggant may be any known chemical, compound or material capable of emitting a detectable signal when exposed to infrared radiation. One example of a taggant material that may be dispersed within the collar <b>28</b> is a base material of lattice structure that includes one or more rare-earth metal dopants. By varying the level of dopant, or the position of the dopant molecules within the lattice, it is possible to produce a range of taggant materials that exhibit different, but predictable and repeatable emission characteristics when excited by a radiation source. Other suitable taggant materials are well known to those skilled in the art, and any commercially available taggant may be used in conjunction with the present invention. To facilitate dispersion of the taggant throughout the thermoplastic resin, the taggant may be considered a micro-particle and may range in size from 20 to 600 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Infrared sensor <b>34</b> includes an infrared radiation signal generator as well as a signal detector for detecting the energy emitted by the taggant within collar <b>28</b>. These IR sensors are well known in the art, and any combination of known signal generators and detectors may be employed. It is also contemplated that an IR signal generator and a detector for detecting the energy emitted by the taggant may be provided separately. In either case, the infrared sensor <b>34</b> will require an energy source. The energy source may be a battery provided within the housing <b>12</b> or an external power source. If the dispensing system <b>10</b> is a hands free system relying upon battery power, the infrared sensor <b>34</b> may rely upon the same batteries or power supply as the dispensing mechanism of the system. In one or more embodiments, infrared sensor <b>34</b> is mounted at a location on or in housing <b>12</b> so as to be positioned above what may be referred to as the &#x201c;splash zone,&#x201d; or area likely to be sprayed by the liquid or foam dispensed, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller (not shown) within the housing <b>12</b> controls the ability of dispensing system <b>10</b> to dispense fluid from a refill unit <b>22</b> based upon the signal, or lack thereof, identified by infrared sensor <b>34</b>. When a refill unit <b>22</b> is installed within housing <b>12</b> and includes a taggant in the collar <b>28</b> that is detectable by the infrared sensor <b>34</b>, then the controller allows the dispensing mechanism to function. Conversely, if a refill unit is installed within housing <b>12</b> that does not include a taggant within the collar that is detectable by the infrared sensor <b>34</b>, then the controller will prevent actuation of the dispenser. In this way, the manufacturer of the dispensing system <b>10</b> maintains control over the quality and type of product dispensed therefrom. It is also contemplated that different densities of taggant may be provided in different refill units to distinguish between various products and customers. The varying of the density of taggant is believed to result in varying signals or strength of energy emitted from the taggant when subjected to IR radiation. Alternatively, it is contemplated that UV absorbers may be included with the taggant in the refill unit to alter the wavelength of the signal emitted by the taggant, thereby providing a unique electronic key to the refill unit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In certain embodiments of the invention collar <b>28</b> may include a flag or other projection extending therefrom. Rather than providing a taggant throughout the entire collar <b>28</b>, the taggant may be provided only in the flag. Accordingly, the flag would be positioned adjacent to an infrared sensor <b>34</b> within housing <b>12</b> so that the sensor could easily detect the energy emitted by the taggant when subjected to infrared radiation. A space or gap may be provided between the flag and the infrared sensor to improve the detection and reliability of the sensor. In certain embodiments, the taggant may be provided in key <b>30</b>, with the key and sensor <b>34</b> arranged in close proximity.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In certain embodiments, a mechanical keying system may also be provided to enhance the security of the dispensing system. Mechanical keying systems are well known in the art, and typically include a physical key located on the refill unit, and a receiving keyway located on the housing. The existence of an incorrect mechanical key may prevent insertion of the refill unit into the housing, thereby preventing stuffing. In one or more embodiments, an electronic keying system may be provided to identify the manufacturer of the refill unit, and a mechanical key may be used to distinguish between several refill units produced by the same manufacturer. Thus, only a refill unit including the taggant and the correct mechanical key will allow the refill unit to be inserted into the housing, and the dispenser to dispense product. An exemplary mechanical keying system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,798,370, which is incorporated herein for the purpose of teaching a suitable mechanical keying system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, an alternative embodiment of a keyed fluid dispenser is shown, and is indicated generally by the numeral <b>50</b>. The foaming dispenser <b>10</b> comprises a peristaltic pump <b>52</b> that includes a plurality of rotating engagement members <b>54</b> that are carried by a rotating drive plate <b>56</b> that is driven by a motor drive operatively coupled thereto. A refill unit <b>57</b> includes a flexible outlet tube <b>58</b> that is fluidly coupled at one end to a refill container <b>60</b> via an attachment adapter <b>62</b>. In certain embodiments, the other end of the outlet tube <b>58</b> may be coupled to a foaming chip nozzle <b>64</b>. The outlet tube <b>58</b> is compressively retained against the rotating engagement members <b>54</b> by a guide <b>66</b> that is pivotably and removably attached to the dispenser <b>10</b>. Thus, as the engagement members <b>54</b> rotate and compress the outlet tube <b>58</b> against the guide <b>66</b>, liquid material, such as soap, carried by the refill container <b>60</b> is drawn or otherwise pumped into the outlet tube <b>58</b> and forced under pressure into the foaming chip nozzle <b>64</b>, where air is introduced into the pressurized liquid material, aerating it into a foam that is dispensed therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The dispenser <b>10</b> includes a housing <b>70</b> and a pivoting door <b>72</b> attached thereto that can be moved between open and closed positions. A frame section <b>74</b> is disposed within the housing <b>70</b>, which provides a retention bin <b>76</b> to house and support the refill container <b>60</b> placed therein. In certain embodiments, housing <b>70</b> may include an infrared sensor <b>78</b>, as discussed above, that is adapted to detect the presence of energy emitted by a taggant dispersed within a molded portion of the refill unit <b>57</b>. In one or more embodiments, the taggant may be dispersed within the attachment adaptor <b>62</b>. However, it is contemplated that the taggant may be provided in any portion of the refill unit that is made of a thermoplastic polymer resin, and the infrared sensor <b>78</b> positioned at a location on housing <b>70</b> adjacent to the location of the taggant containing portion of the refill unit.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, another alternative embodiment of a keyed fluid dispenser is shown and is indicated generally by the numeral <b>100</b>. Dispenser <b>100</b> is configured to be mounted to a mounting base <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. For example, the mounting base <b>102</b> may comprise a countertop surface, such as that used to support a lavatory sink used to wash one's hands in a restroom. The mounting base <b>102</b> includes an upper surface <b>104</b> and opposed lower surface <b>106</b> and may comprise any structure suitable for mounting the dispenser <b>100</b> formed from any suitable material, such as wood, plastic, or ceramic for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The dispenser <b>100</b> includes a nozzle <b>110</b> that is in fluid communication with a refill container <b>112</b> via an outlet tube <b>114</b>. Liquid material, such as liquid soap, sanitizer, moisturizer, or the like that is carried by the refill container <b>112</b> is pumped therefrom via the outlet tube <b>114</b> by a pump <b>116</b> that is in operative communication with the outlet tube <b>114</b>. In the embodiment depicted, pump <b>116</b> is a peristaltic pump, but dispenser <b>100</b> may be adapted to utilize any known pump design. As the liquid material passes through the outlet tube <b>114</b>, it may be converted from liquid to foam by a foaming chip retained within the nozzle <b>110</b>, which is in fluid communication with the outlet tube <b>114</b>. In addition, the peristaltic pump <b>116</b>, the refill container <b>112</b> and various other components of the dispenser <b>100</b> are suspended off of the floor underneath the mounting base <b>102</b> by a support hanger <b>120</b>. As such, the components of the dispenser <b>100</b> are able to be concealed underneath the mounting base <b>102</b> and hidden from the view of the user, without taking up floor space beneath the mounting base.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In certain embodiments, dispenser <b>100</b> may include an infrared sensor <b>122</b>, as discussed above with respect to the other embodiments, that is adapted to detect the presence of energy emitted by a taggant dispersed within a molded portion of the refill container <b>112</b>. In one or more embodiments, the taggant may be dispersed within a collar <b>124</b> of the refill container <b>112</b>. However, it is contemplated that the taggant may be provided in any portion of the refill container that is made of a thermoplastic polymer resin, and the infrared sensor <b>122</b> may be positioned at a location adjacent to the location of the taggant containing portion of the refill unit. In certain embodiments, the infrared sensor <b>122</b> may be secured to the support hanger <b>120</b> of dispenser <b>100</b>. Infrared sensor <b>122</b> and pump <b>116</b> may be connected to a common power source and control circuit, or, optionally, may be connected to separate power supplies and control circuits. Operation of pump <b>116</b> is prevented unless the presence of a taggant within refill container <b>112</b> is detected by infrared sensor <b>122</b>.</p>
