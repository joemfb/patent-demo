<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A novel SRAM memory cell structure and method of making the same are provided. The SRAM memory cell structure comprises strained PMOS transistors formed in a semiconductor substrate. The PMOS transistors comprise epitaxial grown source/drain regions that result in significant PMOS transistor drive current increase. An insulation layer is formed atop an STI that is used to electrically isolate adjacent PMOS transistors. The insulation layer is substantially elevated from the semiconductor substrate surface. The elevated insulation layer facilitates the formation of desirable thick epitaxial source/drain regions, and prevents the bridging between adjacent epitaxial layers due to the epitaxial layer lateral extension during the process of growing epitaxial sour/drain regions. The processing steps of forming the elevated insulation layer are compatible with a conventional CMOS process flow.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and more particularly to SRAM devices and SRAM cell structures that utilize strained-channel transistors to enhance the performance of transistors and methods of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">While the trend of integrating complex electronic systems in an integrated circuit (IC) continues, there is an increasing demand for high-performance memory devices for storing software programs and processed data. As a reliable, proven technology, a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is the instinctive choice of a high-performance stand-alone memory device or an embedded memory device used in ICs having a system-on-a-chip (SOC) configuration. The distinct advantages of an SRAM include fast access speed, low power consumption, high noise margin, and process compatibility with a conventional CMOS fabrication process, among others. There is a continuous quest for SRAMs with higher storage cell density so that a larger amount of data can be stored.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a conventional six transistor CMOS SRAM cell <b>5</b>. In SRAM cell <b>5</b>, a first inverter <b>2</b>, comprising a first pull-up PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> and a first pull-down NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>, is cross-coupled with a second inverter <b>4</b>, comprising a second pull-up PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> and a second pull-down NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>. The source, drain and gate of each transistor are labeled with an &#x201c;S,&#x201d; &#x201c;D,&#x201d; or &#x201c;G,&#x201d; respectively. The gate electrodes of P<b>1</b> and N<b>1</b> and the source regions of P<b>2</b> and N<b>2</b> make up a first storage node &#x201c;A.&#x201d; The gate electrodes of P<b>2</b> and N<b>2</b> and the source regions of P<b>1</b> and N<b>1</b> make up a second storage node &#x201c;B.&#x201d; The drains of P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> and the drains of N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> are coupled to a supply voltage VDD and ground GND, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">During operation, data is written into the SRAM cell <b>5</b> by first activating the wordline WL coupled to access NMOS transistors N<b>3</b> and N<b>4</b>. Subsequently, the digital bit carried on the bitline BL will be passed to the storage node &#x201c;B&#x201d; and the complementary bit on the bitline <o ostyle="single">BL</o> will be passed to the storage node &#x201c;A.&#x201d; This state will be held until new data is applied on the access transistors N<b>3</b> and N<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the inherently lower carrier mobility of holes than that of electrons, a PMOS transistor in an SRAM cell is typically formed occupying larger silicon surface than that of an NMOS transistor in order to obtain matching drive currents between an NMOS and a PMOS transistor, generally leading to the desired symmetric device electrical characteristics. This situation may slow down the pace of continuously scaling-down device feature sizes and increasing memory cell density in an SRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a portion of the cross sectional view of CMOS SRAM cell <b>5</b>, where strain engineering is employed to enhance PMOS transistors P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> performance in SRAM cell <b>5</b>. This is accomplished by etching a recess into silicon substrate <b>10</b> at the source/drain regions of P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. Relaxed silicon germanium (SiGe) epitaxial layer <b>12</b> is then selectively grown in the source region &#x201c;S&#x201d; and drain region &#x201c;D&#x201d; of P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. Because the lattice constant of the SiGe is greater than that of silicon, the channel regions &#x201c;C&#x201d; between the SiGe source/drains of P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> are placed under compressive stresses, leading to a significant drive current increase for P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. However, due to the lateral extension of SiGe epitaxial layer <b>12</b> during the epitaxial growth process, SiGe from drain region &#x201c;D&#x201d; of P<b>1</b> and SiGe from source region &#x201c;S&#x201d; of P<b>2</b> may bridge a shallow trench isolation (STI) isolating P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>, thereby electrically shorting drain region &#x201c;D&#x201d; of P<b>1</b> and source region &#x201c;S&#x201d; of P<b>2</b>. This problem prevents forming thick SiGe epitaxial layer that typically provides favorable electrical characteristics, such as reduced contact resistance. This problem may also lead to reduced SRAM cell manufacturing yield.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The making and using of the presently preferred embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention will be described with respect to preferred embodiments in a specific context, namely improved SRAM devices and SRAM cell structures, and a method of forming the same. This inventive SRAM cell structure comprises an elevated insulation layer on a device isolation region between adjacent PMOS source/drain regions that comprise an elevated epitaxial SiGe layer. The integration of an elevated insulation layer on the device isolation region may be fabricated adding few processing steps that are compatible with a conventional CMOS process flow, for example. The process steps used to form the insulation region will lead to improved overall SRAM product yield.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a portion of a CMOS SRAM cell <b>50</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The portion of cell <b>50</b> comprises PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>, such as pull-up PMOS transistors P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, formed in an N-type region (e.g., N-well) of substrate <b>100</b>. The portion of the SRAM cell <b>50</b> also comprises NMOS device <b>75</b>, such as pull-down NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> or N<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, formed in a P-type region (e.g., P-well) of substrate <b>100</b>. Substrate <b>100</b> is typically silicon (Si), but may also be made of gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium arsenide-phosphide (GaAsP), indium phosphide (InP), gallium aluminum arsenic (GaAlAs), indium gallium phosphide (InGaP), and the like. Alternatively, substrate <b>100</b> could be a semiconductor layer formed on an insulating layer, in a so-called silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> each comprise a source region <b>80</b><i>s </i>and <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and a drain region <b>80</b><i>d </i>and <b>85</b><i>d</i>, respectively. Source regions <b>80</b><i>s </i>and <b>85</b><i>s </i>and drain regions <b>80</b><i>d </i>and <b>85</b><i>d </i>are SiGe epitaxial layers formed in substrate <b>100</b> and are elevated from top surface <b>81</b> of substrate <b>100</b>. Source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>extend from an edge of gate electrode spacer <b>65</b> to an edge of STI. In a preferred embodiment, source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>are from about 50 &#x212b; to about 500 &#x212b; elevated from top surface <b>81</b> of substrate <b>100</b>. Because the lattice constant of SiGe source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>is greater than that of silicon substrate <b>100</b>, channel regions <b>80</b><i>c </i>and <b>85</b><i>c </i>between the SiGe source/drains <b>80</b><i>s </i>and <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s </i>and <b>85</b><i>d</i>, respectively, are placed under uniaxial compressive strain, which results in improved hole mobility in channel regions <b>80</b><i>c </i>and <b>85</b><i>c</i>. This may lead to a significant improvement in measured PMOS drive current. In one preferred embodiment, source/drains regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s </i>and <b>85</b><i>d </i>each have a substantially constant Ge concentration, respectively, such as a substantially constant Ge concentration from about 5% to about 40%. In another preferred embodiment, Ge concentrations in source/drains regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s </i>and <b>85</b><i>d </i>is graded from about 0% Ge at the top surface to a maximum concentration of about 30% near the source and drain bottom/substrate <b>100</b> interface. Also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, NMOS device <b>75</b> comprises heavily-doped N-type source region <b>75</b><i>s </i>and drain region <b>75</b><i>d </i>that extend into substrate <b>100</b>, whereas source/drain regions <b>75</b><i>s </i>and <b>75</b><i>d </i>are not substantially elevated from top surface <b>81</b> of substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">SRAM cell <b>50</b> further comprises an insulation layer <b>70</b> that is formed atop the STIs. The STIs provide electrical isolation between like kinds of NMOS or PMOS transistors in a given well or substrate, such as PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>, and also provide electrical isolation between adjacent NMOS and PMOS transistors formed in separate wells, such as NMOS transistor <b>75</b> and PMOS transistor <b>80</b>. Insulation layer <b>70</b> may be silicon nitride, but may also be made of oxynitride, silicon oxide, SiC, SiCN, any combinations thereof, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one preferred embodiment, insulation layer <b>70</b> is formed prior to the formation of source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d</i>. The edges of insulation layer <b>70</b> are substantially aligned with the edges of STIs. Insulation layer <b>70</b> acts as a barrier to the lateral extension of the SiGe epitaxial layer when forming source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>in a subsequent SiGe epitaxial growth process. The thickness of insulation layer <b>70</b> is, thus, about the same as that of the elevated portion of source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s </i>and <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s </i>and <b>85</b><i>d </i>to be formed. In a preferred embodiment, insulation layer <b>70</b> has a thickness of from about 50 &#x212b; to about 300 &#x212b;, while source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> have an elevated portion of from about 50 &#x212b; to about 300 &#x212b; above a top surface <b>81</b> of substrate <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> have an elevated portion of from about 150 &#x212b; to about 400 &#x212b; above a top surface <b>81</b> of substrate <b>100</b>, leading to significantly reduced contact resistance due to the substantially thickened PMOS source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In preferred embodiments, the elevated portion of the epitaxial SiGe source/drain regions <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d </i>abut, at one end, an edge of gate electrode spacer <b>65</b> and abut, at another end, an edge of insulation layer <b>70</b>, respectively. Furthermore, the insulating characteristic of insulation layer <b>70</b> reinforces the desired electrical isolation between adjacent NMOS and PMOS transistors. In preferred embodiments, SRAM cells also comprise silicide layer <b>68</b> that is formed on the top surfaces of NMOS and PMOS source/drain regions <b>75</b><i>s</i>, <b>75</b><i>d</i>, <b>80</b><i>s</i>, <b>80</b><i>d</i>, <b>85</b><i>s</i>, and <b>85</b><i>d</i>. Silicide layer <b>68</b> is preferably NiSi<sub>2</sub>, CoSi<sub>2</sub>, WSi<sub>2</sub>, TiSi<sub>2</sub>, or the like. Silicide layer <b>68</b> further reduces the contact resistances of the source/drain regions, thus improving NMOS and PMOS transistor performance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another preferred embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the edges of insulation layer <b>70</b> are offset inwardly from the edges of STIs, enabling an increased contact area of the PMOS source/drain regions. Advantageous features include further reduced contact resistance and increased process margin of making electrical contact to the PMOS source/drain regions. To clarify description and avoid repetition, like numerals and letters used to describe SRAM cell <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are used for the various elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and in the coming figures. Also, reference numerals described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may not be described again in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a portion of SRAM cell <b>150</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Each of the epitaxial SiGe source/drain regions of PMOS devices, such as PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>, in SRAM cell <b>150</b> comprises a bottom layer and a cap layer overlying the bottom layer. As an example, bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B and cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A of the source region of PMOS transistor <b>80</b> are used to illustrate inventive features of the current embodiment. The Ge in bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B has a relatively high Ge concentration, while the Ge in cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A has a relatively low Ge concentration. In one preferred embodiment, the bottom layer and the cap layer each have a substantially constant Ge concentration, respectively, such as 20% Ge in bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B and 5% Ge in cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A. In another preferred embodiment, Ge concentrations in cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A and bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B is graded from about 0% Ge at the top surface of cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A to a maximum concentration of about 40% near bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B/substrate <b>100</b> interface. In a further preferred embodiment, cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A has a substantially constant, low Ge concentration of from about 0% to about 5%, while Ge concentration in bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B is graded reaching a maximum concentration of about 40% near bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B/substrate <b>100</b> interface. Also, the thickness of cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A, either with constant or graded Ge concentration, is about 300 &#x212b;. The overall SiGe layer thickness of bottom layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B and cap layer <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A is of from about 400 &#x212b; to about 1000 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">By providing epitaxial SiGe source/drain regions having a high Ge concentration bottom layer and a low Ge concentration cap layer, the performance of the PMOS device in an SRAM cell can be further improved. In one aspect, bottom layers having a high Ge concentration in the source and drain regions of PMOS transistors in an SRAM cell, such as bottom layers <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B and <b>80</b><i>d</i>_B of PMOS transistor <b>80</b>, create an increased uniaxial compressive strain in the channel regions, which may result in an increased PMOS transistor drive current. In another aspect, SiGe source/drain cap layers having a low Ge concentration, such as <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A and <b>80</b><i>d</i>_A of PMOS transistor <b>80</b>, can lead to a high quality interface between the source/drain regions and silicide layer <b>68</b> formed from thereon because silicide layer <b>68</b> has a substantially matching lattice constant with Si but not with Ge. A good source/drain and silicide layer <b>68</b> interface can lead to reduced contact resistances to the source/drain regions of NMOS and PMOS transistors, thus improving NMOS and PMOS transistor performance.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">PMOS transistors having an epitaxial SiGe source and drain region upgrade the electrical strength by increasing the hole mobility through their channel regions. This upgrade of PMOS transistors in an SRAM cell can be used to reduce the size of an SRAM cell because a pre-determined PMOS drive current can be achieved by a strained PMOS transistor having a reduced device size when compared with a non-strained PMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a portion of SRAM cell <b>250</b> in accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention. Besides epitaxial SiGe source and drain regions of PMOS transistors <b>80</b>, <b>85</b>, and insulation layer <b>70</b>, SRAM cell <b>250</b> further comprises tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> that is formed on the gate regions and at least a portion of the source regions and drain regions of the NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell, such as <b>75</b><i>g</i>, <b>75</b><i>s </i>and <b>75</b><i>d </i>of NMOS transistor <b>75</b>. Tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> is preferably formed of a dielectric material, such as silicon nitride, oxynitride, oxide, or the like. In alternative embodiments, tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> may also comprise semiconductors, metals, combinations thereof, or the like. Tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> may be in the form of a single layer or composite layers. An advantageous feature of tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> is that it has an inherent stress, when deposited on an NMOS transistor, and induces a tensile strain in the channel region of the NMOS transistor, such as channel region <b>75</b><i>c </i>of NMOS device <b>75</b>. The magnitude of the tensile strain is affected by the relative properties of the tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> and the underlying materials. In preferred embodiments, tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> is made of silicon nitride and has a thickness from about 50 &#x212b; to about 1000 &#x212b;. As known to those skilled in the art, a tensile strain in the channel region of an NMOS transistor enhances the electron mobility, thus leading to a significant improvement in measured NMOS drive current. This upgrade of NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell can be used to reduce the size of an SRAM cell because a pre-determined NMOS drive current can be achieved by a strained NMOS transistor having a reduced device size when compared with a non-strained NMOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The formation of tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> on NMOS transistors in SRAM cell <b>250</b> also serves an important role in maintaining a pre-determined SRAM cell static noise margin (SNM) when PMOS transistors in an SRAM cell are upgraded with increased drive current in preferred embodiments of the current invention as described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As known in the art, Signal/Noise Margin (SNM) is a principle factor in evaluating the operational stability of an SRAM memory cell. SNM measures the SRAM cell logical stability when a voltage disturbance in the bit lines of an SRAM device occurs. Typically, SNM is maximized to ensure cell stability in a memory device. In order for a CMOS SRAM cell to work in a steady-state with a wide noise margin, the drive current of the pull-down NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell, such as N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, is preferably equal to the drive current of the pull-up PMOS transistors in the SRAM cell, such as P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As PMOS transistor properties change, as in the case of forming SiGe source and drain regions in a PMOS transistor to create compressive strain in its channel region, thus, increasing the drive current in the PMOS transistor, the PMOS and NMOS transistor drive current ratio also changes. The change requires a drive current increase in the NMOS transistors to retain the initial, optimized NMOS and PMOS transistor drive current ratio. One way to enhance the drive current of the pull-down NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell is to increase its size, which is typically unfavorable because increasing SRAM memory cell density is generally preferred in advanced technology. Alternatively, by forming tensile-stressed film <b>200</b> on NMOS transistors in SRAM cell <b>250</b>, the size of the pull-down NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell needs not to be increased while being able to maintain a pre-determined, robust SNM in the SRAM memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an additional and/or alternative embodiment of the current invention, the size of the NMOS and PMOS transistors in an SRAM cell may be decreased or minimized in order to further reduce the size of an SRAM cell and, thus, achieve a maximum possible memory cell density. In this regard, the drive current of the pull-up PMOS transistors may be maintained to a pre-determined value by forming SiGe source and drain regions as described previously. A matching drive current in the pull-down NMOS transistors, which have a reduced transistor size, may be obtained by forming tensile-stressed film on the pull-down NMOS transistors in an SRAM memory cell. Accordingly, a pre-determined high SNM property can be retained even if transistor feature sizes in an SRAM memory cell are further reduced. In preferred embodiments, the level of stress, the film thickness, the film dimension, and the like of film <b>200</b> are adjusted to achieve a matching drive current in the pull-down NMOS transistors in an SRAM memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be noted that only a limited number of examples, such as SRAM cell <b>50</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>250</b> are shown for conveying the inventive feature of providing insulation layer <b>70</b> atop isolations, such as STIs, LOCOS (Local Oxidation of Silicon) isolations, or the like, thus enabling a significantly thickened PMOS transistor source and drain regions that create a desired strain in the PMOS transistor channel region. Also only a portion of each of the SRAM cells of <b>50</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>250</b> is illustrated for the ease of illustration and clarity. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this inventive feature can be used in integrated circuit devices other than SRAM memory cell where improved performance on PMOS devices is desired, such as increased drive current and reduced contact resistance, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, as known in the art, a strain NMOS transistor can also be formed in a manner where an epitaxial layer of Si source and drain is formed on a SiGe substrate. Because the lattice contact of Si is substantially smaller than that of SiGe, the channel region of an NMOS transistor thus formed is placed under a constant tensile strain, which results in improved electron mobility in the channel region. This may lead to a significant improvement in measured NMOS drive current. As can be appreciated by those skilled, the inventive features of forming insulation layer <b>70</b> atop isolations between PMOS transistors as described above can be readily used to form insulation layer atop isolations between NMOS transistors, thus leading to improved NMOS transistor performance.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, the strain inducing materials and the various transistor configurations shown in the different embodiments may be changed, substituted, and combined without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The specific devices or lack of devices that are illustrated in the above examples are not intended to limit the embodiments of the present invention in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a process for fabricating a cell of an SRAM in preferred embodiments, such as cell <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or cell <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the process comprises fabricating PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> in and on an N-type region, such as an N-well of substrate <b>100</b>, and fabricating NMOS transistor <b>75</b> in and on a P-type region, such as P-well of substrate <b>100</b>. PMOS transistor <b>80</b> may include lightly doped source region <b>81</b>, lightly doped drain region <b>82</b>, and gate electrode <b>80</b><i>g </i>formed atop a gate dielectric layer <b>83</b>. PMOS transistor <b>85</b> may include lightly doped source region <b>86</b>, lightly doped drain region <b>87</b>, and gate electrode <b>85</b><i>g </i>formed atop a gate dielectric layer <b>88</b>. NMOS transistor <b>75</b> may include lightly doped source region <b>76</b>, lightly doped drain region <b>77</b>, and gate electrode <b>75</b><i>g </i>formed atop a gate dielectric layer <b>78</b>. PMOS transistors <b>80</b>, <b>85</b>, and NMOS transistor <b>75</b> are electrically isolated from each other by known field isolations, such as STIs. Any known, suitable materials and methods of fabricating the NMOS transistor, PMOS transistor, and STIs may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, dielectric layer <b>55</b> is formed on the top surface of the substrate. By way of example, silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>or Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), oxide, and/or silicon oxynitride (Si<sub>x</sub>ON<sub>y</sub>) may be used for dielectric layer <b>55</b>, although other suitable dielectric materials are not excluded. These materials may be grown or blanket deposited in any suitable manners, such as by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced CVD or physical vapor deposition (PVD). In one preferred embodiment, dielectric layer <b>55</b> is conformal to the underlying substrate topography. A first photolithography process is applied to the surface of dielectric layer <b>55</b>, which comprises forming photoresist pattern (PR) for selective etching of dielectric layer <b>55</b> on the regions of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Continuing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first suitable etch process, such as a plasma anisotropic etch process, is performed, which removes dielectric layer <b>55</b> in the regions of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>, leaving dummy spacers <b>57</b> at the sidewalls of gate electrode <b>80</b><i>g </i>and <b>85</b><i>g</i>, and dielectric layer <b>70</b> over NMOS transistor <b>75</b> and STIs. Recesses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b> are subsequently formed in substrate <b>100</b> at the source/drain regions of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> by a second suitable etch process, such as a plasma anisotropic etch process. In one preferred embodiment, the depth of recesses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b> measured from the top surface of substrate <b>100</b> may be from about 500 &#x212b; to about 2000 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, strain inducing materials are filled in recesses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b> to a level above the top surface of substrate <b>100</b>. By way of example, a first epitaxial SiGe layer is grown in recesses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and <b>104</b>, forming SiGe bottom layers <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B and <b>80</b><i>d</i>_B of the source/drain regions of PMOS transistor <b>80</b>, and SiGe bottom layers <b>85</b><i>s</i>_B and <b>85</b><i>d</i>_B of the source/drain regions of PMOS transistor <b>85</b>, respectively. The SiGe epitaxy process may be performed based using a gas phase DCS/GeH<sub>4</sub>/HCl/H<sub>2 </sub>CVD at a reduced pressure of about 5-50 Torr and at a temperature of about 500-1000&#xb0; C. The higher the GeH<sub>4 </sub>ratio, the higher the Ge concentration in the SiGe bottom layers, the more pronounced the strain effect on hole mobility. In one preferred embodiment, the SiGe bottom layers have a Ge concentration of about 20%, thus, creating a desired compressive strain in channel region <b>80</b><i>c </i>of PMOS transistor <b>80</b> and channel region <b>85</b><i>c </i>of PMOS transistor <b>85</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Remaining in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a second epitaxial SiGe layer is selectively grown on the top surfaces of SiGe bottom layers <b>80</b><i>s</i>_B and <b>80</b><i>d</i>_B of the source/drain regions of PMOS transistor <b>80</b>, and SiGe bottom layers <b>85</b><i>s</i>_B and <b>85</b><i>d</i>_B of the source/drain regions of PMOS transistor <b>85</b>, forming SiGe cap layers <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A and <b>80</b><i>d</i>_A of the source/drain regions of PMOS transistor <b>80</b> and SiGe cap layers <b>85</b><i>s</i>_A and <b>85</b><i>d</i>_A of the source/drain regions of PMOS transistor <b>85</b>. The second SiGe epitaxy layer is made by SiGe epitaxy process having similar process parameters to those used to form the first SiGe epitaxy layer, but with a lower Ge concentration from about 0% to about 20%. The lower Ge concentration in cap layers <b>80</b><i>s</i>_A and <b>80</b><i>d</i>_A, and <b>85</b><i>s</i>_A and <b>85</b><i>d</i>_A provides a substantially matching lattice constant between SiGe on the top surfaces of the SiGe source/drain regions of PMOS <b>80</b> and PMOS <b>85</b>, and the silicide layer formed from there on in a later process step, thus, facilitating a substantially defect-free silicide-to-source/drain interface. This, in turn, results in a reduced resistance of a wire contact to the source/drain regions of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one preferred embodiment, the thickness of the first epitaxial SiGe layer is about 500 to about 2500 &#x212b;, and thickness of the second epitaxial SiGe layer is about 50 &#x212b; to about 300 &#x212b;. Dielectric layer <b>70</b> formed over the STI regions in an earlier process step blocks the lateral extension of SiGe epitaxial layer during the epitaxial process of forming SiGe source/drain layers of PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>.</p>

Gate electrode spacer <b>65</b> is formed by suitable materials on the sidewalls of NMOS transistor <b>75</b> and PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b>. Source/drain regions of NMOS transistor and PMOS transistors <b>80</b> and <b>85</b> are doped by suitable processes, such as a diffusion and/or implantation process, to form heavily-doped source/drain regions. A silicide layer <b>68</b> is preferably formed atop the source/drain regions and gate electrodes (not shown) of the NMOS and PMOS transistors in order to reduce the resistance of the NMOS and PMOS source/drain regions and the gate electrodes. The silicide is preferably NiSi<sub>2</sub>, CoSi<sub>2</sub>, WSi<sub>2</sub>, TiSi<sub>2 </sub>or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Optionally, a tensile-stressed film (not shown) may be formed on the gate regions and at least a portion of the source regions and drain regions of the NMOS transistors, such as <b>75</b><i>g</i>, <b>75</b><i>s </i>and <b>75</b><i>d </i>of NMOS transistor <b>75</b>. Such a tensile-stressed film may be formed of a dielectric material, such as silicon nitride, oxynitride, and oxide, in order to create a tensile strain in channel regions of the NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell, such as <b>75</b><i>c </i>of NMOS transistor <b>75</b>. Thus, the upgraded drive current of NMOS transistors in an SRAM cell can be used to enhance the NMOS transistor performance, reduce the size of an SRAM cell, retain a pre-determined SRAM cell static noise margin (SNM), among others, as explained above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">After the completion of the current process step, CMOS manufacturing processes can continue from this point by, for example, depositing a first inter-layer dielectric layer (ILD) on the substrate and cutting contact openings through the ILD where contacts to source/drain regions and gate electrodes of the NMOS and PMOS transistors are needed. Metal deposition processes may be used to fill conductive contact materials, such as tungsten, in the contact openings. Then, planarization processes such as a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process may be applied on the substrate surface to remove the excess tungsten formation on the substrate surface, providing a substantially flat substrate surface preferable for the subsequent processing steps.</p>
