<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Described herein are example devices, systems, methods and other embodiments associated with reducing or eliminating interference with a radio from a system bus in an integrated device. In one embodiment, logic monitors an FM radio to determine when the FM radio is in use and based on the use, adjusts a clock rate of the system bus to facilitate reducing interference with the FM radio from the system bus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of a device <b>100</b> is shown that is associated with reducing or eliminating interference produced by a bus in a device that includes a radio. Device <b>100</b> includes, for example, host interface <b>110</b>, clock logic <b>120</b>, FM radio <b>130</b>, antenna <b>140</b>, and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interface <b>150</b>. Antenna <b>140</b> is, for example, an external antenna, an internal integrated antenna, and so on. Other types of network interfaces may also be used instead of or in combination with the WLAN interface <b>150</b>. In one embodiment, the device <b>100</b> is implemented on a chip including one or more integrated circuits configured to perform one or more of the functions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, host interface <b>110</b> is a computer bus that connects components in the device <b>100</b> to a host. Device <b>100</b> uses the host interface <b>110</b> to exchange data with the host. In one embodiment, the device <b>100</b> is a component/chip integrated within or connected to the host. The host is, for example, a cellular handset, a smartphone, a portable audio/video device, a navigation device, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a gaming device, a computer and so on. Thus, in one example, host interface <b>110</b> transmits data to the host that is received on a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) interface <b>150</b> in device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The host interface <b>110</b> is configured to transmit and receive data at a frequency that is determined by a clock rate. The clock rate is adjustable/programmable and can be set to a pre-determined value such as 100 MHz. Thus, if the host interface is 4 bits wide it will transmit/receive 400 Mbits/sec when using a clock rate of 100 MHz. When operating at a specified clock rate, the host interface <b>110</b> produces electromagnetic interference (EMI) with the same frequency as the clock rate. Thus, when the clock rate is 100 MHz, host interface <b>110</b> produces an EMI signal with a frequency of 100 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The host interface <b>110</b> is, for example, a Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) interface, a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus, and so on. The host interface <b>110</b> can be a single interface or a group of interfaces. For instance, host interface <b>110</b> can include both an SDIO interface and an SPI bus. Device <b>100</b> can be integrated with the host or may be removeably coupled to the host via host interface <b>110</b> (e.g., connection port). In one embodiment, instead of having the host interface <b>110</b>, the device <b>100</b> includes a system bus. The system bus is an integrated bus that connects components internally. Thus, in an example where device <b>100</b> is a stand-alone device, the system bus is configured to exchange data between the components in the device <b>100</b>. In an embodiment where the device <b>100</b> is a stand-alone computing device, the device <b>100</b> can include at least a processor connected to the system bus. In this case, clock logic <b>120</b> is configured to adjust the clock rate of the system bus as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the clock logic <b>120</b> is configured to change the clock rate of the host interface <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, clock logic <b>120</b> changes the clock rate by reducing the clock rate to a lower frequency or increasing the clock rate to a higher frequency. Clock logic <b>120</b> is configured to change the clock rate to reduce interference with the FM radio <b>130</b> when the FM radio <b>130</b> is in use. When the clock rate is within a predetermined range of the frequency that the FM radio <b>130</b> is tuned to receive, interference with signals received by the FM radio <b>130</b> can occur. This may result in an undesirable effect in the signals or even causing the signals to be blocked. Thus the clock logic <b>120</b> is configured to detect when the FM radio <b>130</b> is in use, and then determine if and how to change the clock rate to reduce or avoid the interference.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the clock logic <b>120</b> determines when the FM radio <b>130</b> is in use before attempting to change the clock rate. Since no interference occurs when the FM radio <b>130</b> is not in use there is no need to change the clock rate unless FM radio <b>130</b> is on. In one embodiment, the clock logic <b>120</b> determines when FM radio <b>130</b> is in use by detecting when the antenna <b>140</b> is receiving radio frequency signals. In alternative embodiments, clock logic <b>120</b> determines that the FM radio <b>130</b> is in use by, for example, receiving an interrupt signal that indicates that the radio is operating, checking a register that is set to indicate the operating status of the FM radio <b>130</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, when clock logic <b>120</b> determines that FM radio <b>130</b> is in use, clock logic <b>120</b> automatically changes the clock rate to a modified clock rate that will not interfere with FM radio <b>130</b>. For example, the clock logic <b>120</b> determines the current frequency band that the FM radio <b>130</b> is set at. The frequency band can be determined, for example, from parameters or settings from the FM radio <b>130</b>. Then the clock rate is changed to a rate that is outside of the current frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Consider one example where the FM radio <b>130</b> is operating and receives signals in a frequency range of 76 MHz to 108 MHZ. Thus, clock logic <b>120</b> may reduce the clock rate to be below the frequency range, for example, to 60 MHz to avoid interfering with the FM radio signals. Alternatively, clock logic <b>120</b> may increase the clock rate above the frequency range, for example, to 120 MHz to avoid the range of 76 MHz to 108 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some additional effects of changing the clock rate can occur. For example, decreasing the clock rate may cause the device <b>100</b> to consume less power. Increasing the clock rate may increase the available bandwidth of the host interface <b>110</b>. Accordingly when FM radio <b>130</b> is in use, clock logic <b>120</b> may be configured to change the clock rate based on additional conditions, e.g., increase the clock rate if more bandwidth is desirable or decrease the clock rate if power savings is desirable. The decision to increase or decrease the clock rate may be dependent on a system setting, a user input, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an alternative embodiment, instead of changing the clock rate to a value that is out-of-band, clock logic <b>120</b> adjusts the clock rate by a predetermined amount to avoid interfering with a selected frequency of the FM radio <b>130</b>. For example, clock logic <b>120</b> determines the current frequency being used by the FM radio <b>130</b> (e.g., frequency selected by a user) and changes the clock rate depending on the selected frequency. For example, when a frequency being used by FM radio <b>130</b> is within a predetermined range of the current clock rate, clock logic <b>120</b> adjusts the clock rate by the predetermined amount to avoid the radio frequency. In this way, clock logic <b>120</b> changes the clock rate to a lesser degree while still avoiding interference with the FM radio <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The predetermined amount is, in one embodiment, a predetermined frequency difference from the current radio frequency that reduces or avoids interference with FM radio <b>130</b> when the clock rate is adjusted by the predetermined amount. In one embodiment, the predetermined amount is 2 MHz. Thus, the clock logic <b>120</b>, upon determining that the clock rate interferes with the radio frequency, adjusts the clock rate by 2 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Clock logic <b>120</b> also dynamically adjusts the clock rate as the radio frequency changes. For example, the clock logic <b>120</b> dynamically adjusts the clock rate when the FM radio <b>130</b> is in use and as the current radio frequency changes from an initial frequency to a second frequency. This situation may occur when a user changes the channel of the FM radio.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Other than the clock rate itself interfering with FM radio <b>130</b>, harmonic multiples of the clock rate can cause interference. Harmonic multiples are signals with a frequency that is an integer multiple of a base signal frequency. In one embodiment, the clock logic <b>120</b> is configured to avoid setting the clock rate at a frequency that produces a harmonic that will interfere with the current radio frequency. Accordingly, if the fundamental frequency is f, the harmonics have frequencies 2f, 3f, 4f, . . . etc. For example, if the radio is tuned to a channel using a selected frequency of 100 MHz, the clock logic <b>120</b> will not change the clock rate to 50 MHz because 100 MHz is a harmonic of 50 MHz (i.e. 2f=2&#xd7;50 Mhz=100 Mhz). Thus, the clock logic <b>120</b> selects a modified clock rate that does not have a harmonic that interferes with the current radio frequency. In this example, since using a clock rate of 50 MHz would still interfere with the radio frequency of 100 Mhz, the clock logic <b>120</b> instead changes the clock rate to a frequency that does not have a harmonic multiple (e.g., 160 MHz or 65 Mhz) that would interfere with the radio frequency of the FM radio <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the device <b>100</b> may be implemented with radio logic (not shown) instead of the FM radio <b>130</b>. The radio logic is a component that receives radio frequency (RF) signals across a wider band than FM radio. Both FM radio <b>130</b> and the radio logic receive radio frequency signals based on a frequency specified by an input. The input is, for example, a user input or an automated input. Accordingly, device <b>100</b> may be implemented with a radio operating at a range of frequencies and, thus, clock logic <b>120</b> facilitates reducing interference from a computing/system bus in device <b>100</b> across an operational band of frequencies for the radio logic.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the device <b>100</b> embedded in a mobile device <b>200</b>. In this embodiment, device <b>100</b> is a system on a chip (SoC) and the FM radio <b>130</b> is separate from the device <b>100</b>. The SoC includes a processor and other system components. In other embodiments, the device <b>100</b> is a computing device that is connected to an internal system bus <b>220</b>. The mobile device <b>200</b> may include components such as a processor <b>210</b>, clock <b>220</b>, display <b>230</b>, and cellular logic <b>240</b>. The device <b>100</b> is configured to control the clock <b>220</b> by adjusting the clock rate as discussed previously based on one or more other communication frequencies used by the mobile device <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, mobile device <b>200</b> is a personal navigation device, a PDA, a laptop, a smart phone, other computing device, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a method <b>300</b> associated with reducing or eliminating interference with a radio from a system bus in a device. In one embodiment, method <b>300</b> operates in a device such as the device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or the mobile device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to reduce interference with a radio.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At <b>310</b>, the radio in the device is tuned to a selected frequency. The selected frequency is, for example, received from a user input, from an application, or other interface, and the device responds by tuning the radio to the selected frequency. The radio may or may not be operating at different times (e.g., on or off, transmitting and/or receiving signals). In other embodiments, the tuning action is not part of the method but is implied to have been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At <b>320</b>, method <b>300</b> monitors the radio or settings in the device to determine when the radio is in use. In one embodiment, method <b>300</b> detects when an antenna in the device is receiving a signal in a predetermined range to determine when the radio is in use. The determination can be performed in other ways as previously discussed. The predetermined range is for example, an FM radio range, an amplitude modulation (AM) radio range, a wireless communication radio range, and so on. Thus, if the radio is operating, method <b>300</b> proceeds to block <b>330</b>. If the radio is not operating, the method continues to monitor for the presence of a radio signal or a change in operating status.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At <b>330</b> after the method determines that the radio is in use, the method <b>300</b> determines whether a clock rate of the system bus in the device conflicts with the frequency of the radio. The clock rate conflicts with the radio frequency when the clock rate causes the system bus to produce EMI that affects the radio. In one embodiment, this occurs if the radio frequency differs from the clock rate by a value that is less than a predetermined threshold. Suppose the predetermined threshold is &#xb1;1 MHz. If the radio frequency is 99.7 MHz and the clock rate is 100 MHz, the condition is satisfied and the clock rate is changed to avoid interference since the difference between the radio frequency and the clock rate is less than the predetermined threshold. Of course, other threshold values may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If no conflict is determined at <b>330</b>, then method <b>300</b> ends or continues to monitor for a change in the radio frequency at <b>320</b>. In one embodiment, while the radio is in use, method <b>300</b> may continuously monitor for a conflict that may be created when the radio frequency is changed. Thus, in this case, method <b>300</b> dynamically adjusts the clock rate when a conflict occurs and continuously checks for a conflict while the radio is on.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">If a conflict is detected at <b>330</b>, then at <b>340</b>, a new clock rate that does not conflict with the currently radio frequency is determined. In one embodiment, the new clock rate is determined by adjusting the current clock rate by a rate change value so that the new clock rate and the current radio frequency are separated by a desired range to avoid causing interference with the radio. In one example, the rate change value may be 4 MHz. Other values can be used. The rate change value may be stored in memory and programmatically changed via an interface or other input method.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">At <b>350</b>, the clock rate is adjusted based on the rate change value. Thus, if the current radio frequency is 100 MHz and the clock rate is 100 MHz, the clock rate is adjusted by &#xb1;4 MHz. Therefore, the new clock rate is, 96 MHz or 104 MHz. Increasing or decreasing the clock rate may be dependent on conditions specified by the device in which the system bus and the radio reside. With the new clock rate in use by the system bus, interference with the radio is reduced or eliminated.</p>
