<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A spring-driven nail gun that retracts a plunger against a resilient force of a spring and then releases the plunger for impacting a nail to a workpiece have been wellknown as an electric power tool. U.S. Pat. No. 3,589,588 discloses an electric power tool having a plunger which is retracted by a mechanism including a motor and decelerating gears in the tool, which reduces power required to retract the plunger. The tool includes a detecting switch that detects a release operation of the plunger. When the release operation is detected, the tool stops feed to the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the above tool, even when the detecting switch is breakdown, the tool is able to perform a normal operation to impact the nail. When this case happens, a user may miss this failure and keep using the tool, because the tool is able to impact the nail. This condition may lead to a risk that the motor may keep rotating after the impacting operation is over, and cause unintentional continuous impacting operations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the invention is to provide a fastener driving tool which ceases an impacting operation in case a detecting switch is breakdown.</p>

The center of the plunger plate <b>8</b><i>b </i>is connected to the tip end of the blade <b>8</b><i>a </i>on the top dead center side. When the plunger <b>8</b> is positioned at the top dead center, the nail is placed in the passage in the nose portion <b>5</b>. When the blade <b>8</b><i>b </i>is moved to the bottom dead center side, the nail is pushed out of the tip end of the nose portion <b>5</b> by the blade <b>8</b><i>a</i>, and then impacted in the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The spring <b>9</b> is arranged between the plunger plate <b>8</b><i>b </i>and a left end of the housing <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The motor <b>7</b> has a rotation shaft (not shown), and is rotated with electric power from the battery <b>4</b> to provide a torque to the decelerating mechanism <b>11</b>. The decelerating mechanism <b>11</b> has the motor <b>7</b>, a pulley (not shown) connected to the rotation shaft, gears, and a belt to generate a torque to an output shaft <b>19</b> described later (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>). The decelerating mechanism <b>11</b> amplifies a torque of the motor <b>7</b>, so the motor <b>7</b> used in the decelerating mechanism <b>11</b> can become compact.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The drum <b>13</b> is rotated with the torque generated by the motor <b>7</b> and supplied through the decelerating mechanism <b>11</b>, interlocked with the operation of a compression release mechanism (a clutch mechanism) described later. The wire <b>16</b> is made with a plurality of metal rods wound and has some flexibility and strength. The wire <b>16</b> has a surface coated with a resin in order to avoid wearing due to contact with the drum <b>13</b>.</p>

The output shaft <b>19</b> has a width across flat portion (not shown) which is cut in the shape of a width across flat. The width across flat portion of the output shaft <b>19</b> is inserted and fitted in the fitting hole <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the gear <b>14</b>, so that the gear <b>14</b> is fixed to the output shaft <b>19</b>. The through holes <b>14</b><i>c </i>are formed in the gear <b>14</b> for weight and inertia reduction of the gear <b>14</b>. The extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>is formed in order to turn on and off the stop switch <b>25</b> by the engagement or disengagement with the stop switch <b>25</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The guide plate <b>18</b> is formed with a guide groove <b>18</b><i>a</i>, a guide projection <b>18</b><i>b</i>, a projection portion <b>18</b><i>d</i>, and a through hole (not shown). The through hole is formed at a center of the guide plate <b>18</b>. The output shaft <b>19</b> are inserted through the through hole. The guide groove <b>18</b><i>a </i>is formed adjacent to the through hole. The guide projection <b>18</b><i>b </i>is formed around the through hole so as to have a portion which has a longer length from the through hole to the guide groove <b>18</b><i>a</i>. In detail, the guide projection <b>18</b><i>b </i>has a convex shape having a length of 5-15 mm in a radial direction from the center of the through hole. The projection portion <b>18</b><i>d </i>has a rectangular shape and is formed at the outer periphery of guide plate <b>18</b>. A key <b>20</b> fixed to the output shaft <b>19</b> is provided on the upper surface of the guide projection <b>18</b><i>b</i>. The key <b>20</b> has a outer shape having a width across flat in a horizontal cross section. The key <b>20</b> is fitted in a through hole <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the pin support plate <b>21</b> described later.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The stop switch <b>25</b> has a open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>having a rectangular shape. The stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on and off by opening and closing the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a</i>, respectively. The stop switch <b>25</b> is fixed to the guide plate <b>18</b> in order to be placed between the outer upper surface of the gear <b>14</b> and the lower surface of the projection portion <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the guide plate <b>18</b>. The length of the stop switch <b>25</b> in the direction of the output shaft <b>19</b> is substantially equal to the height of extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the gear <b>14</b>. The open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>is attached to the position in order that the engagement and disengagement with the extending portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>is switched according to the rotation of the gear <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The pin support plate <b>21</b> has a through hole <b>21</b><i>b </i>which is formed by forming out the width across flat hole in the body portion. An extending portion having a pin support slide portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>extends from the body portion. When the key <b>20</b> is inserted in and engaged with the through hole <b>21</b><i>b</i>, the pin support plate <b>21</b> is fixed to the output shaft <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A power transmission pin <b>17</b> includes a guide groove contact portion <b>17</b><i>a </i>and a pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b</i>. The guide groove contact portion <b>17</b><i>a </i>is able to be engaged in the guide groove <b>18</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the moving direction and the moving distance of the power transmission pin <b>17</b> is controlled by the shape of the guide groove <b>18</b><i>a</i>. The pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>has the same height as that of a hook portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>of a drum hook <b>22</b>, when being assembled with the compression release mechanism. The right side surface of the pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the power transmission pin <b>17</b> is slid ably supported by the pin support slide portion <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The above structure enables the pin support plate <b>21</b> and the power transmission pin <b>17</b> to rotate together in synchronization with the rotation of the output shaft <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The drum hook <b>22</b> includes a cylindrical main portion <b>22</b><i>c</i>, a bearing <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and a hook portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>extending from the side surface of the main portion <b>22</b><i>c. </i>The bearing <b>22</b><i>b </i>is positioned so as to contact with the inner surface of the main portion <b>22</b><i>c</i>,. The output shaft <b>19</b> is inserted in he drum hook <b>22</b> through the bearing <b>22</b><i>b</i>, so that the output shaft <b>19</b> and the drum hook <b>22</b> are not always rotated in synchronization with each other. The hook portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>extends from the main portion <b>22</b><i>c </i>in a direction perpendicular to the output shaft <b>19</b> and is able to contact with the pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the power transmission pin <b>17</b>. Accordingly, the power transmission pin <b>17</b> always rotates in synchronization with the pin support plate <b>21</b>. The drum hook <b>22</b> rotates in synchronization with the pin support plate <b>21</b> and the power transmission pin <b>17</b>, only when the pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the power transmission pin <b>17</b> becomes contact with the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The drum <b>13</b> has a disk shape. The drum <b>13</b> has a through hole <b>13</b><i>c </i>at the center thereof, and the main portion <b>22</b><i>c </i>of the drum hook <b>22</b> is pressed into the through hole <b>13</b><i>c</i>,. Accordingly, the drum <b>13</b> and the drum hook <b>22</b> rotate in synchronization with each other. A damper collision portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>projects from the drum <b>13</b> in the axial direction of the output shaft <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wire <b>16</b> is able to be wound around the lateral surface of the drum <b>13</b> and connects the drum <b>13</b> to the plunger <b>98</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The wire <b>16</b> is wound or rewound around the lateral surface of the drum <b>13</b> to move the plunger <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The operation of the spring compression release mechanism will be described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3D</figref>. The plunger <b>8</b> is positioned at the bottom dead center at an initial stage of the impacting operation by nail gun <b>1</b>. When a user pulls the trigger <b>10</b>, electric power is supplied from the battery <b>4</b> to the motor <b>7</b> by the trigger switch <b>24</b> and the controller <b>100</b> to rotate the motor <b>7</b>. The torque generated by the motor <b>7</b> is transferred to the pin support plate <b>21</b> and the power transmission pin <b>17</b> through the decelerating mechanism <b>11</b> and the output shaft <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the initial condition of the spring compression release mechanism. When the pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>is contact with the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the power transmission pin <b>17</b> and the drum hook <b>22</b> are engaged with each other to move together. Therefore, the pin support plate <b>21</b> is rotated, and the drum hook <b>22</b> and the drum <b>13</b> are rotated, simultaneously. The open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the stop switch <b>25</b> is positioned at a 90&#xb0; angle in a clockwise direction with respect to the contact surface between the pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>which are positioned at the initial condition. In the initial condition, the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the gear <b>14</b> is positioned across the angular range from the above contact surface to 270&#xb0; angle in a counterclockwise direction. At this time, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the stop switch <b>25</b> is engaged with the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the gear <b>14</b> to be closed. The stop switch <b>25</b> turns on immediately after the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the pin support plate <b>21</b> which has been rotated by 180&#xb0; angle from the condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> in the counterclockwise direction. The drum <b>13</b> is rotated by 180&#xb0; in synchronization with the rotation of the pin support plate <b>21</b> to entangle one end of the wire <b>16</b> to a drum concave portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>. When the wire <b>16</b> is entangled, the plunger <b>8</b> connected to the other end of the wire <b>16</b> is pulled to move toward the top dead center. Simultaneously, the plunger plate <b>8</b><i>b </i>attached to the end of the plunger <b>8</b> compresses the spring <b>9</b>. At this time, the stop switch <b>25</b> is maintained turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the pin support plate <b>21</b> is rotated from the condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> to the condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the end of the power transmission pin <b>17</b> becomes contact with the guide projection <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the guide groove <b>18</b><i>a</i>. The guide projection <b>18</b><i>b </i>has the convex shape having a length of 5-15 mm from the rotation axis in the radial direction. As the pin support plate <b>21</b> rotates, the power transmission pin <b>17</b> moves outward along the pin support slide portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>in the radial direction and along the shape of the guide projection <b>18</b><i>b</i>. During this time, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the stop switch <b>25</b> maintains the engagement with the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>and is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the pin support plate <b>21</b> i.e., the drum <b>14</b> is rotated from the condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> by 270&#xb0; angle to the condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the plunger <b>8</b> is moved to the top dead center, and the spring <b>9</b> becomes compressed most. The nail at the front end in the magazine <b>6</b> is pressed by a feeding member (not shown) to be loaded in the ejection passage. Simultaneously, the power transmission pin <b>17</b> is moved outward in the radial direction by 5-15 mm, and the power transmission pin <b>17</b> is disengaged from the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a</i>. At this time, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the stop switch <b>25</b> reaches the edge of the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the power transmission pin <b>17</b> is disengaged from the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the compressed spring <b>9</b> is released and the plunger <b>8</b> is moved toward the bottom dead center. When the plunger <b>8</b> is moved to the bottom dead center, the drum <b>13</b> and the drum hook <b>22</b> which have been drawn by the wire <b>16</b> start counter rotating (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>). On the other hand, the gear <b>14</b> further rotates together with the output shaft <b>19</b> in the counterclockwise direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. Accordingly, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the stop switch <b>25</b> reaches the position where the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>is not formed, and is disengaged from the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the plunger <b>8</b> reaches the bottom dead center by the resilience force of the compressed spring <b>9</b>, the nail placed in the ejection passage in the nose portion <b>5</b> is pushed by the blade <b>8</b><i>a </i>out of the tip end of the nose portion <b>5</b>, and then impacted into the workpiece. After the nail is impacted, turning off of the stop switch <b>25</b> in the above described manner causes the controller <b>100</b> to suspend the feeding power to the motor <b>7</b> from the battery <b>4</b>, thereby stopping the rotation of the motor <b>7</b>. When the drum <b>13</b> returns to the initial condition, the damper collision portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>becomes engaged with the drum damper (not shown) fixed to the housing <b>2</b>, and the drum <b>13</b> and the drum hook <b>22</b> are fixed to the initial position. At this time, the stop switch <b>25</b> becomes engaged with the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>again, so that the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the operation of the stop switch <b>25</b> is explained in brief, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>b </i>is turned on by the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the gear <b>14</b> in the initial condition. In other words, the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on immediately after the trigger switch <b>25</b> is turned on. When the drum <b>13</b> is rotated by 270&#xb0; angle with the stop switch <b>25</b>, maintaining the on condition, the power transmission pin <b>17</b> is disengaged from the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and the drum <b>13</b> starts reverse-rotation. These operation causes the impacting operation. When the gear <b>14</b> is further rotated, the stop switch <b>25</b> is disengaged from the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the gear <b>14</b>, and the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned off.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The operation of the controller <b>100</b> will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows time charts of the controller <b>100</b> under a normal operation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when the trigger switch <b>25</b> is turned on at t=t<b>0</b>, the smoothed voltage Vs is applied from the smoothing circuit to the gate of the FET <b>101</b> to turn on the FET <b>101</b>, so that a current flow starts flowing to the motor <b>7</b>. The motor <b>7</b> then starts rotating, and the pin support plate <b>21</b> and the drum <b>13</b> also start rotating. As described above, the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on at t=t<b>1</b>, because of becoming engaged with the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the gear <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the resistor <b>103</b> has a sufficient larger resistance than the resistances of the resistors <b>108</b> and <b>109</b> (for example, approximate 10 times) in order to prevent the PNP transistor <b>110</b> from turning on immediately after the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on immediately after the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on, the charging the capacitor <b>121</b> starts through the diode <b>118</b> and the resistor <b>119</b>. The stop switch <b>25</b> is maintained on while the rotation angle of the drum <b>13</b> stays within the range from 0&#xb0; to 270&#xb0; angles. When the stop switch <b>25</b> is maintained on, the emitter potential of the PNP transistor <b>115</b> is lower than the cathode potential of the diode <b>120</b>. Under this condition, the potential difference to turn on the PNP transistor <b>115</b> does not appear between the base and the emitter of the PNP transistor <b>115</b>. Accordingly, the PNP transistor <b>115</b> is maintained off.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On the other hand, when the FET <b>101</b> is turned on, the smoothed voltage Vs is divided by the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. The resultant voltage appearing across the resistor <b>127</b> is applied to the non-inverting input terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b> at t=t<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One example of the resistances of the resistors <b>126</b> to <b>128</b> will be described. The input voltage to the non-inverting input terminal is set to be approximately a half of the smoothed voltage, when the smoothed voltage is divided by the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> to the input voltage. This input voltage is obtained if the resistances of the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> are set identical.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on at t=t<b>1</b>, the smoothed voltage Vs is applied to the non-inverting input terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b> through the stop switch <b>25</b> and the diode <b>132</b>. On the other hand, when the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on, the smoothed voltage Vs is applied to the capacitor <b>124</b> through the resistors <b>107</b> and <b>123</b> to charge the capacitor <b>124</b>. The voltage across the capacitor <b>124</b> is applied to the inverting input terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b>. The input voltage to the inverting input terminal is always lower than the smoothed voltage Vs, though the capacitor <b>124</b> is charged. As a result, a High output appears at the output terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b>. This High output is interrupted by the diode <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When the rotation angle of the drum <b>13</b> becomes 270&#xb0; angle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), the contact of the pin contact portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>and the hook portion <b>22</b><i>a </i>is released, so that the reverse rotation of the drum <b>13</b> starts with the resilient force of the spring <b>9</b>. At this time, the plunger <b>8</b> is moved to the bottom dead center. The gear <b>14</b> is further rotated in the clockwise direction, and the engagement between the open/close portion <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the extending portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>is released. Accordingly, the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned off at t=t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned off, the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b> becomes the voltage appearing across the resistor <b>127</b> which is obtained by dividing the smoothed voltage Vs by the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. At this time, the output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> becomes Low, because the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal becomes lower than the input voltage at the inverting input terminal. Simultaneously, the current flow flows through the resistor <b>128</b> by the diode <b>129</b>, and the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal further drops. The Low output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> causes the potential of the node A to become O volt, which turns off the FET <b>101</b> and the current flow ceases flowing to the motor <b>7</b>. As described above, when the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned off, the drive of the motor <b>7</b> is ceased at t=t<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At t=t<b>2</b>, in other words, when the potential of the node A becomes O volt with the output of the Op-amp <b>130</b>, both of the PNP transistor <b>110</b> and the NPN transistor <b>111</b> are turned on, as described later. And, the potential of the node A is maintained 0 volt. When the output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is changed to Low, the current flow starts flowing through the resistor <b>128</b> by the diode <b>129</b>. Therefore, the input voltage at the non-inverting terminal drop to the voltage depending on the resistances of the resistors <b>126</b>, <b>127</b>, and <b>128</b> at t=t<b>2</b>. The capacitor <b>124</b> is discharged through the resistor <b>123</b>, so that the voltage at the inverting input terminal gradually drops, and becomes lower than the voltage at the non-inverting input terminal at t=t<b>3</b>. At this time, the voltage at the non-inverting input terminal becomes the voltage divided by the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> and appearing across the resistor <b>127</b>. The output voltage of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is changed to High. However, the High output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is interrupted by the diode <b>131</b>. Further, the potential at the node A is maintained 0 volt, because the transistors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> are maintained to be turned on until the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned off, the base of the PNP transistor <b>115</b> is connected to the ground through the resistor <b>117</b>, the diode <b>120</b>, and the resistor <b>122</b>, and the emitter of the PNP transistor <b>115</b> is connected to the charged capacitor <b>121</b>. Then, a potential difference occurs between the base and the emitter of the PNP transistor <b>115</b>. Accordingly, the PNP transistor <b>115</b> is turned on, and the electric charge in the capacitor <b>121</b> is flown to the capacitor <b>114</b> through the resistor <b>1</b> <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As the capacitor <b>114</b> is charged, the potential at the base of the NPN transistor <b>111</b> rises to turn on the NPN transistor <b>111</b>. When the NPN transistor <b>111</b> is turned on, the potential at the node A becomes the ground, and the potential at the gate of the FET <b>101</b> becomes the ground. Therefore, the FET <b>101</b> is turned off and the current flow to the motor <b>7</b> is ceased.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the NPN transistor <b>111</b> is turned on, the base of the PNP transistor <b>110</b> is also connected to the ground level through the resistor <b>108</b>, and the transistor <b>110</b> is turned on. As long as the trigger switch <b>24</b> is maintained closed, the smoothed voltage is applied to the base of the NPN transistor <b>111</b>, which maintains the NPN transistor <b>111</b> turned on. Accordingly, once the NPN transistor <b>111</b> is turned on, the NPN transistor <b>111</b> is maintained on, i.e., the FET <b>101</b> is maintained off, even if all electric charge stored in the capacitor <b>121</b> is discharged. It is preferable that the capacitance of the capacitor <b>114</b> is set to be larger than the capacitance of the capacitor <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned off, the PNP transistor <b>110</b> is turned off, and the off condition of the FET <b>101</b> can be released.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The above operation of the controller <b>100</b> enables the nail gun <b>1</b> to impact the nail. The single impact of the nail has been implemented, if the FET <b>101</b> is turned off after finishing the single operation to impact the nail.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The operation of the controller <b>100</b> will be described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, when the stop switch <b>25</b> is disabled due to a failure. It happens that the stop switch <b>25</b> may break down, such as that the stop switch <b>25</b> cannot be pressed down due to a mechanical trouble, or the stop switch <b>25</b> cannot be switched due to a mechanical or electric trouble. If the failure happens, the controller <b>100</b> prevents impacting the nail as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on at t=t<b>10</b>, the FET <b>101</b> is turned on and a current flow stats flowing to the motor <b>7</b>. Simultaneously, the pin support plate <b>21</b> and the plunger <b>8</b> start moving. If the stop switch <b>25</b> is not switched to be closed due to a failure, the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is equal to the voltage appearing across the resistor <b>127</b> which is obtained by dividing the smoothed voltage by the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>. The voltage at the inverting input terminal of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is equal to the voltage across the capacitor <b>124</b> which is charged by the smoothed voltage Vs through the resistors <b>107</b> and <b>123</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the voltage across the capacitor <b>124</b> at t=t<b>10</b> is 0 volt, and the voltage at the non-inverting input terminal is larger than the voltage at the inverting input terminal, so that the output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is the High output. At this time, the output voltage from the Op-amp <b>130</b> is interrupted by the diodes <b>129</b> and <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Sequentially, the voltage appearing across the capacitor <b>124</b> gradually increases due to the charging, and then the voltage at the inverting input terminal becomes greater than the voltage at the non-inverting input terminal at t=t<b>11</b>. At this time, the output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> becomes Low output. Simultaneously, a current flow flows to the resistor <b>128</b> by the diode <b>129</b>, so that the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal drops at t=t<b>11</b>. For example, the resistance of the positive feedback resistor <b>128</b> is set to be one third of the smoothed voltage Vs which is obtained by dividing the smoothed voltage Vs by the resistance of the resistor <b>126</b> and the parallel-connected combined resistance of the resistors <b>127</b> and <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The Low output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> causes the voltage of the node A to be maintained 0 volt by the diode <b>131</b>, so that the gate voltage of the FET <b>101</b> drops to 0 volt by the resistor <b>102</b>, the FET <b>101</b> is turned off to interrupt the power supply to the motor <b>7</b>. It is preferable that the time period from t<b>0</b> to t<b>11</b> is set longer than the time period from t<b>0</b> to t<b>1</b> because of the combination of the proper resistance of the resistor <b>123</b> and the proper capacitance of the capacitor <b>124</b>. In this embodiment, the time period from t<b>0</b> to t<b>11</b> is set a sufficient short time such as 30 ms in order to cease the impact operation.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the voltage at the node A becomes 0 volt, the PNP transistor <b>110</b> and the NPN transistor <b>111</b> are maintained to be turned on, maintaining the voltage at the node A 0 volt, as described above. And, as the capacitor <b>124</b> is discharged through the resistor <b>123</b>, the input voltage at the inverting input terminal gradually drops, and becomes lower than the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal at t=t<b>12</b>. At this time, the input voltage at the non-inverting input terminal is the voltage which is obtained by divided the smoothed voltage Vs by the resistors <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>, and the output voltage of the Op-amp <b>130</b> becomes High. However, this output voltage of the Op-amp <b>130</b> is blocked by the diode <b>131</b>. Further, the voltage at the node A is maintained 0 volt, because the transistors <b>110</b> and <b>111</b> are maintained on until the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, in this embodiment, the stop switch <b>25</b> is turned on immediately after the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on, and turned off after the impacting action is over. When a mechanical failure prevents the stop switch <b>25</b> from being turned on, the output of the Op-amp <b>130</b> becomes a Low, the gate terminal voltage of the FET <b>101</b> becomes 0 volt to turn off the FET <b>101</b>. In other words, the failure detection circuit <b>140</b> monitors whether the stop switch <b>25</b> is switched or not prior to impacting the nail. If the stop switch <b>25</b> is not switched, the controller <b>100</b> causes the FET to turn off for stopping feed to the motor <b>7</b>. Accordingly, the impacting action is prevented when the stop switch <b>25</b> is breakdown.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this embodiment, the plunger <b>8</b> is positioned at the bottom dead center in the initial condition. In the nail gun having the plunger <b>8</b> which is positioned between the top dead center and the bottom top center, an amount of time period from the operation of the trigger to the beginning of the impact action may change due to the repeated operations of the trigger switch. In this embodiment, the position of the plunger <b>8</b> does not change in the initial condition, so that the time amount until the start of the impacting operation substantially does not change. Accordingly, if the stop switch <b>25</b> has not been switched during a predetermined time period after the trigger switch <b>24</b> is turned on, the FET is turned off to interrupt the impacting operation. If the time t=t<b>11</b> is set appropriately, preferably, t=t<b>11</b> is set shorter than the time period required to prepare for the impacting nail, the impacting action is readily prohibited when the stop switch <b>25</b> is breakdown.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, in the electric nail gun according to the present invention, the impacting operation of the nail gun is prohibited without providing a specific mechanism prior to performing the impacting nail according to the operation of the trigger switch if the stop switch is breakdown. In other words, the nail gun which is easy to operate, reliable, and at low cost can be provided.</p>
