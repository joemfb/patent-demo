<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embedded SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) have problems with non-volatility and soft error rates, while embedded flash memories require additional masking layers/processing steps during manufacture, require high-voltage for programming, and have issues with endurance and reliability. PCM overcomes the criticality of the above mentioned parameters and exhibits favorable write speeds, small cell sizes, simpler circuitries and a fabrication compatibility with the Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process. However, additional improvements are needed in the evolution of the PCM technology.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The volatile and nonvolatile memories may be combined in a stacking process to reduce the footprint on a board, packaged separately, or placed in a multi-chip package with the memory component placed on top of the processor. The embodiment also illustrates that one or more of the processor cores may be embedded with nonvolatile memory <b>22</b>. The nonvolatile memory <b>22</b> may have a phase change material feature <b>24</b> made in according with the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an array of PCM cells <b>26</b> in system memory <b>20</b> and/or the nonvolatile memory in processor cores <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The PCM cells are connected to a row circuitry <b>38</b> and a column circuitry <b>36</b> which function to select the cells. They are also connected to a sense circuitry <b>40</b> which reads the states of the cells. PCM cells are made of alloys of elements of group VI of the periodic table&#x2014;elements such as Te or Se that are referred to as chalcogenides or chalcogenic materials. Chalcogenides may be used advantageously in phase change memory cells to provide data retention and remain stable even after the power is removed from the nonvolatile memory. Taking the phase change material as Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5 </sub>for example, two phases or more are exhibited having distinct electrical characteristics useful for memory storage.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Array <b>26</b> includes memory cells each having a selector device <b>28</b> and a memory element <b>30</b>. Although the array is illustrated with bipolar junction transistors (BJT) as selector devices, it should be noted that alternative embodiments may use CMOS selector devices or diodes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to identify and selectively change the electrical properties (e.g. resistance, capacitance, etc.) of the chalcogenide material through the application of energy such as, for example, heat, light, voltage potential, or electrical current. The chalcogenic material may be electrically switched between different states intermediate between the amorphous and the crystalline states, thereby giving rise to a multilevel storing capability.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To alter the state or phase of the memory material, this embodiment illustrates a programming voltage potential that is greater than the threshold voltage of the memory select device that may be applied to the memory cell. An electrical current flows through the memory material and generates heat that changes the electrical characteristic and alters the memory state or phase of the memory material. By way of example, heating the phase-change material to a temperature above 900&#xb0; C. in a write operation places the phase change material above its melting temperature (T<smallcaps>M</smallcaps>). Then, a rapid cooling places the phase-change material in the amorphous state that is referred to as a reset state where stored data may have a &#x201c;1&#x201d; value. Taking Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5 </sub>as an example, the time between achieving the melting temperature Tm and quenching after the local heating to achieve the amorphous phase may be less than 50 nanoseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">On the other hand, to program a memory cell from reset to set, the local temperature is raised higher than the crystallization temperature (Tx) for a time longer than 50 ns (for Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>) to allow crystallization to complete. The phase-change material in the crystalline form is referred to as a set state and stored data may have a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value. Thus, the cell can be programmed by setting the amplitude and pulse width of the current that will be allowed through the cell. In summary, a higher magnitude, fast pulse will amorphize the cell, whereas a moderate magnitude, longer pulse will allow the cell to crystallize.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a read operation, the bit line (BL) <b>32</b> and word line (WL) <b>34</b> are selected and an external current is provided to the selected memory cell. To read a chalcogenide memory device, the current difference resulting from the different device resistance is sensed. It is then determined whether data stored in the selected memory cell is a &#x201c;1&#x201d; or &#x201c;0&#x201d; based on a voltage change caused by a resistance of the phase-change material of the selected memory cell. It is to be appreciated that the association of reset and set with amorphous and crystalline states, respectively, is a convention and that at least an opposite convention may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a simplified cross-sectional view of the PCM cell, whose function is discussed above. The chalcogenide memory element <b>30</b> is coupled with a bit line metal <b>32</b> on its top and with a heater <b>48</b> at its bottom. The heater <b>48</b> is connected to the emitter <b>44</b> of a BIT. The base <b>42</b> of the BJT is connected to word line metal <b>34</b>. The collector <b>46</b> of the BJT is connected to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention describes a method for fabricating such a PCM cell structure, starting from a multilayer stack <b>50</b> of materials as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In particular, it presents a method for avoiding degradation of chalcogenide material during the definition process of the multilayer stack.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In standard approach, the definition of a multilayer stack with chalcogenide using a dielectric hard mask is done with a self aligned etch, after which photo resist and polymers are removed by dry and wet processes, respectively. The dry and wet chemistries interact with chalcogenide sidewalls, causing material degradation such as oxidation, which may result in electrical issues for the devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present invention presents an alternative process flow for PCM cells definition which prevents chalcogenide degradation during photo resist and polymers removal after its definition. The solution employed in the present invention is photo resist stripping after hard mask etching and before chalcogenide definition. As a result, the chalcogenide sidewalls will not be exposed to dry and wet chemicals used to remove photo resist and polymers. Further, the present invention forms dielectric spacers on chalcogenide sidewalls, protecting the chalcogenide from degradation during multilayer stack etch and the eventual cleanings after etch for removing etch sub-products.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it illustrates the cross-sectional view of a multilayer stack <b>50</b> of different materials that is provided for fabricating a PCM cell structure in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. At the bottom of the stack <b>50</b> is a metal heater material <b>204</b> of the PCM cell which surrounded by a first dielectric material <b>202</b> on the sides and a second dielectric material <b>200</b> at the bottom. The heater material <b>204</b> corresponds to the heater in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The sum of the metal heater material <b>204</b> and the adjacent dielectric materials (<b>202</b>, <b>200</b>) forms the structure of wall. Above the wall is a chalcogenide material <b>206</b> with a metal cap material <b>208</b>. The metal cap material <b>208</b> corresponds to the bitline metal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The metal cap material <b>208</b> and the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> together are called storage element. On top of the storage element is a third dielectric material <b>210</b>, which has a function of hard mask during the definition of the multilayer stack <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the metal heater material <b>204</b> is typically made of TiSiN, and the first dielectric material <b>202</b> is typically made of SiN. The layer formed by the metal heater material <b>204</b> and the first dielectric material <b>202</b> is typically 80 nm&#xb1;10 nm in thickness. The second dielectric material <b>200</b> at the bottom of the stack is made of oxide. Further, the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> is typically 75&#xb1;10 nm thick, and the metal cap layer <b>208</b> is typically Ti/TiN based with a thickness of 45&#xb1;10 nm. Additionally, the third dielectric material <b>210</b> at the top of the stack <b>50</b> is typically SiN or SiON, but is also possible to use an oxide or a composite layer such as SiN and amorphous carbon. The third dielectric material <b>210</b> is typically 600&#xb1;100 nm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a layer of photo resist <b>212</b> is deposited and patterned on top of the multilayer stack <b>50</b> using a standard lithography process. The photo resist forms an etch mask directly over the metal heater material <b>204</b>. Subsequently as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the dielectric hard mask <b>210</b> and the metal cap layer <b>208</b> are patterned using the photo resist <b>212</b> as the etch mask. In one embodiment, the dielectric hard mask <b>210</b> is etched by a CF<sub>4 </sub>based dry etch chemistry, and the metal cap layer <b>208</b> is etched by Cl/Ar dry etch chemistry. In another embodiment, the metal cap layer <b>208</b> is not etched or is only partially etched in order to protect the underlying chalcogenide material <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to one embodiment, after the dielectric hard mask <b>210</b> and the metal cap layer <b>208</b> are defined, the photo resist <b>212</b> is removed. In another embodiment, the photo resist <b>212</b> may be removed using O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2 </sub>based plasma dry process. The advantage of stripping the photo resist <b>212</b> before patterning the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> is that the chalcogenide sidewalls will not be exposed to the dry and wet chemicals used in removing the photo resist and polymers when the removal is done after defining the chalcogenide.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> is patterned without the presence of photo resist <b>212</b> but with the help of the hard mask dielectric <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, the chalcogenide etch is performed using a CF<sub>4 </sub>based dry etch chemistry. Etching or complete etching of the metal cap layer <b>208</b> is performed if necessary. In another embodiment, partial etching of the first dielectric <b>202</b> and the metal heater material <b>204</b> is further performed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the blanket deposition of a spacer dielectric <b>214</b> on the multilayer stack <b>50</b> after the definition of chalcogenide material <b>206</b>. The function of the spacer dielectric <b>214</b> is to seal the sidewall of the multilayer stack <b>50</b> by forming sidewall spacer as discussed below. The sidewall spacer helps to prevent degradation of the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> and the metal cap material <b>208</b> during subsequent etching and polymers removal. The spacer dielectric <b>214</b> is typically made of SiN. The thickness of the spacer dielectric <b>214</b> is determined by the desired width for the sidewall spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer dielectric <b>214</b> has a thickness range between 200 and 1000 &#x212b;, typically 600 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an anisotropic etch-back of the spacer dielectric <b>214</b> is performed to form dielectric spacers <b>216</b> on sidewalls of the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> and the metal cap material <b>208</b>. The etch-back removes the portions of the spacer dielectric <b>214</b> on top of the hard mask dielectric <b>210</b> and the first dielectric <b>202</b>, leaving the portions of the spacer dielectric <b>214</b> on the sidewalls of the chalcogenide material <b>206</b> and the metal cap material <b>208</b> to form the dielectric spacers <b>216</b>. The dielectric spacers <b>216</b> protect the chalcogenide from degradation during the multilayer stack etch and the eventual cleanings after etch for removing etch sub-products.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the etch-back is performed by an SF<sub>6 </sub>based dry etch chemistry. In another embodiment, the etch-back is continued to pattern the metal heater material <b>204</b> in the direction going in and out of the plane of the cross-section. The etch-back also etches the first dielectric <b>202</b> and the second dielectric <b>200</b>, using the hard mask dielectric <b>210</b> as the etch mask. In some embodiments, the hard mask dielectric <b>210</b> is also partially removed during the dry etch as a result of material consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Finally as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates, after the formation of the chalcogenide sidewall spacers <b>216</b>, an enclosure dielectric <b>218</b> is deposited over the multilayer stack <b>50</b> in order to seal the entire structure.</p>
