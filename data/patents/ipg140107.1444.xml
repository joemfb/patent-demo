<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An adapter plate is disclosed and methods therefor. In particular, an adapter plate is disclosed which secures and seals an adapter to an equipment housing wall and methods therefor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is often necessary within fiber optic networks to optically connect optical fibers through mating connectors. Mating connectors may include connector alignment features on the ferrules for fine alignment, but are typically grossly aligned using some form of adapter assembly. Adapters may be stand-alone components or may be maintained within network structures, walls or receptacles, for example, within a network connection terminal or on an antenna mounted electronics housing. Desirable adapters should not only properly align mating connectors, but should also protect the mating connectors and optical fibers from adverse environmental and mechanical influences, such as from side loading, rotational and tensile forces.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In many cases, the network structures, walls or receptacles are not configured to receive such a desirable adapter. Upgrades, retrofitting, and alterations to existing networks may require the application of a new or different adapter. Most adapters have particular installation geometrical constraints or &#x201c;footprint,&#x201d; usually defined by the network structures, walls or receptacles. However, in some cases such footprints are not available to the craft. An adapter plate is therefore needed to retrofit the particular footprints of a desired adapter to the network structures, walls or receptacles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure describes an adapter plate assembly including an adapter for mating two connectors and an adapter plate. The adapter includes a first end and a second end and a passage therethrough. The adapter further includes an adapter footprint and an adapter flange. The first end has an external threaded portion and the second end has an external threaded portion. The adapter is adapted to receive a ruggedized connector in the first end and an MT connector in the second end. The adapter plate includes an aperture for receiving at least a portion of the adapter, a footprint receiving portion for receiving at least a portion of the adapter footprint, a flange receiving portion for receiving the adapter flange, and an attachment feature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosure also set outs a method of mounting a standard adapter to a non-standard wall by providing a standard adapter and an adapter plate, the adapter plate having a footprint configured to receive the standard adapter. The method involves placing a drill template on the non-standard wall and drilling holes in the non-standard wall to accommodate the standard adapter and the adapter plate, and securing the adapter to the adapter plate, and securing the adapter plate to the non-standard wall.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional features are set out in the detailed description which follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing the described embodiments and the claims, as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is to be understood that both the general description and the detailed description are exemplary, and are intended to provide an overview or framework to understand the claims.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference is now made in detail to embodiments of the disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Whenever possible, identical or similar reference numerals are used throughout the drawings to refer to identical or similar parts. It should be understood that the embodiments disclosed are merely examples with each one incorporating certain benefits of the present disclosure. Various modifications and alterations may be made to the following examples within the scope of the present disclosure, and aspects of the different examples may be mixed in different ways to achieve yet further examples. Accordingly, the true scope of the disclosure is to be understood from the entirety of the present disclosure in view of, but not limited to, the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An adapter plate is disclosed that may receive, for example, a standard connector adapter, for mounting the standard connector adapter to a structure, for example, a wall or a housing. The adapter plate includes a connector adapter footprint for a connector adapter, and also includes a mounting structure for mounting the adapter plate to a wall, eliminating the need to have the footprint located in the wall or housing. By having the footprint located in the adapter plate, in-the-field conversions from, for example, one type of connector adapter to another type of connector adapter are possible without replacing, for example, a proprietary housing or module. The disclosure includes an exemplary connector adapter and an adapter plate having a corresponding exemplary adapter footprint; however, adapter plate embodiments having other footprints that may receive other connector adapters are possible. The disclosure also includes methods for assembling the adapter plate to the connector adapter and fitting the adapter plate to a wall or housing, as well as methods for altering a wall or a housing to receive the adapter plate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various embodiments will be further clarified by the following examples.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An adapter plate assembly <b>10</b> includes a coupling nut <b>12</b>, an adapter plate <b>20</b>, an adapter gasket <b>14</b>, and an adapter <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Coupling nut <b>12</b> may have a threaded interior <b>13</b>. Adapter gasket <b>14</b> may include a sealing member or surface, for example, a gasket or an O-ring, and may be made from a resilient material, for example, a silicone or a rubber material. An exemplary adapter plate <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>) may include a footprint receiving portion, the footprint receiving portion including, for example, at least one curved side <b>21</b>, at least one flat side <b>23</b>, and at least one key slot <b>28</b>. The footprint receiving portion is adjacent to at least one footprint seat <b>27</b>. Adapter plate <b>20</b> further includes at least one through aperture <b>22</b>, at least one flange cutout <b>24</b>, at least one sealing surface <b>25</b>, at least one bolt aperture <b>26</b>, and at least one adapter mating seat <b>29</b>. An attachment feature may include bolt aperture <b>26</b> in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the attachment feature may include adhesives, clips, or thumb-screws. Footprint seat <b>27</b> and adapter mating seat <b>29</b> are substantially aligned, for example, parallel to each other, and are located on opposite sides of adapter plate <b>20</b>. Flange cutout <b>24</b> may be located adjacent to sealing surface <b>25</b>. Adapter plate <b>20</b> may be made from a metal alloy, for example, stainless steel or aluminum; however, in alternate embodiments adapter plate <b>20</b> may be made from a thermoplastic material, a thermoset material, or other suitable materials or combinations of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Adapter <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) includes a footprint adjacent to a flange <b>32</b>. The footprint may include at least one curved side <b>31</b>, at least one straight side <b>33</b>, and at least one orientation key <b>37</b>. Adapter <b>30</b> also includes at least one shroud portion <b>34</b>, a first end <b>38</b> and a second end <b>39</b>. Flange <b>32</b> may provide support against a portion of adapter plate <b>20</b>, or, for example a wall or housing, in which adapter <b>30</b> may be installed. In an exemplary embodiment, adapter <b>30</b> is used to align two dissimilar connectors for mating. First end <b>38</b> of adapter <b>30</b> may receive such a connector as a hardened multi-fiber optical connector known under the mark OptiTip&#xae;, available from Corning Cable Systems LLC of Hickory, N.C., that may endure such harsh environmental conditions as heat, cold, humidity, or ultraviolet light exposure. A second end <b>39</b> of the adapter <b>30</b> may receive, for example, an unsealed connector, for example, an MT connector, that may be used in such areas as climate controlled telecommunication rooms or, for example, environmentally sealed electronics or optical housings. First end <b>38</b> may have external threads for threadable engagement with, for example, a coupling nut of the ruggedized connector. Second end <b>39</b> may have external threads for threadably engaging interior <b>13</b> on coupling nut <b>12</b>; however, such engaging structures are exemplary and other coupling arrangements are possible. Adapter <b>30</b> may be integrally formed or may include one or more joined together components. Adapter <b>30</b> may be made from such thermoplastic materials as nylon or ULTEM&#x2122; material provided by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) Innovative Plastics, Houston, Tex., or may be made from metal, ceramic, or other suitable material or combinations of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Adapter <b>30</b> functions to reduce or eliminate forces placed upon the ferrule during loading and removal. Shroud portions <b>34</b> of the adapter have a length to accept and partially surround a portion of a connector housing, for example, an MT connector housing, that is handled during loading and unloading. Clearances between the connector housing and the adapter <b>30</b> are reduced to substantially eliminate any large clearances between components and prevent forces from reaching the ferrule. In other words, excess clearance is eliminated, protecting the connector from side-loading forces. In other embodiments, adapter <b>30</b> may include variations of wrap-around arms that engage with the sides of the connector housing. Shroud protrusions may also include a full cup-shaped protrusion, a partial-surround, castling, or any other structure that provides lengthened engagement to the MT connector housing. This insures that the MT connector is aligned accurately along the long fiber axis and serves to bolster the rigidity of the MT connector in the short axis during disengagement.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Adapter <b>30</b> can be a standard adapter or any kind of adapter with a standard outer profile. For purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;standard&#x201d; is characterized by a mating format that requires a particular set of criteria for attaching or mating an adapter to a surface. For example, adapter <b>30</b>, having a footprint of curved side <b>31</b>, straight side <b>33</b>, and orientation key <b>37</b>, all arranged in a particular fashion for a particular function, may not perform optimally if not mated to a surface having a correspondingly arranged receptacle. Adapter plate <b>20</b> includes, in exemplary embodiments, the appropriate features to receive, in this example, adapter <b>30</b> in such a manner as to retain the performance, retention, strength, sealing, and all other benefits designed into adapter <b>30</b>. In turn, by attaching adapter plate <b>20</b> to a generic, or non-standard, surface, for example, a wall or housing, adapter plate <b>20</b> transfers the &#x201c;standard&#x201d; for adapter <b>30</b> to the non-standard surface. In other embodiments, adapter plate <b>20</b> may receive, for example, Hardened Fiber Optic Adapters (HFOAs) that comply with Telcordia GR-3120, Issue 2, April 2010, <i>Generic Requirements for Hardened Fiber Optic Connectors</i>, for mating with GR-3120 compliant Hardened Fiber Optic Connectors (HFOCs). In yet other embodiments, adapter plate <b>20</b> may receive non-hardened adapters suitable for receiving and mating such non-hardened connectors as, but not limited to, SC, ST, LC, DC, MTP&#xae;, MPO, MT-RJ and SC-DC&#xae; connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Adapter plate assembly <b>10</b> may be assembled by axially inserting adapter <b>30</b> into adapter plate <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). Adapter gasket <b>14</b> may be applied about footprint <b>31</b> and may contact flange <b>32</b>. Second end <b>39</b> is inserted through primary aperture <b>22</b> until gasket <b>14</b> contacts sealing surface <b>25</b>.
