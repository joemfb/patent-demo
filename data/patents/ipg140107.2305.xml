<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of depositing a thin film by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on a substrate surface is disclosed. The disclosed method includes placing an ALD deposition proximity head above the substrate with at least one gas channel configured to dispense a gas to an active process region of the substrate surface. The ALD deposition proximity head extends over and is being spaced apart from the active process region of the substrate surface when present. After a pulse of a first reactant gas is dispensed on the active process region of the substrate surface underneath the proximity head, a pulse of a second reactant gas is dispensed on the active process region of the substrate surface underneath the proximity head to react with the first reactant gas to form a portion of the thin layer of ALD film on the surface of substrate underneath the proximity head.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the fabrication of semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits, memory cells, and the like, a series of manufacturing operations are performed to define features on semiconductor wafers. The semiconductor wafers include integrated circuit devices in the form of multi-level structures defined on a silicon substrate. At a substrate level, transistor devices with diffusion regions are formed. In subsequent levels, interconnect metallization lines are patterned and electrically connected to the transistor devices to define a desired integrated circuit device. Also, patterned conductive layers are insulated from other conductive layers by dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reliably producing sub-micron and smaller features is one of the key technologies for the next generation of very large scale integration (VLSI) and ultra large scale integration (ULSI) of semiconductor devices. However, the shrinking dimensions of interconnect in VLSI and ULSI technologies have placed additional demands on the processing capabilities. As circuit densities increase, the widths of vias, contacts and other features, as well as the dielectric materials between them, decrease to sub-micron dimensions (e.g., less than 0.10 micrometers or less), whereas the thickness of the dielectric layers remains substantially constant, with the result that the aspect ratios for the features, i.e., their height divided by width, increase. Many traditional deposition processes have difficulty achieving substantially void-free and seam-free filling of sub-micron structures where the aspect ratio exceeds 4:1.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, copper and its alloys have become the metals of choice for sub-micron interconnect technology due to its lower resistivity. One problem with the use of copper is that copper diffuses into silicon, silicon dioxide, and other dielectric materials, which may compromise the integrity of devices. Conformal barrier layers can be used to prevent copper diffusion. Copper might not adhere well to the barrier layer; therefore, a liner layer might need to be deposited between the barrier layer and copper. Conformal deposition of the barrier layer and liner layer is important to provide good step coverage to assist copper adhesion and/or deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, there is a need for apparatus and methods of depositing conformal thin film in interconnect structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Broadly speaking, the embodiments fill the need for apparatus and methods of depositing conformal thin film in interconnect structures by providing processes and systems using an atomic layer deposition (ALD). More specifically, each of the ALD systems includes a proximity head that has a small reaction volume right above a portion of the substrate. The proximity head dispenses small amount of reactants and purging gas to be distributed and pumped away from the small reaction volume between the proximity head and the substrate in relatively short periods, which increases the through-put.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a solution, a method, a process, an apparatus, or a system. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, an apparatus for depositing a thin film by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is provided. The apparatus includes a substrate support configured to support a substrate. The apparatus also includes a proximity head configured to sequentially dispense a reactant gas and a purging gas to deposit a thin ALD film under the proximity head. The proximity head covers an active process region of a substrate surface. The proximity head also includes at least one vacuum channel to pull excess reactant gas, purging gas, or deposition byproducts from a reaction volume between a surface of the proximity head facing the substrate and the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Several exemplary embodiments of ALD apparatus and methods using proximity heads are provided. The proximity head ALD apparatus and methods improve ALD processing throughput and allow integration with pre and post treatment for ALD deposition in the same apparatus. It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including a process, a method, an apparatus, or a system. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of the specific details set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Barrier overhang <b>101</b> near top of the interconnect structure <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, by conventional physical vapor deposition (PVD) process is known to cause copper voids in metal lines or vias during copper gap-fill due to poor step coverage. The limited deposition of barrier material in the lower corners <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, is also a known problem to cause copper diffusion, electro-migration (EM) problem, and stress-induced voiding. To ensure sufficient barrier material in the lower corners, sufficient barrier materials need to be deposited in the interconnect structures. Therefore, a more conformal barrier deposition is needed. The barrier layer <b>101</b> can be made of refractory metal compound, such as tantalum nitride (TaN), tantalum (Ta), or a combination of these films. Other barrier layer materials can also be used. Barrier layer materials may be other refractory metal compound including but not limited to titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), tungsten (W), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), vanadium (V), ruthenium (Ru) and chromium (Cr), among others.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to step coverage concern, barrier layer, such as tantalum nitride (TaN), adheres well to dielectric layer <b>150</b>; however, the adhesion between TaN and copper is poor. In contrast, barrier layer, such as tantalum (Ta), adheres well to copper, but not as well to the dielectric layer. It's possible to deposit a TaN layer <b>111</b> to line the interconnect structure <b>110</b> to allow the TaN to contact the dielectric material <b>150</b> and to deposit a Ta layer afterwards for copper <b>113</b> to be in contact with Ta <b>112</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The Ta layer acts as a liner layer or a glue layer to copper. However, a two-step process is more complicated and the deposition of the first TaN makes the aspect ratio of the interconnect structure even higher, which worsen the step coverage issue of the following Ta layer. Other examples of liner layer include, not limited to, titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), and ruthenium (Ru), among others.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is known to produce thin film with good step coverage. ALD is typically accomplished by using multiple pulses, such as two pulses, of reactants with purge in between, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For metallic barrier deposition, a pulse of barrier-metal-containing reactant (M) <b>201</b> is delivered to the substrate surface, followed by a pulse of purging gas (P) <b>202</b>. Examples of barrier-metal-containing reactant for barrier metal such as tantalum nitride include but are not limited to pentaethylmethylamino-tantalum (PEMAT; Ta(NC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>), pentadiethylamino-tantalum (PDEAT, Ta[N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>5</sub>), pentadimethylamino-tantalum (PDMAT, Ta[N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>5</sub>), and any and all of derivatives of PEMAT, PDEAT, or PDMAT. Other tantalum containing precursors include without limitation tertbutylimido-tris(diethylamido)-tantalum (TBTDET), tertbutylimido-tris(dimethylamido)-tantalum (TBTDMT), and tertbutylimido-tris(ethylmethylamido)-tantalum (TBTEMT), and all of derivatives of TBTDET, TBTDMT, and TBTEMT. Additionally, other tantalum containing precursors include without limitation tantalum halides for example TaX<sub>5 </sub>where X is fluorine (F), bromine (Br) or chlorine (Cl), and derivatives thereof. Examples of purging gas include helium (He), neon (Ne), argon (Ar), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The pulse of barrier-metal-containing reactant <b>201</b> delivered to the substrate surface form a monolayer of barrier metal, such as Ta, on the substrate surface. In one embodiment, the pulse of purging gas is a plasma enhanced (or plasma assisted) gas. The barrier metal, such as Ta, bonds to the substrate surface, which is made of dielectric material. The purge gas <b>202</b> removes the excess barrier-metal-containing reactant <b>201</b> from the substrate surface. Following the pulse of the purging gas <b>202</b>, a pulse of reactant (B) <b>203</b> is delivered to the substrate surface. The reactant (B) <b>203</b> can be nitrogen-containing gas or a hydrogen-containing reducing gas. If the barrier material contains nitrogen, such as TaN, the reactant (B) <b>203</b> is likely to contain nitrogen. Examples of reactant (B) <b>203</b> include ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), N<sub>2</sub>, and NO. Other N-containing precursors gases may be used including but not limited to N<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y </sub>for x and y integers (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), N<sub>2 </sub>plasma source, NH<sub>2</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, among others. If the barrier material contains little or no nitrogen, the reactant (B) <b>203</b> can be a hydrogen-containing reducing gas, such as H<sub>2</sub>. Following pulse <b>203</b> is a pulse of purging gas <b>204</b>. Reactants M, B, and purge gas can be plasma enhanced or thermally excited. In one embodiment, the pulse of reactant (B) <b>203</b> is a plasma-enhanced (or plasma-assisted).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The tantalum nitride layer formation may start with the chemisorption of a monolayer of a tantalum-containing compound on the substrate followed by a monolayer of a nitrogen-containing compound. Alternatively, the tantalum nitride layer formation may start with the chemisorption of a monolayer of a nitrogen-containing compound on the substrate followed by a monolayer of the tantalum-containing compound. Furthermore, in an alternative embodiment, a pump evacuation alone between pulses of reactant gases may be used to prevent mixing of the reactant gases.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one cycle of the barrier deposition pulses. After one cycle of the barrier deposition pulses, a thin layer (or phase) of barrier layer or liner layer is deposited. One or more cycles of pulses are applied until desired barrier layer thickness is achieved. The duration of the pulses is between about 100 mili-seconds to about 2 seconds. The thickness of the barrier layer and/or liner layer is between about 10 &#x212b; to about 50 &#x212b;, preferably between about 20 &#x212b; to about 30 &#x212b;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In conventional ALD apparatus and process, reactive gas(es) and purging gas(es) are introduced across the entire substrate surface. It requires a certain amount of time &#x394;T<sub>M</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>B </sub>for reactant M or B to cover the entire substrate surface. Similarly, in order to ensure that excess reactant M or B is pumped away from the substrate surface, sufficient purging time &#x394;T<sub>P1</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>P2 </sub>is required, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. &#x394;T<sub>M</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>B</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>P1</sub>, and &#x394;T<sub>P2 </sub>can also be called the pulse times (or durations) for reactant M, purging gas for reactant M, reactant B and purging gas for reactant B, respectively. The pulse times for reactant M, purging gas for reactant M, reactant B, and purging gas for reactant B affect barrier layer deposition throughput. Reactant B is introduced into the process chamber or to the substrate surface after the substrate surface and process chamber is substantially free of reactant M. Similarly, reactant M is introduced into the process chamber or to the substrate surface after the substrate surface and process chamber is substantially free of reactant B.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a process chamber <b>300</b> with a substrate <b>310</b> disposed on substrate support <b>320</b>. In process chamber <b>300</b>, there is a showerhead <b>330</b> suspended above substrate <b>310</b>. A gas inlet <b>340</b> is coupled to the showerhead <b>330</b>. A pump <b>360</b> is connected to the process chamber <b>300</b>. Pump <b>360</b> pumps gas(es) in the reaction chamber <b>300</b> out of the reaction chamber and maintains the pressure in the chamber. Between the shower head <b>330</b> and the substrate <b>310</b> is a reaction volume <b>350</b>. During the purging periods, the excess reactant M or B on the substrate surface needs to be purged from the substrate surface. It is also desirable to purge the excess reactant M or B from the rest of the process chamber to prevent reactants M and B from mixing to prevent particle problem. As discussed above, purging can be replaced by pumping, in some embodiments. To purging excess reactant M or B from the entire substrate surface and/or the process chamber can be time-consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Due to the lengths of the pulses, the deposition cycle can be long and the deposition rate can be relatively low. For example, typical deposition cycle for conventional ALD process chamber is about 1-5 sec/cycle. Typical film thickness per cycle is about 1 &#x212b;/cycle for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, about 2.5 &#x212b;/cycle for W, between about 0.4 &#x212b;/cycle to about 2.6 &#x212b;/cycle for TaN, and about 0.4 &#x212b;/cycle for Ru. For Ru, the deposition rate is 0.08-0.4 &#x212b;/s, which is relatively low. As discussed above, Ru can be a barrier layer and also can be a liner layer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Due to the relatively long deposition cycle, the deposition rate (or through put) for some barrier or liner layers, such as Ru, is considered too low from manufacturing standpoint. In order to improve the deposition rate, the deposition cycle needs to be reduced. One way to reduce deposition cycle is to have short pulses of reactants and purging gases (fast purge or fast pump). Short pulses are possible if the reaction volume is small and when vacuuming (or pumping) of reactant or purging gas is near the reaction volume. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic diagram of an ALD reactor <b>400</b> with a proximity head <b>430</b>. In reactor <b>400</b>, there is a substrate <b>410</b> disposed on a substrate support <b>420</b>. The proximity head <b>430</b> is supported above substrate <b>410</b>. Between the proximity head <b>430</b> and the substrate <b>410</b>, there is a reaction volume <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A gas inlet <b>440</b> and a vacuum line <b>465</b> are coupled to the proximity head <b>430</b>. The gas inlet <b>440</b> supplies reactants and purging gas to process chamber <b>400</b>. The gas inlet <b>440</b> can be coupled to a plurality of containers that store reactants or purging gas. For example, the gas inlet <b>440</b> can be coupled to a container <b>441</b> that stores a first reactant, such as reactant M described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In one embodiment reactant in container <b>441</b> is in liquid form and is carried into the gas inlet <b>440</b> by a carrier gas, which is one of the inert gases or a gas that does not react with reactant M, such as N<sub>2</sub>. Examples of inert gas include helium, argon, neon, krypton, xenon, and radon. The gas inlet <b>440</b> can also be coupled to a container <b>443</b> that supplies a second reactant, such as reactant B described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As described above, reactant B can be plasma assisted. In one embodiment, reactant B is supplied by a reactor <b>443</b>&#x2032; that generate plasmarized reactant B. Alternatively, the substrate support <b>420</b> can be coupled to a radio frequency (RF) generator <b>470</b> to generate plasma to plasmarize reactant B when reactant B is dispensed into the reaction volume <b>450</b>, instead of supplying plasmarized reactant B from reactor <b>443</b>&#x2032;. Another alternative is to couple an RF generator <b>473</b> to the proximity head <b>430</b> to generate plasma. In one embodiment, one electrode is coupled to the RF generator while the other electrode is grounded during plasma generation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The gas inlet <b>440</b> can also be coupled to a container <b>441</b> that stores a purging gas. Purging gas and reactant B can also be diluted by a carrier gas, as described above for reactant M. Carrier gas can be used to sustain chamber pressure. Most likely reactant M needs a carrier gas, because it was in liquid form in storage tank. It needs carrier gas to bring the vaporized reactant M into the processing chamber. Reactant B (a reduction gas) might not need carrier gas, since it already is in gas form. However, reactant B might need a carrier gas to maintain the chamber pressure or to keep the concentration low.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">There could be a heater (not shown) and/or a cooler coupled to, or embedded in, the substrate support <b>420</b> to maintain the substrate temperature. Other parts of the chamber could also be heated or cooled to maintain process temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">During ALD deposition cycles, one of reactants M, B and purging gas P is supplied to the gas inlet <b>440</b>. The on and off of gas supplies of these gas are controlled by valves <b>451</b>, <b>453</b>, and <b>454</b>. The other end of the vacuum line <b>465</b> is a vacuum pump <b>460</b>. The reaction volume <b>450</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is much smaller than the reaction volume <b>350</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. There is also a vacuum pump (not shown) coupled to the pressure chamber to maintain the chamber pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows one embodiment of a proximity head <b>430</b> disposed above substrate <b>410</b>, with a reaction volume <b>450</b> between the proximity head <b>430</b> and substrate <b>410</b>. The substrate surface under the reaction volume <b>450</b> is an active process region <b>455</b>. The proximity head <b>430</b> has one or more gas channels <b>411</b> that supplies reactant M, B, or purging gas P. On both sides of the gas channel <b>411</b>, there are vacuum channels <b>413</b>, <b>415</b> pumping excessive reactants M, B, purging gas, and/or reaction byproducts from the reaction volume <b>450</b>. Due to the existence of vacuum channels <b>413</b>, <b>415</b> vacuuming excessive reactants or reactant byproducts away from substrate surface, purging gas might not be needed. Purging steps <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> might be eliminated in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Reactant M, B, and purging gas P is passed through the gas channel <b>411</b> sequentially, such as the sequence shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Gas channel <b>411</b> is coupled to gas inlet <b>440</b>, which is coupled to different gas sources, including reactant M, B and purging gas P. When a pulse of gas, either reactant M, B, or P, is injected from the gas channel <b>411</b> to the substrate surface, the excess amount of gas is pumped away from the substrate surface by the vacuum channels <b>413</b>, <b>415</b>, which keeps the reaction volume small and reduces the purging or pumping time. Since the reaction volume is small, only small amount of reactant is needed to cover the small reaction volume. Similarly only small amount of purging gas is needed to purge the excess reactant from the reaction volume <b>450</b>. In addition, the vacuum channels are right near the small reaction volume <b>450</b>, which assists the pumping and purging of the excess reactants, purging gas, and reaction byproducts from the substrate surface. As a consequence, the pulse times &#x394;T<sub>M</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>B</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>P1</sub>, and &#x394;T<sub>P2 </sub>for reactants M, B, and purging gas respectively, can be greatly reduced. As a consequence, the cycle time can be reduced and the throughput can be increased.</p>

Proximity head <b>430</b> moves across the substrate surface. In this embodiment, the length of the proximity head L<sub>PH </sub>is equal to or greater than the diameter of the substrate.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to the embodiment of proximity head shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, other embodiments are also possible. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a cross section of a rotating proximity head <b>700</b> suspended above a substrate <b>710</b>. The cross section of proximity head <b>700</b> can be rectangular or square. On the surface of each side, there is a gas inlet in the middle and vacuum channels on both sides of the gas feed. For example, on side <b>1</b>, there are a gas inlet <b>711</b>, supplying reactant M, and vacuum channels <b>713</b>, <b>715</b>. On side <b>2</b>, there are a gas inlet <b>721</b> supplying purging gas P, and vacuum channels <b>723</b>, <b>725</b>. On side <b>3</b>, there are a gas inlet <b>731</b> supplying reactant B, and vacuum channels <b>733</b>, <b>735</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At the start of the process flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, side <b>1</b> faces the surface of substrate <b>710</b>. A pulse of reactant M is dispersed on the substrate surface underneath the proximity head. Excess amount of reactant M is pumped away from the substrate surface by vacuum channels <b>713</b>, <b>715</b>. Afterwards, the proximity head <b>700</b> rotate to have side <b>2</b> facing the surface of substrate <b>710</b> to pulse the purging gas to expel excess reactant M from the substrate surface. The rotating device is not shown. Side <b>3</b> is then rotated to face the surface of substrate <b>710</b> to allow a pulse of reactant B to be dispersed on the substrate surface underneath the proximity head. Reactants M and B react to form a barrier layer or a liner layer. At the end of reaction, side <b>4</b> is rotated to face the surface of substrate <b>710</b> to purge excess reactant B and reaction byproduct from the surface of substrate <b>710</b> and finishes one deposition cycle. During the deposition cycle, the distance between various sides to the surface of substrate <b>710</b> can be different from one side to the next side. The mechanism (or device) that rotates and moves the proximity head allows gap space to be different from side to side. At the end of one deposition cycle, another cycle can be repeated on the same location to increase the film thickness or the proximity head can be moved to a location next to the current location to deposit another section of the thin film, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The gap distance between the proximity head and substrate is small during ALD cycles. The gap distance between the proximity head and substrate during dispensing of barrier-metal-containing reactant M is less than about 5 mm In one embodiment, the gap distance is about 1 mm The gap distance between the proximity head and substrate during dispensing of reactant B is less than about 5 mm In one embodiment, the gap distance is about 1 mm The gap distance between the proximity head and substrate during dispensing of purging gas is less than about 5 mm In one embodiment, the gap distance is about 1 mm During deposition cycle, the gap distance can change when the proximity head rotates from side to side. For example, the gap distance for pulsing of reactant M or B can be smaller than the gap for purging gas P. The smaller gap distance during pulsing of reactant M or B decreases the reaction volume, while slightly larger gap distance during pulsing of purging gas could enhance the purging efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is desirable to have the surfaces of sides <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> around the gas inlets and vacuum channels to be flat to ensure the pulse of reactant M, B, or purging gas P is distributed evenly on the substrate surface. In addition, the vacuum channels suck away the excess reactant M, B or purging gas P evenly across the substrate surface. The flat surfaces of sides <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> ensure uniform film deposition on the surface of substrate <b>710</b>.</p>

Wafer area pressure P<sub>wap </sub>in the reaction volume needs to be greater than chamber pressure (P<sub>chamber</sub>) to control P<sub>wap</sub>. Chamber pressure (P<sub>chamber</sub>) needs to be at least slightly higher than the pressure of the vacuum pump that is used to control the chamber pressure.
