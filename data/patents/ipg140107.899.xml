<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Abandonment Procedure for wells on a platform that has fallen over. There are basically two ways to restore control of the wells on a platform that has fallen over. Abandon the wells completely in the order they are accessed, or remove the bent or broken portion of the well and install a subsea wellhead. However, when removing the bent or broken part of the pipe such piping may still be under pressure such pressure dealt with before removal. Otherwise, a blow out could occur.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to the hot tapping multiple coaxial strings of underwater piping and/or tubing for overturned wells and/or platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Under pressure drilling or hot tapping is the process of drilling into a pressured pipe or vessel using special equipment and procedures to ensure that the pressure and fluids are safely contained when access is made. The most common example of a hot tap is into a pressured pipeline. A typical hot tap assembly consists of a saddle assembly with a doughnut-type elastomer pack off, two outboard full-bore flanged valves, a tee assembly and the hot tapping device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional hot tap device has a polished rod and pack-off assembly which allows movement in the longitudinal direction, as well as rotation while maintaining a seal. A drill bit is installed on the end of the polished rod to drill into the vessel. The means to turn the polished rod may be manual, or by air or hydraulic-generated torque. A threaded sleeve feeds the polish rod assembly and provides the force to resist the pressure area effect that would tend to blow out the polished rod.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Abandonment Procedure for Wells on a Platform That Has Fallen over. There are basically two ways to restore control of the wells on a platform that has fallen over. Abandon the wells completely in the order they are accessed. Or remove the bent or broken portion of the well and install a subsea wellhead.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Preliminary Work</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">(1) Move on location and set up as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">(2) Make a review of the platform. Determine at what depths the wells are broken over. Determine whether cutting into the wells conductor pipe will cause the platform to move. Are the wells holding up any weight besides their own? When performing multi string hot tapping, operations go much more efficiently when larger diameter access holes can be taken out of the drive pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">(3) Verify that the pipelines have been removed and have no pressure on same.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">(4) Mark the well number clearly at several points along their length.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">(5) Remove Debris as needed to give divers access to the wells where they are as close to vertical as possible or below where they are broken over. This may entail going below the mud line. Quite often the inner wells are broken over at a lower depth than the outer wells. Make a diagram showing the depth that all the wells are broken over in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">(6) Visually attempt to determine if any of the drive pipes <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>&#x2032;, <b>50</b>&#x2033;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">have failed or are broken open. If so are any of the inner casing strings broken open.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">(7) The personnel in the field must be cognizant of what the operator wishes to accomplish in order to determine at what depth the outer wells will need to be cut off and or tapped into.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">(8) Determine a game plan as to what order the wells will be accessed and how the operator wishes to regain control of the wells. This will determine at what depth the wells will need to be hot tapped.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Hot Tap Procedure</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">(1) Divers have previously gained access to the well and have prepared for themselves a work area.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">(2) Determine the depth where the hot tap will be done. Install ropes around the Drive pipe <b>50</b> where the pipe is vertical&#x2014;if there is plenty of room for working&#x2014;Install the soft line around the pipe approximately 3 feet apart. Take a 2 inch flat chisel and remove all the barnacles from the work area between the ropes.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">(3) Once the pipe is clean for work. Measure the pipe <b>50</b> with a tape to verify the diameter of same. Use the tape to make a line around the pipe in the middle between the two ropes as straight as possible. Using an imaginary plane cutting the pipe perpendicular to its longitudinal axis, draw four (4) vertical marking lines extending from the top rope to the bottom rope which are radially spaced apart (e.g., preferably 90-degrees radially spaced from each other). In one embodiment these vertical lines will be at: (a) 0 degrees; (b) 90 degrees, (c) 180 degrees; and (d) 240 degrees going in a clockwise manner around the pipe. In this manner the space between the 0 degree and 240 degree lines will provide the most area work.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">(4) Verify that the outer drive pipe <b>50</b> has no pressure&#x2014;i.e., it is been broken open, or if not broken has no interior annular pressure. If it can be verified as not being pressurized, use a drill (which can be hydraulically powered and magnetically attached) to drill holes at the radial locations of 0, 90 and 240 degrees. The size of the holes to be drilled will be determined by the drive pipe <b>50</b> and the inner casing string (e.g., <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, and/or <b>80</b>). Once the holes <b>52</b> are drilled, remove any annular cement as needed to measure the distance from the outer drive pipe <b>50</b> to the inner casing string <b>60</b>. Once the interior location of the inner casing string <b>60</b> is determined relative to the drive pipe <b>50</b>, the location of tool attachment can be decided upon. When the outer drive pipe cannot be verified to have no pressure inside of it. The outer drive pipe will have to be hot tapped, as is done in this procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">(5) Install the saddle clamp tool <b>100</b> with the center of the openings <b>230</b>, <b>230</b>&#x2032; set at the 0 and 180 degree positions as indicated by the 0 and 180 degree vertical lines. The saddle clamp tool <b>100</b> can be installed by closing the two bolts on the open side and snugging them down, then backing off the holding nut on the opposite bolts then tightening the tighten nuts on the other two bolts. Finally, going back and tightening the two original nuts.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">(6) Install a hot tap barrel <b>2000</b> on the saddle clamp tool <b>100</b> by sliding it over the top slick bolt, and then lining up the barrel against the drive pipe. Preferably, the barrel includes a properly size tapping tip <b>2010</b> which has a curved flexible (e.g., Teflon) seal installed to sealing fit against the drive pipe <b>50</b>. Tighten the sealing nuts <b>244</b> to create a seal between the drive pipe <b>50</b> and the hot tap tip <b>2010</b>. Test the seal against drive pipe <b>50</b> to 250 pounds per square inch pressure. Note: the end of the barrel <b>2050</b> has a 2 inch 1502 weco connection. The seal test can be done by installing a &#xbc; inch (or 1&#xbd; inch hose) to the back of the barrel <b>2050</b> and pressuring up the connection. If pressure is maintained then a seal has been formed.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">(7) Remove the pressure test hose and install the Hot Tap Tool to the end of the barrel <b>2050</b> using a 2 inch 1502 weco quick connection (by hammering up the quick connect). Run in the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> till the &#xbe;&#x2033; flat drill <b>2100</b> of the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> touches the drive pipe <b>50</b>. Pressure up the barrel <b>2050</b> between the 1 inch polished rod and chevron packing on the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and the Teflon seal <b>2010</b> against the outer casing to 250 pounds per square inch pressure. Double check the stop setting on the hot tap tool <b>2000</b>&#x2014;should be set for the thickness of the diameter size of the outer casing <b>50</b> (e.g., the drive pipe <b>50</b> diameter=&#xbe; inch+ 1/16 inch extra). Install the drill <b>2100</b> on the end of the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and rotate the polished rod to rotate the &#xbe; inch bit on the end. Advance the polished rod with the wheel with about &#xbc; inch linear advancement per turn as the diver is drilling the &#xbe; inch hole. This linear advancement of the drill bit <b>2110</b> should be continued until either: (a) pressure change is seen and/or (b) break thru of the drill bit is felt (e.g., the metal/drilling gets easier or the diver hits the stop/makes enough turns on the wheel to have advanced same the proper distance).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">(8) Once the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> has drilled thru the outer drive pipe <b>50</b>, the drill <b>2100</b> should be removed from the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and the hydraulic hoses disconnected with the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> positioned in a nearby location until needed again. Back out the polished rod till it clears the ball valve on the end of the barrel <b>2050</b> and close the ball valve. Bleed off any remaining pressure on the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and remove same from the barrel <b>2050</b>&#x2014;2 inch 1502 weco hammer union connection. Send the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> back to surface until needed again.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">(9) If there is any pressure behind the drive pipe <b>50</b> (i.e., in the annular space <b>62</b> between the interior of the drive pipe <b>50</b> and the first inner casing <b>60</b>), install a 1&#xbd; inch pump in line to the end of the barrel <b>2050</b>&#x2014;2 inch 1502 weco hammer union connection. Test the line against the ball valve. Open the ball valve opening the annular space <b>62</b> to the surface. Perform the necessary actions to remove any pressure and or hydrocarbons from this annular space <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">(10) Once all pressures and hydrocarbons have been removed from the annular space <b>62</b>, remove the barrel <b>2050</b> and send back to the surface to be redressed for the next casing string <b>70</b> by changing the hot tap sealing tip <b>2010</b>&#x2032;. In one embodiment the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> can be connected to the hot tap clamp <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">(11) Once the barrel <b>2050</b> is removed, measure the linear distance to the exterior of the next interior casing, pipe, and/or tubing <b>60</b>. Such linear distance can be measured with a measuring probe. In one embodiment there are 20 inch, 30 inch, and 40 inch measuring probes included for such measurements. Cement in the annular space may need to be removed prior to being able to take this measurement. Brushes, chippers, grinders, etc. can be included to assist the divers in clearing it out the annular space <b>62</b> for making such measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">(12) Once this measurement is taken, a determination can be made regarding the maximum enlarged hole <b>52</b> that can be drilled in the exterior casing/pipe <b>50</b> to provide operating space and visual access to the next interior casing, pipe, and/or tubing <b>60</b>. Send the drill <b>1000</b> down to the diver. Remove the 1 inch holding pin&#x2014;straight pick up&#x2014;from the saddle clamp <b>100</b> and line up the drill <b>1000</b>&#x2014;drop the pin in holding same. The initial drill <b>1000</b> will have the proper size bit <b>1400</b> already installed on the drill <b>1000</b>&#x2014;on all subsequent drilling events the diver will have to change out the bit <b>1400</b>&#x2032; to the proper size as needed. The drill <b>1000</b> sits on a multiple degree of freedom swiveling arm carriage that is held in place by the pin. Swivel the drill bit <b>1400</b> into place, lock it down solid by tightening the drill holding nuts. Advance the drill bit <b>1400</b> until it touches the drive pipe <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Detailed Hot Tap Procedure</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Below is a more detailed hot tap procedure which can be used for various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Dual plates <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032; will be set up with 8&#x2014;20 inch Jaws, 4&#x2014;Pivot Pins (with 8&#x2014;mount brackets and 4&#x2014;1 inch pins to hold them in place), 4&#x2014;Mount Brackets for Clevis's and 4&#x2014;Clevis's with 1&#x215e; inch&#xd7;36 inch Long Bolts &#x26; Nuts. The Long Bolts will have inner Nuts on the Closed Side of the DSC preset for 20 inch Drive Pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Depending on how the Clevis Mount Brackets are installed the diver can install drill <b>1000</b> on either their right or left side if they have a preference of plate <b>200</b> or <b>200</b>&#x2032;. Clevis Mount Brackets can be set to allow free movement when Drill Slide <b>1160</b> is installed on the Pivot Pin on the right and side of the either Plate <b>200</b> or <b>200</b>&#x2032; can still be installed on the Left Pivot Pin.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Clamp <b>100</b> can be prepared to be installed on Drive Pipe <b>50</b> by first determining the size of drive pipe <b>50</b>. In one embodiment drive pipe <b>50</b> can be 20 inches in diameter. Plates <b>200</b> and <b>200</b>&#x2032; can have bolt holes cut out (or open slots) on one side to allow the bolts to be swung into and out of position. Plates <b>200</b> and <b>200</b>&#x2032; can also have &#xbd; inch keys welded onto the end of the cut outs to keep the nut and washer from slipping out of position when they are loose. A set of 1 inch&#xd7;10&#x2032;&#x2014;4 part Nylon Slings (length depends on the crane&#x2014;the longer they are the more easily it will be for the diver to open and close clamp <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Lower clamp <b>100</b> alongside drive pipe <b>50</b> to the desired attachment location. With the diver assisting pulling clamp <b>100</b> around pipe <b>50</b> via the open side of clamp <b>100</b>. Once clamp <b>100</b> it is in place, the diver will release the tension in the come along just enough to allow plates <b>200</b> and <b>200</b>&#x2032; to close around pipe <b>50</b>. Close the two long clevis bolts on the open side by rotating them into the cut out bolt holes, over the &#xbd; inch stop keys, and tightening down the nuts and washers. The nuts should be tightened hand tight with a hammer wrench.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">At this time the diver should take a look at clamp <b>100</b> to determine that it is in place and fairly squared up. Look and see if the dies on the jaws <b>350</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>370</b>, and <b>380</b> are engaged and that the front and back plates <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032; are in their desired position relative to each other and drive pipe <b>50</b>. At this time, or at any later time, clamp <b>100</b> can be easily moved around drive pipe <b>50</b> simply by loosening the nuts on the open side and tightening up on the come along until the dies or jaws <b>350</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>370</b>, and <b>380</b> (and <b>350</b>&#x2032;, <b>360</b>&#x2032;, <b>370</b>&#x2032;, and <b>380</b>&#x2032;) on the open side become disengaged from pipe <b>50</b>, then simply rotate clamp <b>100</b> to the desired position or have the crane operator lower or raise the clamp <b>100</b> as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Once clamp <b>100</b> is in place and the open side has been hand tightened, slack off the remainder of the way on the come along making sure it has slack in it and is not holding a bind on clamp <b>100</b>. Diver should go around to the closed side and back off the two inside nuts, once they are free turn them at least three full rounds to make sure they do not interfere with the outside nuts being tightened. Tighten the two outside nuts on the closed side with the hammer wrench&#x2014;hand tight.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Once again look at clamp <b>100</b> to verify it is in position and is level with drive pipe <b>50</b>. As long as at least three of the dies (from <b>350</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>350</b>&#x2032;, and <b>360</b>&#x2032;) on the top set of jaws (4 jaws on top with 2 dies each and 4 jaws on bottom with 2 dies each) are making contact with drill pipe <b>50</b>, clamp <b>100</b> will stay firmly in place. Have the crane operator slack off clamp <b>100</b> as it will hold its own weight with the outer nuts just snug. Tighten up the 4 outside nuts with a hammer wrench and a one handed sledge hammer until they are tight. There is no need to beat it with a <b>101</b><i>b </i>or <b>121</b><i>b </i>sledge, you can if you would like&#x2014;the 2 inch thick plates with the 1&#x215e; inch bolts will take whatever tightening you would care to give them but the 16&#x2014;1&#xbc; inch&#xd7;5&#x215e; inch Diamond Tooth Tong Dies that are in the jaws are made to hold in every direction.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Once clamp <b>100</b> is installed remove the 1 inch&#xd7;10&#x2032; 4 part sling from the top of clamp <b>100</b>. Prior to running down clamp <b>100</b> and installing a &#x201c;Deer Stand&#x201d; work platform on drive pipe <b>50</b> for the diver to work of, drive pipe <b>50</b> area should be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Run the end of the bundle of Hydraulic Hoses down to the diver and attach them out of the way but handy. The Hydraulic hose bundle consists of a set of 1 inch hoses (inlet and outlet) used to run drill <b>1000</b> and a set of &#xbd; inch hoses used to run all the hand tools. Quick connects are installed on all of the hoses with inlet and outlet having male and female respectively to make sure they cannot be put on backward. Run the &#xbc; inch 10,000 psi test hose down to the diver and have him secure it out of the way.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Tap the 20 inch Drive Pipe <b>50</b> to determine if it has pressure on the inside of same. Compression plate <b>500</b> can be used with a 20 inch Mandrel <b>2050</b>. The 20 inch Mandrel <b>2050</b> will have attached to it the Swivel Nut <b>800</b>, Backing Nut <b>802</b>, Seal Tip <b>2010</b> (with Teflon Seal Installed) on one end and the Ball Valve (with 2 inch 1502 Weco Connection) on the other. The Swivel Nut <b>800</b> is screwed onto the mandrel <b>2050</b> and allows the center flange <b>500</b> to transfer the load to the mandrel <b>2050</b>. This swivel nut <b>800</b> allows for up to 10 to 15 degrees of rotation of the mandrel <b>2050</b> thru the flange <b>500</b>. Backing Nuts for the Mandrel can be installed on its threads as needed if accessories are wanted. For example, there may be a desire to attach a video camera as a camera would allow personnel on the topside (e.g., Dive Supervisor), to be able to see the seal tip <b>2010</b> and assist the diver when installing the mandrel <b>2050</b>. Also, a video camera would allow the dive supervisor to observe the seal tip <b>2010</b> to make sure it is level with the pipe (<b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, and/or <b>80</b>) prior to energizing the seal or to see any die leaking out around the seal while testing. These backing nuts can be installed on the mandrel <b>2050</b> for any reason needed. The Seal Tip <b>2010</b> with Teflon Seal Inserted will be for 20 inch pipe <b>50</b>. The Seal Tip <b>2010</b> and seal are cut to the curvature of the pipe (<b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, and/or <b>80</b>) to be hot tapped. The Tip <b>2010</b> and the mandrel <b>2050</b> will have a line drawn on it to show the diver how to line it up with the pipe. The Ball Valve (BV) can be a 2 inch 6,000 pounds per square inch heavy duty type with a 1&#xbd; inch ID thru same. The Ball Valve has 2 inch Line Pipe connections on both sides and a 2 inch 1502 Weco Male Connection will be installed on the BV. The BV will be run down to the diver in the open position. The diver will receive the Center Flange <b>500</b> with 20 inch mandrel <b>2050</b> on a center flange with a 20 inch tip <b>2010</b> on one end and ball valve open on the other. The diver will set the flange <b>500</b> on the 18 inch stud that is in the 12 O'clock position and remove the strap that holds it. The diver will slide the flange <b>500</b> forward on the 18 inch stud until the flange <b>500</b> is lined up on the 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch&#xd7;12 inch studs in the 2/4/8/10 positions. The diver will install 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch nuts on the 2/4/8/10 studs until the nuts are completely on the studs but no further. The 20 inch mandrel <b>2050</b> and tip <b>2010</b> will have a top dead center line run down the length of it. The diver will advance the inch mandrel <b>2050</b> by rotating the swivel nut <b>800</b> until the Teflon on the tip <b>2010</b> is engaged against the 20 inch pipe <b>50</b>. At that time the diver needs to verify that the mandrel <b>2050</b> is perpendicular to pipe <b>50</b> and that the line on the mandrel <b>2050</b> is on top (i.e., mandrel <b>2050</b> should be is lined up properly with pipe <b>50</b>). In order to get a seal mandrel <b>2050</b> should be line up perpendicular to the particular pipe the diver is attempting to seal against.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Once mandrel <b>2050</b> is in the proper position, tighten the 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch nuts with a hammer wrench taking care to tighten one half of a turn at a time when turning by hand then one fourth of a turn at a time when using a hammer, going from nuts 2 to 8; to 4 to 10; then back to nut 2. Preferably nuts are tightened evenly. This tightening compresses the Teflon seal against pipe <b>50</b>. Once mandrel <b>2050</b> is tightened against pipe <b>50</b>, stop and look at the entire set up and verify that everything looks proper such as whether the line on mandrel <b>2050</b> is still top center and the mandrel <b>2050</b> is perpendicular to pipe <b>50</b> tip <b>2010</b> is sealing against.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Test the Teflon seal on the 20 inch drive pipe <b>50</b> to 250 pounds per square inch low/1,000 pounds per square inch high for 5 minutes each test. The testing will be done by installing a 2 inch 1502 Female Weco hammer up connection to the 2 inch 1502 male Weco connection on the end of the mandrel. When hammering on and off the 2 inch 1502 Weco connections it is not necessary to use a big hammer and lots of force, please use common sense and caution. Install the &#xbc; inch test hose, or whatever test hose the operator chooses to use to the &#xbd; inch outlet on the end of the mandrel <b>2050</b>. When testing, if the operator chooses to do so, Green Dye can be available to be mixed with seawater to assist in seeing any leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Crane to send down the 30 inch stroke Hot Tap Tool <b>2000</b> with a 5&#x215e; inch long&#xd7;&#xbe; inch Fluted Bit with insert tips <b>2010</b> installed on same. In this case we will be using a &#xbe; inch Flat Tipped Cutting Insert on the Bit. Make up the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> to Mandrel <b>2050</b> by making up a 2 inch 1502 Weco connection. Throughout the procedure we will be utilizing the 3 inch diameter&#xd7;30 inch stroke 6,000 pounds per square inch working pressure Hot Tap Tool <b>2000</b>. In one embodiment both a 30 inch stroke Tool <b>2000</b> and a 54 inch Stroke tool <b>2000</b>&#x2032; will be sent out. Both have been designed to be used with this system <b>10</b>. The 30 inch stroke tool <b>2000</b> works with the 20 inch Mandrel <b>2050</b>. The 54 inch stroke tool <b>2000</b>&#x2032; works with the 30 inch and 40 inch Mandrels (<b>2050</b>&#x2032; and <b>2050</b>&#x2033;) should an extended reach be needed. The 54 inch stroke tool <b>2000</b>&#x2032; can also be used in conjunction with the 20 inch Mandrel <b>2050</b> should something happen to the 30 inch tool <b>2050</b>&#x2032;. Along with two Hot Tap Tools spare parts will be sent with each tool including an extra Lower Drilling Rod Assembly for both tools so they can be rebuilt in the field if needed. The Hot Tap Tool <b>2000</b> has a 1 inch Drilling Rod that is sealed off against Chevron packing (6 part). The packing retainer on the tools is made in such a way that it can be tightened if the packing starts leaking while drilling or anytime that the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> is installed on the well. The diver will be supplied with a special wrench to be able to tighten the packing retainer nut if needed. The 1 inch Rod is attached to the bit with a standard #2 Morris Taper (1&#xbc; inch OD). The Mandrel <b>2050</b> has a 1.30 inch ID. The Seal Tip <b>2010</b> has a &#xbe; inch ID that helps to align the &#xbe; inch bit.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Make up the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> on the mandrel <b>2050</b>. Leave the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> hanging from the crane while it is in the water. The hot tap tool <b>2000</b> is fairly light+/&#x2212;150 lb of weight and when using same on a real well it could be hung off from an air bag if it is necessary to remove it from the crane. Test the Teflon seal on the 20 inch drive pipe <b>50</b>, the packing around the 1 inch rod and the 1502 connection to 250 pounds per square inch low/1,000 pounds per square inch high for 5 minutes each test. Bleed off the pressure. Run in the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> by turning the hand wheel. The Drive Rod on the hot tap tool <b>2000</b> is a 2 inch OD Course Acme Thread with 4 Turns to the inch or &#xbc; inch advancement per Revolution of the hand wheel. The 1 inch Drilling Rod runs thru the 2 inch Drive Rod. The hot tap tool <b>2000</b> has two stop subs. One on the outside of the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and another on the threads of the 2 inch Drive Rod. Prior to sending the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> down the Stop Subs on the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> will be preset to not allow the diver to drill more than 1/16 inch past the thickness of the pipe that will be drilled. The hot tap tool <b>2000</b> was designed to work in conjunction with the mandrel <b>2050</b> to where when the 20 inch Mandrel <b>2050</b> is used with the 30 inch stroke Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> the inch Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> can only drill out approximately 2 inch past the Seal Tip <b>2010</b>. This allows the diver to close up the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> almost completely prior to starting to do any drilling with same, making it easier on the diver.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">After testing. Bleed off the test pressure to Zero pounds per square inch, this allows the diver a better feel for what he is doing. Advance the bit in the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b>+/&#x2212;27&#xbd; inch until it hits the Teflon seal. The Teflon seal when installed on the seal tip <b>2010</b> had a &#xbe; inch opening. Because the Teflon seal was compressed against the pipe to make a seal it has been compressed or flared on the inside as well as the outside. Once the diver advances the drill bit as far as possible rotate the drill on the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> By hand to cut the Teflon away and advance the bit until the bit makes contact with the pipe. Sometimes the bit, because it is a flat tip, has trouble getting into the &#xbe; inch ID of the seal tip <b>2010</b> (the mandrel <b>2050</b> has a 1.30 inch ID). NOTE: It is easy to cut Teflon by hand, it is not as easy to drill metal and the diver can feel the difference. At this time the bit is against the Drive pipe <b>50</b>. Take the time to double check the Stop Subs by looking at them and verifying they are set for drilling only the thickness of the pipe, in this case 1 inch wall thickness Drive pipe <b>50</b>, + 1/16 inch only. Pressure up on the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and seals to 500 pounds per square inch. Send down a hand drill and make it up on the hydraulic hoses.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Drill thru the 20 inch&#xd7;1 inch Wall Drive Pipe <b>50</b> by drilling turning the bit <b>2110</b> with a hydraulic hand drill and advancing the bit <b>2110</b> with the wheel by hand. Keep track of the rounds turned on the wheel to verify the distance drilled. In this case 1 inch pipe will be 4 complete revolutions. Do not force the bit <b>2110</b>&#x2014;when the bit <b>2110</b> drills thru the pipe <b>50</b> the diver can feel it and there will be a fluctuation in pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Once the diver has drilled thru the pipe <b>50</b> stop drilling and check and record the pressure. Advance and retract the bit <b>2110</b> thru the hole to make sure it is completely cut out to a &#xbe; inch opening. Watch for metal shavings getting the bit <b>2110</b> in a bind. If that occurs it is often remedied by pumping water into the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> to flush or move the cuttings.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Once you are sure that the hole has been cut in the pipe <b>50</b> and there is a full &#xbe; inch opening. Secure the hand drill. Back out the bit <b>2110</b> until it clears the Ball Valve. If the casing is not static, close the Ball valve.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">If the Ball valve is closed, bleed off any remaining pressure on the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and hose.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Disconnect the Test Hose and secure same.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Open the needle valve on the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> to double verify there is no pressure left on it. Remove the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> and send same to surface.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">If the casing <b>50</b> drilled has pressure on it. Install the 1&#xbd; inch Kill Line and test as needed against the ball valve. Open the Ball valve. Deal with the pressure by pumping in or bleeding off as needed until the casing <b>50</b> is static. If there was no pressure on the casing the Ball valve was left open.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">With the Ball valve Open, remove the Flange Plate <b>500</b> by backing out the 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch nuts and send the Flange Plate <b>50</b> and Mandrel <b>2050</b> assembly to the surface. Once the mandrel <b>2050</b> assembly has been removed, measure the distance with the measuring probe thru the &#xbe; inch hole to the next casing string <b>60</b>. Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> has 20 inch, 30 inch and 40 inch measuring probes included in each box. Cement may need to be removed prior to being able to take this measurement. If needed send down a hand drill with a &#x215d; inch masonry bit.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Normally the next casing string <b>60</b> size is known. In this case we have a string of 10&#xbe; inch 45.5 #/ft J-55 casing. When taking the measurement it is never known for sure if you are on a collar or not.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Care should be taken here when getting these measurements and selecting the size of core bit <b>1400</b> to drill out of casing <b>50</b>. When drilling into any casing string a balance must be maintained between getting as big a hole as possible and not having the casing that is being drilled to fail or collapse. As a general rule the size of the hole being drilled should not exceed 50% of the casing <b>50</b> you are drilling. The Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> supervisor will be able to calculate that and look at the different size holes that can be drilled depending on outer casing size versus inner casing size and the distance between them. Calculate the maximum size hole that can be drilled without drilling into the next casing or tubing string. Prior to starting you also need to consider what size of hole you would like to have in the production casing. In this case the production casing is 7&#x215d; inch therefore the maximum hole size that can be drilled is +/&#x2212;4 inch (+/&#x2212;50% of 7&#x215d; inch), to be able to drill a 4 inch hole on the 7&#x215d; inch, you must drill at least a 4&#xbd; inch hole (&#xbd; inch bigger minimum) on the 10&#xbe; inch casing, which means we must have at least a 5 inch hole on the 20 inch. So 5 inch can be the minimum size you can start with on the 20 inch Drive pipe <b>50</b>. The Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> Saddle Clamp <b>100</b> has an 11&#xbd; inch Opening but the biggest hole recommended to start with is 10 inch.</p>

<p id="p-0196" num="0195">20 inch Drive pipe <b>50</b>&#xd7;10&#xbe; inch inner casing string (centered)=10 inch bit. The initial 10 inch bit <b>1400</b> will have been already installed on drill <b>1000</b>&#x2014;on all subsequent drilling events the diver will have to change out the bit <b>1400</b> to the proper size as needed. Rotate the DS into place in the front of clamp <b>100</b>, the bottom five bolts can be used for the DS. It has been our experience that only two 1&#x215d; inch nuts will be needed to hold the Articulating drill <b>1000</b> in place on the Clamp <b>100</b> while drilling therefore on the bottom of the Clamp <b>100</b> two 1&#x215d; inch&#xd7;8 inch long studs were installed for the Articulating drill <b>1000</b> on at the #5 and #7 positions. Tighten up the 2&#xd7;1&#x215d; inch nuts installing the Articulating drill <b>1000</b> into place on the Clamp <b>100</b>. Install 1 inch Hydraulic Hoses to the Drill <b>1000</b>. Advance the drill until the bit <b>1400</b> touches the drive pipe <b>50</b>. Start the drill <b>1000</b> and make sure it is turning properly.

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Remove the 10 inch coupon.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Remove the 10 inch bit <b>1400</b> and send to the top.</p>

During this test we know there is no cement in this annulus or a collar, but the 10&#xbe; inch casing will have to be cleaned off where we will be installing the seal tip <b>2010</b>. Send down tools as needed to clean off same.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">If there is a collar on the inner casing string <b>60</b>, a decision will have to be made to either move the Clamp <b>100</b> up or down to get away from it and starting over. Or, the Hot tap tool <b>2000</b> system has not only Center Flanges <b>500</b> but offset flanges <b>500</b>&#x2032; that allow movement of the Mandrel <b>2050</b> in a circle about inches in radius (up or down vertically from center), and to still be perpendicular to the inner casing string <b>60</b> for tapping purposes. Consideration should be given to whether this should be done on the basis of how many more inner strings will have to be dealt with and whether part of the collar can be cut out without sacrificing structural integrity of the pipe after it is tapped to gain access to the inner strings.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Next the diver needs to determine where the centerline of the inner casing string <b>60</b> lies in relation to the Clamp <b>100</b>. In order to get a seal&#x2014;the seal tip <b>2010</b> is preferably set on the centerline of the pipe <b>60</b> and the mandrel <b>2050</b> lined up perpendicular to pipe <b>60</b> attempting to be sealed against. One advantage of the method and apparatus is the flexibility allowed when lining up on the inner casing strings (<b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>80</b>). The hot tap tool <b>2000</b> swivel nut <b>800</b> is primarily used to allow the mandrel <b>2050</b> to be perpendicular to the inner casing string (<b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, or <b>80</b>) where there is a difference in angle from vertical between the Drive Pipe <b>50</b> and the inner casing strings (<b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, or <b>80</b>). This allows the new system some ability to get on Drive pipe <b>50</b> that is not only out of round but also still not vertical. The Offset Flange <b>500</b> with offset <b>552</b> allows the mandrel <b>2050</b> to be moved up and down as well as right and left (e.g., up to 4 inches). Extreme caution must be exercised when attempting to utilize the Swivel Nut <b>800</b> to make up for fact that the inner casing strings (<b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, or <b>80</b>) are more than 10 Degrees to the left or right of the centerline of the Clamp <b>100</b>. When the 1&#x215d; inch nuts are tightened against the flange <b>500</b> to effect a seal, they move the flange <b>500</b> in the direction of the centerline of the Clamp <b>100</b> (and not in the direction mandrel <b>2050</b> is pointed when mandrel <b>2050</b> is offset). If the centerline of any subsequent inner string (<b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, or <b>80</b>) is encountered where it is more than 10 Degrees to the left or right of the Clamp <b>100</b> centerline then the Clamp <b>100</b> is preferably rotated on drive pipe <b>50</b> to line up Clamp <b>100</b> with the inner strings (<b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, or <b>80</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Because casing <b>60</b> is found to be centered, 10&#xbe; inch casing <b>60</b> will be tapped to determine if it has pressure on the inside of same, utilizing the Center Flange <b>500</b> with the 20 inch Mandrel <b>2050</b> assembly. The diver will receive the Center Flange <b>500</b> with 20 inch mandrel <b>2050</b> with a 10&#xbe; inch tip <b>2010</b>. The diver will set the flange <b>500</b> on the 18 inch stud that is in the 12 O'clock position and remove the strap that holds it. The diver will slide the flange <b>500</b> forward on the 18 inch stud till the flange <b>500</b> is lined up on the 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch&#xd7;12 inch studs in the 2/4/8/10 positions. The diver will install 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch nuts on the 2/4/8/10 studs till the nuts are completely on the studs but no further. The 20 inch mandrel <b>2050</b> and tip <b>2010</b> will have a top dead center line run down the length of it. The diver will advance the 20 inch mandrel <b>2050</b> by rotating the swivel nut <b>800</b> until the Teflon on the tip <b>2010</b> is engaged against the 10&#xbe; inch pipe <b>60</b>. At that time the diver needs to verify that the Seal tip <b>2010</b> is on the centerline of the pipe and the mandrel <b>2050</b> is perpendicular to pipe <b>60</b> and that the line on the mandrel <b>2050</b> is on top (i.e., that the mandrel <b>2050</b> is lined up properly with the pipe <b>60</b>). In order to get a seal&#x2014;seal tip <b>2010</b> should be set on the centerline of the pipe <b>60</b> and the mandrel <b>2050</b> lined up perpendicular to the pipe <b>60</b> attempted to be sealed against. Once the mandrel <b>2050</b> is in the proper position, tighten the 4&#x2014;1&#x215d; inch nuts with a hammer wrench taking care to tighten a &#xbd; turn at a time when turning by hand then a &#xbc; turn at a time when using a hammer, going from 2 to 8 to 4 to 10 then back to 2. It is preferable that they are tightened evenly. This tightening compresses the Teflon seal against the pipe <b>60</b>. Once the mandrel <b>2050</b> is tightened against the pipe <b>60</b> stop and look at the entire set up and verify that everything looks proper (i.e., the line on the mandrel <b>2050</b> is still top center and the mandrel <b>2050</b> is perpendicular to the pipe <b>60</b> it is sealing against).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Test the Teflon seal on the 10&#xbe; inch casing <b>60</b> to 250 pounds per square inch low/1,500 pounds per square inch high for 5 minutes each test.

In this case 10&#xbe; inch 45.5 #/ft casing is 9.95 inch ID=0.4 inch thick. Please note: the drift=9.794 inch therefore the casing could be up to 9.95 inch-9.794 inch/2=2.5/64 inch extra thick therefore the 1/16 inch extra will make up for it.</p>
