<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to an improved binding element. The present invention also relates to a method for binding documents using an improved binding element.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There presently exists thermal binding products that include wraparound covers with adhesive in the spine. These covers may be made of a one or two piece wrap around paper, or paper/plastic combination. They have also been made by utilizing a stiff channel which can be metal in combination with paper or plastic covers that can be of a permanent or temporary nature. These products may be comprised of U-shaped channels of metal with an adhesive placed either directly onto the metal or placed on an absorbent material that has been attached to the metal. The problem of guiding pages that are inserted into such folders to avoid sheets being caught by a protruding lip has been addressed in the prior art with the use of end sheet liners, or the shaped application of an internal adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Desktop thermal binding machines and thermal binding covers have been developed and gained some acceptance in document binding over the past 30 years or so. The basic product is an empty soft cover or hard cover book that has a hot melt adhesive or resin in the spine. One picks a cover with the appropriate spine width and places the sheets to be bound inside. The cover is then placed spine down against a heated plate. After a minute or so the adhesive liquefies to a point where it can slightly wick into the sheets. The cover is removed, and placed in a rack to cool down, after which time one has a bound book. This bond is permanent and cannot be undone without tearing a page unless the cover is reinserted into a binding machine, reheated and carefully edited. This makes the report more suitable for legal documents and similar presentations where alterations would not be welcome.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The various thermal binding machines that form the bulk of the market operate in a temperature range from 250 F to over 375 F. The machines are basically hotplates with vertical holders and timers. Because high temperatures are involved, it is necessary to have at least one or both covers attached to the U-shaped spine or a complete wrap-around cover in order to place and remove the booklet from the binding machine. A disadvantage of this arrangement is that covers that already have hot melt adhesive inside cannot be run through printers for desktop customization and any other customization, like foil-stamping, requires additional handling. One solution to this problem has been to use a permanent glue to pre-attach temporary front and back covers to a U-shaped metal channel. A customized front and back cover can then be inserted and the temporary covers can be torn off after the binding process has been completed. Such covers require a wide variety of predetermined spine widths to accommodate the varying range of sheets to be bound. Also, this process is quite time consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, another object of the present invention is to provide a product and system that eliminate the need for temporary front and back covers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a product and system having permanent front and back covers can be readily printed or customized in standard formats. The following represent an additional list of objects of the present invention:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">(a) a new and simpler element for producing an effective binding;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">(b) a binding that is in the form of an extrusion or co-extrusion used to create the binding element;</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(c) an improved binding element that can be readily attached to sheets of paper and front and back covers for easy insertion into and removal from a thermal binding machine;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(d) an improved binding element and an associated method of using the binding element and in which there is eliminated the requirement for handles or attached cover sheets;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(e) a means to allow the binding elements to have a greater range of content or sheet number thus requiring fewer spines sizes to be inventoried;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">(f) a means for manufacturing of the binding element itself with extrusion or co-extrusion techniques.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reference is now made to the drawings and a number of different cross-sectional views that depict different embodiments of the present invention. In each of these embodiments there is provided a plastic extrusion or a co-extrusion that is used to provide a binding element. Although a preferred plastic is used in accordance with the present invention other materials can be employed for the basic binding element such as a metal material. Hereinafter there is a further discussion of preferred plastics. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is provided an extruded element <b>10</b> having a base <b>11</b> and integrally formed opposed legs <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the legs <b>12</b> preferably has inwardly directed ribs <b>14</b>, and at least one of such ribs. The extruded plastic element <b>10</b> is constructed so as to provide a bias of the legs <b>12</b> against the respective front and back covers of the sheets being bound. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the front cover C, the back cover B and the sheets S. Similar designations are used with respect to the other embodiments described in additional cross-sectional views.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the legs <b>12</b> hold the contents firmly while at the same time enabling a great range of content, thus requiring fewer spine sizes to be inventoried. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the normal rest position of the legs <b>12</b> would be a position in which they are closer together than that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> but can be spread in order to accommodate the sheets and front and back covers. In this regard one of the important aspects of the binding element disclosed herein is the angular direction of the legs <b>12</b> toward each other. This angular displacement, along with the preferred multiple ribs <b>14</b>, provides for a firm grasp of the sheets and covers regardless of the thickness of the overall sheet and cover thickness. In the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the very top of each leg <b>12</b>, in the rest position thereof, may be spaced apart half the distance illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. That spacing provides a firm bias of both legs in the direction of the sheets S. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates the thermal adhesive <b>16</b> that is disposed on the top of the base <b>11</b>. The adhesive layer may be provided as a unit or co-extrusion with the binding element itself There may also be provided an optional metal insert <b>18</b> that provides additional strength. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the metal insert <b>18</b> is shown basically only extending along the base <b>11</b> of the binding element. However, in other embodiments of the present invention (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) the insert may also extend upwardly at its ends into each leg <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Reference is now made to a second embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This also includes an extruded plastic element <b>20</b> having a base <b>21</b> and opposed legs <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, each of the legs <b>22</b> has a turned end <b>24</b> with extending retention teeth <b>25</b> on the surface that faces the sheets S. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates the thermal adhesive <b>26</b> that may be extruded with the base <b>21</b> or added by hot melt or separate glue strip or by an adhesive insert. As in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the legs <b>22</b> are biased inwardly and are used for holding the contents firmly while at the same time allowing the element to accommodate a wide range of thickness of the sheets and covers. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the leg <b>22</b> would not be as angularly disposed as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also has the turned end. Also the very free end of the leg <b>24</b> may be pointed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to provide further contact force with the sheets and covers. In the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the very top of each leg, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the rest position thereof, may be spaced apart half the distance illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for a third embodiment of the present invention in the form of a coextruded element <b>30</b>. This element may be a co-extrusion of a hard extruded plastic including the base <b>31</b> and a more spongy plastic material forming the legs <b>32</b>. Facing surfaces of the legs <b>32</b> are preferably provided with a gripping surface at <b>34</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also depicts the thermal adhesive <b>36</b> as well as the optional metal reinforcement insert <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Reference is now made to a fourth embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This embodiment also employs an extruded plastic element <b>40</b> with a coextruded crimpable metal liner <b>45</b>. The basic plastic element <b>40</b> includes a base <b>41</b> and opposed legs <b>42</b>. Each of the legs <b>42</b> terminates in a turned end <b>44</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the legs <b>42</b> in solid in an initial position and in dotted outline in a position wherein the legs have been inherently biased inwardly to be secured tightly against the covers C and B. The coextruded crimpable metal liner <b>45</b> preferably extends through the base <b>41</b> and up a substantial length of each of the legs <b>42</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. An unbiased position of the legs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> would also be one in which both legs <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are closer together than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference is now made to a fifth embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This embodiment is substantially the same as that previously described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> including an element <b>50</b> having a base <b>51</b> and opposed legs <b>52</b> with the illustrated ribs. In this embodiment, in addition to the thermal adhesive <b>56</b>, there is also provided a contact adhesive <b>57</b>. This arrangement enables a holding of the contents both initially for combining the contents into a unit and inserting and removing the unit from the thermal binding machine, and for permanently binding such unit. This embodiment also allows for a varied thickness of material to be bound as the legs can accommodate various thicknesses while at the same time imposing a biasing force against the covers B and C.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A sixth embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This includes an extruded plastic element <b>60</b>, which like embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, includes a base <b>61</b> and opposed legs <b>62</b>. In this particular embodiment the extruded plastic element has a profile that will accommodate a snap in or slide in element containing the thermal adhesive. This snap in member is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by the channel or strip <b>65</b> that supports the thermal adhesive layer <b>66</b>. Similarly, a simple thermal binding strip can be disposed in the channel <b>65</b> prior to binding. The opposed legs of the channel <b>65</b> are dimensioned for receipt within slots <b>67</b> in the extruded element <b>60</b>. The channel <b>65</b>, or like member, can be drawn (co-extruded with) with the extruded plastic to thus offer additional strength and/or malleability.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a seventh embodiment of the present invention. This illustrates sheets S that are to be bound and also a chipboard cover C and a clipboard cover B. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> there is also illustrated the flexible extrusion <b>70</b> having a base <b>71</b> and opposed leg pairs <b>72</b>. Each of these pairs <b>72</b> defines a channel <b>73</b>. Inside of each of the channels on the respective legs of the pair are facing retention teeth <b>74</b>. The extrusion <b>70</b> is flexible permitting the side channels to bend and the bottom spine <b>71</b> to curve when the covers are open. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also illustrates the hot melt adhesive material <b>76</b>. This material may be coextruded with the basic extrusion or applied in an additional step.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the pair of leg members and base together defines a retention area in which the bundle of sheets is held. The pair of leg members is constructed and arranged with each formed by a set of inner and outer legs that are disposed substantially in parallel defining a channel <b>73</b> therebetween for receiving respective opposed covers B, C. The inner legs each have at least one inwardly directed rib <b>77</b> arranged for contact with respective sides of the bundle of sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with other aspects of the present invention the pair of legs of a leg member <b>72</b> have inner facing surfaces that define the channel <b>73</b> with at least one of the inner facing surfaces having a set of engagement teeth <b>74</b> for holding a cover, wherein both facing surfaces of a set of legs have engagement teeth. A thermal adhesive layer is disposed on the base and upon which the bundle of sheets rests. The adhesive layer may be disposed between the leg members and also within each channel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thermal adhesive can be applied during a co-extrusion process or subsequent to the extrusion. Such thermal adhesive may be multilayered or applied in a distributive fashion so as to provide both an intermediate adhesion and a long term thermally activated adhesion. The desired flexibility or firmness may be accomplished by simply varying the thickness of the thermal adhesive material or by combining two or more formulations during the coextrusion process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. These figures are substantially the same as respective <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> which are cross-sectional views. Accordingly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> the same reference numbers are used as previously identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In the previously pending application, the types of materials that may be employed were not discussed in detail. The binding element may be constructed of metal, plastic and including such materials as nylon or composite materials. Also, previously the process was explained as constructing the elements by extrusion or co-extrusion. Alternatively, the process used may include stamping, injection molding and other types of processes to produce the binding element.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sheets S identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, as well as in previous figures may be bound together with an adhesive or may be stapled. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> in particular show the use of staples. This includes a staple <b>19</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and a staple <b>27</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the longitudinal barbed ribs <b>14</b> catch against the staple <b>19</b> and in that way keep the contents from slipping out. Similarly, in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the retention teeth <b>25</b> lock against the staple or staples <b>27</b> keeping the sheets in place.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The product of the present invention is considered as an improvement both to any form of slide binder and to the thermal binding spine or cover. To make the product suitable for use in thermal binding machines the binding profile should be extruded from a high temperate plastic, a composite or formed from spring steel. It is anticipated that a hot melt adhesive would be coextruded or added at the time the product is formed. Acetal plastics, and other engineered plastics can withstand temperatures up to 600 F while retaining their resilience. This makes it possible to have a slide on binder clip with hot melt adhesive that works in existing thermal binding equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Although engineered plastics are more expensive and more difficult to extrude than PVC the advantage is that it accommodates a higher temperature adhesive which will hold its bond even when a report is left in the back window of a car on a sunny hot day. See the suggested engineered plastics set forth below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although a preferred form uses a high temperature plastic for the binding element, an alternative embodiment may use the same triangular profiles but made out of PVC using a coextruded adhesive that works at a lower temperature. This would require thermal binding machines that operate at a lower temperature at about 200 F. Alternatively, insulating adapters could be offered for existing machines to bring them down to that temperature. These would be designed to lower the surface temperature of the heating plates so that the PVC would not deform and or lose its gripping power. Such adapters can be in the form of insulating adaptors that can be placed over the heating plates of a thermal binding machine in order to reduce the surface temperature. For many of the thermal binding machines that are on the market, one can simply lay the adapter strip on top of the heating plate because the opening throat of the machine is wide enough to easily drop the strip and position it on the plate. For many other machines they have spring loaded clamps that hold the covers vertically in place. With those machines, one has to spread the clamps apart in order to get the strip in place. The adapter can include opposed Teflon layers with an insulating material disposed therebetween. The Teflon layer may comprise fiberglass coated with Teflon.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Engineering plastics are a group of plastic materials that exhibit superior mechanical and thermal properties in a wide range of conditions over and above more commonly used commodity plastics. The term usually refers to thermoplastic materials rather than thermosetting ones. Engineering plastics are used for parts rather than containers and packaging.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of processing a binding element for retaining sheets, comprising the steps of: providing a binding element that includes a base, and a pair of opposed position legs that are integrally formed with and extend from respective sides of the base. The pair of legs and base together define a retention area in which the bundle of sheets is held, said pair of legs constructed and arranged with a resilient bias toward each other, but separable to enable the bundle of sheets to be held therebetween under a biasing force. The method includes providing a thermal adhesive layer disposed on the base and upon which the bundle of sheets rests, and constructing the binding element of an engineered plastic that can withstand temperatures in a range of at least 400 F to 600 F without deforming or weakening the binding element. Finally is the step of transferring the binding element to a thermal binding machine to subject the binding element to temperatures in a range of 250 F to 375 F in order to adhere the binding element and sheets. The method may also include providing the binding element and adhesive as a co-extrusion.</p>
