<p id="p-0005" num="0004">(b) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, CO<sub>2 </sub>gas welding is a semi-automatic or automatic arc welding process in which a continuous and consumable wire electrode and a shielding gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) are fed for insulating a welding portion from air.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Particularly, when a welding gun does not reach a welding portion due to a complicated vehicle body structure and so on, the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas welding process may be applied, and an automatic welding process with a robot also applies the CO<sub>2 </sub>gas welding.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a drawing showing a conventional CO<sub>2 </sub>gas welding apparatus. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in general CO2 gas welding process, a welding torch <b>105</b> is mounted to an arm <b>103</b> of a robot <b>101</b>, and a welding wire <b>109</b> is supplied to the welding torch <b>105</b> from a wire drum <b>107</b> through a supplying line <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The welding torch <b>105</b> is connected to a CO<sub>2 </sub>gas tank <b>111</b> through a gas line <b>113</b>, and CO<sub>2 </sub>gas is supplied to the welding torch <b>105</b> then discharged to the welding portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The welding torch <b>105</b> is connected to a CO<sub>2 </sub>gas welding machine <b>110</b> to be supplied welding electric power.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the CO2 gas welding process, welding quality is influenced by a matching state of the welding wire <b>109</b> and the welding portion, wire supplying speed, appropriate current and voltage adjusting, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">During the CO2 gas welding, if the welding wire <b>109</b> within the wire drum <b>107</b> is completely used and the welding process is continued without preparation of complete exhaustion of the welding wire <b>109</b>, productivity may be deteriorated due to having to restart the welding process, and faulty products may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Due to the problem, even if a large capacity wire drum for the welding wire <b>109</b> is used, in the mega-factory the welding wire replacement process is a burden.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Particularly, in the conventional art, when the welding wire <b>109</b> within the wire drum <b>107</b> is almost exhausted, residual welding wire <b>109</b> is replaced by a new welding wire <b>109</b> and the residual welding wire <b>109</b> is discarded to prevent the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, replacement of the old welding wire <b>109</b> may increase unnecessary consumption of welding wire and welding cost.</p>
