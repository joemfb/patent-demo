<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to the field of cable path identification and more specifically to identifying a cable path using light emitting diodes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A network may include a myriad of cables. In some instances, a first end of a cable may become disconnected from its destination device. A user may not be able to readily determine the location (and the point of connection) of the second end of the cable. For example, the cable path may go through a wall, ceiling, or floor, or the cable may be bundled with other cables such that it is very difficult to trace the path of the particular cable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In accordance with the present invention, disadvantages and problems associated with previous techniques for identification of a cable path using light emitting diodes may be reduced or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, a system for identification of a cable path may include a cable set operable to transmit data. The cable set may comprise power delivery wires designed to transmit electrical power. The cable set may also comprise two adapters proximate respective ends of the cable set, where the first adapter is operable to be coupled to a signal generator operable to transmit electrical power across the power delivery wires. In some embodiments, the cable set may further comprise a circuit coupled to the power delivery wires of the cable set. The circuit may be operable to receive electrical power from the signal generator and allow at least a portion of the electrical power to continue across the power delivery wires. The cable set may further comprise an indicator coupled to the circuit and operable to emit light when electrical power from the circuit is received at the indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain embodiments of the invention may provide one or more technical advantages. A technical advantage of one embodiment may be that a cable may have indicators that emit light along the cable path. This may allow a user to trace a cable path without the help of another user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain embodiments of the invention may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an example of a system <b>100</b> for identification of a cable path using light emitting diodes. In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include a cable set <b>104</b> operable to transmit data. In some embodiments, the cable set <b>104</b> may comprise at least one pair of power delivery wires designed to transmit electrical power. The cable set <b>104</b> may also comprise a first adapter <b>108</b> proximate a first end of the cable set, where the first adapter is operable to be coupled to a signal generator <b>112</b>. The signal generator <b>112</b> may be operable to transmit electrical power across the power delivery wires. The cable set may comprise a second adapter <b>116</b> proximate a second end of the cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the cable set <b>104</b> may further comprise a circuit <b>120</b> coupled to the power delivery wires of the cable set. The circuit may be operable to receive electrical power from the signal generator <b>112</b> and allow at least a portion of the electrical power to continue across the power delivery wires. The cable set <b>104</b> may further comprise an indicator <b>124</b> coupled to the circuit <b>120</b> and operable to emit light when electrical power from the circuit is received at the indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, a user <b>132</b> may encounter a cable set (such as <b>148</b>) with a loose (e.g., unplugged) end <b>140</b> in a room <b>180</b>. The user <b>132</b> may not be able to readily identify the cable path of the cable set <b>148</b>. For example, the cable path may go through a wall, ceiling, or floor, the cable set may be bundled with other cables, or the cable path may end in another room <b>184</b>. In such situations, it may be extremely difficult to trace the path of the cable set. Such situations may hinder or prevent a user <b>132</b> from discovering the location of the other end <b>144</b> of the cable set <b>148</b>. This may be problematic, since it is generally desirable to know what one end of a cable is connected to before connecting the other end. In some situations, the cable path may not be identifiable without help from another user <b>136</b>. For example, if a portion of the cable path is not visible, a user <b>132</b> may have to tug on the cable set <b>148</b> while another user <b>136</b> attempts to identify which cable set is being displaced by user <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the embodiment depicted, system <b>100</b> includes a cable set <b>104</b> that includes one or more indicators <b>124</b>. An indicator <b>124</b> may be any device capable of converting electrical power into light and/or sound. In some embodiments, an indicator <b>124</b> may be a light emitting diode (LED), a light bulb, a buzzer, or other suitable light or noise source. In some embodiments, the indicators <b>124</b> of a cable set <b>104</b> may be operable to illuminate the cable path of the cable set when power from a signal generator <b>112</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A cable set <b>104</b> may comprise one or more cables <b>128</b> operable to transmit data and power. For example, cable <b>128</b> may be an Ethernet cable (such as Category 3, 5, 5E, 6, or 7), a telephone cable, a Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable, or other suitable cable. In some embodiments, a cable set may comprise a plurality of cables connected in series. In some embodiments, the cable set comprises a first adapter <b>108</b> that may be coupled to a signal generator <b>112</b>. The signal generator may be operable to transmit power through the cable set <b>104</b> (e.g., through wires of the cable set) to the indicators <b>124</b> of the cable set <b>104</b>. The indicators <b>124</b> are operable to emit light and/or sound when the power is received. The light and/or sound emitted by the indicators may allow a user <b>132</b> to easily trace the cable path and/or identify the other end of the cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the cable set <b>104</b> of system <b>100</b> may allow a user <b>132</b> to identify a cable path without help from another user <b>136</b>. For example, a user <b>132</b> may plug adapter <b>108</b> into signal generator <b>112</b>, set the signal generator down, and identify the cable path by viewing the lights (or listening to sound) from the indicators <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example of a cable <b>128</b>, adapter <b>116</b>, indicator <b>124</b>, and circuit <b>120</b> that may be used in system <b>100</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the circuit <b>120</b> and indicator <b>124</b> are shown adjacent to the adapter <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the circuit <b>120</b> and/or indicator <b>124</b> may be placed at any suitable location along the length of cable <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the embodiment depicted, the wires of cable <b>128</b> may be coupled to contacts (such as <b>122</b>) of circuit <b>120</b>. As shown, cable <b>128</b> may comprise at least one pair of power delivery wires (coupled to contacts <b>122</b>) designed to transmit electrical power. For example, in some embodiments, the power delivery wires may have been previously assigned by a standards making organization, such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), to carry electrical power. As an example, in some embodiments, cable <b>128</b> may comprise an Ethernet cable that conforms to a Power over Ethernet standard. A Power over Ethernet standard specifies standards for transmitting data and power in an Ethernet chord. For example, the IEEE 802.3af and IEEE 802.3at standards are Power over Ethernet standards. In the embodiment depicted, the cable <b>128</b> conforms to the IEEE 802.3af (mode B) standard. Under this standard, wires <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> (coupled to the contacts labeled &#x201c;DC+&#x201d; and &#x201c;DC&#x2212;&#x201d;) are assigned to carry electrical power. In other embodiments, a pair of wires used to transmit data may also be used to transmit power. For example, in IEEE 802.3af (mode A), wires <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>6</b> are assigned to carry both electrical power and data signals. In some embodiments, a data signal may be superimposed on a direct current (DC) power signal and transmitted across cable <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, cable set <b>104</b> may comprise one or more adapters <b>108</b> proximate one or more ends of a cable <b>128</b>. An adapter <b>116</b> may be any suitable apparatus operable to couple one or more wires of a cable <b>128</b> to another apparatus. For example, in some embodiments, adapter <b>116</b> may be operable to couple the wires of cable <b>128</b> to another adapter, a signal generator <b>112</b>, and/or the wires of another cable <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, an adapter <b>116</b> may be an Ethernet adapter (such as a Registered Jack 45 (RJ45) or similar connector), a telephone wire adapter, a USB adapter, or other suitable adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, an indicator <b>124</b> may be coupled to circuit <b>120</b> and may be operable to emit light and/or sound when electrical power from the circuit is received at the indicator. In some embodiments, indicator <b>124</b> may comprise a light emitting diode (LED) or other suitable device operable to convert electrical power to light. In some embodiments, any suitable color of light may be emitted by the indicator. For example, the indicator may emit white, blue, red, or other color of light. In some embodiments, the shape of the indicator may be any suitable shape. In some embodiments, the indicator <b>124</b> may be operable to emit light and/or sound in response to receiving DC and/or Alternating Current (AC) electrical power. In some embodiments, the indicator <b>124</b> may emit light and/or sound intermittently when the electrical power is received.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, one or more circuits <b>120</b> may be coupled to the power delivery wires of the cable set <b>104</b>. In the embodiment depicted, circuit <b>120</b> is coupled to each wire of cable <b>128</b> through contacts (such as <b>122</b>). In some embodiments, circuit <b>120</b> may be coupled to a subset of the wires of cable <b>128</b>. Circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to receive electrical power from the signal generator <b>112</b> and allow at least a portion of the electrical power to continue across the power delivery wires. For example, a portion of the current produced by signal generator <b>112</b> may be diverted from the power delivery wires and/or dissipated by circuit <b>120</b> while the remaining current is allowed to flow across the power delivery wires. In some embodiments, the circuit <b>120</b> may pass a portion of the electrical power received to indicator <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the circuit <b>120</b> may limit the amount of electrical power passed to the indicator <b>124</b>. For example, the circuit <b>120</b> may include a current limiting device, such as resistor <b>160</b>, in order to protect the indicator <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the indicator <b>124</b> may include a current limiting device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to perform various functions using logic <b>164</b>. For example, in some embodiments, circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to distinguish between a power signal received from signal generator <b>112</b> and a power signal received from a power supply device that transmits power according to a predetermined power supply standard. A power supply standard may specify a voltage, current, and/or other characteristic of power. As an example, IEEE 802.3af specifies a voltage range of 37.0-47.0 V for power received at a powered device. In some embodiments, circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to sense a voltage level, current level, and/or other characteristic of the power signal to determine whether it conforms to a power supply standard or is from signal generator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, if the cable set <b>104</b> is coupled between two devices that exchange power conforming to a power supply standard, such as a Power over Ethernet standard, it may be desirable to disconnect an indicator <b>124</b> from the power signal in order to preserve power for the powered device and/or protect the indicators <b>124</b> from excessive current. In some embodiments, the circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to prevent all or a portion of the electrical power received at the circuit from reaching the indicator <b>124</b>. For example, the circuit may cut off the electrical power to the indicator <b>124</b> if the power conforms to a predetermined power supply standard, such as a Power over Ethernet standard.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As another example, circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to filter one or more signals received from the signal generator <b>112</b>. For example, the circuit <b>120</b> may receive a data signal on a pair of wires that is designed to carry data and power. In order to avoid power loss or other undesirable effects, the circuit <b>120</b> may filter the data signal so that only the power signal is passed to the indicator <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As another example, circuit <b>120</b> may be operable to detect which pair(s) of wires are being used to transmit a power signal and use these pairs to receive the power signal and transfer power to the indicator <b>124</b>. For example, the circuit <b>120</b> may check a pair of wires for a DC voltage within a given range before transmitting the power received from the pair of wires to the indicator <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an example of a signal generator <b>112</b> and various cables <b>158</b>, <b>162</b>, <b>166</b>, and <b>170</b> that may be used in the system. In some embodiments, a signal generator <b>112</b> may have a port <b>156</b> that is operable to be coupled to an adapter <b>108</b> of the cable set <b>104</b>. A port <b>156</b> may comprise any suitable apparatus for coupling one or more wires of a cable <b>128</b> to the signal generator <b>112</b>. For example, a port may comprise a female Ethernet adapter or other suitable adapter.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the signal generator <b>112</b> may also comprise a power supply that is operable to supply electrical power to a cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the power supply may provide DC and/or AC power to one or more pairs of wires of cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the power supply may comprise one or more batteries, such as alkaline, lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, or other suitable batteries. In other embodiments, the power supply may comprise a transformer and/or rectifier to convert power from an electrical outlet to a form suitable for transmission through the cable set <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, signal generator <b>112</b> may comprise various inputs and/or indicators. In some embodiments, signal generator <b>112</b> may comprise switch <b>168</b> that controls whether electrical power is transmitted through cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, signal generator <b>112</b> may comprise an interval control <b>174</b> that controls the length of a repeating interval over which electrical power is transmitted through cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the maximum interval setting may result in constant power transmission through the cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, signal generator <b>112</b> may comprise one or more indicators <b>172</b> that emit light. For example, in an embodiment, indicator <b>172</b> may glow when switch <b>168</b> is activated. In other embodiments, indicator <b>172</b> may glow when the signal generator <b>112</b> senses that a cable set <b>104</b> has been connected to the signal generator and/or electrical power is being transmitted through the cable set.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the signal generator <b>112</b> may be a hand-held device. In some embodiments, the signal generator <b>112</b> may be a computing device, such as a laptop, operable to control transmission of electrical power through the cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the computing device may include software that allows a user <b>132</b> to control characteristics of the transmitted electrical power, such as when and/or how electrical power is transmitted through the cable set <b>104</b>. For example, the software may allow a user <b>132</b> to set the voltage, maximum current, and/or other characteristics of the power signal transmitted through cable set <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the software may allow a user <b>132</b> to enable and disable the transmission of the power. In some embodiments, the software may allow a user to specify a repeatable interval over which power is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, a cable set <b>104</b> may comprise cables with various adapter configurations. In some embodiments, a cable of a cable set <b>104</b> may comprise one or more male adapters <b>152</b> and/or one or more female adapters <b>154</b>. For example, cables <b>158</b> and <b>170</b> have two male adapters each, and cable <b>166</b> has one male adapter. As another example, cable <b>162</b> has two female adapters and cable <b>166</b> has one female adapter. In some embodiments, a male adapter <b>152</b> may be operable to be coupled to a female adapter of a signal generator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, zero, one, or more of the adapters of a cable may be coupled to an indicator <b>124</b>. For example, both adapters of cables <b>158</b> and <b>162</b> are coupled to indicators <b>124</b>, but neither adapter of cable <b>170</b> is coupled to an indicator. In some embodiments, a cable <b>166</b> may be attached to a cable <b>170</b> and/or another cable that does not include an indicator <b>124</b>. Such embodiments may enable the tracing of the cable path of a cable set <b>104</b> that includes one or more cables that do not include indicators <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments, an adapter of a cable set <b>192</b> may be coupled to a networking device <b>188</b>. A networking device may be any device operable to mediate data in a computer network. For example, a networking device may comprise a gateway, router, bridge, switch, hub, repeater, or other suitable device. In general, networking devices are not designed to pass electrical power between two cable sets connected through the networking device (rather they are designed to transmit data between the cable sets). In some embodiments, a networking device is operable to allow electrical power from a signal generator <b>112</b> to pass from one cable set <b>192</b> connected to the networking device <b>188</b> to another cable set <b>196</b> also connected to the networking device. In some embodiments, the networking device <b>188</b> may be operable to distinguish between electrical power received from signal generator <b>112</b> and electrical power that conforms to a power supply standard, such as a Power over Ethernet standard. The networking device <b>188</b> may be operable to allow power received from a signal generator <b>112</b> to pass from one cable set <b>192</b> to another cable set <b>196</b>, but prevent the transfer if the power conforms to the power supply standard.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts an example of a method for identifying a cable path using light emitting diodes. The method begins at step <b>404</b>. At step <b>408</b>, a user <b>132</b> locates an unattached end of a cable set <b>104</b>. A user attaches adapter <b>108</b> at the loose end of the cable set to a signal generator <b>112</b> at step <b>412</b>. At step <b>416</b>, the user configures the signal generator <b>112</b> to transmit electrical power through the cable set <b>104</b>. For example, the user may configure a hand-held signal generator to transmit the electrical power or the user may configure the software of a computing device to transmit the electrical power. At step <b>420</b>, the user identifies the cable path by viewing the light emitted from the indicators <b>124</b> of the cable set. The method ends at step <b>424</b>.</p>
