<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to surgical robot systems and, more particularly, to an improved system, apparatus, and method for sensing forces applied to a surgical instrument.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In robotically-assisted surgery, the surgeon typically operates a master controller to control the motion of surgical instruments at the surgical site from a location that may be remote from the patient (e.g., across the operating room, in a different room or a completely different building from the patient). The master controller usually includes one or more hand input devices, such as handheld wrist gimbals, joysticks, exoskeletal gloves, handpieces, or the like, which are operatively coupled to the surgical instruments through a controller with servo motors for articulating the instruments' position and orientation at the surgical site. The servo motors are typically part of an electromechanical device or surgical manipulator arm (&#x201c;the slave&#x201d;) that includes a plurality of joints, linkages, etc., that are connected together to support and control the surgical instruments that have been introduced directly into an open surgical site or through trocar sleeves (cannulas) inserted through incisions into a body cavity, such as the patient's abdomen. There are available a variety of surgical instruments, such as tissue graspers, needle drivers, electrosurgical cautery probes, etc., to perform various functions for the surgeon, e.g., retracting tissue, holding or driving a needle, suturing, grasping a blood vessel, dissecting, cauterizing, coagulating tissue, etc. A surgeon may employ a large number of different surgical instruments/tools during a procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This new surgical method through remote manipulation has created many new challenges. One such challenge is providing the surgeon with the ability to accurately &#x201c;feel&#x201d; the tissue that is being manipulated by the surgical instrument via the robotic manipulator. The surgeon must rely on visual indications of the forces applied by the instruments or sutures. It is desirable to sense the forces and torques applied to the tip of the instrument, such as an end effector (e.g., jaws, grasper, blades, etc.) of robotic minimally invasive surgical instruments, in order to feed the forces and torques back to the surgeon user through the system hand controls or by other means, such as visual display, vibrations, or audible tone. One device for this purpose from the laboratory of G. Hirzinger at DLR Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics is described in &#x201c;Review of Fixtures for Low-Invasiveness Surgery&#x201d; by F. Cepolina and R. C. Michelini, <i>Int'l Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery</i>, Vol. 1, Issue 1, page 58, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. However, that design disadvantageously places a force sensor distal to (or outboard of) the wrist joints, thus requiring wires or optic fibers to be routed through the flexing wrist joint and also requiring the yaw and grip axes to be on separate pivot axes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem has been fitting and positioning the necessary wires, rods, or tubes for mechanical actuation of end effectors in as small a space as possible because relatively small instruments are typically desirable for performing surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">What is needed, therefore, are improved telerobotic systems and methods for remotely controlling surgical instruments at a surgical site on a patient. In particular, these systems and methods should be configured to provide accurate feedback of forces and torques to the surgeon to improve user awareness and control of the instruments.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an apparatus, system, and method for improving force and torque feedback to and sensing by a surgeon performing a robotic surgery. In one embodiment, a force sensor includes a tube portion that includes a plurality of radial ribs and a strain gauge positioned over each of the plurality of radial ribs. A proximal part of the tube portion is coupled to a shaft of a surgical instrument that may be operably coupled to a manipulator arm of a robotic surgical system. A distal part of the tube portion is coupled to a wrist joint coupled to an end effector. The couplings may be direct or indirect with an intermediate mechanical component between the coupled parts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Groups of strain gauges are positioned on or near a distal end of an instrument shaft proximal to (i.e., inboard of) a moveable wrist of a robotic surgical instrument via an apparatus that senses forces and torques at the distal tip of the instrument without errors due to changes in the configuration of the tip (such as with a moveable wrist) or steady state temperature variations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, the present invention improves the sensing and feedback of forces and/or torques to the surgeon and substantially eliminates the problem of passing delicate wires, or optic fibers through the flexible wrist joint of the instrument. A force sensor apparatus may be manufactured, tested, and calibrated as a separate modular component and brought together with other components in the conventional instrument assembly process. The force sensor apparatus may also be manufactured as an integrated part of the instrument. In addition, it is possible to choose a material for the sensor structural member different from the material of the instrument shaft whose design considerations may compromise the mechanical properties required for the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The scope of the invention is defined by the claims, which are incorporated into this section by reference. A more complete understanding of embodiments of the present invention will be afforded to those skilled in the art, as well as a realization of additional advantages thereof, by a consideration of the following detailed description of one or more embodiments.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures. It should also be appreciated that the figures may not be necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention provides a multi-component system, apparatus, and method for sensing forces applied to tissue while performing robotically-assisted surgical procedures on a patient, particularly including open surgical procedures, neurosurgical procedures, and minimally invasive procedures, such as laparoscopy, arthroscopy, thoracoscopy, and the like. The apparatus and method of the present invention are particularly useful as part of a telerobotic surgical system that allows the surgeon to manipulate the surgical instruments through a servomechanism from a remote location from the patient. To that end, the manipulator apparatus or slave of the present invention will usually be driven by a kinematically-equivalent master having six or more degrees of freedom (e.g., 3 degrees of freedom for position and 3 degrees of freedom for orientation) to form a telepresence system with force reflection or other scalar force magnitude display. A description of a suitable slave-master system can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,355, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals indicate like elements, a robotic surgical system <b>10</b> is illustrated according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref>, robotic system <b>10</b> generally includes one or more surgical manipulator assemblies <b>51</b> mounted to or near an operating table O and a master control assembly located at a surgeon's console <b>90</b> for allowing the surgeon S to view the surgical site and to control the manipulator assemblies <b>51</b>. The system <b>10</b> will also include one or more viewing scope assemblies and a plurality of surgical instrument assemblies <b>54</b> adapted for being removably coupled to the manipulator assemblies <b>51</b> (discussed in more detail below). Robotic system <b>10</b> includes at least two manipulator assemblies <b>51</b> and preferably at least three manipulator assemblies <b>51</b>. The exact number of manipulator assemblies <b>51</b> will depend on the surgical procedure and the space constraints within the operating room among other factors. As discussed in detail below, one of the assemblies <b>51</b> will typically operate a viewing scope assembly (e.g., in endoscopic procedures) for viewing the surgical site, while the other manipulator assemblies <b>51</b> operate surgical instruments <b>54</b> for performing various procedures on the patient P.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The control assembly may be located at a surgeon's console <b>90</b> which is usually located in the same room as operating table O so that the surgeon may speak to his/her assistant(s) and directly monitor the operating procedure. However, it should be understood that the surgeon S can be located in a different room or a completely different building from the patient P. The master control assembly generally includes a support, a monitor for displaying an image of the surgical site to the surgeon S, and one or more master(s) for controlling manipulator assemblies <b>51</b>. Master(s) may include a variety of input devices, such as hand-held wrist gimbals, joysticks, gloves, trigger-guns, hand-operated controllers, voice recognition devices, or the like. Preferably, master(s) will be provided with the same degrees of freedom as the associated surgical instrument assemblies <b>54</b> to provide the surgeon with telepresence, the perception that the surgeon is immediately adjacent to and immersed in the surgical site, and intuitiveness, the perception that the master(s) are integral with the instruments <b>54</b> so that the surgeon has a strong sense of directly and intuitively controlling instruments <b>54</b> as if they are part of or held in his/her hands. Position, force, and tactile feedback sensors (not shown) may also be employed on instrument assemblies <b>54</b> to transmit position, force, and tactile sensations from the surgical instrument back to the surgeon's hands, ears, or eyes as he/she operates the telerobotic system. One suitable system and method for providing telepresence to the operator is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,574,355, which has previously been incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The monitor <b>94</b> will be suitably coupled to the viewing scope assembly such that an image of the surgical site is provided adjacent the surgeon's hands on surgeon console. Preferably, monitor <b>94</b> will display an image on a display that is oriented so that the surgeon feels that he or she is actually looking directly down onto the operating site. To that end, an image of the surgical instruments <b>54</b> appears to be located substantially where the operator's hands are located even though the observation points (i.e., the endoscope or viewing camera) may not be from the point of view of the image. In addition, the real-time image is preferably transformed into a stereo image such that the operator can manipulate the end effector and the hand control as if viewing the workspace in substantially true presence. By true presence, it is meant that the presentation of an image is a true stereo image simulating the viewpoint of an operator that is physically manipulating the surgical instruments <b>54</b>. Thus, a controller (not shown) transforms the coordinates of the surgical instruments <b>54</b> to a perceived position so that the stereo image is the image that one would see if the camera or endoscope were located directly behind the surgical instruments <b>54</b>. A suitable coordinate transformation system for providing this virtual image is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,973, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A servo control is provided for transferring the mechanical motion of masters to manipulator assemblies <b>51</b>. The servo control may be separate from, or integral with, manipulator assemblies <b>51</b>. The servo control will usually provide force and torque feedback from the surgical instruments <b>54</b> to the hand-operated masters. In addition, the servo control may include a safety monitoring controller (not shown) to safely halt system operation, or at least inhibit all robot motion, in response to recognized undesirable conditions (e.g., exertion of excessive force on the patient, mismatched encoder readings, etc.). The servo control preferably has a servo bandwidth with a 3 dB cut off frequency of at least 10 Hz so that the system can quickly and accurately respond to the rapid hand motions used by the surgeon and yet to filter out undesirable surgeon hand tremors. To operate effectively with this system, manipulator assemblies <b>51</b> have a relatively low inertia, and the drive motors have relatively low ratio gear or pulley couplings. Any suitable conventional or specialized servo control may be used in the practice of the present invention, with those incorporating force and torque feedback being particularly preferred for telepresence operation of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a perspective view is shown of a surgical instrument <b>54</b> including a force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> operably coupled to a distal end of a rigid shaft <b>110</b> and proximal to a wrist joint <b>121</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. An end portion <b>120</b>, such as a surgical end effector, is coupled to force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> via the wrist joint <b>121</b>. A housing <b>150</b> is operably coupled to a proximal end of the rigid shaft <b>110</b> and includes an interface <b>152</b> which mechanically and electrically couples instrument <b>54</b> to the manipulator <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> and <b>2</b>, an improved apparatus, system, and method for sensing and feedback of forces and/or torques to the surgeon will be described in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a perspective view of force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> including in one embodiment a tube <b>102</b> including a number (e.g., 3, 4, 6, or 8) of strain gauges <b>104</b> (e.g., <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>) mounted to a surface of tube <b>102</b> and oriented axially (parallel to the lengthwise axis z of the tube). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> operably coupled to a shaft <b>110</b> and end portion <b>120</b> of a surgical instrument in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows a cross-section view of force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> including a cover or sleeve <b>113</b> over tube <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> is a separately manufacturable module or part adapted for incorporation as part of the shaft <b>110</b> of surgical instrument <b>54</b> at a prescribed distance from the tip where there may be an articulated wrist with specialized jaws, cutting devices, or other end portion <b>120</b>. In one example, tube <b>102</b> may be made of a sufficiently strong material and may be spool shaped, including end portions <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>with a depressed portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>therebetween that is smaller in diameter than end portions <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>. Strain gauges <b>104</b> may be mounted on the surface of depressed portion <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Proximal tube portion <b>102</b><i>c </i>operably couples to the shaft <b>110</b> of surgical instrument <b>54</b> and distal tube portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>operably couples to a wrist joint <b>121</b>. In one example, the diameter of the completed force sensor apparatus matches the diameter of the instrument shaft, thus allowing the entire assembly of the instrument (including the coupled force sensor apparatus) to pass through a cannula or a seal without added friction or snagging.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> includes a through passage <b>109</b> for end portion actuation cables or rods. End features <b>108</b> of end portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>insure secure mounting and angular alignment to the main instrument shaft and wrist/jaw/other end portion sub-assembly of the instrument. Wire leads or optic fibers <b>116</b> (e.g., shielded twisted pairs, coax, or fiber) from the strain gauges <b>104</b> may be inlaid into grooves <b>112</b> in proximal tube portion <b>102</b><i>c </i>of tube <b>102</b> and matching grooves in the shaft <b>110</b> of the surgical instrument <b>54</b>. The wire leads or optic fibers <b>116</b> may then be embedded in an adhesive bonding or potting compound such as epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, cover <b>113</b> is positioned over and encapsulates the mounted strain gauges <b>104</b> and other circuit elements on the surface of the tube <b>102</b>, thereby providing mechanical protection of the sensors. In one example, cover <b>113</b> is a mechanically protective woven sleeve potted on depressed portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>and is comprised of a woven resin impregnated fiberglass or metal braid electrical shielding.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/537,241, filed Sep. 29, 2006, the contents of which have been previously incorporated by reference, strain gauges <b>104</b> may be spaced in a ring at intervals around the circumference of the tube <b>102</b> (e.g., 3 gauges at 120 degrees, 4 gauges at 90 degrees, or <b>4</b> gauges at 70 degrees and 110 degrees). The signals from the sensors are combined arithmetically in various sums and differences to obtain measures of three perpendicular forces (e.g., F<sub>X</sub>, F<sub>y</sub>, and F<sub>z</sub>) exerted upon the instrument tip and the torques about the two axes perpendicular to the shaft axis (i.e., axes x and y). In accordance with the present invention, the measurement of the forces is made independent of the orientation and effective lever arm length of an articulated wrist mechanism at the distal end of the instrument when two axially separated sets or rings of gauges are utilized. Forces exerted against end portion <b>120</b> are detected by the force sensing elements via an interrogator, which may be operably coupled to the servo control or to a processor for notifying the surgeon of these forces (e.g., via master(s) or a display). It is understood that by adding a second ring of similarly oriented gauges (e.g., two sets of 3 gauges or two sets of 4 gauges) at a different axial position on the tube, additional applied torque information (e.g., T<sub>x </sub>and T<sub>y</sub>) may be obtained, and dependence of the force data on instrument wrist length, orientation, and resulting jaw distance may be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, various strain gauges may be used, including but not limited to conventional foil type resistance gauges, semiconductor gauges, optic fiber type gauges using Bragg grating or Fabry-Perot technology, or others, such as strain sensing surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Optic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) gauges may be advantageous in that two sensing elements may be located along one fiber at a known separation, thereby only requiring the provision of four fibers along the instrument shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Both fiber technologies require an interrogator unit that decodes the optically encoded strain information into electrical signals compatible with the computer control hardware or display means of the robotic surgical system. A processor may then be used to calculate forces according to the signals from the strain gauges/sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, there may be co-mounted unstrained gauges or Poisson strained gauges oriented in the circumferential direction adjacent to each axial gauge and incorporated in the bridge completion circuits to eliminate temperature effects. The strain gauge bridge circuits are completed in a manner to give the best signal for bending loads due to the lateral forces (F<sub>x </sub>and F<sub>y</sub>) exerted on the instrument tip jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For resistive foil or semiconductor strain gauges, active components such as bare die op-amps and passive components such as secondary resistors or capacitors may be attached adjacent to the strain gauges connected by bond wires or thick film circuit traces in the manner of hybrid circuits to amplify, filter, and/or modulate the gauge output signals to reject noise sources. Such components are not needed for fiber optic gauges.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Surgical instrument <b>54</b> to which force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> couples may include a circumferentially coiled insulated flex circuit style service loop of parallel conductive traces at the proximal end of the instrument shaft <b>110</b> permitting the substantially free rotation of the instrument shaft while conducting the input gauge excitation power and output gauge signals to stationary housing <b>150</b> of the instrument <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Housing <b>150</b> operably interfaces with a robotic manipulator arm <b>51</b>, in one embodiment via a sterile adaptor interface <b>152</b>. Applicable housings, sterile adaptor interfaces, and manipulator arms are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/314,040 filed on Dec. 20, 2005, and U.S. application Ser. No. 11/613,800 filed on Dec. 20, 2006, the full disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Examples of applicable shafts, end portions, housings, sterile adaptors, and manipulator arms are manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a preferred configuration, end portion <b>120</b> has a range of motion that includes pitch and yaw motion about the x- and y-axes and rotation about the z-axis (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). These motions as well as actuation of an end effector are provided via cables and/or rods running through shaft <b>110</b> and into housing <b>150</b> that transfer motion from the manipulator arm <b>51</b>. Embodiments of drive assemblies, arms, forearm assemblies, adaptors, and other applicable parts are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,331,181, 6,491,701, and 6,770,081, the full disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is noted that various surgical instruments may be improved in accordance with the present invention, including but not limited to tools with and without end effectors, such as jaws, scissors, graspers, needle holders, micro-dissectors, staple appliers, tackers, suction irrigation tools, clip appliers, cutting blades, irrigators, catheters, and suction orifices. Alternatively, the surgical instrument may comprise an electrosurgical probe for ablating, resecting, cutting or coagulating tissue. Such surgical instruments are available from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For the methods and apparatus mentioned above, it may be advantageous to use a calibration process in which combinations of forces and torques are applied to the instrument tip serially, simultaneously, or in combinations while correction factors and offsets are determined. The correction factors and offsets may then be applied to the theoretical equations for combining the gauge outputs to obtain F<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub>, F<sub>z</sub>, T<sub>x</sub>, and T<sub>y</sub>. Such a calibration process may be done either by directly calculating the correction factors and offsets or by a learning system such as a neural network embedded in the calibration fixture or in the instrument itself. In any calibration method, the calibration data may be programmed into an integrated circuit embedded in the instrument so that the surgical system using the individual instrument can correctly identify and apply its correction factors and offsets while the instrument is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Advantageously, force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention is adaptable to the size and shape constraints of various robotic surgical instruments and is suitable for a variety of instruments. Accordingly, end portions <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>may be formed into various applicable shapes and sizes. Furthermore, force sensor apparatus <b>100</b> may be manufactured, tested, and calibrated as a separate modular component and brought together with other components in the conventional instrument assembly process. Also, the sensor may be a slip-on module with suitable electrical contacts that mate with contacts on the instrument shaft permitting a higher value sensor to be used with lower cost instruments of limited cycle life. In addition, the sensor structural member <b>102</b> may be comprised of an advantageous material, which may be a different material than the instrument shaft <b>110</b> whose design considerations may compromise the properties required for the sensor.</p>

Inner tube <b>218</b> includes a proximal raised end portion <b>218</b><i>b </i>and a depressed portion <b>218</b><i>a </i>smaller in diameter than raised end portion <b>218</b><i>b</i>.

In one example, outer tube <b>214</b> of force sensor apparatus <b>200</b> is a concentric tubular structural member made of sufficiently strong materials that can encapsulate the strain gauges and other electronics within an annular gap between the inner and outer tubes <b>218</b> and <b>214</b>. In one embodiment, the concentric tubes are joined rigidly at the proximal end adjacent proximal portion <b>218</b><i>b </i>while a narrow annular gap between the distal ends near a distal portion is filled with an elastomeric material <b>215</b> that prevents the high and varying axial forces of the wrist and jaw actuator cable or rods from being transmitted through the inner tube carrying the strain gauges. It is noted that the partially isolated tube carrying the gauges may be either the outer or the inner tube. The non-isolated tube of the pair may carry the entire axial cable load. Preferably, the gauges may be placed on the interior tube to isolate the gauges from the environment. In such an embodiment, the outer tube <b>214</b> carries the axial cable forces and also permits the outer tube to provide mechanical protection and potentially act as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding to the gauges <b>204</b> on the inner tube <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> highlights elastomeric material <b>215</b> between the inner tube <b>218</b> and outer tube <b>214</b> of the force sensor apparatus <b>200</b>, and wires or optic fibers <b>216</b> operably coupled to gauges <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of the force sensor apparatus <b>200</b> operably coupled proximal to a wrist joint <b>221</b> of a surgical instrument in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Leads <b>216</b> (e.g., shielded twisted pairs, coax, or optic fiber) from the strain gauges <b>204</b> may be inlaid into grooves <b>212</b> in proximal tube portion <b>218</b><i>b </i>of tube <b>218</b> and matching grooves in the shaft <b>210</b> of a surgical instrument. The leads <b>216</b> may then be embedded in an adhesive potting compound such as an epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one example, if an outer sensor carrying tube is mounted stationary at the rear mechanism housing, the wire routing may be simplified by not requiring a rotating joint service loop.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Advantageously, the relative shear and compressive properties of elastomers enable this design concept. A suitable elastomer <b>215</b> with a low shear modulus permits the relative compression and extension of the cable load carrying tube with respect to the sensor carrying tube (which is connected rigidly at only one end of the tubes as mentioned above). Thus, cable loads and load changes do not affect the sensors. On the other hand, an elastomer confined between two relatively rigid surfaces where the gap between the surfaces is small compared to the extent of the surfaces behaves as a nearly incompressible rigid connection in the direction normal to the confining surfaces, in this case the radial direction of the combined annular tube structure. This causes bending moments carried in the axially loaded tube to be transmitted to and shared by the sensor tube. Thus, the sensor tube can advantageously detect the bending moments due to lateral loads on the instrument wrist and jaws without significant interference or &#x201c;noise&#x201d; from the higher varying axial cable loads carried by the other tube. Advantageously, the decoupling of the load carrying members in an endoscopic surgical instrument force sensor enables the separation of undesired jaw actuator tendon forces from desired lateral jaw load induced bending moments on the force sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Alternatively, the desired effect of axially de-constraining the sensor carrying tube from the cable load carrying tube at one end may be obtained by inserting an annular ring of a more rigid low friction material in the annular gap between the unconnected ends of the tubes machined for a very close fit, thereby permitting the relative axial motion but transmitting the lateral motion associated with bending moments due to the lateral tip forces. Another alternative is to make the tubes with a very close fit and apply a low friction coating to one or both surfaces at the distal end. However, these alternatives may create a small deadband in sensor response depending on how close a fit may be reliably obtained. The expansion thermal coefficients of the inner and outer tubes must also be matched or the required close fit may bind when heated or cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should also be understood that the same decoupling effect achieved with concentric tubes as described above may potentially be achieved with alternating axial finger-like members half (or some number) of which carry the axial cable loads while the alternating (or remaining) ones carry the bending loads. Again, these members may be rigidly connected at the proximal end while they are decoupled in the axial direction at the distal end.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> includes a generally annular tube <b>306</b> operably coupled to a distal end of rigid shaft <b>310</b> and proximal to wrist joint <b>321</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, tube <b>306</b> includes a number of rectangular-shaped apertures <b>301</b> cut from tube <b>306</b> and a plurality of radial ribs <b>302</b> forming through passages <b>308</b> for passage of actuation cables, wires, tubes, rods, and/or flushing fluids. Ribs <b>302</b> run along and radiate from the z-axis centerline of tube <b>306</b>, and a number (e.g., 3, 4, 6, or 8) of strain gauges <b>304</b> are oriented parallel to the lengthwise z-axis of the tube and mounted to an outer rib surface <b>302</b><i>a</i>. The strain gauges may be inlaid into grooves or a depressed area <b>317</b> on the outer rib surface <b>302</b><i>a </i>in one example.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> includes two sets of four apertures <b>301</b> cut from the wall of tube <b>306</b> at separate axial locations along tube <b>306</b>. Each of the ribs <b>302</b> are separated by 90 degrees measured about the z-axis centerline of tube <b>306</b>, which forms a cruciform cross-sectional view of the ribs <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref>. Ribs <b>302</b> form four through passages <b>308</b> for passage of actuation cables, wires, tubes, and/or rods. Furthermore, ribs <b>302</b> may extend along the entire length of tube <b>306</b> thereby forming internal through passages along the entire length of tube <b>306</b>, or ribs <b>302</b> may extend along a portion(s) of the length of tube <b>306</b>, thereby forming internal through passages along a portion or portions of the length of tube <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> is capable of sensing bending moments applied to its distal end due to lateral forces applied to the wrist joint or its specialized end portion. Advantageously, apertures <b>301</b> and ribs <b>302</b> provide for regions of controlled stress and strain when subjected to bending moments, which may be measured by fiber optic strain gauges <b>304</b> embedded in grooves along an outer surface of the ribs and sensor body parallel to the lengthwise z-axis of tube <b>306</b>. Through passages <b>308</b> permit cables, wires, tubes, or rigid tendons to pass through the sensor apparatus body to actuate the distal wrist joint(s) and/or control the end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one example, tube <b>306</b> and ribs <b>302</b> may be made of a sufficiently strong but elastic material to allow sensing of stress and strain without mechanical failure. Tube <b>306</b> and ribs <b>302</b> are further comprised of material with a sufficiently low modulus of elasticity to give a sufficient strain signal under an applied load, a sufficiently high strain at yield to give adequate safety margin above the maximum design load, and a sufficiently high thermal diffusivity to promote rapid thermal equilibrium (therefore reducing thermal disturbances to sensor output signals) when subject to localized or asymmetric thermal disturbances from tissue contact or endoscope illumination. In particular, the plurality of radial ribs <b>302</b> may be comprised of a high thermal diffusivity material, such as an aluminum alloy (e.g., 6061-T6 aluminum) or a copper alloy (e.g., GlidCop&#xae; AL-60) to reduce the temperature difference between opposing gauges under transient thermal disturbances while providing a direct thermal pathway between opposing gauges.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one example, tube <b>306</b> may be comprised of metal alloys, treated metals, or plated metals, such as of aluminum, copper, or silver, which allow for adequate strain, mechanical failure safety margin, and high thermal diffusivity. In a further example, 6061-T6 aluminum, which is an aluminum alloy that is heat treated and aged, GlidCop&#xae; AL-60, which is copper that is dispersion strengthened with ultrafine particles of aluminum oxide, or a dispersion strengthened silver, may be used to form tube <b>306</b> and ribs <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Advantageously, the present invention allows for a low bending moment of inertia to increase a strain signal to noise signal ratio consistent with a materials choice and rib design meeting the need for high thermal diffusivity and a direct thermal path between opposing strain gauges while also providing passage for actuation cables, wires, tubes, and/or rods.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Wire leads or optic fibers <b>316</b> (e.g., shielded twisted pairs, coax, or fiber) coupled to the strain gauges <b>304</b> may be inlaid into grooves <b>317</b> on tube <b>306</b>, the outer rib surface <b>302</b><i>a</i>, and matching grooves <b>319</b> in shaft <b>310</b> of the surgical instrument. The wire leads or optic fibers <b>316</b> may then be embedded in an adhesive potting compound such as epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/537,241, filed Sep. 29, 2006, the contents of which have been previously incorporated by reference, strain gauges <b>304</b> may be spaced in a ring at intervals around the circumference of the tube <b>306</b> mounted on ribs <b>302</b> (e.g., 3 gauges at 120 degrees, 4 gauges at 90 degrees, or <b>4</b> gauges at 70 and 110 degrees). The signals from the sensors are combined arithmetically in various sums and differences to obtain measures of three perpendicular forces (e.g., F<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub>, and F<sub>z</sub>) exerted upon the instrument tip and the torques about the two axes perpendicular to the shaft axis (i.e., axes x and y). In accordance with the present invention, the measurement of the forces is made independent of the orientation and effective lever arm length of an articulated wrist mechanism at the distal end of the instrument as well as wrist friction moments and actuator cable tensions when two axially separated sets or rings of gauges are utilized. Forces exerted against end portion <b>320</b> are detected by the force sensing elements, which may be operably coupled to the servo control or surgeon display means via an interrogator <b>334</b> or to a processor <b>340</b> for notifying the surgeon of these forces (e.g., via master(s) or a display means). It is understood that by adding a second ring of similarly oriented gauges (e.g., two sets of 3 gauges or two sets of 4 gauges) at a different position along the z-axis of the tube, additional applied torque information (e.g., T<sub>x </sub>and T<sub>y</sub>) can be obtained, and dependence of the force data on instrument wrist length, orientation, and resulting jaw distance and cable tensions, can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one example, various strain gauges may be used, including but not limited to conventional foil type resistance gauges, semiconductor gauges, optic fiber type gauges using Bragg grating or Fabry-Perot technology, or others, such as strain sensing surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. Optic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) gauges may be advantageous in that two sensing elements may be located along one fiber at a known separation, thereby only requiring the provision of four fibers along the instrument shaft. Fiber optic gauges may also be desirable because of their resistance to disturbance from cautery and other electromagnetic noise.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Both fiber technologies require an interrogator unit, such as interrogator unit <b>334</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>) that decodes the optically encoded strain information into electrical signals compatible with the computer control hardware of the robotic surgical system. A processor <b>340</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>) operably coupled to the interrogator unit <b>334</b> may then be used to calculate forces according to the signals from the strain gauges/sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">For resistive foil or semiconductor strain gauges, active components such as bare die op-amps and passive components such as secondary resistors or capacitors may be attached adjacent to the strain gauges connected by bond wires or thick film circuit traces in the manner of hybrid circuits to amplify, filter, and/or modulate the gauge output signals to reject noise sources. Such components are not needed for fiber optic gauges.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> is a separately manufactured module or part adapted for incorporation as part of the shaft <b>310</b> of a laparoscopic surgical instrument at a prescribed distance from the tip where there may be an articulated wrist with specialized jaws, cutting devices, or other end portion <b>320</b>. A proximal portion of tube <b>306</b> operably couples to the shaft <b>310</b> of the surgical instrument and a distal portion of tube <b>306</b> operably couples to wrist joint <b>321</b>. In one example, the diameter of the completed force sensor apparatus matches the diameter of the instrument shaft, thus allowing the entire assembly of the instrument (including the coupled force sensor apparatus) to pass through a cannula or a seal without added friction or snagging. In other embodiments, the surgical instrument may be manufactured with a force sensor portion integrated as a part of shaft <b>310</b> (i.e., force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> is not separable from the shaft).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Similar to the embodiments described above, the surgical instrument to which force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> couples may also include a service loop <b>330</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>) of conductive traces or optic fibers at the proximal end of the instrument shaft <b>310</b> and a cable swivel mechanism <b>332</b> permitting the substantially free rotation of the instrument shaft while conducting the input gauge excitation power or light and electrical or optical output gauge signals to the interrogator unit <b>334</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similar to the embodiments described above, the housing <b>150</b> operably interfaces with a robotic manipulator arm, in one embodiment via a sterile adaptor interface.

Such surgical instruments are manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For the sensing methods and apparatus mentioned above, it may be advantageous to use a calibration process in which combinations of forces and torques are applied to the instrument tip serially, simultaneously, or in combinations while correction factors and offsets are determined to apply to the theoretical equations for combining the gauge outputs to obtain F<sub>x</sub>, F<sub>y</sub>, F<sub>z</sub>, T<sub>x</sub>, and T<sub>y</sub>. This calibration may be done either by directly calculating the correction factors and offsets or by a learning system such as a neural network embedded in the calibration fixture or in the instrument itself. In any calibration method, the calibration data may be programmed into an integrated circuit embedded in the instrument so that the surgical system using the individual instrument can correctly identify and apply its correction factors and offsets while the instrument is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Advantageously, force sensor apparatus <b>300</b> of the present invention is adaptable to the size and shape constraints of robotic endoscopic surgical instruments and is suitable for a variety of instruments.

Furthermore, the combined stiffness of tube <b>706</b> and ribs <b>702</b> still allow for a strong strain signal to noise signal ratio consistent with a materials choice and rib design meeting the need for high thermal diffusivity and a thermal path between opposing strain gauges while also providing passage for actuation cables, wires, tubes, rods, and/or fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Similar to the embodiments disclosed above, a number of strain gauges <b>704</b> are oriented parallel to the lengthwise z-axis of the tube and mounted to an outer rib surface <b>702</b><i>a</i>. The strain gauges may be inlaid into grooves or a depressed area <b>717</b> on the outer rib surface <b>702</b><i>a </i>in one example. Wire leads or optic fibers <b>716</b> (e.g., shielded twisted pairs, coax, or fiber) coupled to the strain gauges <b>704</b> may be inlaid into grooves <b>717</b> on tube <b>706</b>, the outer rib surface <b>702</b><i>a</i>, and matching grooves <b>717</b> in a shaft of the surgical instrument. The wire leads or optic fibers <b>716</b> may then be embedded in an adhesive potting compound such as epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Embodiments described above illustrate but do not limit the invention. It should also be understood that numerous modifications and variations are possible in accordance with the principles of the present invention. For example, the number of strain gauges and their configuration may vary but must allow for applicable force and torque determinations and noise rejection. Similarly, the number of ribs and angle between ribs may vary from those described above. Furthermore, the embodiments of force sensor apparatus described above may be integrated with a surgical instrument upon manufacture as a non-separable part of the shaft. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is defined only by the following claims.</p>
