<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to ghrelin analogues and, in particular, to ghrelin analogues having a specific affinity for ghrelin receptors such as, human growth hormone secretagogue receptors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Human Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR), a member of the G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR) family, was identified in 1996 as a 7 transmembrane domain 366 amino-acid protein that is responsible for the regulation of the growth hormone (GH) secretion. This receptor is mainly expressed in the hypothalamus, pituitary cells, and a number of peripheral tissues. Expression of the GHSR has been reported in various types of tumors, including breast carcinomas, prostate cancer cell lines, ovarian tumors, testicular tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and intestinal carcinoids. The presence of high affinity and specific binding sites on GHSR in the neoplastic cells which are absent in the corresponding normal tissues has been demonstrated in at least 3 different human breast carcinoma cell lines and pancreatic endocrine tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ghrelin, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, was discovered in 1999 by Kojima et. al. and is the natural ligand for the GHSR. Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide hormone in which serine-3 residue is n-octanoylated. This hormone plays an important role in the stimulation of GH secretion through binding with GHSR along with some other functions including appetite regulation. Ghrelin binds to the GHSR with high affinity and specificity, resulting in a ghrelin-GHSR complex that is internalized.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Analogues of ghrelin have now been developed which exhibit specific receptor-binding activity for diagnostic and therapeutic use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in one aspect of the invention, a receptor-binding ghrelin analogue is provided, wherein said analogue is modified to incorporate a functional entity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect of the invention, a method of detecting a disease in a mammal is provided comprising the steps of:

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Receptor-binding ghrelin analogues are provided which are modified to incorporate a functional entity.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">The term &#x201c;ghrelin&#x201d; is used herein to refer to mammalian ghrelin, a peptide hormone, including human ghrelin as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, having the amino acid sequence, GSS(n-octanoyl)FLSPEHQRVQQRKESKKPPAKLQPR (SEQ ID No. 1), as well as other forms of ghrelin, for example, from other mammalian species.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">The term &#x201c;receptor-binding&#x201d; refers to the ability of a ghrelin analogue to bind to a target receptor including, but not limited to, GHSR, and particularly to receptors or receptor sites which are prevalent in a disease state such as specific GHSR binding sites in cancer cells.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">The term &#x201c;analogue&#x201d; refers to ghrelin which is altered from its native form. A ghrelin analogue may, thus, incorporate alterations in structure including side chain modifications, terminal modifications, truncation and amino acid substitutions, for example by conservative amino acid replacement such as substitution of glutamic acid with aspartic acid, or substitution of lysine with arginine, by non-conservative amino acid replacements, or by amino acid replacements with un-naturally occurring amino acids (e.g. D-lysine, D-aspartic acid, D-glutamic acid, diaminopropanoic acid, diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, allylglycine, aminoadipic acid, homocysteine, or related molecules) that do not adversely affect the receptor-binding activity of the analogue. Preferably, alterations to the analogue function to increase in vivo stability and penetration to permit the analogue to reach target binding sites. Furthermore, alterations will preferably improve or retain strong affinity for ghrelin receptor binding sites. For example, substituting the glutamic acid at position-8 of native ghrelin with arginine or lysine increases the potency of GHSR stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">The analogues of the invention comprise a peptide-derived entity based on the chemical structure of the 28-amino acid peptide ghrelin. The amino acid sequence of the analogue is selected to facilitate affinity for ghrelin binding sites. Truncation of the C-terminal section of ghrelin is preferred in order to minimize the size of the entity. In order to maintain receptor-binding activity, ghrelin analogues according to the invention comprise at least amino acids at positions 1-5 of the native ghrelin peptide hormone (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and may additionally comprise one or more amino acids from positions 6 to 28. Preferably, ghrelin analogues according to the invention comprise at least amino acids at positions 1-7 of ghrelin, and more preferably at least amino acids at positions 1-10 of ghrelin.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">The present ghrelin analogues may additionally be modified at the amino acid side chain groups. Such modifications may include modifications which increase stability, or otherwise confer on the analogue a desirable property. In one embodiment, the ghrelin analogues include a modification at the amino acid at position 3 which is an n-octanoyl-substituted serine residue in native ghrelin. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, modifications at position 3 include those that do not adversely affect the receptor binding activity of the analogue, and thus, include modifications which retain the properties of the native n-octanoyl substituent, including suitable lipophilicity and neutrality, at least to the extent required to retain sufficient receptor binding. In this regard, suitable modifications may include replacement of the n-octanoyl substituent with aliphatic chains e.g. comprising from about 4 to about 16 carbon atoms; aromatic entities e.g. phenyl, biphenyl, napthyl, or substituted derivatives thereof. In addition, the ester bond linking the n-octanoyl group to the peptide (which may readily undergo hydrolysis) may be replaced with a more stable linkage such as an amide linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">The present ghrelin analogues incorporate a functional entity. The term &#x201c;functional entity&#x201d; is used herein to refer to any entity suitable for attachment to the ghrelin analogues that imparts on the analogue a particular function, including but not limited to, an imaging agent or other detectable label, a therapeutic agent, or any other entity that may require delivery to a ghrelin receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">For example, the ghrelin analogue may incorporate an imaging agent to render the analogue useful in any one of various imaging modalities, including but not limited to, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), optical, and ultrasound (US). For SPECT, a gamma emitting radionuclide, including but not limited to <sup>67</sup>Ga, <sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>123</sup>I or <sup>123</sup>I may be used. For PET, a positron emitting radionuclide, including but not limited to <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>44</sup>Sc, <sup>64</sup>Cu, <sup>68</sup>Ga, or <sup>94m</sup>Tc may be used. For MRI, a Gd or other lanthanide may be used. For CT, an iron oxide, or other contrast enhancing unit may be used. For optical imaging, a fluorescent dye such as fluorescein, bromeosin, rhodamine, coumarin, cyanine, or derivatives thereof, including near-infrared dyes. For US, the ghrelin analogue may facilitate delivery of micro-bubbles. In addition, the targeting ability of the ghrelin analogue may be incorporated into a nanoparticle, either polymer-based or as a biological macromolecule, for example viral, to facilitate tumour targeting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">As one of skill in the art will appreciate, well-established methods may be utilized to incorporate the functional entity into the selected ghrelin analogue. The method(s) utilized may vary with the functional entity to be incorporated. The functional entity may be connected to the ghrelin analogue by a direct or indirect bond, via a linker such as an aliphatic chain, or in the case of a metal, through a chelation or organometallic complex.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">The functional entity may be situated at any convenient location on the ghrelin analogue, including but not limited to the C-terminus or on a side-chain of an amino acid within the analogue. In a preferred embodiment, the functional entity is attached to the analogue at the amino acid residue at position 3 of the analogue, the position of the octanoylated serine in the native ghrelin peptide. In this regard, the n-octanoyl group may be modified or replaced as previously described to serve as a suitable site of attachment for the functional entity. To retain receptor affinity, this side-chain may contain from about 2 to about 16 methylene units between the functional group of the side-chain, e.g. the alcohol, thiol or amine functional group of the side-chain, and the location of the functional entity to be attached. This side-chain may also contain other atoms besides carbon, for example ethylene glycol units. Similarly, the functional entity may be situated at other locations within the peptide, for example, linked to another side-chain functional group. In this regard, the functional entity may be linked to a naturally occurring amino acid native to the ghrelin protein (e.g. lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine) or linked to an unnaturally occurring amino acid (e.g. D-lysine, D-aspartic acid, D-glutamic acid, diaminopropanoic acid, diaminobutyric acid, ornithine, allylglycine, aminoadipic acid, homocysteine, or related molecules) that replaces an amino acid native to ghrelin.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Ghrelin analogues according to the invention are useful in a method of detecting a disease state in a mammal. The term &#x201c;mammal&#x201d; is used herein to refer to both human and non-human mammals. The method comprises the step of administering a detectable labelled receptor-binding ghrelin analogue to the mammal. The analogue is capable of specifically binding to a receptor, such as GHSR, that is useful in the diagnosis of disease, for example, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, disorders of the nervous system (central and peripheral), gastro-intestinal disease, hematological disease, inflammation, and respiratory disease. Administered ghrelin analogue is detected and measured by measuring the amount of retained detectably label, e.g. imaging agent, within the mammal. The detection of an abnormal amount of retained or bound analogue, either abnormally high amounts or abnormally low amounts in comparison to normal amounts that are retained in healthy mammals (i.e. control amounts), is indicative of correspondingly abnormal amounts of ghrelin receptor, which is indicative of disease.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">As one of skill in the art will appreciate, a method of detecting disease may also be conducted in vitro. In this case, a suitable biological sample is obtained from a mammal to be diagnosed. Suitable biological samples may include, for example, non-invasively obtained samples such as blood, urine and saliva, as well as invasively obtained samples such as tissue samples obtained by biopsy. The biological sample may also include cells, cultured cell lines, transfected cell lines or commercially available cell lines. Once obtained, a detectably labelled receptor-binding ghrelin analogue is combined with the sample (or a purified or otherwise processed version of the sample, if required) under conditions suitable to permit analogue binding to the target receptor. The sample may then be imaged to detect bound analogue which may then be quantified as described, and a diagnosis made based on a finding of abnormal levels of receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">For use in a therapeutic method according to another aspect of the invention, the present ghrelin analogues may incorporate a therapeutic agent as the functional entity for targeted delivery to a ghrelin-binding receptor site associated with a disease state. Examples of therapeutic agents that may be attached to a ghrelin analogue for delivery to a receptor binding site include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, anti-angiogenic agents, antibiotics, antidiabetics, antifungals, antimicrobials, antimitotics, antimycobacterials, antineoplastics, antiparasitics, antivirals, chemokines, cytokines, cytotoxic agents, hormonal therapeutics, nucleoside analogues, or prodrugs thereof. The therapeutic agent may also be a particle emitting radionuclide, including a beta-emitting radionuclide such as <sup>90</sup>Y, or <sup>186</sup>Re; a beta/gamma emitting radionuclide such as <sup>47</sup>Sc, <sup>153</sup>Sm, <sup>177</sup>Lu, or <sup>188</sup>Re; or alpha-emitting radionuclides such as <sup>213</sup>Bi, <sup>223</sup>Ra, or <sup>225</sup>Ac. The therapeutic agent may alternatively be a non-radioactive metal such as rhenium, indium, and the like, which may be used for therapeutic intervention or as a chemical standard for biological evaluations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">The ghrelin analogue modified to incorporate a selected therapeutic agent is administered to a mammal in the treatment of a target disease, e.g. a ghrelin receptor-related condition. In this regard, the ghrelin analogue may be administered to the mammal by any suitable route of administration, including for example, oral, parenteral, by injection, intravenous, by inhalation, topical, and any other suitable administrable routes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">The ghrelin analogue modified to incorporate a therapeutic agent may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the analogue and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant. The expression &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; means acceptable for use in the pharmaceutical and veterinary arts, i.e. not being unacceptably toxic or otherwise unsuitable. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants are those used conventionally with peptide-based drugs, such as diluents, excipients and the like. Reference may be made to &#x201c;Remington's: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy&#x201d;, 21st Ed., Lippincott Williams &#x26; Wilkins, 2005, for guidance on drug formulations generally. The selection of adjuvant depends on the intended mode of administration of the composition. In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds are formulated for administration by infusion, or by injection either subcutaneously or intravenously, and are accordingly utilized as aqueous solutions in sterile and pyrogen-free form and optionally buffered or made isotonic. Thus, the compounds may be administered in distilled water or, more desirably, in saline, phosphate-buffered saline or 5% dextrose solution. Compositions for oral administration via tablet, capsule or suspension are prepared using adjuvants including sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and derivatives thereof, including sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose and cellulose acetates; powdered tragancanth; malt; gelatin; talc; stearic acids; magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oils, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, olive oil and corn oil; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerine, sorbital, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; agar; alginic acids; water; isotonic saline and phosphate buffer solutions. Wetting agents, lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, stabilizers, tableting agents, anti-oxidants, preservatives, colouring agents and flavouring agents may also be present. Creams, lotions and ointments may be prepared for topical application using an appropriate base such as a triglyceride base. Such creams, lotions and ointments may also contain a surface active agent. Aerosol formulations, for example, for nasal delivery, may also be prepared in which suitable propellant adjuvants are used. Other adjuvants may also be added to the composition regardless of how it is to be administered, for example, anti-microbial agents may be added to the composition to prevent microbial growth over prolonged storage periods.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">In accordance with the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a ghrelin analogue-containing therapeutic agent is administered to a mammal in the treatment of disease. The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; is an amount of the therapeutic agent indicated for treatment of a target disease while not exceeding an amount which may cause significant adverse effects. Appropriate dosages, thus, will vary on many factors including the nature of the target disease and selected therapeutic agaent to used in the treatment protocol. Appropriate dosages for use can readily be determined by one of skill in the art.</p>

The functional entity may be any entity suitable for attachment to the analogue to impart onto the analogue a selected utility, including but not limited, an imaging agent or other detectable label, a therapeutic agent and the like. The kit may also include one or more reagents to facilitate the attachment of the selected functional entity to the ghrelin analogue. The kit may optionally include instructions to facilitate the linkage of the functional entity to the ghrelin analogue.

<p id="p-0041" num="0042">Fully-protected resin-bound peptides were synthesized according to the general procedures in Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis either manually or automated using an APEX 396 peptide synthesizer. Fmoc protected rink amide MBHA resin (loading 0.27 or 0.47 meq/g) was used as the solid support. N-Fmoc amino acids, with strong acid labile protecting groups for side-chain functional groups, were used in general, and N-Boc amino acid was used for the N terminus. Fmoc-diaminopropanoic acid (Dpr), with the &#x3b2;-amine protected with methyltrityl (Mtt), was used for residue-3. Fmoc removal was achieved with treatments of 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 10 and 20 minutes and successive washes using DMF and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>after each treatment. For each amino acid coupling, resin was treated once or twice with 3 eq. of Fmoc or Boc amino acids, 3 eq. of 3-[bis(dimethylamino)methyliumyl]-3H-benzotriazol-1-oxidehexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and 6 eq. of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in 2 mL of DMF for 30 minutes to 4 hours.

When necessary, cleaving a small sample of resin beads (micro-cleave) was performed to obtain a small quantity of representative peptide, for which HPLC and MS analyses were conducted. After all modifications were done, the peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by TFA containing the scavengers water (5% v/v), phenol (5% m/v), TIS (2% v/v) for 2-4 hours. Resin was filtered and rinsed with a small amount of TFA. Peptide was precipitated from the TFA solution using tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME), and collected after centrifugation and decanting. Peptide was then rinsed using TBME and collected again. The resulting solid was redissolved in water with additional CH<sub>3</sub>CN when necessary, frozen, and lyophilized to obtain crude peptide as a fine powder.

Results and Discussion
<br/>
Fluorine Bearing Ghrelin Analogues
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0085">The peptides were assembled following standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) methods on a polystyrene-based insoluble support, Rink amide 4-methylbenzhydrylamine (MBHA) resin, which provided an amide C-terminus upon cleavage. The Ser-3 of human ghrelin was replaced with Dpr, protected by the weak acid labile methyltrityl (Mtt), to provide an amide linkage in this position upon further modification. The fully-protected resin-bound ghrelin(1-5) 12 and ghrelin(1-14) 13 prior to modification are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0086">At this point, the Dpr-3 of the peptide was ready for functionalization. Fluorine bearing analogues were designed with the fluorine attached to the end of the aliphatic side-chain with variable length. Non-radioactive analogues using <sup>19</sup>F in the place of <sup>18</sup>F were used to study their chemical and biological properties and side-chain precursors were prepared in solution phase prior to attachment to the peptide, with fluorination of the side-chain being conducted on-resin. Prior to attachment, side-chain precursors had three features: an aliphatic chain with length adjusted for binding affinity to the receptor, a site of attachment to the peptide, and a site of attachment for the imaging agent.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0087">Three different side-chain lengths were prepared: 6, 9, and 12 carbon length, indicated as 6C, 9C, and 12C respectively. The 6C and 12C precursors were prepared from their cyclic lactones, with the first synthetic step being the opening of the lactone rings in methanol using an acid catalyst (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Methanol was chosen as media to provide methyl protection to the carboxylate group. The formed alcohols 14a and 14c, as well as commercially available methyl-9-hydroxynonanoate, the starting material for 9C, were then tritylated to obtain weak acid labile protection for the alcohol group, which was necessary during the side-chain coupling to the peptide. Purification of the tritylated products 15a, 15b, and 15c was problematic and attempts to perform chromatography were made. The existence of excess trityl chloride and pyridinium salt made it difficult to dissolve the crude material and methanol was added to help the solvation. Unfortunately methanol reacted with unused trityl chloride, caused acid formation, and resulted in trityl (Trt) deprotection from the product that reformed the starting materials. Instead, the byproducts were removed by filtration with organic solvents at 0&#xb0; C. to obtain 15a and 15b, or by flash chromatography without methanol to obtain 15c.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0088">Hydrolysis of the methyl ester of 15a, 15b, and 15c was carried out under basic conditions, followed by an acidic work up, during which the pH was maintained above 4 to prevent trityl deprotection. After recrystallization for solid product or flash chromatography for oil products, 6-trityloxyhexanoic acid 16a, 9-trityloxynonanoic acid 16b and 12-trityloxydodecanoic acid 16c were isolated, providing aliphatic side-chains that were ready to be coupled to 12 and 13.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0089">The on-resin reaction series started with a selective deprotection of the acid labile amine-Mtt of Dpr-3, which was done with a series of treatments with a dilute trifluoroacetic acid (2% TFA) solution in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. After the free amine was obtained, the carboxylic acid group of the side-chain precursor was coupled to this amine via O-benzotriazole (OBt) ester formation, following standard coupling procedures in peptide synthesis. For the 5-mer 12, only 16a was coupled to the peptide, while for the 14-mer 13, all precursors previously made, 16a, 16b, and 16c, were used. Reaction completion was followed by the Kaiser Test and in some cases micro cleavage to allow HPLC analysis and MS analysis to confirm the product mass.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0090">After the side-chain was attached to the peptide, the protected alcohol was transformed to a fluoro group via several steps. The first step was the selective deprotection of the alcohol-Trt with dilute acid (2% TFA) solution in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The obtained alcohol was activated prior to fluorination. For the ghrelin(1-5)-6C&#x2014;OH, activation was done via tosylation in basic conditions. HPLC monitoring and MS analysis of the micro-cleaved product showed conversion of the starting material to the desired product ghrelin(1-5)-OTs (55%) and various byproducts. Mesylation was used for the 14-mer peptides for the reason that mesyl chloride (MsCl) forms a highly reactive intermediate sulfene (SO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>), in which the sulfur is highly electrophilic and will react with any alcohol, even with tertiary alcohols that react very slowly with TsCl. HPLC and MS analyses of the micro-cleaved products showed that mesylation was successfully applied to the 14-mer peptides with the 6C, 9C, and 12C side-chains.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">Fluorination for both ghrelin(1-5) and ghrelin(1-14) derivatives was performed using tetra-n-butylamonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), monitored by HPLC and MS analysis of micro-cleaved products. Fluorination was the last step done on-resin, and at this point the peptides were ready to be cleaved off the resin and fully deprotected. The desired fluorine bearing ghrelin(1-5)-6C&#x2014;F 17, ghrelin(1-14)-6C&#x2014;F 18a, ghrelin(1-14)-9C&#x2014;F 18b, and ghrelin(1-14)-12C&#x2014;F 18c were isolated with yields of 9%, 7%, 2%, and 12% respectively (Table 2).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">The binding affinities of these fluorine bearing ghrelin(1-5) and ghrelin(1-14) derivatives to the GHSR were evaluated according to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values (Table 2) as determined by a radioligand binding assay. Fluorine bearing ghrelin(1-14) derivatives of different side-chain lengths: 6C, 9C, and 12C, were found to have satisfactory nanomolar binding affinities that make them suitable for use as imaging agents.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Rhenium Bearing Ghrelin Analogues</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0093">The second class of molecules designed were rhenium bearing ghrelin analogues to investigate the suitability of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-radiolabelled ghrelin analogues as SPECT imaging agents for the GHSR. Cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl organometallic (CpM(CO)<sub>3</sub>) species were incorporated into the ghrelin analogues to impart imaging utility due to the neutral, lipophilic, and stable properties of this complex. The ability to use the cyclopentadienyl-metal complex in an integrated fashion, e.g. directly associated with the estrogen receptor binding site, was desirable. The neutral and lipophilic properties of the metal complex assisted in this integration of the complex as part of the residue-3 side-chain that participates in the binding to the GHSR.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0094">The side-chains for the rhenium bearing ghrelin were prepared using solution-phase chemistry prior to attachment to the peptide. Two different lengths were prepared: 4 and 6 carbons long, counted from the amide's carbon to the carbon in which Cp ring is attached, and will be identified as 4C and 6C. Both precursors were prepared from their cyclic anhydride, succinic anhydride and adipic anhydride for 4C and 6C respectively, and rhenium tricarbonyl cyclopentadienyl (CpRe(CO)<sub>3</sub>) through Friedel Crafts acylation using aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) (Scheme 4). The reaction for the 4C precursor went slowly and did not go to completion, due to the low reactivity of the Cp ring when it is coordinated to Re(I). The starting material CpRe(CO)<sub>3 </sub>was recovered during the extraction, and the product 4-(Cyclopentadienylrhenium tricarbonyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid 19a, was isolated upon chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0095">In the synthesis of 6C precursor, adipic anhydride was prepared from adipic acid through dehydration. In this regard, 2 eq. of adipic anhydride and 4 eq. of AlCl<sub>3 </sub>were used, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>was used as the solvent, and the mixture was refluxed. This caused all starting material to be consumed within 2 days and upon purification, 6-(Cyclopentadienylrhenium tricarbonyl)-6-oxohexanoic acid 19b, as well as the dimer 1,6-di(CpRe(CO)<sub>3</sub>)-1,6-dioxohexane as a byproduct, were isolated.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0096">The side-chain precursors 19a and 19b, already containing rhenium, were ready to be incorporated into the peptide at this point. Fully protected on-resin 13 was prepared and the Mtt group was removed from the amine of Dpr-3 using 2% TFA solution. The side-chains 19a and 19b were then coupled to this amine followed by cleaving from resin and complete deprotection. The rhenium bearing ghrelin(1-14)-4C-CpRe(CO)<sub>3 </sub>20a and ghrelin(1-14)-6C-CpRe(CO)<sub>3 </sub>20b were obtained with purified yields of 24% and 36% respectively (Table 2).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0097">The evaluation of 20a and 20b showed that both molecules have good binding affinity to the GHSR, marked by their nanomolar IC<sub>50 </sub>values: 35 nM and 174 nM respectively (Table 2). The incorporation of a metal complex in the binding region of a peptide ligand was a success, with the neutral and lipophilic complex, CpRe(CO)<sub>3</sub>, which mimicked the lipophilic property of the original ghrelin side-chain.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0098">This work demonstrates that analogues of ghrelin have strong affinity to a receptor target, and thus, are suitable for use as probes for the non-invasive imaging of tumours expressing a receptor target, as well as for use as a carrier to deliver a therapeutic agent to a target receptor in, for example, a tumour.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0099">Materials:</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0100">Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and solvents were ACS grade or higher and used without further purification from commercial suppliers. Fmoc-protected amino acids, HBTU, and rink amide p-methylbenzylhydrylamine (MBHA) resin (0.52 meq/g) were obtained from Peptide International (Louisville, Ky.). Fmoc-Dap (Alloc)-OH was obtained from Chem-Impex (Wood Dale, Ill.). Octanoic acid and fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) isomer I was obtained from Aldrich (Oakville, ON). Cell culture medium minimum essential medium alpha (&#x3b1;MEM), Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), Penicillin-Streptomycin (PEST) and Trypsin were purchased from GIBCO and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0101">Peptide Synthesis:</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0102">Elongation of peptidyl chains on rink amide MBHA resins (1 mmol) was performed on an automated synthesizer (APEX396 peptide synthesizer) using manufacturer supplied protocols. The peptidyl resin was then transferred to a manual peptide vessel and the Alloc group from the side chain of diamonipropionic (Dap) acid (residue-3) was removed using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and phenylsilane (2&#xd7;30 min at room temperature) under argon atmosphere. The resin was washed successively with DCM, THF, and DMF after each coupling. The resin was then agitated (at 600 rpm) for 4 hours with HBTU (3 equiv), catalytic amount of diisopropylamine (DIPEA) (6 equiv) and either 4-fold excess of octanoic acid or 4-(cyclopentadienylrhenium tricarbonyl)-4-oxobutanoic acid in dimethylformide (DMF). The trityl group from the side chain of Lys (residue-15) was removed with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane (7&#xd7;2 min). Again, successive washes with DMF, DCM and THF were performed after each deprotection step. Subsequently, the peptidyl resin was vigorously stirred for 4 hours with FITC (3 equiv) and DIPEA (6 equiv) in DMF. The ensuing resin was treated with cleavage cocktail consisting of 88% TFA and 12% scavengers (5% water, 5% triisopropylsilane, and 2% phenol). The resulting suspension was shaken for 4 hours at 700 rpm. The filtrate was collected, filtered into cold tert-butyl methyl ether and pelleted via centrifugation at 3000 rpm and &#x2212;5&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. Pellets were then dissolved in distilled-deionized water and lyophilized yielding yellow solids for both analogs. Crude peptides were analyzed by analytical reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Grace Vydac protein/peptide RP-C18 column 4.6&#xd7;250 mm, 5 &#x3bc;m. Preparative separations of peptides was done on a Grace Vydac protein/peptide RP-C18 column 22&#xd7;250 mm, 10 &#x3bc;m, followed by analytical hplc for purity analysis. Characterization was performed using electro-spray mass spectrometry (MS) in the positive-ion mode on a Waters Quattro Micro MS/MS.
