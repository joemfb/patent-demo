<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An input unit for an electronic device comprising a body, a first switch adjacent a first location of the body, a second switch adjacent a second location of the body, and a third switch adjacent a third location of the body. When the body moves in a first direction to a first position, the third switch generates a signal to activate a first operational mode and the first and second switches generate signals to perform first and second functions when the body moves in a second direction different from the first direction. When the body moves in the first direction to a second position, the third switch generates a signal to activate a second operational mode and the first and second switches generate signals to perform third and fourth functions when the body moves in the second direction.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mobile phones, pod or pad-type devices, tablets, notebook computers, media players, book readers, gaming devices, and other information terminals are continuously being upgraded to meet consumer demand. These terminals have input units that prove to be unsuitable or difficult to use for purposes of accessing many functions that are offered. Many terminals use multiple separate input units in an attempt to improve ease of use. However, use of multiple separate units is undesirable because they tend to increase complexity and at the same time increase the size of the terminal.</p>

The circuit board <b>235</b><i>a </i>may be electrically connected to circuit board <b>282</b> configured with or which provides a coupling to controller <b>180</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As a result, controller <b>180</b> may process user inputs associated with different commands or functions are input through activation of respective ones of switches <b>235</b><i>b </i>and <b>235</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show examples of how the dome switches <b>235</b><i>b </i>and <b>235</b><i>c </i>may be activated. In accordance with one embodiment, the first dome switch <b>235</b><i>b </i>may be disposed to be pressed by one end of button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>and the second dome switch <b>235</b><i>c </i>may be disposed to be pressed by another or an opposing end of the button body <b>234</b><i>a</i>. In this regard, the dome switches may overlap respective ends of the button body; however, in another embodiment this overlap may not be necessary as a different structure (e.g., extension pieces) may be used to activate the switches when the ends are pressed. When used to control volume, the dome switches <b>235</b><i>b</i>, <b>235</b><i>c </i>may generate signals for respectively increasing and decreasing the volume of audio output module <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> again, button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>is also configured to slide back and forth, in the second direction, relative to the mounting portion <b>233</b>. In order to allow the button body to slide into positions for entering commands, the width of mounting portion <b>233</b> may be longer than a width of button body <b>234</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">More specifically, the button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>may be slide between sides of the mounting portion <b>233</b> to advance and retract guide wings <b>234</b><i>b </i>located on ends of button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>into and out of respective guide grooves <b>233</b><i>b </i>of the mounting portion <b>233</b>. According to one embodiment, the guide wings <b>234</b><i>b </i>may be formed to protrude in opposite directions from respective ends of button body <b>234</b><i>a</i>. In other embodiments, only one of the guide wing <b>234</b><i>b </i>may protrude only one side of button body <b>234</b><i>a</i>, or neither side of the button body may include a protrusion. In this latter case, side surfaces of the button body may be spaced from side surfaces of the mounting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B, the guide groove <b>233</b><i>b </i>may be formed along a sliding direction of the button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>to allow the guide wing <b>234</b><i>b </i>to be inserted and slide therein. The guide groove <b>233</b><i>b </i>may be located at both ends of the mounting portion <b>233</b>, and formed to be recessed at an inner surface of the case.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5C</figref>, in order to generate a signal for a command or other user input for movement in the second direction, a second switch <b>236</b> may disposed adjacent to the first switch portion <b>235</b>. More specifically, when the button body moves in the second direction, the second switch <b>236</b> may be switched to generate a second input signal, for example, by causing the button portion <b>234</b> to move a position of the second switch in the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">To effect switching of the second switch, the second switch <b>236</b> may, for example, include a switch body <b>236</b><i>a </i>located between dome switches <b>235</b><i>b</i>, <b>235</b><i>c </i>on the circuit board <b>282</b>. A latch portion <b>234</b><i>c </i>which, for example, may snap into or otherwise contact second switch <b>236</b> may be disposed between ends of the button body <b>234</b><i>a</i>. According to one embodiment, a manipulation protrusion <b>236</b><i>b </i>may protrude from the switch body <b>236</b><i>a</i>, and the manipulation protrusion <b>236</b><i>b </i>may be latched or otherwise be made to move by latch portion <b>234</b><i>c </i>when the latch portion slides in the second direction to generate a second input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The second input signal may be a signal for turning on or off the display module <b>251</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). More specifically, a sliding manipulation of the button portion <b>234</b> generates a signal for turning on or off a display element.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to one embodiment, the mobile terminal may be considered to be in a &#x201c;locked state&#x201d; or a &#x201c;released state&#x201d; according to whether or not a user control command input. The locked state may be a state in which a display element is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">More specifically, in the locked state, one or more user input control commands for an application in the mobile terminal are restricted. The locked state may be provided, for example, to prevent a function or application from being activated or deactivated through unintentional entry of a user control command, e.g,. through entry of an unintentional touch input. Accordingly, in the locked state, a user control command input for display module <b>251</b> and/or other user input units <b>230</b> may be prevented or otherwise limited to within a preset range.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Moreover, a locked state may be automatically activated based on a condition where a user input has not been sensed for a prescribed period of time. The prescribed period of time may change based on a pre-programmed setting or based on a setting entered by a user. Additionally, or alternatively, the mobile terminal may be placed in a locked state when a specific key (for example, a hold key) of the mobile terminal is pressed by the user. The specific key may be manipulation unit <b>232</b>, a keypad key, a menu option, and/or another key.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The released state may be implemented, for example, when the specific key is pressed while the mobile terminal is in the locked state and/or based on manipulation of a predetermined key or menu item of display module <b>251</b> and/or based on manipulation of user input unit <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Through this arrangement, a user input unit capable of performing various manipulations using a single body may be implemented through use of button portion <b>234</b> which is configured to receive user inputs in multiple directions.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> again, an operation surface (shaft or protrusion) <b>234</b><i>d </i>extends toward the first switch portion <b>235</b> may be formed at the button body <b>234</b><i>a</i>, and the operation surface (shaft or protrusion) <b>234</b><i>d </i>extends toward the first switch portion <b>235</b> within a sliding range of the button body <b>234</b><i>a</i>. The operation shafts may overlap respective ones of the dome switches, to allow different user inputs to be entered in the first direction when the dome switches are actuated. According to one embodiment, irrespective of the sliding position of the button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>in the second direction, the operation shaft <b>234</b><i>d </i>may still overlap respective ones of the dome switches <b>235</b><i>b </i>and <b>235</b><i>c </i>to allow inputs to be made. With this arrangement, push inputs may be entered regardless of whether the terminal is in the locked state or released state. In other embodiments, push inputs may be restricted in one or both of the first or second directions in the locked state.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment, both ends of button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>may rotate relative to latch portion <b>234</b><i>c</i>. For example, latch portion <b>234</b><i>c </i>may be fixed or maintained in a substantially stationary position (e.g., portion <b>234</b><i>c </i>may correspond to a pivot point) relative to manipulation protrusion <b>236</b><i>b </i>of the switch body <b>236</b><i>a</i>, and the button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>may be tilted or rotated around this position. Because latch portion <b>234</b><i>c </i>serves as a rotational center or pivot point, a complicated structure for implementing a push mechanism of the button body <b>234</b><i>a </i>can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one embodiment, first and second input signals may perform audio control and/or hold functions. In other words, the first and second input signals may control different functions or operations. In other embodiments, functions or operations unrelated to audio control may be entered by these input signals.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show examples of functions that may be controlled by the manipulation unit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the display module <b>251</b> of a mobile terminal may be configured to enable a touch sensing and the second input signal may be a signal for deactivating a touch sensing against at least part of the display module <b>251</b>. However, the display module <b>251</b> maintains an ON state. In this manner, the state in which a touch input to all or part of the display unit is disabled but the display module <b>251</b> is turned on may be referred to as a locked screen.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In this example, if button portion <b>234</b> is made to slide in the second direction while an application (music application in case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) is implemented in a mobile terminal, the execution screen of the display module <b>251</b> becomes a locked screen.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one implementation of a locked state, any touch input may be limited or restricted and in the example under consideration in the screen may be locked. As a result, an unintended or erroneous user input can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If the button portion <b>234</b> is pressed in a state of the locked screen, the mobile terminal may be controlled to drive a function associated with the first input signal. For example, audio volume adjustment output from the audio output unit <b>252</b> in the state of the locked screen may be controlled through a push input of the button portion. As a result, a user can control the function of an application using button portion <b>234</b> while limiting a touch input to the execution screen of the application using the same button portion <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">On the contrary, the second input signal may be a signal for locking a function associated with the first input signal. In other words, it may be possible to implement a state that audio volume cannot be adjusted even if the button portion <b>234</b> is push-manipulated while being switched to a locked screen by a sliding manipulation of the button portion <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In case where the second input signal is a signal for deactivating touch sensing, then the first input signal may be a signal for controlling a different function according to a kind of the executed application.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, when a user slides the button portion <b>234</b> in the second direction to a first position, different functions may be performed by pushing ends of the button portion <b>234</b> in the first direction. When a user slides the button portion in the second direction to a second position, additional different functions may be performed by pushing the ends of button portion <b>234</b> in the first direction. Thus, for example, in case of a video play application, an input signal entered by pushing button one end of button portion <b>234</b> in the first direction when this button portion is slid to a first position may adjust display brightness. And, when button portion is slid to a second position, the same end of button portion <b>234</b> may adjust audio volume.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A through 7D</figref> show another embodiment of a manipulation unit for a mobile terminal. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the button portion <b>334</b> is configured to be moved to different vertical positions, e.g., may be formed to slide in a direction along a lateral surface of the terminal body. Guide wings may be protruded at both lateral surfaces (e.g., upper and lower portions) of the button body and guide grooves may be formed at corresponding side walls of the mounting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to this embodiment, a second input signal generated by a sliding operation of the button portion <b>334</b> may be a signal related to a terminal setting, and a first input signal inputted by a push operation of the button portion <b>334</b> may be an input signal associated with a detailed setting of the terminal. However, these input signals may control other terminal functions. Also, button portion <b>334</b> may be configured to slide along a lateral surface of the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, for example, the second input signal may be a bell or vibration setting signal generated when receiving a phone call, and the first input signal may be a signal for controlling the volume of a bell or vibration. If the user slides the button portion <b>334</b> in a vertical direction to a first position, then the bell may be selected. If the button portion <b>334</b> is pushed inwardly (e.g., towards an interior of the terminal body in a direction crossing or perpendicular the slide direction) in that state, then the volume of the bell may be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If the user slides button portion <b>334</b> in the vertical direction to a second position, then a vibration function may be selected and the rate of frequency of the vibration may be adjusted when a push operation is executed on the button portion <b>334</b> in the direction perpendicular or crossing the slide direction, e.g., when the button is pushed in a direction toward an interior of the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> shows another example of functions that may be controlled by the manipulation unit. According to this example, a second input signal may be a switching signal between a 2D mode and a 3D mode, and a first input signal may be a signal for configuring the detailed functions of the 2D and 3D modes. As with the previous embodiment, the second input signal used to select the mode of the terminal may be generated based on sliding the manipulation unit to up and down positions. The first input signal may be generated by pushing the manipulation unit in a direction towards the terminal body.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Functions that may be controlled by the first input signal include 3D depth adjustment. In other words, if the user slides the button portion <b>334</b> in a side direction to a first position, then the state of a mobile terminal is switched to a 3D mode to display a 3D image on the display unit. In this case, it may be possible to control a 3D depth being displayed by a push input of the button portion.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> shows another example of functions that may be controlled by the manipulation unit. In this case, sliding the manipulation unit to respective vertical and up and down positions may cause the terminal to switch between a camera capture mode and a video capture mode. Pushing the manipulation unit in a direction towards an interior of the terminal body while capturing a video stream may cause a camera capture function to be implemented. And, pushing the manipulation unit in the same direction while in camera mode may cause a picture to be taken.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8E</figref> show another embodiment of functions controlled by a manipulation unit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The input signal generated when a user slides the button portion in the second direction may lock a touch input to an application screen of the display unit. Pushing the button portion inwardly may switch the execution screen to another application.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">For example, if the screen of one applications is displayed on the display module <b>251</b> and a user slides button portion <b>234</b> to a first position, then a touch input to the screen may be locked. (A screen to which a touch input is locked may be referred to as a locked screen). In this case, if push input is received from button portion <b>234</b>, then the displayed execution screen will be replaced the execution screen of a different application.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to one specific example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the execution screen <b>210</b> of an application displayed on the display module <b>251</b> may include a map associated with a navigation application. If a user slides button portion <b>234</b> in this state or a push input is received, the execution screen becomes a locked screen. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the mobile terminal may be configured to update the execution screen <b>210</b> of an application being displayed on the locked screen according to the execution of applications.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the execution screen is switched to a &#x201c;play screen&#x201d; associated with the video play application by a push input of the button portion <b>234</b> in this state. Furthermore, if a new event (for example, notification of a change of the heading direction in navigation, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>) occurs when the execution screen has been switched, the display unit may display an icon (I) indicating this event. In this case, if the button portion is pressed again, then the execution screen of an application prior to being switched will be displayed again on the display unit (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">According to another example, when a text message is received while the execution screen <b>210</b> of a video play application is displayed as a locked screen, controller <b>180</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the mobile terminal may display a notification icon on the display unit. In this case, if a push input is applied through the button portion, then an execution screen related to a text message instead of the execution screen <b>210</b> of the video play application will be displayed on the display unit. In this manner, various modifications can be made in both a structural aspect as well as in a functional aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows another embodiment of a manipulation unit which includes a first switch portion <b>435</b> and button body <b>434</b><i>a </i>to move in interlock with a sliding of the button body <b>434</b><i>a </i>of the button portion <b>434</b>. For example, the first switch portion <b>435</b> and button portion <b>434</b> may be configured to include a flexible circuit board <b>435</b><i>a </i>mounted in opposing relation to button body <b>434</b><i>a </i>and a plurality of dome switches <b>435</b><i>b </i>and <b>435</b><i>c </i>may be disposed on the flexible circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to this arrangement, unlike one or more previous embodiments, the area of operation surfaces (shaft or protrusion) <b>434</b><i>d </i>in contact with respective ones of the dome switches <b>435</b><i>b </i>and <b>435</b><i>c </i>are smaller to enhance operation reliability and in order to allow a user to better feel a clicking sensation when a signal is input.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Furthermore, additional functionality may be realized by pushing the button portion <b>434</b> in a manner that causes both dome switches <b>435</b><i>b</i>, <b>435</b><i>c </i>to be simultaneously switched. When this occurs, for example, the power of the terminal body may be turned on or off.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For example, the power may be turned on if both dome switches are pressed at the same time when the button portion is slid to a first position. Conversely, the power may be turned off if the dome switches are pressed at the same time when the button is slid to a second position. The combinations of a sliding and push inputs associated with power on/off can be changed based on the manufacturer's or user's option.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> show another embodiment of a manipulation unit which includes a button portion <b>534</b>, a button body <b>534</b><i>a</i>, and a sliding body <b>541</b>. The button body <b>534</b><i>a </i>may be configured such that one end thereof can be rotated or deflected relative to another end thereof and/or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A through hole <b>542</b> is formed at a surface of the button body <b>534</b><i>a</i>, and the sliding body <b>541</b> is mounted in the through hole <b>542</b> and formed to slide within the through hole <b>542</b>. Sliding body <b>541</b> is separate from button body <b>534</b><i>a</i>. As a result, moving sliding body <b>541</b> to different positions does not cause the button body <b>534</b><i>a </i>to slide. According to one embodiment, button body <b>534</b><i>a </i>and sliding body <b>541</b> may be incorporated within as same modular unit.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Furthermore, a slide wing <b>541</b><i>a </i>formed on at least one side of the sliding body <b>541</b> may be provided to guide sliding of the sliding body <b>541</b>, and a slide groove <b>541</b><i>b </i>is provided at the button body <b>434</b><i>a </i>into which the slide wing <b>541</b><i>a </i>may be inserted. According to one embodiment slide wings may be provided on opposing ends of the sliding body for insertion into respective grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> show another embodiment of a manipulation unit that includes a button portion <b>634</b> fixed to a first direction when slid in a second direction. For example, when slid to a first position the button portion generates a signal for turning on or off the display unit. In this same position, however, the button portion is prevented from moving inwardly and outwardly relative to the terminal body, i.e., the button portion may slide in a first direction but a push input in a second direction is disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">For example, at least one of the guide grooves <b>633</b><i>b</i>, <b>633</b><i>c </i>formed at ends of the mounting portion <b>633</b> may include a surface to fix movement of guide wing <b>634</b><i>b </i>in a vertical direction. The surface may include a cover <b>633</b><i>d </i>mounted on or adjacent the guide groove. As a result, when a user slides the button portion to a first position, guide wing <b>634</b><i>b </i>is inserted into the guide groove <b>633</b><i>c </i>to prevent the button portion from moving in a first (push) direction. As a result, the dome switch adjacent groove <b>633</b><i>c </i>is prevent from being actuated by a push touch upon the button portion.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In addition, a protrusion <b>680</b> may be formed to protrude at a position adjacent groove <b>633</b><i>b </i>to prevent the button portion <b>634</b> from actuating the other dome switch. Thus, the protrusion <b>680</b> and cover <b>633</b> may cooperate to prevent both switches from being actuated when a user slides the button portion to the first position, i.e., when guide wing <b>634</b><i>b </i>is inserted into groove <b>633</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Conversely, when a user slides the button portion <b>634</b> to the opposite position (e.g., a guide wing slides into groove <b>633</b><i>b</i>), the button portion <b>634</b> is allowed to receive push inputs that will depress either or both of the dome switches. This is accomplished because guide wing <b>634</b><i>d </i>is removed from groove <b>633</b><i>c </i>and protrusion <b>680</b> is allowed to move into a recess <b>681</b>. According to one example, the recess may have a depth greater than a length of the protrusion. However, in another example, the recess may have a shallower depth because the dome switch may be depressed under these circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">According to one embodiment, when the mobile terminal is in a locked state, the button portion may be prevented from being unintentionally pressed or otherwise manipulated by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">According to another embodiment, a user input unit is provided which performs multiple manipulations in multiple directions using a single body, which includes a button portion configured to receive user inputs in multiple directions. Anew type of input unit and/or user interface may therefore be provided for a mobile terminal or other type of electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">According to another embodiment, a manipulation unit is provided for a mobile terminal or other electronic device for controlling the activation or deactivation of a locked screen.
