<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. P2007-129739 filed on Dec. 13, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a data driving device and a liquid crystal display device using the same, and more particularly, to a data driving device which is capable of compensating for a color temperature based on a gray scale, and a liquid crystal display device using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a liquid crystal display device displays a desired image by applying an electric field to a liquid crystal material having an anisotropic dielectric constant formed between two substrates and adjusting the intensity of the electric field to adjust light transmittance of the liquid crystal material. Such a conventional liquid crystal display device displays a gray scale according to light transmittance of red, green, and blue dots based on each of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) data signals. If the red, green, and blue data signals are the same, the same gray scale voltage is used for the red, green, and blue data signals. That is, the same gray scale voltage is used for all three colors even though it is known that the red, green, and blue dots have different electro-optical characteristics, resulting in a problem where color temperature varies with the gray scale. The color temperature is determined depending on a combination ratio of brightness of the red, green, and blue dots that make up a pixel. However, when the gray scale increases or decreases, the gray scale voltages used for the red, green, and blue data signals cannot be controlled individually, thereby causing the color temperature to be uneven in upper and lower gray scale areas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a data driving device and a liquid crystal display device using the same that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a data driving device which is capable of compensating for a color temperature based on a gray scale, and a liquid crystal display device using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, a gray scale voltage generator includes a voltage dividing resistor string to generate blue (B), red (R), and green (G) gamma voltage signals, the voltage dividing resistor string including a B gamma voltage signal generating section, a R/G gamma voltage generating section, and a common (COM) gamma voltage generating section to individually control a B gray scale voltage and a R/G gray scale voltage to maintain a constant color temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The gray scale voltage generator <b>120</b> includes first to third voltage-dividing resistor strings <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first area <b>122</b><i>a </i>includes the first resistor RR<b>1</b> and the first to eth voltage-dividing resistors R_<b>1</b> to R_e connected in series to the first resistor RR<b>1</b>.
