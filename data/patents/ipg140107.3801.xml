<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A display device includes: a display panel including first and second substrates spaced from and opposite to each other, and has a touch sensor switch. The touch sensor switch includes a first touch electrode provided on a surface of the first substrate facing the second substrate, and a second touch electrode provided on a surface of the second substrate facing the first substrate and spaced from and faces the first touch electrode. The first and second touch electrodes contact with each other when the touch panel is deformed by an external pressure. The first touch electrode covers a surface of a concave and convex area where grooves are formed to be spaced from each other, and on the surface on which the first touch electrode is provided, an application film is provided to expose a surface of a top face of a convex part of the concave and convex area.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, a manufacturing method of a liquid crystal display device, a display device and an information input apparatus. Particularly, the invention relates to a liquid crystal display device, a manufacturing method of a liquid crystal display device, a display device and an information input apparatus, in which a touch sensor switch is provided on a pair of substrates opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A display device, such as a liquid crystal display device or an organic EL display device, has merits such as low thickness, lightweight and low power consumption. Thus, the display device is often used in a mobile electronic equipment, such as a cellular phone or a digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the display device as stated above, the liquid crystal display device includes, as a display panel, a liquid crystal panel in which a liquid crystal layer is sealed between a pair of substrates. For example, the liquid crystal panel is of a transmission type, modulates an illumination light emitted by an illumination device, such as a backlight, provided on the back of the liquid crystal panel and allows it to pass through. Then, an image is displayed on the front of the liquid crystal panel by the modulated illumination light.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, the liquid crystal panel is of an active matrix type, and includes a TFT array substrate on which plural thin film transistors (TFTs) functioning as pixel switching elements are formed. In the liquid crystal panel, an opposite substrate is disposed so as to be opposite to the TFT array substrate, and the liquid crystal layer is provided in a space between the TFT array substrate and the opposite substrate. In the active matrix type liquid crystal panel, a voltage is applied to the liquid crystal layer by inputting an image signal to a pixel electrode through the pixel switching element, and the transmittance for the light passing through the pixel is controlled, so that the image is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the display device as stated above, in order to enable a user to input operation data by using an image, such as an icon, displayed on the screen of the display panel, there is a case where a touch panel is provided as an information input device on the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the touch panel is externally disposed on the display panel, the whole thickness becomes large, and there is a case where the merit of low thickness is lost. Besides, since there is a case where the transmitted light is reduced in the display area by the touch panel or the light interferes, the quality of the display image can deteriorate. Further, disadvantages such as reduction in manufacture efficiency and increase in manufacture cost can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, a display device is proposed in which the display panel has a built-in touch panel function.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, a liquid crystal display device is proposed in which the liquid crystal panel has a built-in resistive film type touch sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, the touch sensor includes a touch sensor switch in which a touch electrode is provided on each of a pair of substrates constituting the liquid crystal panel, and when the liquid crystal panel is pressed and is deformed, the pair of touch electrodes are electrically connected to each other. In the liquid crystal panel, the touch electrode is provided on a convex part protruding convexly, so that the touch electrodes formed on both the substrates are electrically connected to each other by a small external pressure (see, for example, JP-A-2001-75074 (patent document 1), JP-A-2007-52368 (patent document 2) and JP-A-2007-95044 (patent document 3)).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the liquid crystal panel, a liquid crystal orientation film is provided in order to orient liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal payer. With respect to the liquid crystal orientation film, it is proposed that a surface portion of the touch electrode is removed, and the surface portion is exposed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the liquid crystal orientation film is removed from the surface portion of the touch electrode, a solvent is sprayed onto the portion from a fine nozzle used in an inkjet system and the portion is dissolved (see, for example, patent document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in the above method, since it is difficult to obtain a sufficient throughput, the manufacture efficiency can deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Besides, since it is difficult to sufficiently remove the liquid crystal orientation film from the surface portion of the touch electrode, yield can decrease.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Besides, since it is necessary to newly introduce the above instrument, the manufacture cost can increase.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, in the above method, since there is a case where the periphery of an area where the surface is exposed is also dissolved, it is necessary to provide a margin. Thus, in the liquid crystal panel, a portion occupied by the touch sensor is increased, and the aperture ratio of the liquid crystal panel can decrease. Thus, the brightness of a display image is reduced and the image quality can deteriorate.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the display device, with reduction in thickness of the display panel, members, such as electrodes or the like, may be damaged due to an external pressure, and reliability of the device may be degraded.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, in a liquid crystal panel having a touch sensor switch, when a touch electrode is provided on a convex part, such a problem conspicuously occurs since the touch electrode is rigid. For example, the touch electrode may be disconnected and the touch panel function may be damaged. Further, a conductive foreign substance when the touch electrode is crushed may be diffused into the liquid crystal cell, so the touch electrodes may be short-circuited.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to resolve such a problem, the surface of the convex part on which the touch electrode is provided may increase in area. In this case, however, the aperture ratio of the liquid crystal panel decreases, which may cause deterioration in quality of a display image.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, in the display device, deterioration in image quality due to the decrease in the aperture ratio, or degradation in reliability of the device may occur.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, it is desirable to provide a liquid crystal display device, a manufacturing method of a liquid crystal display device, a display device and an information input device, in which manufacture efficiency, yield and image quality can be improved, and manufacture cost can be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0172" num="0171">First, at T<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8D</figref>, each of the data signal (Vsig) and the write signal (Write) becomes a high level from a low level.

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Next, at T<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, the write signal (Write) becomes the low level, the switch SWw is turned off, and the signal line SL becomes in a floating state. In this state, at T<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the scanning signal (Vgate) becomes the high level from the low level. Thus, the gate of the pixel switching element <b>31</b> becomes in the ON state, a channel is formed in the pixel switching element <b>31</b>, and a discharge path of electric charge of the data signal (Vsig) is generated (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">At this time, when the touch sensor switch SWs is brought into the ON state, the electric charge of the signal line SL in the floating state is discharged to the large-capacity Vcom line CL.

<p id="p-0175" num="0174">On the other hand, when the touch sensor switch SWs is in the OFF state, as indicated by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the potential of the data signal (Vsig) is almost kept and is little changed.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Next, at T<b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, the read signal (Read) becomes the high level from the low level.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Here, when the touch sensor switch SWs is in the ON state, as indicated by the solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the data signal (Vsig) of the low potential is read.

<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Then, at this time, the position detection section <b>402</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the data processing section <b>400</b> performs position detection based on the potential of the read data signal (Vsig).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Specifically, the position detection section <b>402</b> performs a comparison process between the potential of the read data signal (Vsig) and the reference potential, and when the former potential is larger than the reference potential, it is determined that the touch sensor switch SWs is in the OFF state. On the other hand, when the potential of the read data signal (Vsig) is smaller than the reference potential, it is determined that the touch sensor switch SWs is in the ON state. Then, the position detection section <b>402</b> detects, as the position with which the detection target object F such as the finger contacts, the position of the pixel P where it is determined that the touch sensor switch SWs is in the ON state.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">That is, the position detection section <b>402</b> detects the position with which the detection target object F, such as the finger, contacts in the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> based on the potential changed between the case where the touch sensor switch SWs is in the ON state and the case where it is in the OFF state.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Next, at T<b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>, the read signal (Read) is brought into the low level, and the switch SWr is brought into the OFF state.

Thereafter, the potential of the common voltage Vcom is inverted, and the control of the display is continued.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Hereinafter, a method of forming the portion of the concave and convex area <b>500</b> as the main part of the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> will be described.</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0183">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Here, for example, the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> is formed by applying a photosensitive resin (not shown). For example, after a positive photosensitive acryl resin is applied, a pre-bake process is performed, so that the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, grooves are formed in the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Here, the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> made of the photosensitive resin is pattern-processed by a photolithography technique, so that the grooves are, and the concave and convex area <b>500</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Specifically, an exposure process is performed using a photo mask on which a mask pattern is formed. In this exposure process, exposure light is irradiated to portions where the grooves are to be formed. Here, the exposure amount is suitably adjusted, and the irradiation of the exposure light is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">After the exposure process is performed, a development process is performed. Thereafter, a remaining solvent in the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> and a low molecular non-polymerized component are volatilized by performing a bake process. By doing so, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the grooves are formed on the surface of the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Incidentally, in the above exposure process, in addition to the case where one photo mask is used to perform the formation, the exposure process may be performed by suitably combining plural photo masks. Besides, in addition to the grooves, although not shown, a contact hole may be formed separately by the same process.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the touch electrode <b>25</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">Here, the touch electrode <b>25</b> is formed by forming a film of transparent conductive material on the surface of the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> where the grooves are formed. For example, a film of ITO is formed by a sputtering method, so that the touch electrode <b>25</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">In addition to this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the common electrode <b>23</b> is also formed by the same process.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Here, the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> is formed by applying an orientation material onto the touch electrode <b>25</b> and the common electrode <b>23</b> and by forming a film. For example, an application liquid in which the orientation material is dissolved is applied by a spin coat method. Then, after the solvent in the application film is volatilized by a pre-bake process, the remaining solvent is removed by a main bake process. By this, the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> of, for example, polyimide is formed. The liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> may be formed by offset printing or the like in addition to the spin coat method.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, since the convex part and the concave part are alternately provided on the surface of the concave and convex area <b>500</b>, the film of the orientation material is not formed on the top face of the convex part. Specifically, an application liquid in which the orientation material is dissolved enters the concave part of the concave and convex area <b>500</b> so as not to cover the top face of the convex part. Thus, in the concave and convex area <b>500</b>, the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> is not formed on the surface of the top face of the convex part, and the surface of the touch electrode <b>25</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Thereafter, an alignment process is performed. The alignment process is performed by, for example, a rubbing process. In addition to this, the alignment process such as a photo-alignment process, an ion beam alignment process, or a grating alignment process may be performed. Incidentally, for example, when the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> induces vertical orientation and the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> is brought into the vertical orientation mode, it is not necessary to separately perform the alignment process.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the opposite substrate <b>202</b> on which the respective parts are formed and the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> are bonded to each other. Thereafter, a liquid crystal material is injected between the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> and the opposite substrate <b>202</b> to provide the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>, and the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(Conclusion)</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">As described above, in this embodiment, the touch electrode <b>25</b> to constitute the touch sensor switch SWs is provided to cover the surface of the concave and convex area <b>500</b> in which the plural grooves are formed to be spaced from each other. The liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> is formed by applying the orientation material onto the surface on which the touch electrode <b>25</b> is formed, and the surface of the top face of the convex part of the concave and convex area <b>500</b> is exposed in the touch electrode <b>25</b>. As stated above, in this embodiment, since the touch electrode <b>25</b> is formed along the surface of the concave and convex area <b>500</b>, the surface of the top face of the convex part can be exposed without separately performing the process of removing the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> in this portion.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Thus, in this embodiment, the manufacture efficiency and yield can be improved. Besides, since it is not necessary to introduce a new equipment such as an inkjet equipment, the increase in manufacture cost can be prevented. Besides, in this embodiment, since the touch electrode <b>25</b> provided on the opposite substrate <b>202</b> and the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>t </i>provided on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> can be appropriately electrically connected to each other at the time of contact, the reliability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Besides, in this embodiment, it is preferable that in the state where the touch electrode <b>25</b> is covered, the concave and convex area <b>500</b> is formed such that the width L of the convex part is 0.5 to 5.0 &#x3bc;m, and the width S of the concave part is 0.5 to 5.0 &#x3bc;m. Besides, it is preferable that the distance (height) H between the top face of the convex part and the bottom face of the concave part is 0.5 to 2.0 &#x3bc;m. By doing so, it can be appropriately realized that the surface of the top face of the convex part of the concave and convex area <b>500</b> in the touch electrode <b>25</b> is not covered with the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b> but is exposed.</p>

<p id="p-0266" num="0265">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in this embodiment, a structure of a touch sensor switch SWsf is different from that of Embodiment 2. Specifically, as is understood by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a touch electrode <b>25</b><i>f </i>formed on an opposite substrate <b>202</b> is different from that of Embodiment 2. Besides, a touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>formed on a TFT array substrate <b>201</b> is different from that of Embodiment 2. This embodiment is similar to Embodiment 2 except for this point and points relevant thereto. Thus, the description of duplicate portions is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In the opposite substrate <b>202</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, similarly to Embodiment 2, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>f </i>is formed to be integral with and to have the same laser as a common electrode <b>23</b> on an inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b>. Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>f </i>is provided to cover a top face of an elastic member <b>63</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the elastic member <b>63</b><i>f </i>is provided on the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>2</b> so as to protrude convexly in a direction toward the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">In this embodiment, the elastic member <b>63</b><i>f </i>is formed so that its height is equal to a column spacer SP in the state where the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>f </i>is covered.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">In the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>is provided to cover the surface of a concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f </i>is formed on a bottom face of a concave area <b>72</b><i>f </i>provided on the surface of the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>1</b>. That is, the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>1</b> is formed so that the height of the surface of the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f </i>where the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>is formed is lower than the surface of an area other than the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f. </i></p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">For example, in the inter-layer insulating film Sz<b>1</b> made of a photosensitive material, a portion where the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f </i>is to be formed is removed by a photolithography technique, so that the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f </i>is provided. In addition to this, the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f </i>may be formed by, for example, a nanoinprint method.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>f </i>is formed by applying an orientation material onto the surface on which a pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>and the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>are formed. In this embodiment, similarly to Embodiment 2, since a convex part and a concave part are alternately provided on the surface of the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f</i>, a film of the orientation material is not formed on a top face of the convex part. Thus, the surface of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>positioned on the convex part is exposed.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">(Conclusion)</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">As described above, in this embodiment, similarly to Embodiment 2, the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>is formed along the surface of the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f</i>. Thus, in this embodiment, the surface of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tf </i>can be exposed on the top face of the convex part without separately performing a process of removing the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>f </i>of this portion. Thus, in this embodiment, the manufacture efficiency and yield can be improved, and the increase in manufacture cost can be prevented. Besides, the reliability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Particularly, in this embodiment, similarly to Embodiment 5, since the height of the concave and convex area <b>500</b><i>f </i>can be adjusted at high precision by adjusting the exposure amount in the photolithography technique, a variation of a sensor gap &#x394;df can be suppressed. That is, it becomes unnecessary to specify the sensor gap &#x394;df by adjusting the height of the elastic member <b>63</b><i>f </i>by an application condition (number of rotations, etc.) in a spin coat method. Thus, in this embodiment, the above effects can be more appropriately obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Incidentally, in the above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the description is made on the case where the elastic member <b>63</b><i>f </i>and the column spacer SP are separately formed, no limitation is made to this.</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0277">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, an elastic member <b>63</b><i>f </i>and a column spacer SPf may be formed in a same process.</p>

Thereafter, a touch electrode <b>25</b><i>f </i>and a common electrode <b>23</b> are formed, and then, a liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b><i>f </i>is formed.</p>

<p id="p-0320" num="0319">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is sandwiched between the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> and the opposite substrate <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Liquid crystal molecules (not shown) of the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> are oriented by the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>formed on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> and the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>2</b><i>g </i>formed on the opposite substrate <b>202</b>. For example, the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is formed such that the liquid crystal molecules are vertically oriented. That is, the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is formed such that the liquid crystal display mode is a VA (Vertical Align) mode.

<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Hereinafter, in the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>, an operation to detect a position where a detection target object, such as a finger of a user or the like, comes into contact with the display area PA of the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">At the time of detection of a contact position, precharge is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">The control section <b>401</b> controls the respective parts so as to execute the following precharge.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a voltage (xVcom) having a polarity opposite to a voltage (Vcom) applied to the Vcom line CL is applied in advance to the first signal line SL<b>1</b> through the switch SWw<b>1</b>. A voltage (Vcom) having the same polarity as the voltage (Vcom) applied to the Vcom line CL is applied in advance to the second signal line SL<b>2</b> through the switch SWw<b>2</b>. Thereafter, the switch SWw<b>1</b> on the side of the first signal line SL<b>1</b> is brought into OFF state, such that the first signal line SL<b>1</b> is electrically put into a floating state.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">Next, a contact position where the detection target object comes into contact with the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The control section <b>401</b> controls the respective parts so as to execute the following contact position detection operation.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">Specifically, after the precharge is executed, a signal is supplied so as to change a gate voltage of the gate line GL to an activation level (in this example, high level), such that the pixel switching elements <b>31</b> respectively connected to the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are brought into the ON state. Then, the switch SWr connected to the first signal line SL<b>1</b> is brought in the ON state, and a sensor signal is output from the first signal line SL<b>1</b> to the reading circuit RC. The reading circuit RC detects the contact position on the basis of the sensor signal.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">For example, when the detection target object comes into contact with the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g</i>, and the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>comes into contact with the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, as will be understood from the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the touch sensor switch SWsg is brought in the ON state. In this case, the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are electrically connected to each other and short-circuited. For this reason, between the first signal line SL<b>1</b> and the second signal line SL<b>2</b> precharged as described above, a current flows from the second signal line SL<b>2</b> to the first signal line SL<b>1</b> through the touch sensor switch SWsg. Therefore, the potential of the first signal line SL<b>1</b> in the floating state changes.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">When no external pressure is not applied to the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g</i>, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>is not brought into contact with the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, and the touch sensor switch SWsg is in the OFF state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, unlike the above description, the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are not electrically short-circuited. For this reason, no current flows between the first signal line SL<b>1</b> and the second signal line SL<b>2</b>, so the potential of the first signal line SL<b>1</b> in the floating state does not change.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">As described above, the potential of the first signal line SL<b>1</b> differs depending on presence/absence of contact of the detection target object. For this reason, the position detection section <b>402</b> detects, on the basis of the position of the first signal line SL<b>1</b>, the contact position where the detection target object comes into contact with the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">In the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b>, in addition to the position detection operation, an image display operation is performed. The position detection operation and the image display operation are alternately and repeatedly executed.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">At the time of image display, the scanning signal is supplied from the gate line GL to the gate of the pixel switching element <b>31</b> so as to control the switching operation of the pixel switching element <b>31</b>. Then, the video signal is written from the writing circuit WC to the pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>through write switches SWw<b>1</b> and SWw<b>2</b>, the signal line SL, and the pixel switching element <b>31</b> in that order, thereby executing image display.</p>

<p id="p-0335" num="0334">When the detection target object comes into contact with the side of the opposite substrate <b>202</b> opposite to the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> and the opposite substrate <b>202</b> is pressed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A and 26B</figref>, the opposite substrate <b>202</b> is deformed and moved toward the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. At this time, with the deformation of the opposite substrate <b>202</b>, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>provided on the side of the opposite substrate <b>202</b> facing the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b> is moved toward the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. Then, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>comes into contact with the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>provided on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. In this way, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>provided on the opposite substrate <b>202</b> comes into contact with the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>provided on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>, so the touch sensor switch SWsg is brought into the ON state.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">That is, when a touch operation is made on the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>with a pressing force equal to or larger than an operation start pressure, a sensor gap is reduced, the touch electrodes <b>25</b><i>g </i>and <b>62</b><i>t </i>on both substrates <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> come into contact with each other, and the touch sensor switch SWsg is brought into the ON state.</p>

<p id="p-0340" num="0339">Hereinafter, a method of forming the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>which is a main part of the liquid crystal display device will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27C</figref> are sectional views showing a process of forming the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>in the liquid crystal display device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 7 of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A to 27C</figref> show a main part and the illustration of some members is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27A</figref>, the inter-layer insulating film Sz is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">The inter-layer insulating film Sz is formed by applying photosensitive resin (not shown). For example, after positive sensitive acryl resin is applied, a pre-bake process is executed so as to form the inter-layer insulating film Sz.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>, the pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>and the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">The pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>and the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are formed by forming a transparent conductive film on the surface of the inter-layer insulating film Sz and patterning. For example, an ITO film is formed by a sputtering method and then patterned by a photolithography technique so as to form the pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>and the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg. </i></p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>, the groove TR is formed in the inter-layer insulating film Sz.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The inter-layer insulating film Sz made of photosensitive resin is patterned by a photolithography technique so as to form the groove TR.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Specifically, an exposure process is executed by a photo mask on which a mask pattern is formed. In this exposure process, exposure light is irradiated to a portion where the groove is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">After the exposure process is executed, a development process is executed. Thereafter, a back process is performed so as to volatilize a remaining solvent in the inter-layer insulating film Sz or a low-molecular-weight non-polymerized component. By doing so, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27C</figref>, the groove TR is formed in the inter-layer insulating film Sz.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">The liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>is formed by applying an application liquid containing a material for an orientation film onto the pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>and the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>. For example, an application liquid in which polyimide is dissolved as a material for an orientation film is applied by a spin coat method. Then, a pre-bake process is executed so as to volatilize a solvent in an application film, and a back process is executed so as to remove a remaining solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, since the groove TR is provided between a pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, when the application liquid containing the material for an orientation film is applied, the application liquid enters the groove TR, and is not formed such that the top face of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg </i>around the groove TR is covered with the application film. That is, since the application liquid enters the groove TR by the effect of surface tension or gravity, no application film is formed on the top face of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg </i>around the groove TR. For this reason, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>is formed such that, while the pixel electrode <b>62</b><i>p </i>is covered with the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g</i>, the surface of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg </i>is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">After the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>is formed in the above-described manner, an alignment process is executed. For example, the alignment process is executed by a rubbing process. In addition, an alignment process, such as a photo-alignment process, an ion beam alignment process, or a grating alignment process, may be executed. For example, when the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>induces vertical alignment and the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>is brought into the VA (Vertical Align) mode, it is not necessary to separately perform the alignment process.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the opposite substrate <b>202</b> on which the respective parts are formed and the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> are bonded to each other. Thereafter, a liquid crystal material is injected between the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> and the opposite substrate <b>202</b> to provide the liquid crystal layer <b>203</b>. Thus, the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>is completed.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">(Conclusion)</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">As described above, in this embodiment, the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>is deformed by the external pressure such that the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>comes into contact with a pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>so as to electrically connect the pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>to each other. The touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>of the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> are provided on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> with the inter-layer insulating film (under layer) Sz having the concave groove TR intervening therebetween. The liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>is formed such that, when the application liquid containing the orientation material is applied onto the surface on which the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are formed, the application liquid enters the concave groove TR, and the top face of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg </i>is not covered therewith. Specifically, the inter-layer insulating film (under layer) Sz is provided such that the groove TR is located between the pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, and the pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are formed such that the surfaces thereof around the groove TR are not covered with the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">For this reason, in this embodiment, the surface of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg </i>can be exposed without separately executing a process of removing the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>from the surface of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg</i>. Therefore, in this embodiment, manufacturing efficiency and yield can be improved, and an increase in manufacturing costs can be suppressed. Further, the reliability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">In this embodiment, in the opposite substrate <b>202</b>, the convex part CO is formed on the xy plane facing the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. The flat area HR is formed at the top face of the convex part CO facing the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. The touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>constituting the touch sensor switch SWsg is formed as an independent pattern on the flat area HR while not being formed in an area other than the flat area HR on the convex part CO. Therefore, as described above, the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>can be prevented from being disconnected even when being repeatedly used, so the reliability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">In this embodiment, when the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>g </i>is deformed by the external pressure, the touch sensor switch SWsg is configured such that the single touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>comes into contact with the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>so as to electrically connect the two touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">That is, the touch sensor switch SWsg of this embodiment is a two-point contact type, not a one-point contact type. In the case of a one-point contact type, when a conductive foreign substance exists at the one-point contact position and short-circuit constantly occurs, position detection becomes difficult. However, since the touch sensor switch SWsg is a two-point contact type, even when short-circuit occurs between the one upper touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>and one of the two lower touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, if no external pressure is applied, the two lower touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>can be maintained in the open state.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Therefore, in this embodiment, position detection can be accurately executed.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">In this embodiment, it is preferable that the convex part CO has a tapered shape to have a tapered angle &#x3b8; equal to or smaller than 70&#xb0;. When the tapered angle exceeds 70&#xb0;, the displacement of the convex part CO increases, and the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>may be disconnected.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0361"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a view showing a relation between the tapered angle &#x3b8; of the convex part and the displacement x (m) in Embodiment 7 of the invention. A simulation result with respect to the displacement of the convex part CO using ANSYS, which is an FEM structure analysis simulator is shown. In this simulation, as the center condition of the convex part CO, the Young's modulus is 3.5 GPa, and the Poission's ratio is 0.38. The size of the bottom face of the convex part CO is 35 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;15 &#x3bc;m, and the height of the convex part CO is 2.5 &#x3bc;m. The simulation result when the displacement refers to a distance of deformation of the upper end of the convex part is shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, &#x201c;pressure&#x201d; represents a pressure to be applied at the time of the simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0362"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref> are sectional views showing a case where the convex part CO is deformed depending on the tapered angle &#x3b8; in Embodiment 7 of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0363">As a result of the simulation as described above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, when the tapered angle &#x3b8; is 68&#xb0;, the displacement&#xd7;(m) is minimized. When the tapered angle &#x3b8; is in the range of 78&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, the displacement&#xd7;(m) increases. As the tapered angle &#x3b8; of the convex part CO decreases from 90&#xb0; to 45&#xb0;, the side face of the convex part which is deformed in the transverse direction is changed to a state where the top face is depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, when the convex part has no tapered shape (tapered angle &#x3b8;=90&#xb0;), the side face of the convex part is deformed in the transverse direction. The bottom part of the convex part CO has small deformation, but the top face of the convex part CO is deformed so as to be expanded outwardly and the deformation increases. When the convex part has no tapered shape, tensile stress is applied such that the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>formed at the top face of the convex part CO is expanded in the transverse direction, so the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>may be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, when the convex part has a tapered shape, the side face of the convex part is hardly to be deformed by the external pressure, and the convex part can be deformed such that the top face thereof is depressed. In particular, if the tapered angle &#x3b8; of the convex part CO is equal to or smaller than 70&#xb0;, the convex part can be depressed such that the top face thereof can be easily deformed, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the displacement of the convex part CO can be controlled. For this reason, little tensile stress is applied to expand the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>formed at the top face of the convex part CO in the transverse direction, so the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>can be effectively prevented from being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0366">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, it is preferable that the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>is formed in an area away from a tapered area TP inwardly by a distance equal to or larger than a width L<b>1</b> of the tapered area TP of the convex part CO. That is, it is preferable that a distance L<b>2</b> between the end of the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>and an inflection point when the top face of the convex part CO is inflexed to the side face inclined in a tapered shape is equal to or larger than the width L<b>1</b> between the inflexion point and the point of the end where the side face of the convex part is located near the opposite substrate <b>202</b>. In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, in this area, the top face of the convex part CO is depressed by the external pressure. For this reason, stress is hardly to concentrate on the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>formed in this area, so the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>can be prevented from being damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0367">In addition, it is preferable that the convex part CO is formed such that the Young's modulus is in a range of 1 to 5 GPa, and the Poission's ratio is in a range of 0.36 to 0.40.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0368">When the Poission's ratio is set to 0.38 as the center condition of the convex part CO, and similarly to the above description, a simulation is executed, the displacement has no change in the above-described range of the Poission's ratio. When the Young's modulus is set to 3.5 GPa as the center condition of the convex part CO, and similarly to the above description, a simulation is executed, the displacement has no change in the above-described range of the Poission's ratio. Therefore, the above-described range is preferable.</p>

For this reason, when the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>of the opposite substrate <b>202</b> comes into contact with the exposed surface of each of the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, position detection is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">In this modified example, the entire occupying area can be reduced, as compared with modified examples 9 to 12.</p>

<p id="p-0423" num="0422">In the case of modified examples 9 to 13, as described above, the exposed portion of each of the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>of the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> extending in the y direction and the touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>of the opposite substrate <b>202</b> come into contact with each other, and the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are electrically connected to each other.

<p id="p-0440" num="0439">As described above, in this embodiment, similarly to Embodiment 7, the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>of the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> are provided on the TFT array substrate <b>201</b> with an inter-layer insulating film (under layer) Sz having a concave groove TR intervening therebetween. A liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>is formed such that, when an application liquid containing an orientation material is applied onto the surface on which the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are formed, the application liquid enters the concave groove TR, and the top face of the touch electrode <b>62</b><i>tg </i>is exposed while not being covered therewith. Specifically, the inter-layer insulating film (under layer) Sz is provided such that the groove TR is located between a pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>, and the pair of touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>are formed such that the surface around the groove TR is exposed while not being covered with the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g. </i></p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0440">For this reason, in this embodiment, the surface of each of the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg </i>can be exposed without separately executing a process of removing the liquid crystal orientation film HM<b>1</b><i>g </i>from the surface of each of the touch electrodes <b>62</b><i>tg</i>. Therefore, in this embodiment, manufacturing efficiency and yield can be improved, and an increase in manufacturing costs can be suppressed. Further, the reliability of the device can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0441">In this embodiment, the liquid crystal panel <b>200</b><i>h </i>is an FFS system, but as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, similarly to Embodiment 7, a convex part CO is formed on the xy plane of the opposite substrate <b>202</b> facing the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, a flat area HR is provided at the top face of the convex part CO facing the TFT array substrate <b>201</b>. The touch electrode <b>25</b><i>g </i>constituting the touch sensor switch SWsg is formed on the flat area HR as an independent pattern while not being formed in an area other than the flat area HR on the convex part CO. Therefore, in this embodiment, similarly to Embodiment 7, the touch electrodes <b>25</b><i>g </i>can be prevented from being disconnected, so the reliability of the device can be improved.</p>
