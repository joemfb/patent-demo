<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to biodiesel production through transesterfication of vegetable oils and animal fats with non-basic, non-acidic homogeneous organo-metallic catalysts having the general formula M(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x </sub>wherein M is a selected metal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Biodiesel is produced commercially from vegetable oils and/or animal fat through transesterification with alcohol to convert triglycerides into alkyl esters of the fatty acids (biodiesel) and glycerol using a basic homogeneous catalyst, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium acetate. Because base-catalyzed reactions are very sensitive to the presence of free fatty acids (FFAs), they are unsuitable for unrefined oils with FFA contents higher than about 3%. Moreover, to prevent saponification during the transesterification reaction, FFA and water contents in the oil feed should be less than 0.5 and 0.05 wt %, respectively, which means that essentially only pure vegetable oils can be used. High FFA levels in the oil feed also deplete the base catalyst through acid-base neutralization reactions. Base-catalyzed reactions also require that the NaOH catalyst be neutralized with acid and removed from the reactor effluent with a water wash. The resulting salt byproduct from the acid/base neutralization must then be separated from the biodiesel product. Finally, water produced in the reaction promotes saponification of the fatty acids with the NaOH catalyst which renders phase separations among the products (biodiesel and glycerol) and the salts even more difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Homogeneous acid catalysts have also been employed in transesterification reactions for biodiesel production but acid-catalyzed reactions are slow and generally less suitable for large scale operations. Although the performance of the acid catalyst is not affected by the presence of FFA in the oil or fat feedstock, nevertheless, the process requires a high alcohol-to-oil mole ratio and long reaction times due to the low activity of the acid catalyst. When using a base or an acid catalyst, the transesterification process, which occurs in a corrosive environment, requires costly neutralization, water wash, filtration, and solid waste disposal steps to remove the spent catalyst from the biodiesel and glycerol product streams.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is directed to neutral, non-corrosive homogeneous catalysts for transesterification of triglycerides through a non-basic, non-acidic reaction mechanism. The inventive techniques can be implemented in a simple, inexpensive process that does not require the troublesome neutralization, water wash, filtration, and solid disposal operations for spent catalyst removal associated with conventional transesterification techniques using base or acid catalysts. The non-basic, non-acidic homogeneous catalysts are organo-metallic compounds containing at least one &#x2014;OCH<sub>3 </sub>functional group for effectively catalyzing the transesterification and esterification reactions simultaneously for directly producing biodiesel from the vegetable oils, animal oils and fats or waste cooking oils having high FFA content.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention is directed to a process for producing biodiesel through transesterification that includes:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">contacting a triglyceride-containing vegetable or animal oil with an aliphatic mono-alcohol containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms and a homogenous catalyst to effect transesterification to yield a mixture containing a fatty acid alkyl ester and glycerol wherein the homogenous catalyst is a non-basic, non-acidic organo-metallic compound having the formula: M(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x </sub>wherein M is metal that is selected from the group consisting of B, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Al, Sn, Sb, Mo, Ag, and Cd and x is an integer from 2, 3 or 4.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is based in part on the demonstration that the weak base, potassium tetrahydroboron (KBH<sub>4</sub>) is capable of catalyzing the transesterification reaction between soybean oil and methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) to produce methyl ester of the fatty acids (the biodiesel) with an activity that is comparable to that of conventional homogeneous NaOH (or KOH) catalyst. It is known that the KBH<sub>4 </sub>reacts with CH<sub>3</sub>OH to form potassium tetramethoxyborate (KB(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>). From this initial observation concerning KBH<sub>4</sub>, the following reaction mechanisms are postulated:</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001">
<img id="EMI-C00001" he="81.53mm" wi="74.34mm" file="US08624073-20140107-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/>
</chemistry>
<br/>
In Reaction (1), KBH<sub>4 </sub>and CH<sub>3</sub>OH form KB(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>which decomposes into B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and KOCH<sub>3 </sub>as depicted in Reaction (2). The presence of B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>in an reactor effluent was confirmed by gas chromatographic-mass (GC-Mass) analysis whereas KOCH<sub>3 </sub>was not detected. This is likely due to the basic nature of KOCH<sub>3 </sub>and its propensity to disassociate into K<sup>+</sup> and OCH<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> species through a mechanism that is similar that of the basic KOH catalyst. It is expected that Reactions (1) and (2) occur and both B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and KOCH<sub>3 </sub>catalyze the transesterification reactions between soybean oil and methanol, according to Reactions (3) and (4), to produce fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) and glycerol, in each reaction.
</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To evaluate the feasibility of using B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>to catalyze transesterification reactions, a mixture of vegetable oil and methanol, with an oil-to-alcohol mole ratio of 1:6, was mixed with 5 wt % amount of B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and introduced to an autoclave. The autoclave was operated at a pressure of 14.6 bar to carry out the batch transesterification reaction at temperatures ranging from 130 to 230&#xb0; C. The reaction time was two hours. After the reaction, the content was analyzed for conversion and selectivity of the catalyst. It was found that B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>exhibited significant activity and selectivity for catalyzing the transesterification reaction between the vegetable oil and methanol. Since the catalyst was not consumed it can be recycled for reuse. When it is incorporated into continuous processes, the catalyst performance can be enhanced by increasing the catalyst and alcohol circulation rate to at least match the performance of the conventional homogeneous base catalyst, including the highly active NaOH or KOH catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It was further demonstrated that other organo-metallic compounds containing the &#x2014;OCH<sub>3 </sub>functional groups, e.g., (M(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x</sub>), exhibited activity for catalyzing transesterification reactions. Ti(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Sb(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Ge(OCh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Al(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and Cu(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>were individually tested in an autoclave using the same vegetable oil and under the same conditions as for B(OCH)<sub>3 </sub>set forth herein. The results showed that Ti(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Sb(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, Ge(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>exhibited high activity and selectivity at levels that are comparable to that of a basic catalyst, such as NaOH (or KOH) for catalyzing the transesterification reaction between the vegetable oil and the alcohol whereas Al(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and Cu(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>exhibited lower activity and selectivity. The selection of suitable homogeneous catalysts for continuous processes may also depend on their physical properties some which are listed in Table 1. All six catalysts were commercially chemical compounds available from Sigma-Aldrich Co.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The data show that the Ti, Sb, Al and Cu based catalysts are solids at room temperature with melting points ranging from 125 to 210&#xb0; C., except B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and Ge(OCH)<sub>4</sub>, which partially soluble in the oil or alcohol including methanol. Experimental results show that the quantities of M(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x </sub>used in the process are within the solubility limits of the M(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x </sub>used in the oil feeds and/or alcohols, so they remain in the liquid solution throughout the process loop in a continuous process without precipitating from the solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Based on the experimental data for the above described species, it is expected that other organo-metallic compounds can be used to generate biodiesel through transesterification as well.

A mixture of two or different organo-metallic compounds can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One advantages of using B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and Ge(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>as the homogeneous catalyst is their, low boiling points of 68 and 66&#xb0; C., respectively. With low boiling points, the catalysts circulated in process the loop with access amounts of alcohol, preferably methanol (boiling point 65&#xb0; C.) thereby affording easy recovery and recycling of the catalyst for reuse. B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>is particularly preferred because of its low toxicity and relatively low cost.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The conventional transesterification process as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> using basic or acid homogeneous catalyst to produce biodiesel from a vegetable oil is a complicated process than that of the present invention which uses the novel recyclable catalysts. The inventive process is simpler and does not need to contend with phase separation, acid-base neutralization, salt filtration, and waste disposal. In a continuous biodiesel producing process, the neutral low-boiling homogeneous organo-metallic catalysts of the present invention will exhibit a significantly higher catalytic activity for transesterifying vegetable oil or fat into biodiesel as compared to conventional base or acid homogenous catalysts. In addition, the continuous process of the present invention employs a non-corrosive process system due to the organo-metallic catalyst's neutral property. The catalyst and product can be readily separated due to the catalysts' low boiling points and the catalysts can be recycled for reuse due to their low boiling points and high stabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The transesterfication reaction of the present invention can also be effected in a batch reactor such as an autoclave.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Under the above reactor conditions, it was demonstrated that the catalytic activity of KBH<sub>4 </sub>is comparable to that of the conventional strong base catalyst, NaOH, with a conversion of 93%. The advantages of using KBH<sub>4 </sub>catalyst over using NaOH catalyst include exposing the process equipment to less corrosive environment and easy of phase separation between bio-diesel and glycerol (which a potential problem associated with the NaOH catalyst) by avoiding the occurrence soponification reaction in the reaction mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The relationship of transesterification conversion catalyzed by KBH<sub>4 </sub>catalyst versus reaction time is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which shows that the conversion is directly proportional to the reaction time up to two hours.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Catalytic Activity of Homogeneous B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>Catalyst</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is shown that B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>can be generated through the reaction of KBH<sub>4 </sub>and CH<sub>3</sub>OH as expressed in Reactions (1) and (2). Therefore, at least a part of catalytic activity of KBH<sub>4 </sub>for transesterification reaction demonstrated in Example 1 can be attributed to the presence of B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>species that are generated in the autoclave during the experimental run. The other part of the activity can be caused by KOCH<sub>3</sub>, a weak base catalyst. To determine the activity of B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, an experimental run was conducted by using B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>directly for catalyzing the transesterification reaction of a vegetable oil with methanol. In particular, 134 grams of soybean oil and 28 grams of methanol (under O/M of 1:6), and 5 wt % B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>were added to the autoclave. The transesterification reactions were conducted under a mixing rate of 250 rpm, pressure of 14.6 bar and temperatures of 130&#xb0; C., 180&#xb0; C. and 230&#xb0; C. for two hours.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The conversion and catalyst selectivity at different temperatures were determined by GC analysis of reactor effluent and presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> which shows that the B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>catalyst can achieve 7% conversion with 50% selectivity at 130&#xb0; C. However, both conversion and selectivity increased significantly to 54% and 90%, respectively, when the reaction temperature was increased to 230&#xb0; C. The data confirm that B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>does have significant catalytic activity for converting vegetable oil into biodiesel. Additional experimental runs under various conditions were carried out to optimize the performance of B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>in the autoclave. A conversion of 60% with 84% selectivity was observed under an O/M ratio of 1:6 and a reaction temperature of 230&#xb0; C. It is not surprising that, under the same O/M and reaction time, KBH<sub>4 </sub>is more active than B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>at even lower temperatures, because it generates two catalytic species, namely: (B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and KOCH<sub>3</sub>), that catalyze the transesterification reaction. However, as mentioned earlier, KBH<sub>4 </sub>has the same drawback as the conventional basic catalyst because the existence of KOCH<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>is not consumed in the reaction and can be recycled for reuse, larger amounts of the catalyst can be mixed into the methanol feed to raise its solubility in the oil phase. This leads to enhanced mass transfer rates as well as achieving essentially 100% catalytic conversion of the oil feed into biodiesel in a process with multi-stage stirrer tank reactors or multi-stage tubular reactors Again, it was observed that phase separation between bio-diesel and glycerol was readily achieved and facilitated by avoiding soponification in the reaction mixture, which would otherwise occur if a basic catalyst were used.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown, the conversion and selectivity under Ti(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>are quite impressive, 99.07 and 93.72 wt %, respectively. The catalysts Sb(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>and Ge(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>also performed well as compared to the conventional basic catalyst NaOH (or KOH) whereas Al(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>and Cu(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>showed relatively poorer performance. The conversion and selectivity are also presented graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Again, for each catalyst it was observed that phase separation between bio-diesel and glycerol was readily achieved by avoiding the occurrence soponification reaction in the reaction mixture. This example demonstrates that the functional group &#x2014;OCH<sub>3 </sub>in the homogeneous catalyst of B(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3 </sub>or M(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>x </sub>is critical to the catalytic activity of transesterification reaction between vegetable oil or animal fat with the alcohol to produce biodiesel.</p>
