<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to corn heads for use with combines and more specifically to an accessory for corn heads.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Corn heads are commonly attached to combines in order to harvest corn. The corn head removes ears of corn from the stalks and conveys them to a collection container within the combine. Gathering points, which are located on the front of the corn head, guide each row of corn into a row unit of the corn head. Once within the row unit, snapping chains break off the stalks. The ears, as well as debris, move rearward in the corn head to a cross auger, which conveys the ears and debris to a collection chamber in the combine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Combine operators routinely encounter difficulties when harvesting corn. One such difficulty is a build up of debris in front of a feeder house opening to the combine. This debris is made up of corn stalks, leaves, and &#x201c;fluff&#x201d; (fine particles of ground up stalks and leaves). Advances in plant science caused an increase in the amount of debris experienced by the combine operator. For example, today's corn varieties retain their leaves longer, and are planted more densely. Corn yields have also been increased, at least in part, by genetic improvements to the corn plant. A yield increase has brought with it larger, healthier corn plants that produce larger amounts of debris that may potentially break off the stalk. Severe debris buildup occurs in dry harvest conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, a corn head includes a frame, an auger, and a finger. The frame includes a feeder house opening and a trough located in front of the feeder house opening. The auger is rotatably mounted in the trough and includes a tube and flighting for directing material into the feeder house opening. The finger is attached to the auger and extends radially outward from the auger. The finger is flexible and rotates along with the auger.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, an attachment for a combine includes an auger and a finger. The auger has flighting for directing material to a feeder house opening. The flighting extends radially a first distance from the auger. The finger has a fixed end secured to the auger adjacent the flighting, and a free end extending radially a second distance from the auger. The second distance for the finger is greater than the first distance for the flighting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another embodiment, a corn head includes plurality of snouts, a plurality of row units, a frame, an auger, and a finger. The snouts are located at a front of the corn head. Each snout includes a gathering point for guiding material into the corn head. The row units are located behind the snouts. Each row unit includes a bonnet attached to one of the snouts and chains beneath the bonnet for conveying the material rearward along the corn head. The frame is located behind the row units. The frame includes a trough for collecting material received from the plurality of row units and a feeder house opening for transferring the material to a combine. The auger is rotatably mounted in the trough. The auger includes a tube and flighting extending radially from the tube for directing the material into the feeder house opening. The finger is attached to the auger. The finger extends radially outward from the auger and contacts the trough during rotation.</p>

Snouts <b>22</b> act as teeth of a comb by guiding single rows of corn stalks into corn head <b>10</b>. After passing through snouts <b>22</b>, corn encounters row units (not visible), which are protected by bonnets <b>22</b>. The row units cut stalks while passing corn material rearward to auger <b>14</b> rotating within frame <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Frame <b>16</b> includes back panel <b>24</b>, which extends vertically and defines a rear of corn head <b>10</b>. Located in an approximate center of back panel <b>24</b> is feeder house opening <b>26</b>, which opens to the combine. Extending forward from back panel <b>24</b> is trough <b>28</b>. Auger <b>14</b> is rotatably mounted within trough <b>28</b>. Corn exits row units beneath bonnets <b>20</b> and is conveyed centrally within trough <b>28</b> by the rotation of auger <b>14</b>. More specifically, auger <b>14</b> moves corn toward feeder house opening <b>26</b>, for exiting corn head <b>10</b> and entering a grain processing unit of the combine. Auger <b>14</b> has flighting which is slanted centrally from both ends toward feeder house opening <b>26</b>, which insures central movement of corn and debris.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Corn head <b>10</b> can become blocked by build-up of debris. Stalks, weeds, fluff (i.e. fine particles of ground up stalks) or other material tends to accumulate on top of corn head <b>10</b> and/or in auger <b>14</b> and trough <b>28</b>. This blockage prevents the free flow of ears from corn head <b>10</b> to the combine via feeder house opening <b>26</b>. Debris buildup is further exacerbated by dry field conditions. The task of manually dislodging debris is time consuming and can result in injury to the operator. In the present disclosure, corn head <b>10</b> is equipped with an accessory for automatically reducing debris accumulation. Namely, finger <b>12</b> is attached to auger <b>14</b> and rotates therewith to continually encourage debris movement toward feeder house opening <b>26</b>. A plurality of fingers <b>12</b> can be attached to auger <b>14</b> where each finger is aligned centrally with a row unit. Use of one or more fingers <b>12</b> reduces the likelihood of corn head <b>10</b> becoming plugged and no longer functioning as intended.</p>

Depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are finger <b>12</b>, auger <b>14</b>, frame <b>16</b>, side board <b>18</b>, bonnets <b>20</b>, back panel <b>24</b>, and trough <b>28</b>. Finger has fixed end <b>30</b> and free end <b>32</b>. Auger <b>14</b> includes tube <b>34</b> and flighting <b>36</b>. Back panel <b>24</b> has top <b>38</b> and bottom <b>40</b>. Also shown are chains <b>42</b> and gearbox <b>44</b> for a row unit beneath bonnet <b>20</b>. Finger <b>12</b> is attached to auger <b>14</b> and rotates along with auger <b>14</b> to prevent debris accumulation in and around trough <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Finger <b>12</b> is substantially rectangular and defined by fixed end <b>30</b> and an opposite free end <b>32</b>. Fixed end <b>30</b> of finger <b>12</b> is attached to auger <b>14</b>. Auger <b>14</b> has tube <b>34</b> extending horizontally across trough <b>28</b> in a direction perpendicular to back panel <b>24</b>. Both ends of tube <b>34</b> are attached to frame <b>16</b>. Flighting <b>36</b>, a helical blade, is spirals along tube <b>34</b>. Flighting <b>36</b> extends outwardly a first distance D<b>1</b> from tube <b>34</b>. Fixed end <b>30</b> of finger <b>12</b> is attached to either tube <b>34</b> or flighting <b>36</b> and extends outwardly to free end <b>32</b>, which is located a second distance D<b>2</b> from tube <b>34</b>. Free end <b>32</b> of finger <b>12</b> extends beyond flighting <b>36</b>. In other words, distance D<b>2</b> (tube <b>34</b> to free end <b>32</b>) is greater than distance D<b>1</b> (tube <b>34</b> to end of flighting <b>36</b>). In the depicted embodiment, D<b>2</b> is approximately twice D<b>1</b>. Back panel <b>24</b> of frame <b>16</b> is substantially vertical and bounded by top <b>38</b> and bottom <b>40</b>. Bottom <b>40</b> is attached to a rear side of trough <b>28</b> and can include a stripper bar <b>98</b>. Attached to a front side of trough <b>28</b> are row units located under bonnets <b>20</b>. The row units include chains <b>42</b> that are driven by gearbox <b>44</b>. Gearbox <b>44</b> is the rearmost component of row unit and is therefore, attached to front end of trough <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Finger <b>12</b> is attached to either tube <b>34</b> or flighting <b>36</b> and therefore, rotates along with auger <b>14</b>. Finger <b>12</b> is formed from a flexible, yet durable material (e.g. metal, cable, belting, plastic, rubber) and is configured to bend during rotation of auger <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a still image of auger <b>14</b> at one moment of rotation when finger <b>12</b> is pointed substantially vertically upwards, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a still image of auger <b>14</b> at an approximately opposite side of a single rotation when finger <b>12</b> is curving (dotted line) and rebounding (solid line) at a forward end of trough <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, free end <b>32</b> extends upwardly in an approximately straight line from fixed end <b>30</b>. As auger <b>14</b> rotates rearward toward back panel <b>24</b>, free end <b>32</b> of finger <b>12</b> contacts top <b>38</b> and then bottom <b>40</b> of back panel <b>24</b>. If a stripper bar is located near bottom <b>40</b>, finger <b>12</b> will also contact the stripper bar. Around the location of attachment between bottom <b>40</b> and rear end of trough <b>28</b>, free end <b>32</b> of finger <b>12</b> begins to bend or curve. Free end <b>32</b> curves because the distance between tube <b>34</b> and a bottom of trough <b>28</b> is less than the distance of finger <b>12</b> extending from auger <b>14</b> or distance D<b>2</b>. As shown by a dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, finger <b>12</b> remains curved while located between auger <b>14</b> and bottom of trough <b>28</b> (see dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Once free end <b>32</b> clears bottom of trough <b>28</b> it rebounds and flings forward to its extended position, as shown by a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. During this rebound, free end <b>32</b> contacts a fill plug on gearbox <b>44</b> between counter-rotating chains <b>42</b> of row units. Continued rotation of auger <b>14</b> returns finger <b>12</b> to the upright position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The bending, rebounding, and extending of finger <b>12</b> during rotation of auger <b>14</b> aids in freeing debris from trough <b>28</b>. Finger <b>12</b> repeatedly contacts debris accumulations with force to break up and free the debris for central movement by auger <b>14</b>.</p>
