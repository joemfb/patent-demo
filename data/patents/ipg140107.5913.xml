<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to turbo decoders, and more specifically, to parallel contention free interleaved access to memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communications such as voice and data. One such system is wide band code division multiple access (WCDMA), which has been adopted in various competing wireless communication standards, e.g. third generation partnership project 3GPP, 3GPP project 2 (3GPP2) and long term evolution 3GPP (LTE 3GPP).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To overcome data corruption that can occur during RF transmission, the different wireless communication standards typically include some form of channel coding, where one common channel coding technique is turbo coding.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Turbo coding involves the use of a turbo encoder for encoding a code segment (i.e. a data packet) and a turbo decoder for the decoding of the encoded code segment. A turbo encoder typically includes a pair of convolutional encoders, one of which receives information bits (i.e. systematic bits) while the other convolutional encoder receives interleaved information bits. The information bits are shuffled (interleaved) in accordance with a specified interleaving scheme. The pair of convolutional encoders output two sequences of parity bits that are modulated and transmitted to a receiver. The systematic bits are also modulated and transmitted to the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates prior art turbo decoder <b>100</b>. Turbo decoding is performed by an iterative process in which so called extrinsic information elements are exchanged between sub-blocks (also referred to as a processing units) <b>120</b> of turbo decoder <b>100</b>. Extrinsic information elements are stored in multiple memory banks <b>110</b> and form a block of a certain size (K). Memory banks <b>110</b> are connected to processing units <b>120</b> via interconnect <b>130</b>. Each processing unit can apply a soft input soft output algorithm. In order to utilize multiple sub-blocks <b>120</b> in an efficient manner the processing units <b>120</b> should operate in a parallel contention free manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various single access contention free interleavers were developed. A single access contention free interleaver can prevent contentions if each processing unit fetches, during a single fetch cycle, a single extrinsic information unit. 3GPP LTE interleavers applies the following interleaving function: phi(x)=(f1*x+f2*x<sup>2</sup>)modulo(K), whereas f1 and f2 are set in response to the value of K.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Single access contention free interleavers limit the access of each processing unit to a certain sub-set of the block. Thus, if there are N processing units, each one can access a single K/N sub-set of information elements. During each access.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The throughput of a turbo decoder can be increased by adding more processing units (increasing N). This solution it is costly as it involves adding processing units. In addition, the quality of the turbo decoding process decreases when the size of the K/N sub-set of information elements decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a growing need to provide turbo decoders that are characterized by a high parallelism and enhanced performance.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A system and method are provided. They are characterized by an interleaved contention free access to multiple memory banks during each fetch cycle. High throughput can be achieved by allowing each processing unit to fetch multiple consecutive interleaved address information elements. The fetching of multiple consecutive interleaved address information elements per a fetch cycle enables to utilize fewer processing element, thus exposing each processing element to a larger sub-set of information elements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that a system, method or a fetching are referred to as WiMax compliant or 3 compliant if the system fetches information elements according to WiMax standard or LTE 3GP standard respectively, if the method (and especially the fetching operation) is performed according to the WiMax standard or LTE 3GP standard. Conveniently, these standards include at least the LTE 3GP standard and the WiMax standard that are at force at January 2008.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is noted that the mentioned below systems and methods can operate in any interleaving scheme where multiple consecutive interleaved address information elements of different parity should be fetched substantially simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a parallel access system <b>200</b>. System <b>200</b> includes: (a) a group of processing entities that includes N processing entities <b>220</b> (denoted <b>220</b>(<b>0</b>) through <b>220</b>(N&#x2212;1)); wherein N is a positive integer; (b) a group of memory banks that stores K information elements and which includes N pairs of single access memory banks (denoted (<b>210</b>(<b>0</b>) through <b>210</b>(N&#x2212;1)).

Each row of the table illustrates a single cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, in both of the configurations represented by tables <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, for processing entities P<b>0</b> through P<b>3</b> access information elements grouped into eight single access memory banks. The access sequence that is indicated for each processing entity P<b>0</b> through P<b>3</b> for two consecutive interleaved address information elements in every cycle (wherein the interleaved address information elements access by each processing unit P<b>0</b> through P<b>3</b> are listed in two columns below the correlating processing entity column caption) is a standard access sequence that is implemented in turbo decoding for K=40 and where eight single access memory banks are present. In both of the tables <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, in the column corresponding to each of the memory banks, the digit 1 denotes that the memory bank was accessed during the cycle represented by the corresponding row, and the digit 0 represents that the memory bank was not accessed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is noted that conveniently, consecutive interleaved address information elements are generated by applying an interleaving function on two consecutive (non-interleaved) addresses. A set of K non-interleaved addresses is divided to N sub-sets of equal length (K/N). Each processing unit <b>220</b> is associated with a unique sub-set of K/N non-interleaved addresses. The different processing units <b>220</b> scan (during multiple fetch cycles) their unique sub-sets of K/N non-interleaved addresses in a sequential manner and after applying the interleaving function access different memory banks. Conveniently, during each fetch cycle each processing unit <b>220</b> fetches two consecutive interleaved address information elements.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The addresses of consecutive interleaved address information elements accessed by each processing unit <b>220</b> are determined according to an interleaved address determination algorithm. In an example (such as the one illustrated by table <b>304</b>), N equals four, K equals forty; and wherein during a j'th fetch cycle a first processing entity fetches a modulo40[(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element and a modulo40[13+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element; a second processing entity fetches a modulo40[30+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element and a modulo40[3+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element; a third processing entity fetches a modulo40[20+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element and a modulo40[33+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element; and a fourth processing entity fetches a modulo40[10+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element and a modulo40[23+(j&#x2212;1)*6]'th information element.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Taking into consideration, by way of example, the first cycle (represented by the first row of data in each of tables <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>), wherein processing entity P<b>0</b> requires access to information elements <b>0</b> and <b>13</b>, processing entity P<b>1</b> requires access to information elements <b>30</b> and <b>3</b>, processing entity P<b>2</b> requires access to information elements <b>20</b> and <b>33</b>, and processing entity P<b>3</b> requires access to information elements <b>10</b> and <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the teaching of the invention, wherein the memory banks are divided into pairs of odd and even memory banks, each single access memory bank (<b>212</b> and <b>214</b>) is accessed once during each cycle. In comparison, according to a standard straight forward method (represented by table <b>302</b>) in which each memory bank <b>110</b> include five consecutive information elements, each of memory banks <b>110</b>(<b>0</b>), <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>6</b>) includes two information elements that need to be read during the first cycle (represented by the first row), and therefore, the first cycle required two reading cycles, wherein in the second reading cycle (represented by the second row of table <b>302</b>) each of memory banks <b>110</b>(<b>0</b>), <b>110</b>(<b>2</b>), <b>110</b>(<b>4</b>) and <b>110</b>(<b>6</b>) is accessed again, to retrieve information from information elements <b>3</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>23</b>. Similarly, for the second access sequence <b>6</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>29</b> (indicated in the third row&#x2014;corresponding to the third reading cycle&#x2014;of table <b>302</b>, and in the second row&#x2014;i.e. reading cycle&#x2014;of table <b>304</b>), again 4 single access memory banks <b>110</b> need to be accessed twice, instead of a single access to each even memory bank <b>212</b> and a single access to each odd memory bank <b>214</b> according to the teaching of the invention, as illustrated in table <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is therefore clear to a person who is skilled in the art that implementing the memory banks according to the teaching of the invention requires less reading cycles of the single access memory banks, and thus expedites the process of turbo decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example (such as the one illustrated by table <b>304</b>), parallel access system <b>200</b> is such wherein K equals forty; and wherein the number or processing entities equals four.

Thus, the description of method <b>500</b> benefits from the description of system <b>200</b>, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Method <b>400</b> starts by stage <b>410</b> of fetching, during each fetch cycle and by each processing entity of a group of N processing entities, a first information element from an odd memory unit of a pair of memory banks and a second information element from an even memory unit of the pair of memory banks. The first and second information elements are two consecutive interleaved address information elements.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The memory banks are single access memory banks. N pairs of memory banks form a group of memory banks. The group of memory banks stores K information elements. Each pair of memory banks includes an even memory bank and an odd memory bank. Each pair of memory banks stores a sub-set of K/N information elements. An even memory bank of each pair of memory banks stores even address information elements of a certain sub-set of K/N information elements and an odd memory bank of each pair of memory banks stores odd address information elements of the certain sub-set of K/N information elements. K/N is an even positive integer. The group of processing entities is connected to the group of memory banks by a non-blocking interconnect.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an example, stage <b>410</b> of fetching is followed by stage <b>420</b> processing the fetched information elements by the group of processing entities.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an example, the stages of fetching and processing are repeated during a turbo decoding process.
