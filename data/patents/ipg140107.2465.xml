<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In this specification, a number of documents including patent applications and manufacturer's manuals is cited. The disclosure of these documents, while not considered relevant for the patentability of this invention, is herewith incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) comprise several important drug targets that are implicated in severe human diseases. In case of the secretin family (subfamily B1) of G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCR) these diseases include osteoporosis, type II diabetes and depression<sup>1,2</sup>. Despite considerable efforts, however, numerous drug discovery programs have been unsuccessful to deliver clinically useful small molecules for the peptidergic class B1 GPCRs so far<sup>1,3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fragments are defined as chemical moieties with a molecular weight of 200-250 Da that can be part of a larger drug-like molecule. They have been proposed as a more systematic alternative to the classical screening procedure<sup>4-6</sup>: (i) Due to their small size, fragments provide a better coverage of the respective chemical space<sup>7</sup>; (ii) fragments have a higher probability to fit into a given binding pocket<sup>8</sup>; and (iii) fragments are likely to have a better binding energy/heavy atom ratio (ligand efficiency)<sup>9 </sup>thus making them better starting points for a drug development process.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The major drawback of fragments is their weak initial affinity which usually is below the detection limit of typical high-throughput screening assays.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,335,155 (Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) describes methods for rapidly identifying small organic molecule ligands for binding to biological target molecules. The target molecule has to contain a thiol group adjacent to the binding site of interest. This thiol group, if not present, has to be introduced. The compounds to be screened for their capability to bind to the site of interest on the target molecule also comprises a thiol group. In case binding of a compound to the site of interest occurs, a disulfide bond will be formed. As such, the method allows to capture&#x2014;and subsequently detect by means of mass spectrometry&#x2014;binding molecules. In case no binding occurs, no disulfide is formed. An increase of the local concentration of potentially binding compounds prior to binding to the site of interest does not occur. In other words, binding at the site of interest has to take place in a first step in order to permit formation of the disulfide bond.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the limitations of the methods described in the prior art, the technical problem underlying the present invention was therefore the provision of means and methods for the identification of potentially pharmaceutically relevant compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, this invention relates to a method of identifying a compound capable of binding to a target domain of a G-protein coupled receptor comprising the steps of: (a) providing a receptor comprising said target domain and a first group linked to said target domain; (b) bringing into contact said receptor of (a) with a test molecule comprising a second group and said compound linked to each other, wherein said first group binds said second group; and (c) determining, subsequent to the binding of said first group to said second group, whether said compound binds to said target domain.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A target domain of a GPCR according to the invention may be any domain. The term &#x201c;domain&#x201d;, as used in the art, refers to an autonomous folding unit which, if removed/cleaved from its context within a protein, maintains or substantially maintains its structure and functions. Domains of GPCRs include the transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain (J-domain), the extracellular domain, if present, which is involved in ligand binding and the intracellular domain, which is involved in signalling leading to cellular effects which may include the formation of one or more second messengers. Domain boundaries are well known to the skilled person and have been described for a number of GPCRs or can be determined from a sequence alignment, preferably a multiple sequence alignment, wherein domains correspond to regions of elevated sequence conservation or identity as compared to linkers, which exhibit a lower degree of sequence conservation or identity are not required for structural and/or functional integrity of isolated domains. Preferred target domains include the transmembrane and the extracellular domain. As regards class B GPCRs, which are preferred according to the invention (see below), Harmar (2001)<sup>2 </sup>provides a multiple sequence alignment of transmembrane domains (FIG. 3 of Harmar (2001)) as well as of extracellular domains (FIG. 4 of Harmar (2001)), which are incorporated by reference. The sequences of the respective domains shown in Harmar (2001) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) represent transmembrane and extracellular domains, respectively, suitable for the method of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;receptor comprising said target domain&#x201d; as used herein is to be held distinct from the specific GPCR the target domain is obtained or derived from. Said receptor comprising said target domain is the vehicle used for the screening method of the invention. It may comprise said target domain as the only proteinaceous component. As further detailed below, it may also comprise further domains obtained or derived from the same GPCR the target domain originates from or from a different GPCR. In the latter case, the receptor comprising said target domain is a chimeric receptor. Specific chimeric receptors are also subject of this invention (see below). The receptor of the invention may also comprise sequence which do not originate from a GPCR such as tags, GFP and leader sequences. It is furthermore deliberately envisaged that said receptor comprising said target domain is selected from naturally occurring GPCRs including class B GPCRs which are further detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The terms &#x201c;extracellular&#x201d; and &#x201c;intracellular&#x201d; as used herein relate to the positions of parts or domains of a receptor inserted in the membrane of an intact cell. However, also in the absence of a cell or membrane, these terms may be used to designate the corresponding parts or domains.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The terms &#x201c;first group&#x201d; and &#x201c;second group&#x201d; as used herein refer to any groups, provided they are capable of binding to each other. It is preferred that said binding is non-covalent. This applies to various preferred embodiments further detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, said binding may be covalent. In this case, each compound to be assessed is part of a covalent construct comprising the receptor comprising said target domain, a group linked to said target domain, wherein said group in turn carries&#x2014;via a covalent link&#x2014;said compound to be assayed. In other words, the present invention also provides a method of identifying a compound capable of binding to a target domain of a G-protein coupled receptor comprising the steps of: (a) providing a receptor comprising said target domain and a group linked to said target domain, said group in turn being linked a compound; and (b) determining whether said compound binds to said target domain. The group linking target domain on the one side and compound on the other side may arise as a result of the formation of a covalent bond between a first and a second group. The ternary construct target domain&#x2014;group&#x2014;compound may be obtained by methods known in the art including the snap tag technology or the intein technology. In case of the snap tag technology said first group is an enzyme fused to said target domain, wherein the enzyme catalyses a reaction which leads to the formation of a covalent bond between the enzyme and said second group, which serves as a carrier group for said compound. The intein technology may in general be employed for ligating protein domains to each other in order to obtain constructs used in the screening method of the invention. Specifically it may be used, for example, for ligating a target domain to a first group and/or, in those cases where a covalent bond between first and second groups is desired, for ligating said first and second groups. It is understood that the intein technology is applicable where peptides or polypeptides are to be ligated. Both the snap tag method and the intein method are known in the art and described in, for example, Gronemeyer et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 16: 453-458 (2005) (as regards covalent labelling of fusion proteins including snap tag technology) and Muralidharan and Muir, Nature Methods 3: 429-438 (2006) (as regards protein ligation including intein-based methods).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">First groups are also referred to as recruiting groups, whereas second groups are also referred to as carrier groups.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The link between said receptor and said first group may be any link. In case the first group is of a peptide or polypeptide, said link may be direct in that it is a peptide bond. This applies to embodiments where the first group is another domain of the GPCR the target domain originates from or of a different GPCR, as well as to embodiments wherein the first group is peptidic tag such as dicystein, tetracystein or a His tag. In these case said receptor can be subsumed under the term fusion protein and its preparation may be accomplished by molecular biology techniques without any need to further modify the expressed recombinant fusion protein. Alternatively to covalent links, non-covalent links are also envisaged. Suitable non-covalent links may be selected from the non-covalent interaction pairs described below as preferred embodiments of first and second groups, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Similarly, the link between said second group and said compound may be any link. Preferably, the link is covalent as further detailed below. However, also non-covalent links are deliberately envisaged. Suitable non-covalent links may be selected from the non-covalent interaction pairs described below as preferred embodiments of first and second groups, respectively. Preferably the link between said second group and said compound is such that said compound, when linked to said second group is in the same or substantially the same conformation as in its free form, i.e. without said second group linked to it. Suitable linkers are further detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The binding of said compound to said target domain may be a binding to any conformational state of said target domain. In other words, it may lead to any conformational state of said target domain. GPCRs and accordingly the receptor used in the method of the invention occur in at least two distinct states, an activated and an inactive state. The activated state is capable of eliciting signal transduction. Recently Hoare et al. (Hoare, S. R. J.; Sullivan, S. K.; Pahuja, A.; Ling, N.; Crowe, P. D.; Grigoriadis, D. E. <i>Peptides </i>2003, 24, 1881-1897) have identified three different conformational states of CRFR<sub>1</sub>, as well as the nature of two of them: a state in which the receptor is uncoupled to G-protein (R state) and another one in which the receptor is coupled to G-proteins (RG state): The nature of the third state named R<sub>0 </sub>has also been detected in others B-GPCRs such as Parathyroid Hormone Receptor (PHTR) (see. Dean, T.; Linglart, A.; Mahon, M. J.; Bastepe, M.; J&#xfc;ppner, H.; Potts, J. T.; Gardella, T. J. <i>Mol. Endicronol. </i>2006, 20, 931-943). Some peptidic modulators of CRFR<sub>1 </sub>are partially selective in the binding to those CRFR<sub>1</sub>'s states.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Binding of said compound may or may not entail functional changes. In case it does, the binding may entail modulation of receptor function. Modulation may either be activation, in which case the method of the invention allows the identification of agonists or it may be de-activation, in which case the method of the invention allows the identification of antagonists. The precise nature of activation or de-activation processes depends on the read-out scheme used. Various read-out schemes are described in the prior art (cited below) and described further herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The binding of said compound to the target domain or the interaction between said compound and the target domain occurs subsequent to the binding of the first and second groups to each other. As a consequence of the interaction between the first and second groups, the local concentration of the compound is increased and weaker binding compounds may be identified which otherwise would escape detection. Concomitantly, the total free energy of binding of the test molecule is elevated as compared to the free energy or binding of the compound alone.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method of the present invention, instead of using conventional compound libraries, uses conjugates of high affinity binders (also referred to as second group or carrier group) with compounds of a library. This approach permits the detection of binding of compounds to the target domain which in the absence of the high affinity binder would not be possible. It exploits the two-domain model described for the signal transduction of peptidic ligands by class B1 GPCRs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>)<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the field of class B GPCRs, chimeric receptor-ligand pairs and direct binding experiments with truncated/isolated domains<sup>12 </sup>are consistent with a high-affinity interaction of the N-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor with the C-terminal, &#x3b1;-helical portion of the peptide ligand. This positions the N-terminal effector part of the peptide ligand in close proximity to the transmembrane J-domain, thereby inducing a structural rearrangement leading to G-protein activation. Chimeric receptors according to the invention permit to expand the two-domain model to non-class B GPCRs.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an illustrative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, peptide analogs derived from the high-affinity C-terminal domain of the native peptide ligands are linked to a library of fragments and these conjugates are used to probe receptor function in a high-throughput fashion. Thereby the effective concentration of the fragments is dramatically increased in the vicinity of the receptor J-domain, thereby allowing even very low-affinity interactions to be detected. After the identification of a few weakly binding fragments, analogs of these initial hits are prepared by classical medicinal chemistry to generate more potent low-molecular weight compounds that can be characterized by classical receptor assays wherein the low-molecular weight compounds are no longer linked to the peptide carrier (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). To the extent test molecules according to the invention comprise a fragment of a natural ligand, the method of the invention may also be referred to as biomimetic screening.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a preferred embodiment, said target domain comprises or consists of the transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain of said G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof. Fragments include functional fragments, i.e. fragments which are capable of eliciting signal transduction. Assays for signal transduction are well known in the art further detailed below. Also included are fragments which comprise or consist of the seven transmembrane helices including the intervening intra- and extracellular loops (see, for example, FIG. 3 in reference 2).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term &#x201c;analog&#x201d; as used herein in conjunction with peptides or polypeptides includes the replacement of one or more residues with non-naturally occurring amino acids as well as to constructs comprising protection groups. Non-naturally occurring amino acids include beta-alanine, alpha-amino butyric acid, gamma-amino butyric acid, alpha-amino isobutyric acid, norvaline, norleucine, epsilon-lysine, ornithine, homoserine and hydroxyproline. Up to 20% of the residues of the parent polypeptide may be replaced with non-naturally occurring amino acids, preferably up to 10%, 5% or 2%. Alternatively, more than 20% of the residues may be replaced. Also single replacement, which may correspond to less than 2% of the residues, are deliberately envisaged. The term &#x201c;analog&#x201d; also comprises peptidomimetics which are further detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;analog&#x201d; as used throughout the specification preferably relates to functional analogs. Functional analogs include analogs which are capable of binding the respective cognate binding partner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further preferred embodiment, said first group is linked to the extracellular part and/or the N-terminus of said transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain or a fragment or analog thereof. In case said first group is a peptide or polypeptide, it is preferred that said first group is fused, i.e. linked via a peptide bond, preferably via a main chain peptide bond, to said transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain or said fragment or analog thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably said first group comprises or consists of (i) the N-terminal domain of said G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof; (ii) the N-terminal domain of a different G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof; or (iii) avidin or biotin; a metal ion or chelator; a strep-tag or strep-tactin; glutathion or GST; tetracystein or diarsen. In case fragments of an N-terminal domain of a GPCR are to be used, the choice of the fragment boundaries may be done in conjunction with the choice of C-terminal part of a natural cognate ligand of said GPCR further detailed below, thereby ensuring that cognate first and second groups are provided which are capable of binding to each other. The receptor used as a vehicle for the screening method of the invention may comprise or consist of a fragment of a GPCR beginning with the N-terminal residue of said GPCR and ending with the last residue of the seventh transmembrane helix. In case the N-terminal domain of a different GPCR is used, said N-terminal domain may be fused to said transmembrane domain at any position in the sequence alignment where the sequences connecting the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane domain are aligned (see, for example, reference 2 as cited herein for multiple sequence alignments).</p>

Preferred length of fragments of said C-terminal part are between 5 and 40, more preferred between 10 and 30 or 10 and 20, most preferred between 10 and 12 residues. Preferably said fragments bind with a nanomolar binding constant to said N-terminal domain. Preferred binding constants are between 1 and 100 nM and include 5 nM as reported for the peptide described in Yamada et al.<sup>16 </sup>The peptide described in Yamada et al. is a preferred second group of the invention. This peptide is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>; see also SEQ. ID NO: 27. Of course, more affine fragments are also deliberately envisaged. Higher affinity between first and second groups permits the detection of compounds binding to the target domain with even lower affinity. The term analog is defined herein above. Peptidomimetics, which also fall under the term &#x201c;analog&#x201d; according to the invention include alpha-helix mimetics such as substituted poly-p-phenylenes (e.g. terphenyls), oligoamides (e.g. trispyridylamides, terephthalamides), and beta-peptides. These compound classes and their suitability as peptidomimetics have been review in, for example, Fletcher and Hamilton, Curr. Opin. Chemical Biol. 9: 632-638 (2005). Preferred are conformationally restrained peptidomimetics, e.g. cyclic compounds.

Exemplary sequences of natural ligands (SEQ ID NOs: 4 to 24) are shown in Example 3.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an alternative preferred embodiment of the main embodiment, said target domain comprises or consists of the extracellular or N-terminal domain of said G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof. In conjunction with this embodiment, said first group preferably comprises or consists of (i) the transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain of said G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof; or (ii) the transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain of a different G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof. More preferably, said second group comprises or consists of the N-terminal part of a natural cognate ligand of said G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof capable of binding and/or activating said transmembrane or juxtamembrane domain or fragment or analog thereof. Embodiments of the invention wherein the N-terminal domain of a GPCR is used as target domain for the screen are also referred to as &#x201c;reverse setup&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The reverse setup also includes embodiments, wherein the binding of first and second group does not occur prior to binding of the compound to the target domain. Instead, binding of first and second group may serve as a read-out to identify compounds binding to the target domain. In other words, the invention also provides a method of identifying a compound capable of binding to the N-terminal domain of a G-protein coupled receptor or a fragment or analog thereof comprising the steps of: (a) providing a receptor comprising said N-terminal domain or fragment or analog thereof and a first group linked thereto; (b) bringing into contact said receptor of (a) with a test molecule comprising a second group and said compound linked to each other, wherein said first group is capable to bind said second group; and (c) determining whether said compound binds to said target domain, wherein said determining is effected by determining binding of said first and second groups.</p>

Such compounds of lower molecular weight are also referred to as fragments. As stated above, fragments exhibit properties rendering them superior to larger molecules. These properties include: (i) Due to their small size, fragments provide a better coverage of the respective chemical space<sup>7</sup>; (ii) fragments have a higher probability to fit into a given binding pocket<sup>8</sup>; and (iii) fragments are likely to have a better binding energy/heavy atom ratio (ligand efficiency)<sup>9 </sup>thus making them better starting points for a drug development process.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another preferred embodiment, the method of the invention further comprises the step of (d) optimising the binding of said compound to said target domain, wherein said compound is devoid of said second group.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Methods for the optimization of the pharmacological properties of compounds identified in screens, generally referred to as lead compounds, are known in the art and comprise a method of modifying a compound identified as a lead compound to achieve: (i) improved affinity to the target domain, (ii) modified site of action, spectrum of activity, organ specificity, and/or (iii) improved potency, and/or (iv) decreased toxicity (improved therapeutic index), and/or (v) decreased side effects, and/or (vi) modified onset of therapeutic action, duration of effect, and/or (vii) modified pharmacokinetic parameters (resorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion), and/or (viii) modified physico-chemical parameters (solubility, hygroscopicity, color, taste, odor, stability, state), and/or (ix) improved general specificity, organ/tissue specificity, and/or (x) optimized application form and route.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The various steps recited above are generally known in the art. They include or rely on quantitative structure-action relationship (QSAR) analyses (Kubinyi, &#x201c;Hausch-Analysis and Related Approaches&#x201d;, VCH Verlag, Weinheim, 1992), combinatorial biochemistry, classical chemistry and others (see, for example, Holzgrabe and Bechtold, Deutsche Apotheker Zeitung 140(8), 813-823, 2000).</p>

For the purposes of this embodiment, the first group may be absent from the receptor, noting that the test molecule to be assayed consists of the compound only.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a preferred embodiment, said determining in step (c) or step (f) is effected by determining displacement of a labelled reference compound known to bind the target domain. Said reference compound, in those cases where both target domain and first group originate from the same GPCR, may be the natural ligand of the GPCR or an analog or fragment thereof. In case the receptor used in the screen is a chimeric receptor, for example a receptor comprising a transmembrane domain from one GPCR and an N-terminal domain from another GPCR, matching chimeric reference compounds may be prepared. Said chimeric reference compounds comprise or consist of a part capable of binding to the first group and a second part capable of binding to the target domain. Alternatively, the reference compound may bind only to the target domain and hot to the first group. N-terminal fragments of peptidic ligands of GPCRs or analogs thereof may be used in this case. Such fragments are known in the art and further detailed below. Furthermore, non-peptidic reference compound may be used. Examples include 3H-NBI35965 (Hoare, Mol. Pharmacol. (2003), 751-765) and 3H-SN003 (Zhang, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therapeut. (2003), 57-69), which are both suitable reference compounds in particular for CRFR1. Furthermore, natural ligands may be used as reference compounds.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively or additionally, said determining in step (c) or step (f) is effected by determining whether a conformational or functional change of said target domain occurs, said change being indicative of a compound binding to said target domain. A variety of assays directed to the monitoring of conformational and/or functional changes of GPCR-derived target domains is known in the art and described in, for example, Thomsen et al., Curr. Opin. Biotechnol., 16: 655-665 (2005); Greasley and Jansen, Drug Discovery Today: Technologies 2: 163-170 (2005); and Milligan, Drug Discovery Today 8: 579-585 (2003).

The presence of the C-terminal domain implies presence of the transmembrane domain. This embodiment is of particular relevance for those read-out schemes which involve parts of the signal transduction pathway triggered by an activated GPCR in its natural environment. A naturally occurring GPCR may also be used. Said naturally occurring GPCR, preferably a class B GPCR provides an N-terminal domain and a transmembrane domain as first group and target domain, respectively (or vice versa in the framework of the reverse setup described above) as well as a C-terminal domain which is capable of triggering signal transduction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">More preferably, said determining in said steps (c) and/or (f) is effected by determining (i) the formation of a secondary messenger; (ii) the displacement of a GTP analog; (iii) covalent modification of said receptor such as phosphorylation; or (iv) recruiting of an interaction partner of said receptor such as arrestin or a G-protein. The term &#x201c;displacement of a GTP analog&#x201d; refers to a read-out at the G-protein level. Receptor phosphorylation in known to occur in response to a change of receptor status, for example, activation of the receptor in response to binding of a compound. The term &#x201c;interaction partner of said receptor&#x201d; relates to molecules which bind a certain conformation (usually the active conformation) of the receptor and do not bind another conformation (usually the inactive conformation).

Methods/assays according to the invention where a secondary messenger is to be detected comprise the required components of the signal transduction pathway which are well known in the art.

Suitable origins of replication (ori) include, for example, the Col E1, the SV40 viral and the M 13 origins of replication.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The coding sequences inserted in the vector can e.g. be synthesized by standard methods, or isolated from natural sources. Ligation of the coding sequences to transcriptional regulatory elements and/or to other amino acid encoding sequences can be carried out using established methods. Transcriptional regulatory elements (parts of an expression cassette) ensuring expression in prokaryotes or eukaryotic cells are well known to those skilled in the art. These elements comprise regulatory sequences ensuring the initiation of the transcription (e.g., translation initiation codon, promoters, enhancers, and/or insulators), internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) (Owens, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 (2001), 1471-1476) and optionally poly-A signals ensuring termination of transcription and stabilization of the transcript. Additional regulatory elements may include transcriptional as well as translational enhancers, and/or naturally-associated or heterologous promoter regions. Preferably, the polynucleotide of the invention is operatively linked to such expression control sequences allowing expression in prokaryotes or eukaryotic cells. The vector may further comprise nucleotide sequences encoding secretion signals as further regulatory elements. Such sequences are well known to the person skilled in the art. Furthermore, depending on the expression system used, leader sequences capable of directing the expressed polypeptide to a cellular compartment may be added to the coding sequence of the polynucleotide of the invention. Such leader sequences are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Possible examples for regulatory elements ensuring the initiation of transcription comprise the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, SV40-promoter, RSV-promoter (Rous sarcome virus), the lacZ promoter, the gai10 promoter, human elongation factor 1&#x3b1;-promoter, CMV enhancer, CaM-kinase promoter, the <i>Autographa californica </i>multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) polyhedral promoter or the SV40-enhancer. For the expression in prokaryotes, a multitude of promoters including, for example, the tac-lac-promoter, the lacUV5 or the trp promoter, has been described. Examples for further regulatory elements in prokaryotes and eukaryotic cells comprise transcription termination signals, such as SV40-poly-A site or the tk-poly-A site or the SV40, lacZ and AcMNPV polyhedral polyadenylation signals, downstream of the polynucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, it is preferred that the vector of the invention comprises a selectable marker. Examples of selectable markers include neomycin, ampicillin, and hygromycine, kanamycine resistance and the like. Specifically-designed vectors allow the shuttling of DNA between different hosts, such as bacteria-fungal cells or bacteria-animal cells (e.g. the Gateway&#xae; system available at Invitrogen).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">An expression vector according to this invention is capable of directing the replication, and the expression, of the polynucleotide and encoded enzyme of this invention. Suitable expression vectors which comprise the described regulatory elements are known in the art such as Okayama-Berg cDNA expression vector pcDV1 (Pharmacia), pRc/CMV, pcDNA1, pcDNA3 (In-Vitrogene, as used, inter alia in the appended examples), pSPORT1 (GIBCO BRL) or pGEMHE (Promega), or prokaryotic expression vectors, such as lambda gt11, pJOE, the pBBR1-MCS&#x2014;series, pJB861, pBSMuL, pBC2, pUCPKS, pTACT1 or, preferably, the pET vector (Novagen).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The nucleic acid molecules of the invention as described herein above may be designed for direct introduction or for introduction via liposomes, phage vectors or viral vectors (e.g. adenoviral, retroviral) into the cell. Additionally, baculoviral systems or systems based on Vaccinia Virus or Semliki Forest Virus can be used as eukaryotic expression system for the nucleic acid molecules of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A typical mammalian expression vector contains the promoter element, which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA, the protein coding sequence, and signals required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Moreover, elements such as origin of replication, drug resistance gene, regulators (as part of an inducible promoter) may also be included. The lac promoter is a typical inducible promoter, useful for prokaryotic cells, which can be induced using the lactose analogue isopropylthiol-b-D-galactoside. (&#x201c;IPTG&#x201d;). For recombinant expression and secretion, the polynucleotide of interest may be ligated between e.g. the PelB leader signal, which directs the recombinant protein in the periplasm and the gene III in a phagemid called pHEN4 (described in Ghahroudi et al, 1997, FEBS Letters 414:521-526). Additional elements might include enhancers, Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription can be achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) from retroviruses, e.g., RSV, HTLVI, HIVI, and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular elements can also be used (e.g., the human actin promoter). Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include, for example, vectors such as pSVL and pMSG (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 37152), pSV2dhfr (ATCC 37146) and pBC12MI (ATCC 67109). Mammalian host cells that could be used include, human Hela, 293, H9 and Jurkat cells, mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV1, quail QC1-3 cells, mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Alternatively, the recombinant (poly)peptide can be expressed in stable cell lines that contain the gene construct integrated into a chromosome. The co-transfection with a selectable marker such as dhfr, gpt, neomycin, hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transfected cells. The transfected nucleic acid can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded (poly)peptide. The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful to develop cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy et al. 1991<i>, Biochem J. </i>227:277-279; Bebbington et al. 1992<i>, Bio/Technology </i>10:169-175).

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The following examples illustrate the invention but should not be construed as being limiting.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Screen for Small Organic Molecules (Fragments) Modulating the Human CRF<sub>1 </sub>Receptor</heading>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The 41aa neuropeptide Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF) is the principal stress-response regulator in humans. The corresponding CRF<sub>1 </sub>receptor has been validated as a prime target in behavioral disorders like anxiety and depression by transgenic mice, antisense approaches and small molecule intervention<sup>13</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Beyermann et al. have shown that linking of isolated N- and C-terminal domains of CRF analogs, each inactive alone, reconstitutes full CRF, agonism (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>)<sup>15</sup>. More recently, Yamada et al. have developed a 12 amino acid analog of astressin that binds to the CRF<sub>1 </sub>receptor with 5.5 nM affinity and is devoid of any detectable influence on the J-domain signaling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>)<sup>16,17</sup>. This peptide is coupled to commercially available fragments containing thiol or amine groups via established bioconjugation strategies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). A modified effector domain of urocortin<sub>1-19 </sub>is used as a positive control. Receptor activation by G protein-coupled cAMP production is used as read-out. Alternatively, fragments are tested for ligand-induced receptor internalization in a high-content screening, as recently shown for the CRF-antagonist astressin<sup>17</sup>. Enhancement of direct binding is assayed by competition with reporter peptides from CRF<sub>1 </sub>membrane preparations. Similarly, allosteric inhibition is assayed by displacement of small molecule antagonists<sup>18</sup>.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Screen for Peptides Modulating the Human CRF<sub>1 </sub>Receptor</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The synthesis of a library of CRF analogs is performed by tethering two peptidic fragments. These peptide-peptide conjugates are composed of a fixed C-terminal analog peptide with high affinity for the extracellular domain of CRFR and a variable N-terminal analog peptide designed to interact with the J-domain of the CRFR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The synthesis and coupling of short length peptides to form a full functional CRFR<sub>1 </sub>modulator has several advantages with respect to the classical synthesis of the whole peptide (e.g. less time consuming higher product yields and purities). These advantages are exploited for the synthesis of modulators in a high-throughput fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Conjugation Methodology.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The fragments are tethered by a one pot reaction of two functional groups compatible with most of the diverse functional groups present in peptides thus allowing the use of unprotected peptides. This can be achieved by &#x201c;click-chemistry&#x201d; reactions<sup>1 </sup>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Specifically, the 1,3-dipolar cycloadition of an azide and an alkyne that affords a triazol group under mild conditions is used.<sup>2 </sup>The solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of peptides containing a terminal alkyne group or an azide group and further &#x201c;click-chemistry&#x201d; reaction between the resulting fragments provides a library of peptide-peptide conjugates in a straightforward manner. Additionally, the introduction of an alkyne or azide group in a peptide is fully compatible with SPPS.<sup>3 </sup>Alternatively, in case that a native amide bond is required, the attachment of fragments is performed by the Staudinger ligation<sup>4</sup>, cysteine-free native chemical ligation<sup>5 </sup>or ketoacid-isoxazolidine peptide formation.<sup>6 </sup>1 a) Kolb, H.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Selection of peptidic fragments for tethering: Peptidic carrier. The C-terminal peptidic carrier is chosen from the high affinity antagonist peptides existing in the literature such as astressin (1a)<sup>6a </sup>or the 12 aa analog (2a)<sup>6b </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Previous papers have shown that the chain elongation of a non-natural antagonist such as astressin can provide a full agonist with increased potency respect to CRF.<sup>8d </sup>The connection between both fragments is made through a linker.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Selection of Peptidic Fragments for Tethering:</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">N-terminal peptidic effector. It is well known that residues 4-8 of CRF play an important role in the activation<sup>7 </sup>of CRFR.<sup>8d </sup>As initial N-terminal peptide the residues. 1-10 of h-CRF are used. This fragment is synthesized carrying a propargyl group appended to residue 10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>). Synthesis of the compound shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>is described in Example 6. Alternatively, the elongated or truncated of this N-terminal analog are used. These peptidic fragments serve as positive controls and as templates for the library design. 7 Rivier, J.; Spiess, J.; Vale, W. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>1983, 80, 4851-4855.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Evaluation of the Activities.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The peptide-peptide conjugates of the initial N-terminal peptide and the different peptidic carrier are tested in order to confirm that these non-natural analogs retain the agonistic properties of hCRF and to choose the most appropriate carrier for this work. This evaluation consists in competitive receptor binding assays and as agonist by cAMP production assay.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Library Design.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A library of N-terminal fragments appended to a propargyl group is made by single point substitution of any residue of the control peptide previously identified (see above). First, by alteration of the side chain: At least one of each type of amino acids is introduced at each position. Second, by backbone modification: a natural amino acid is substituted by a peptoid or the respective &#x3b2;-amino acid. The influence of the N-backbone hydrogen bonding is investigated by systematic N-methylation. Third, by derivatization of the N-terminus: A broad range of commercially available capping groups is appended to the terminal amino group. This increases the diversity of the library and reduces the peptidic character.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The propargyl group reacts with an azide to yield a triazol which is one of the preferred linkers of the invention; see the synthesis of compound 9 in Example 6 below.</p>
