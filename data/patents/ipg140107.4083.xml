No. 8,120,811, titled &#x201c;System and Method for Adding Data to a Printed Publication,&#x201d; which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/003,991, filed Nov. 21, 2007, titled &#x201c;Laser printing using ablation.&#x201d; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/275,085 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of printing, such as commercial printing. The disclosure more specifically relates to printing fixed and variable data by using a laser to ablate at least a portion of a layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current commercial printing technology generally employs planographic (e.g., offset, lithography, collatype, screenless), relief (e.g., letterpress and flexography), intaglio (e.g., gravure and steel die engraving), porous (e.g., screen printing and stencil), reprography (e.g., copying and duplicity) and digital (e.g., ink jets and toner) methods of print.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Commercial printing can include fixed data printing followed by variable data printing (VDP) employing an ink jet system. The fixed data printing can be performed using current commercial printing technology, such as high quality high speed four color printing press-based processes like web-offset. Today, variable data printing is often performed in the post-press process (e.g., after the fixed data is applied to a substrate) or as part of tasks related to personalization, mailing or delivery. The variable data printing can be used to print codes, messages, images and other data unique to an item or group of items printed. For example, the variable data may comprise codes that can include batch or serial numbers, addresses for recipients of the items, names, personalized messages, advertising, consumer specific coupons, etc. Traditionally, ink jet systems are most commonly used to print the variable data. The ink jet systems used for variable data printing are often slower than the higher-speeds of the fixed data printing systems, which thus requires the printed materials to be transferred &#x201c;off-line&#x201d; to a different variable printing line or the use of high cost equipment such as accumulators or buffers to process the materials &#x201c;in-line.&#x201d; Further, the manufacturer must continue to buy the ink long after purchasing the ink jet, resulting in an ongoing manufacturing expense. Yet further, the ink jet heads often become clogged and damaged, requiring labor and replacement costs. Additionally, the toxicity of some ink adds additional manufacturing complexity. Additionally, the ink jet systems have other drawbacks that may hinder performance of the overall printing process, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, a printing line can utilize an entirely plateless printing process and perform fixed and variable data printing in a single line. Such systems rely on ink jets, electrophotography, ion or electron charge deposition, etc. As discussed above, such systems have drawbacks.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One embodiment of the disclosure relates to a system for adding data to a publication printed on a substrate.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments described herein can provide an improved printing process for fixed and/or variable printing; provide a combination of a higher speed fixed and/or variable data printing process with a high speed, high quality fixed and/or variable data printing process; provide an efficient, high quality, high speed, high resolution fixed and/or variable printing apparatus and process; provide a non-ink based fixed and/or variable data printing process. Yet further, various embodiments can provide a fixed and/or variable data printing process that can be integrated into a high speed, four color printing press operation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Printing Overview</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Data, both variable and fixed, may be marked or otherwise printed on a substrate (e.g., a generally flexible substrate, a generally stiff substrate, a semi-rigid substrate, etc.) or printed material (e.g., a web, which may be continuous, sheets of paper, paper which may be coated or uncoated, a printed publication or other printed material, etc.) at any point during a commercial printing process, including on a printing and/or a finishing line. The substrate may be made from a variety of materials including, without limitation, paper, plastic, metal, laminate, or any combination thereof. Printed publications may include any printed media intended for distribution typically by mailing, to a wide audience, such as hundreds, thousands, or more. Examples of types of printed publications may include catalogs, magazines, bound and unbound advertisements, newspapers, direct marketing and mailing pieces, inserts, onserts, signatures or forms used to make any of the above, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In exemplary embodiments where the substrate is packaging, the packaging may generally be any material used to pack or label something, for example a box, carton, bag, tag, label, can, or bottle to package a product. In some exemplary embodiments, the packaging may be substantially non-flat, such as bottles, cans, or other materials having substantial sizes in three dimensions. The packaging may enclose or substantially enclose a product and may have opaque, transparent, and/or translucent portions. The packaging may have dimensions greater than about 0.02 inches in all three dimensions, greater than about 0.2 inches in all three dimensions, greater than about 2 inches in all three dimensions, any combination thereof, or other thicknesses. According to other exemplary embodiments, the packaging may be substantially flat, such as paper, cardboard, or plastic cards. In some exemplary embodiments, the packaging may be substantially flat at one step in a process and become substantially non-flat at a second step in a process (e.g., where cardboard is formed into a box), and printing may occur at either step of the process. For example, a plastic packaging may be applied to a package of meat, whereby the packaging becomes substantially non-flat due to the non-flat surfaces of the meat, and printing is applied to the plastic in its non-flat form. In various exemplary embodiments including substantially flat or non-flat packaging, the packaging may be composed of paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, wood, glass, fabric or fibrous material, foam, rubber, another material, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Packaging generally includes discrete primary, secondary, and/or tertiary packaging units. For purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;primary packaging&#x201d; may be a packaging unit that is in contact with the product, that first envelops and holds the product, or that is the smallest unit of distribution or use in the packaging. For purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;secondary packaging&#x201d; may be a packaging unit that is outside the primary packaging, that is in contact with the primary packaging, or that is used to group primary packaging together. For purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;tertiary packaging&#x201d; may be a packaging unit that is used for bulk handling, warehouse storage, or transport shipping (e.g., a palletized unit load that packs into containers) or that is in contact with the secondary packaging and/or the primary packaging. According to various exemplary embodiments, the packaging may substantially cover the product to be packaged.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to another exemplary embodiment, variable data may comprise information printed on product packaging representing product numbering, naming, expiration information, customization information, shipping or mailing information, or other information related to a product to be packaged.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;fixed data&#x201d; may be any common information added or printed to multiple printed materials that does not change for each printed material. This fixed data may include data that forms graphical or textual information. Under some circumstances, fixed data may also include machine readable indicia such as a barcode, a name, a location, a number, a graphic, text, advertisement, article, or any other information that may be commonly printed on multiple printed materials so long as meeting the meaning of fixed data.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;Variable data&#x201d; may comprise elements such as text, a graphic, image, data or information which may be changed from one print operation to the next or from one series of print operations to the next, or a combination thereof. Variable data may be received from a database, external file, memory, or other data source. In some embodiments, variable data may be changed without stopping or slowing down the printing process. The term variable data may be used to refer to data stored in a memory, to the indicia printed on the printed material based on the data stored in the memory, or to data represented in any other form. Variable data may be used to determine which of other variable data is to be printed on a substrate (e.g., demographic data may be used to determine which of different variable data advertisements to print) or variable data may represent the data that actually gets printed (e.g., the advertisement).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Variable data may include or be based on geographic, demographic, postal, personal, and/or book data or any combination of these types of information and other types of information not specifically identified here. Geographic information may include address data, regional data, state data, country data, language data, or other types of geographical or census data for each piece of printed material. Demographic data may include any data about the recipient or subscriber or class of recipients or subscribers of the printed media including personal data which may be used by a printing device configured to print personalized content on the printed media during a finishing operation as well as information based upon region, country, state, etc. Postal information may comprise any information useful to a postal delivery service or useful in taking advantage of the features offered by a postal delivery service including postal class data (e.g., as first class, second class, third class, standard, flat rate, and priority), private mailing services data (e.g., for FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc.), postal delivery information or sort information (e.g., carrier route number), zip code (e.g., 3 or 5 digit zip code data), sectional center facility (SCF) information, or any other geographic or postal rate data. Personal data may include age data, purchasing history data, buying habit data, income data, race or ethnicity data, sex data, religious data, hobby data, or any other data about a person or class of persons. Book data may include information about the book, magazine, catalog, signature, or other printed material being assembled including the title of the printed material, size data representing a size of at least one dimension of the printed media (e.g., a length to be trimmed, a length post-trim, lengths or widths, or locations/coordinates at which to set a knife or blade for trimming, etc.), page count, publisher, version, or any other information about the book, magazine, catalog, signature or other printed media being assembled. The variable data may be used, for example, to tailor advertisements or may also include billing information that may be provided on billing forms. In addition to using ablation to add information to a substrate or printed publication, information may also or alternatively be removed from a substrate or printed publication using ablation, for example to remove certain information in an advertisement which is not applicable to a particular recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one example, variable data may comprise a map, text, and/or graphics related to a retail store or stores or dealer in the vicinity of an address of a recipient of a printed publication. The map, text, and/or graphics may provide turn-by-turn directions, store address, store phone number, store hours, and/or other information relating to the retail store.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to another example, variable data may comprise machine-readable indicia (e.g., bar codes, etc.) representing certain data or other information, for example address data, universal product code (UPC) data, price data, or other data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to another example, variable data may be demographic or geographic data used in a printing system to determine which of a plurality of advertisements to print in a printed publication. For example, the printing system may select one of a plurality of advertisements associated with different income levels, gender, age ranges, or other demographic or geographic data and print the advertisements in the printed publication associated with the relevant demographic or geographic data.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another example, variable data may comprise information printed on a printed publication (e.g., in a header or footer or other location of a printed publication) representing an advertisement for a particular dealer or retail location based on a particular region to which the publication is being distributed or mailed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For purposes of this disclosure, a &#x201c;printing line&#x201d; may be any type of printing press application. For example, a printing line may include offset or gravure applications where at least one layer is applied via a printing blanket or plate or via a cylinder using one or more printing units (e.g., cyan, magenta, yellow, and black printing units), or alternatively a digital type press such as traditional or drop-on-demand ink jet technology presses.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For purposes of this disclosure a &#x201c;finishing line&#x201d; may be any in-line or off-line process performed on the printed material after the printing is applied (i.e., after the printing line). Such a process may include binding (e.g., with glue or another adhesive or binder), stitching (e.g., with wire or another stitching material), trimming, gathering, collating, varnishing, laminating, embossing, bronzing, die-stamping, folding, perforating, punching, round cornering, padding, tin-edging, addressing, mailing and/or sorting, slitting, or wrapping tasks or functions, or any combination thereof. It is noted that a printing line and finishing line may be combined in-line, at least in part, to perform both printing processes and finishing processes or they may be separate lines with the printed materials transferred from the printing line to the finishing line for further processing. In either an inline or offline finishing process a message, address, or other information that includes variable data may be included on blow-in material, bind-in material, stickers, onserts, inserts, tipons, or other printed materials.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to various exemplary embodiments including packaging, the packaging can be printed with fixed data for substantially all discrete packaging units in a print run, with variable data for substantially all packaging units, or any combination of fixed and variable data. Labels can be printed with information and then applied to the product or other product packaging.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ablation Overview</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to some exemplary embodiments, printing of data (e.g., text or graphics) may be accomplished using an energy source. An example of an energy source is a laser. Lasers may comprise, for example, a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser, a fiber laser, a laser diode, a laser diode array, a YAG laser or any other laser with a power, wavelength, and other laser parameters to ablate at least a portion of a layer covering at least a portion of a substrate or another layer (e.g., multiple layers may cover a substrate). The layers, as they relate to commercial printing, may include an ink, a varnish, a glue or other adhesive, a black dye, or any other layer that may be removed by laser ablation, or any combination thereof. The layers may include or be mixed with an additive to facilitate ablation. Such additives may include carbon black pigment, infrared (IR) or near infrared (NIR) absorbers such as copper hydroxylphosphate (CHP), copper hydroxide phosphate, tin oxide, and N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-Tetrakis(4-dibutylaminophenyl)-p-phenylene diaminium dehexafluoroantimonate, a conducting polymer such as Baytron P available from HC Starck of Newton, Mass., Iriodin LS820 available from Merck of Whitehouse Station, N.J., Pro-Jet 900NP available from Avecia of Cleveland, UK, or any other NIR absorber or other material that may facilitate laser ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Ablation can be used to remove at least one layer from a surface, but may be used to ablate multiple layers. Ablation may take place by erosion, melting, evaporation, vaporization, or other physical removal via irradiation by a laser. Using this method, the laser can be used to reveal the background and, for instance, generate text and/or graphics on the printed media. For example, when producing a printed material having a layer comprising a certain color of ink, a laser may be used to ablate portions of the colored ink to reveal text and/or graphics (e.g., a personal message, other variable data, fixed data, etc.) by exposing portions of the underlying ink (or other layer) or substrate. The laser ablation technique may be used to ablate materials from any color or type of ink or from only a certain color or type of ink. According to other exemplary embodiments, the laser ablation technique may be used to ablate non-ink material from a printed material (e.g., varnish, a laser or ink jet printed section, a coated section of a printed material, a non-printed portion of paper, etc.). In other embodiments, the laser may ablate at least a portion of a layer to expose an underlying layer having a sensual feature, such as smell. The laser also may be used to ablate at least a portion of a layer to cause a textured look or feel to occur on the printed product. In another embodiment, the laser may ablate a layer to expose a metallic ink, other layer, or substrate (e.g., a metallic or textured substrate). In still other embodiments, the laser may ablate a layer with a glossy appearance (e.g., a varnish) to expose text, graphics, or a surface that has a matte appearance, or vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Exemplary Lasers</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">One example of a suitable laser is a Videojet 3320 laser marking system commercially available from Videojet Technologies of Wood Dale, Ill.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Exemplary Printing and Finishing Speeds</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In commercial printing, the laser may be used to ablate at least a portion of a layer on a substrate moving along a printing line or finishing line at a predetermined speed that facilitates printing or finishing. According to various exemplary embodiments, printing speeds for web-offset, gravure type, digital presses, custom web printing (e.g., press and finishing or mailing on a single line) or other printing processes may include speeds more or less than about 8000 ft/min, more or less than about 4000 ft/min, more or less than about 3000 ft/min, more or less than about 1500 ft/min, more or less than about 1000 ft/min, more or less than about 500 ft/min, or more or less than about 250 ft/min. According to one various embodiments, printing speeds may include speeds greater than about 250 ft/min and less than about 8000 ft/min, greater than about 250 ft/min and less than about 4000 ft/min, greater than about 500 ft/min and less than about 4000 ft/min, greater than about 500 ft/min and less than about 3000 ft/min, greater than about 800 ft/min and less than about 3000 ft/min, greater than about 250 ft/min and less than about 1000 ft/min, greater than about 800 ft/min and less than about 3000 ft/min, greater than about 350 ft/min and less than about 500 ft/min, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The laser may also be used to ablate at least a portion of the layer(s) from a substrate or other printed material on a finishing line. According to various exemplary embodiments, materials may move through a finishing line (e.g., on a conveyor) at finishing conveyor speeds (which carry the printed materials such as signatures or other printed publications to be ablated) at speeds of more or less than about 800 pieces/min, more or less than about 700 pieces/min, more or less than about 600 pieces/min, more or less than about 450 pieces/min, more or less than about 250 pieces/min, more or less than about 200 pieces/min, etc. According to various exemplary embodiments, finishing conveyor speeds may be more than about 200 pieces/min and less than about 800 pieces/min, more than about 250 pieces/min and less than about 800 pieces/min, more than about 450 pieces/min and less than about 800 pieces/min, and so on. According to various exemplary embodiments, finishing conveyor speeds may be more than about 230 ft/min, more than about 290 ft/min, more than about 525 ft/min, more than about 700 ft/min, more than about 815 ft/min, and more than about 930 ft/min. According to various exemplary embodiments, finishing conveyor speeds may be more than about 230 ft/min and less than about 930 ft/min, more than about 290 ft/min and less than about 930 ft/min, more than about 525 ft/min and less than about 930 ft/min, etc. In some instances, pieces/minute can be used to roughly calculate the speed of the conveyor at feet/minute equal to about (#pieces per minute*14)/12.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The distance from the laser to the substrate may vary depending on the type of laser used, including for example its wavelength and power. According to one exemplary embodiment, the distance of a laser from the print medium may be less than about 15 inches. According to another exemplary embodiment, the distance of a laser from the print medium may be between about 1 inch and about 15 inches, depending on the type of lens used. According to other exemplary embodiments, the distance of a laser from the print medium may be less than 1 mm, greater than about 0.1 mm, between about 0.1 mm and about 15 inches, or between about 1 mm and 15 inches, depending on the type of lens and laser used. In this regard, one may achieve greater marking speeds by placing the laser at a further distance from the substrate due to less distance the laser will have to move to print a character and because of the increased size of the print window. As the distance between the laser and the substrate decreases, less variance in print may occur due to vibration of the laser or movement of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one embodiment, the laser source is remote from the paper medium and fiber optic cables are used to communicate the light from the laser source to the paper. Such an embodiment allows the laser source to be placed in a less harsh environment and allows for improved cooling of the laser source. According to another exemplary embodiment, the data may be printed using other energy types, for example, an electron beam, gamma beams, x-ray beams, thermal IR, far IR or any other energy or light type generally capable of ablating a layer of material or substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, the laser may achieve the desired marking speeds for commercial printing (either on the printing or finishing lines) by use of a system adapted to receive and output at least about 5 bytes or characters (e.g., about 40 bits) of data from a source of variable or fixed print data for printing every machine cycle. For purposes of this disclosure, a &#x201c;machine cycle&#x201d; may be the amount of time that it takes to print variable data on a single item of printed material via ablation as it moves along the line. According to other exemplary embodiments, the system may be adapted to output between about 5 and about 200 bytes or characters per cycle. According to various exemplary embodiments, the system may be configured to output more than or less than about 50 characters per printed publication, or more than or less than any of about 5, 10, 15, 50, 200, 500, or 1000 characters per printed publication. The laser may be configured for more than about 200 bytes or characters of data per cycle by using higher-speed data communication interfaces (e.g., Ethernet, Universal Serial Bus (USB), etc.), cache data source, less control data, use of multiple lasers, use of faster mirrors, such as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) for directing the laser beam, and other improvements in laser systems.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">To calculate the number of characters printed per minute by the laser via ablation, one multiplies the number of characters output by the system by the printing press or finishing speeds (e.g., between about 200 and about 700 books/min). For example, if 5 characters are output by the system per cycle at a finish speed of about 200-700 books/min, according to various embodiments, printing speeds on the finishing line may include speeds between about 1000 char/min and about 3500 char/min. According to other exemplary embodiments where about 200 characters are printed per cycle at a finish speed of about 200-700 books/min, printing speeds on the finishing line may include speeds between about 40,000 char/min and about 140,000 char/min.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to other exemplary embodiments where a laser with seven tubes and a printing capacity for two lines per tube is used, the system and laser may be adapted to print at about 820 ft/min. At twelve characters per inch and fourteen inch pin centers, the laser may print at about 288 characters per cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Variable and/or fixed data may be printed with a resolution or pixel size of more or less than about 75 dots per inch (dpi), about 100 dpi, about 200 dpi, about 300 dpi, about 600 dpi, about 720 dpi, about 1000 dpi, about 1500 dpi, about 2000 dpi, about 2500 dpi, about 3000 dpi, or about 5000 dpi. The data may be printed with a resolution of greater than about 300 dpi and less than about 600 dpi (e.g., when used on a finishing line), greater than about 600 dpi and less than about 720 dpi (e.g., when used on a press or printing line), greater than about 300 dpi and less than about 720 dpi, greater than about 75 dpi and less than about 1000 dpi, etc. These resolutions may be used at speeds described above or at least about 1000 ft/min (e.g., in a press or printing line configuration), at least about 500 ft/min or between about 350 and about 500 ft/min (e.g., on a finishing line), etc. The variable and/or fixed data may be printed with or without the use of traditional dot printing or halftone dots, and may be printed as a bitmap or rasterized image, using vector graphics, using fulltone printing, or other types of printing. The data may be printed in any case with a resolution as fine as the energy submitted by the energy source, such as a laser, or as fine as may be printed based on a dimension of the energy source (e.g., width, diameter, etc.) and/or its effect on the layer being ablated. For example, a laser may be used to ablate ink at a width of less than a picometer, nanometer, micrometer, or millimeter. Moreover, multiple passes of the laser can create a large range of widths of printed features or pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to other exemplary embodiments, the laser may be used to ablate at least a portion of a layer on a product or on packaging moving along a packaging line at a predetermined speed. According to some exemplary embodiments, the packaging may travel past the laser at a rate of at least about one foot per second. According to other exemplary embodiments, the packaging may travel past the laser at a rate of less than about ten feet per second.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Communication</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to various exemplary embodiments, the system may communicate with the laser and/or printing or finishing line via a wired or wireless connection. According to other exemplary embodiments, this communication may by facilitated over Ethernet, LAN, USB, Firewire, RD-232, or RS-485 connections or another type of serial, parallel, or optical communication protocol, such as a proprietary communication protocol. According to other exemplary embodiments, the communication may by facilitated over a WAN, WiFi, WiMax, Bluetooth, RF, cellular, or another wireless communication protocol. These communication protocols can be used between a source of variable or fixed data and the laser (e.g., at a wired or wireless interface), or between other components of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Location of Ablating Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The ablating apparatus, such as a laser, can be placed anywhere along a printing line or finishing line. Variable and/or fixed data may be printed to materials, such as, for example, a paper web or paper sheet, that already includes fixed data printed thereon or to materials prior to printing fixed data thereon. Examples of where the laser may be placed in a commercial printing operation include at the beginning, end or at any point along any of (1) a printing line (e.g., before or after application of at least one layer, before or after application of four layers of CYMK colors, etc.); (2) a binding line, including a saddle stitching or perfect binding line (a) either pre- or post binding or (b) pre- or post-delivery to the gathering chain or conveyor or (c) pre- or post-delivery to the pocket; (3) a pre- or post-trimming operation; (4) a pre- or post-wrapping operation; (5) a mailing table; or (6) a mailing or delivery line. In another embodiment, the print media may be printed with fixed or variable data after blending of materials for combined mailing, which may be printed on a wrapper, through a wrapper onto the printed material within the wrapper, on a label affixed to the wrapper, etc. In one embodiment, the underside or inside of the pages of the printing medium may be printed with fixed or variable data during a finishing process (e.g., binding, stitching, wrapping processes, etc.). According to an exemplary embodiment, fixed or variable data may be printed on the outside or exposed sheets of a printing medium.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Examples of where the laser may be placed in a packaging operation include at the beginning, end or at any point before or after a packaging feeder (e.g., primary packaging, secondary packaging, tertiary packaging, etc.), a product feeder, or any other point on a packaging line.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to one embodiment, printing fixed or variable data by ablating at least a portion of a layer with a laser may be done in lieu of conventional ink jet or laser jet or in combination with such equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to another exemplary embodiment, data may be printed by an ablating apparatus as described herein on a flat card (e.g., inserts, tear-outs, etc.) prior to, during, or after binding, stitching, blowing, or onsetting to a book, magazine, or other printed material. According to still another exemplary embodiment, data may be applied on a cover for a printed material before, during, or after a stitching or binding process.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to still another exemplary embodiment, a line may be configured to print both fixed and variable data. For example, the printing line may print fixed information (e.g., company name, product description or picture, etc.) on a substrate as well as variable data (e.g., customer name, customer address, amount, etc.) using the techniques of the present application. According to yet another exemplary embodiment, variable data may be printed using the apparatus described herein that applies the print based on pre-printed codes on the printing medium.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to yet another exemplary embodiment, the ablating apparatus may print variable data as bar codes. According to another exemplary embodiment, variable data may be printed as direct mailing/custom web or sorting information.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It is noted that if the wrong address is printed during finishing or if there is an ink splot or error on the printing plate of the web off set printing, a laser can be used to ablate out or correct the error. For web printing errors, this could save having to recreate a plate if the plate was created incorrectly or poorly.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A sealed-off CO<sub>2 </sub>laser (rated at about 30 Watts, 10.6 &#x3bc;m) was used to ablate variable data in the form of individual names to personalize printed publications. The laser ablated ink on each of the publications to print a different name (the variable data) over an image of an article of clothing printed (the fixed data) on each publication. The fixed data was printed with a web offset printing press. In one example, a name was printed on about 500,000 pieces. In another example, a name was printed on about 3 million pieces. In a third example, a name was printed on about 500,000 pieces in a curved or arced orientation. In each example, an advertisement within the printed publications was personalized in an effort to enable the recipients of the advertisements to see what the clothing would look like if ordered with their names.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the three examples, the publications were printed with the fixed data and sent to a saddle stitcher or other finishing line. At the saddle stitcher line, the ablation apparatus was positioned over a mail table. To be efficiently placed in the proper position, the ablation apparatus was mounted to a portable stand adapted to be set on the floor rather than the stitching machinery itself to reduce vibration and provide greater portability.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The laser was generally set with a marking intensity of about 80%, and more generally at a marking intensity of between about 70-90%. The laser was adapted to receive up to at least 80 bits of continuous variable data per bound piece. Accordingly, the laser apparatus was able to convert the received data up to at least 10 font characters, and ablate traditional off-set ink from a paper substrate to form variable print at a rate of approximately 250-450 pieces per minute with the average piece having about six characters printed thereon by the laser. The laser used an SHC 60 lens, and was positioned at approximately 190.5 mm (7.5 in.) from the printed publication. To obtain the desired font, the laser scribed each character twice on each of the printed publications as the printed publications passed by the ablation apparatus to ablate the desired amount of ink and reveal the variable data.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-16</figref>, a printed material is shown during ablation and after ablation during the third example described above. Prior to ablation, the unablated publication <b>800</b> (i.e., the back of a magazine) included a fixed data graphical image <b>802</b> of a sports jersey without a name printed on it. As the printed material moved on a conveyor <b>804</b> (from right to left) it passed under an ablation laser <b>806</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, as graphical image <b>802</b> of the jersey passed under ablation laser <b>806</b>, the laser began to remove a dark blue colored surface layer of the magazine to reveal a personalized name <b>808</b> (i.e., variable data) on the jersey in a substantially white color. Laser <b>806</b> moved in an arced path to ablate the name in a substantially arced shape. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the ablated magazine <b>810</b> included a graphical image <b>802</b> of a jersey with a personalized name <b>808</b> printed on it via removal of the top layer to reveal a different colored layer underneath. The ablated magazine <b>810</b> continued to move down the line to a finishing task (e.g., wrapping, bundling, mailing, additional ablating, etc.) while a new unablated magazine <b>800</b> passed under the ablation laser for personalization.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A laser printer or other energy source may be located at least about 1 inch from the substrate which is to be printed upon, at least about 3 inches, at least about 6 inches, or at least about 12 inches.</p>

Each print unit <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> includes an upper blanket cylinder <b>22</b>, an upper printing plate cylinder <b>24</b>, a lower blanket cylinder <b>26</b>, and a lower printing plate cylinder <b>28</b>. In the printing line <b>10</b>, colors <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> on units <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b> are typically black (K), cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y), respectively. However, it is noted that any colors of ink may be used for web-offset printing, and more or less than four print units may be used. The location of the printing units <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>20</b> relative to each other (e.g., the color ordering) may vary depending on user preference and/or the color scheme. In the illustrated embodiment, the printing press is a web offset press, however in other exemplary embodiments gravure, flexographic, digital presses, or other types of printing system may be used. Printing line <b>10</b> may also include an ablation apparatus <b>30</b> that is configured to ablate at least a portion of a layer printed on web <b>12</b>. Printing line <b>10</b> may also include one or more driers to dry the layer(s). An ablation apparatus can be placed before or after the driers to ablate either a solid or liquid layer. According to another exemplary embodiment, an ablation apparatus can be put before or after any of printing units <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and/or <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Depending on the layer or the substrate beneath the ablated layer, the print may be in color, metallic or in monochrome (e.g., black). In one particular embodiment, the variable and/or fixed data may be printed in a substantially white color by ablating non-white ink to reveal portions of a substantially white paper substrate. In another embodiment, ink may be ablated to reveal a metallic ink or other metal-containing substrate. In still other exemplary embodiments, the layer may be ablated to reveal a matte finish, a glossy finish, a texture, or a scent.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to one exemplary embodiment, a variable data printing (VDP) operation may include a distribution location. According to another exemplary embodiment, a VDP operation may include a delivery address. According to one exemplary embodiment, a VDP operation may include pricing information. According to other exemplary embodiments, a VDP operation may include advertisements (e.g., tailored to an individual reader or recipient or a group of readers or recipients), coupons, geographic location-based information, or any other variable information.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to one exemplary embodiment, a VDP operation may be applied directly to the surface of a printed publication. According to another exemplary embodiment, a VDP operation may apply variable data to an advertisement, for example the name on the back of an image of a jersey, or image of other clothing or clothing materials. According to other exemplary embodiments, a VDP operation may apply variable data to any item that may include variable information. According to another exemplary embodiment, a VDP operation may be applied to a label that may be affixed to a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Versioning</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to another embodiment, the system may be configured to print a plurality of versions of a printed publication. The versions may be for different geographic regions. For example, the versions may include a &#x201c;metro&#x201d; area version and a &#x201c;suburb&#x201d; area version, versions printed with different advertiser data to reflect local retailers, versions printed with different theater data to reflect local movies playing, etc. Alternatively, versions may represent any variable parameter that can be organized by variable data, such as, geographic, demographic, postal, personal, and/or book data.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to one exemplary embodiment, versions can represent different book titles, magazine titles or magazine publishers, for example, in the case where the ablation system is disposed on a printing line and/or other finishing line configured to produce two or more different titles at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The ablation techniques described herein may be used to print fixed data onto a web (or sheet) or variable data with only intermittent variation. For example, the laser may ablate the printed publications based on a first set of version data to substantially complete a first print run and then switch to ablating the printed publications based on a second set of version data to substantially complete a second print run. The techniques described herein can permit each print run to commence without having to stop the press run. In another example, the version data may be varied within a print run but not with each piece of printed material. This could be particularly useful when printing different versions of publications, which have runs of repeatable variable data together with fixed data. Using the ablative techniques described herein, the differences between versions can be printed by ablating at least a portion of the layers with a laser. This will reduce and may potentially eliminate the need for manufacturing different plates or engraving different cylinders that will be used to print each version of a publication, the make-ready time to change over the plates during a production run, and the labor, paper and energy waste associated with such make-ready and plate production. In such embodiments, the ablating apparatus can be located on either the printing line or a finishing line.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Saddle Stitching Line</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary finishing line <b>32</b> is generally configured to assemble signatures, books, blown cards, pamphlets, inserts, onserts, etc. into a finished printed material or publication and bind them with saddle stitching. Finishing line <b>32</b> may include at least one pocket <b>34</b>, a flat card feeder <b>36</b>, a printer feeder pocket <b>38</b>, a printer feeder <b>40</b>, at least one ablation printer <b>42</b>, at least one blow-in feeder <b>44</b>, a stitcher section <b>46</b>, a trimmer <b>48</b>, a stacker <b>50</b>, a wrapper <b>52</b>, and a mailing table <b>54</b>. Any of the above listed elements can be removed from finishing line <b>32</b> without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Finishing line <b>32</b> is preferably a post printing line or finishing line modified to include at least one ablation printer <b>42</b> (as described above). Line <b>32</b> can be utilized to bind, fold, batch, collate, gather, mail and/or distribute product. The elements of line <b>32</b> may be rearranged in any of a variety of configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Pockets <b>34</b> can be associated with fixed and/or variable data printing via laser ablation or can receive pre-printed sheets or pages that may be referred to as signatures or forms. Each signature is folded over a moving wire, chain, or bar (i.e., a saddle) and thus the printed material travels from pocket to pocket in finishing line <b>32</b> as it is assembled. At each pocket <b>34</b>, a page can be combined with other sheets (i.e., signatures) to form a pamphlet or book. The last pocket is typically a cover pocket <b>35</b> where the cover is placed over the other signatures of the printed material. Alternatively, line <b>32</b> can be configured to provide a single page product or a folder type product.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A flat card feeder <b>36</b> may insert a flat card into a pocket <b>12</b> for inclusion with the print medium. Flat card feeder <b>14</b> may include printed materials with fixed and/or variable data, for example printed by laser ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Printer feeder pocket <b>38</b> is generally configured to feed a signature to a pocket <b>34</b> via pocket feeder <b>40</b> (e.g., a conveyor). An ablation printer <b>42</b> (as described above) may be coupled to pocket feeder <b>40</b> to ablate a layer (e.g., ink, varnish, etc.) off of the signature substrate (e.g., paper) to print fixed and/or variable data (e.g., a graphical image, text, etc.) either on the top or outside face of the signature or on the under or interior side of the saddled signature.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It is noted that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may illustrate ablation printer <b>42</b> to be in specific positions, in other exemplary embodiments the ablation printer <b>42</b> may be at any position in a printing or finishing line <b>32</b> where variable data may be applied to a printed material. For example, ablation printer <b>42</b> may be placed before trimmer <b>48</b> in the finishing area (e.g., an area to staple, bind, cover, label, etc.) according to one exemplary embodiment. In other exemplary embodiments, ablation printer <b>42</b> may be mounted on trimmer <b>48</b>, in printer feeder pocket <b>38</b>, at a blow in feeder <b>44</b>, on a trimmed medium, at a flat card feeder <b>36</b>, near a stacker <b>50</b>, near a wrapper <b>52</b>, etc. In another exemplary embodiment, ablation printer <b>42</b> may be remote from a printing or finishing line <b>32</b>. In still another exemplary embodiment, ablation printer <b>42</b> may be portable and placed anywhere in a printing or finishing line <b>32</b> or external to a printing or finishing line <b>32</b>. Ablation printer <b>42</b> may be placed within a binder to print on the inside of a signature as it passes through line <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Blown card feeder <b>44</b> and an ablation printer <b>42</b> may be configured to print data (e.g., an advertisement) on a card that is forcefully blown (i.e., by air or another gas) into a stack of signatures. Ablation printer <b>42</b> may be configured to print variable data (e.g., customized advertisements, address information, etc.) to the card. Once variable data has been printed, the card may be blown into the printed material. It is noted that while blown card feeder <b>44</b> and an ablation printer <b>42</b> are illustrated as being before stitcher section <b>46</b> in printing line <b>32</b>, in other embodiments, blown card feeder <b>44</b> and ablation printer <b>42</b> may be placed at other points in printing line <b>32</b>, for example after stitcher <b>46</b> or in a finishing line after trimmer <b>48</b>, or may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Stitcher section <b>46</b> is typically configured to stitch the assembled and collated printed materials received at each pocket <b>34</b> and cover pocket <b>35</b>. According to various exemplary embodiments, stitcher section <b>46</b> may join the printed medium using a fastener (e.g., stitches, wire staples, etc.) or any other suitable technique.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Trimmer <b>48</b> is configured to trim to book to its desired trim size (e.g., 8&#xbd;&#x2033;&#xd7;11&#x2033;) and remove any excess material as received from stitcher <b>46</b>. Trimmer <b>48</b> may include one or more cutting apparatuses or be of any other design suitable for removal of excess material from the printed material.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Stacker <b>28</b> is configured to stack or gather printed materials from trimmer <b>48</b> in preparation for bundling or wrapping. Wrapper <b>52</b> then wraps or bundles the stacked printed materials for mailing or delivery. It is noted that a strapper may be present after stacker <b>50</b> and/or after wrapper <b>52</b> to strap stacks of printed material together, for example with a nylon strap or cord.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Binding Line</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary finishing line <b>56</b> is generally configured to assemble signatures, books, pamphlets, inserts, onserts, etc. into a finished printed material or publication and bind them with a &#x201c;perfect binding&#x201d; technique that binds the signatures together with adhesive. Finishing line <b>56</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to finishing line <b>32</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> except for the manner of travel down the line and that line <b>56</b> uses a binder <b>58</b> instead of stitcher section <b>46</b> to attach the pages and cover together. The elements of line <b>56</b> may be rearranged in any of a variety of configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The signatures are fed into pockets <b>34</b> by printer feeder pocket <b>38</b> via printer feeder <b>40</b> as before, however each signature is stacked on top of one another substantially flat on a conveyer line, chain, or gatherer instead of being saddled. The last pocket <b>34</b> does not receive the cover as it does in line <b>32</b>. A set of covers <b>60</b> are separately fed into binder <b>58</b> for binding to the signatures. The conveyor leading to binder <b>58</b> rotates and thus rotates the signatures into a generally vertical axis where they are clamped by binder <b>58</b>. The clamped signatures are rotated around a carousel and the end to be bound is dipped in an adhesive such as glue. At this point, the cover is pressed against the adhesive covered end to bind the printed material, which then travels along an extended drying line to allow the adhesive to dry. The printed material is then sent to trimmer <b>48</b> and the process continues as in finishing line <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It is noted that according to various exemplary embodiments, ablation printers <b>42</b> may be present in one or more of the same locations in finishing line <b>56</b> as in finishing line <b>32</b> including before or after binder <b>58</b> rather than before or after stitcher section <b>46</b>. Additionally, an ablation laser <b>42</b> may be located on the conveyor that leads covers <b>60</b> to binder <b>58</b> for ablation of fixed and/or variable data into the outside of the cover, for example with a book title or a personalized message.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Polywrap Line</p>

The finishing line is similar to the finishing lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> except that the stitcher or binder are omitted and the wrapper wraps the unbound or unstitched finished printed material. The wrapper is configured to wrap the signatures with a poly wrap (e.g., plastic) and/or a paper wrapping. The elements of the finishing line may be rearranged in any of a variety of configurations not illustrated in the figure. For example, the laser ablation printers illustrated in the figure may exist in other or additional locations on the line, for example between each pocket, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Mailing Line</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a mailing or co-mailing line <b>62</b> that may receive the finished printed materials from the finishing lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>3</b> is illustrated. Mailing line <b>62</b> is configured to combine the finished printed materials (e.g., pre-personalized books with variable data, books with only fixed data, etc.) described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, with other finished materials, for example to generate bundles of materials with like zip codes, carrier routes, recipient or destination addresses, or other postal information. Mailing line <b>62</b> includes one or more pockets <b>64</b>. Some of the pockets <b>64</b> may be coupled to stacks or bundles of similar finished materials (e.g., all of one book title) in a pocket feeder <b>66</b>. The finished materials may be bundled in postal code order. The elements of line <b>62</b> may be rearranged in any of a variety of configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The mailing lists associated with the different publications in pocket feeders <b>66</b> may be merged to create a master mailing list that includes the desired postal code mailing sequence of the finished materials. The master mailing list may be maintained in a controller <b>68</b>. Pocket feeders <b>66</b> are selectively actuated by controller <b>68</b> based on the master mailing list. Pocket feeders <b>66</b> selectively feed books onto a conveyor <b>70</b> in the desired postal code order.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">An ablation printer <b>72</b> downstream of pockets <b>64</b> also operates under the control of controller. Ablation printer <b>72</b> may print fixed or variable data (e.g., addresses, postal code, destination, another identifier, a personalized message, an advertisement, etc.) on the finished materials.
