<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a rapper device for cleaning heat exchange surfaces in a pressure vessel for transporting hot dust-laden gas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hot process gases can contain fouling components, such as fine dust and molten or evaporated components, which turn sticky when they cool and condense, thereby adhering to each other and to surfaces in contact with the gases. These fouling components can form harmful deposits, particularly on heat exchange surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such hot process gases can for example be synthetic gases synthesized by partial combustion processes, generally referred to as syngas. These gases are guided along heat exchanging surfaces in a pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fouling deposits from hot dust laden process gases can be removed by using a rapper device, such as the rapper device disclosed in British patent application GB 2 104 614 A. This prior art rapper device comprises an energy transmitting element having one end within a pressure vessel contacting the heat exchange surface to be cleaned, and one end outside the pressure vessel, which is repetitively knocked by an impact device. The impact energy of the knocking device is passed through the energy transmitting element to the heat exchange surface. The heat exchange surface and the deposits adhering thereto are accelerated differently by the transmitted impact energy as a result of different mass moments of inertia. As a result, the deposits fall off the heating surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pressure within the pressure vessel is much higher than the atmospheric environmental pressure outside the pressure vessel. For example, in coal pressure gasification plants the pressure in the heat exchange vessel can be as high as about 40 bar. Due to these differences in pressure, the energy transmitting element is forced towards the outside of the pressure vessel. In GB 2 104 614 A, a gas pressure equalizing device is used to overcome this force. Since the pressure on the one end of the energy transmitting element should be equal to the pressure exerted on the end abutting the heat exchange surface, the surface area of the energy transmitting element within the pressure chamber should be sufficiently high. Since in GB 2 104 614 A the wall of the pressure vessel is interrupted where it is passed by the energy transmitting element, a number of seals must be used to prevent leakage of synthetic gas, which is toxic and inflammable. These seals typically have short life cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,417 describes a method and apparatus for the percussive cleaning of objects disposed in a chamber that is under process pressure, wherein it is provided that for a more simple pressure balancing that at least during the acceleration of the striker, the two ends of the striker be maintained at the same pressure, which essentially corresponds to the pressure in the process chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a rapping method and device wherein leakage of synthetic gas from the pressure vessel is effectively reduced, while the pressure exerted on the energy transmitting element in the pressure vessel is balanced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention comprise a method and apparatus for cleaning a heat exchange surface in a pressure vessel by transmitting impact energy from a rapper device comprising a striker rod that has one end contacting the heat exchange surface in the pressure vessel and one end projecting out of the pressure vessel via a passage opening, wherein the rapper device comprises an impacting device for impacting the projecting end of the striker rod, and wherein a section of the striker rod is slideably supported in a pressure chamber adjacent the passage opening, and wherein the pressure chamber is connected to a sealing gas supply maintaining the pressure in the pressure chamber at a higher level than the pressure in the pressure vessel.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The pressure in the pressure chamber can, e.g., be maintained at about at least 10% higher than the pressure in the pressure vessel. While the pressure in the pressure vessel is typically about 40 bar, the pressure in the pressure chamber can for example be kept about 6-7 bar higher. With such overpressures, additional springs to bias the striker rod against the heat exchange surface are not required anymore.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Suitable gases are for instance inert gases, such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the invention comprises a rapper device for cleaning a heat exchange surface in a pressure vessel by transmitting impact energy. The rapper device comprises a striker rod and an impacting device for impacting the striker rod that has one end contacting the heat exchange surface in the pressure vessel and one end projecting out of the pressure vessel via a passage opening into a pressure chamber, which is connected to a gas pressure source. A bellows defines a gastight chamber around at least a part of the striker rod in the pressure chamber with a gastight connection to a wall section surrounding the passage opening. This way, a sealing gas can be supplied under an overpressure without contaminating the process gases with the used sealing gas. No sealing gas is consumed. Instead of a continuous flow of sealing gas, there is only a pressurized sealing gas chamber. This has the advantage that there is no risk of dew point corrosion and no pre-heating of the sealing gas is required anymore to prevent dew point corrosion. Also, the supply line can be small sized.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The bellows can for example be made of a foldable steel foil, aluminum foil or any other suitable heat and pressure resistant flexible material. The bellows may comprise a tubular corrugated concertina structure of adjustable axial length, the concertina structure having pleats with folds between axially adjacent pleats acting as hinges.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The striker rod can be provided with a flange positioned within the pressure vessel, while the bellows is connected to the flange in a gastight manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Optionally, the part of the striker rod within the bellows is slideably supported by a support member with one end connected to a wall section around the passage opening within the gastight chamber defined by the bellows.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To ensure a minimum distance between the support member and the flange on the striker rod, a spacer can be used. The spacer can for example be ring shaped, coaxially surrounding the striker rod. In case of low sealing gas pressure, the striker rod will be moved in the direction towards the outside of the pressure vessel. The spacer limits the movement and thus avoids damage of the expansion bellows.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Optionally, the passage opening is a central opening in a flange connected to the wall of the pressure vessel. This flange can for example be connected to a flanged bus branching off from the pressure vessel. The flanged bus can for example be connected to a flanged bus of a larger diameter connected to the wall of the pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention will be elucidated with reference to the drawing wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows in cross section a rapping device according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows in cross section a rapper device <b>1</b> for cleaning a heat exchange surface <b>2</b> in a pressure vessel <b>3</b> with a pressure vessel wall <b>4</b>. In the pressure vessel <b>3</b>, synthetic gas, synthesized, e.g., by partial combustion of oil or coal, is guided along the heat exchange surface <b>2</b>, e.g., of a heat exchange pipe, which is cooled by a flowing cooling medium, such as water. The rapper device <b>1</b> comprises an impact device <b>10</b> attached to a housing <b>11</b> on the wall of the pressure vessel <b>3</b>. The housing <b>11</b> comprises a first flanged bus <b>12</b> of a larger diameter branching off from the pressure vessel wall <b>4</b>. The bus <b>12</b> comprises a flange <b>13</b> connected to a flange <b>14</b> welded to a second flanged bus <b>15</b> of a smaller diameter having an end flange <b>16</b> which is connected to a top flange <b>17</b> defining a passage opening <b>18</b> for a striker rod <b>19</b>. In line with the passage opening <b>18</b> is a spacer <b>20</b> with openings <b>21</b>. The spacer <b>20</b> can for instance be cylindrical. The spacer <b>20</b> carries the impact device <b>10</b> having a knocker head <b>22</b> in line with the striker rod <b>19</b> and opposite a free end <b>23</b> of the striker rod <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an alternative embodiment, the rapper device according to the present invention can be built with a single flanged bus <b>12</b>, without flange <b>14</b> and bus <b>15</b> with flange <b>16</b>. Other configurations can also be used within the frame of the present invention, if so desired.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The free end <b>23</b> of the striker rod <b>19</b> is part of a section <b>24</b> passing the passage opening <b>18</b>. A second section <b>25</b> of the striker rod <b>19</b> has a larger diameter than the passage opening <b>18</b> and extends in the direction of the heat exchange surface <b>2</b>. Near the heat exchange surface <b>2</b>, the striker rod <b>19</b> is provided with a head <b>26</b> of an enlarged diameter. The head <b>26</b> can for example be connected to the second section <b>25</b> of the strike rod <b>19</b> by means of a screw thread connection. The head <b>26</b> engages an anvil plate <b>27</b> welded onto the heat exchange surface <b>2</b>. Due to the enlarged diameter of the head <b>26</b>, the contact surface between the head <b>26</b> and the anvil plate <b>27</b> is enlarged. The head <b>26</b> is made of a material of lower mechanical strength than the material used for section <b>25</b> and anvil plate <b>27</b>. As a result, the replaceable head <b>26</b> will deform more than the other parts during operation of the rapper device <b>1</b>. After a certain period of use, the deformed head <b>26</b> can be be exchanged for a new head <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A coaxial circular flange <b>28</b> is gastight connected to the second section <b>25</b> of the striker rod <b>19</b>. A tubular bellows <b>30</b>, which can, e.g., be made of a steel foil has a first end <b>31</b> connected to the perimeter of the circular flange <b>28</b>. The connection between the flange <b>28</b> and the first end <b>31</b> of the bellows <b>30</b> is gastight, e.g., a welded connection. The opposite second end <b>32</b> of the tubular bellows <b>31</b> is gastight connected to the top flange <b>17</b>, in an area surrounding the passage opening <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Within the bellows <b>30</b> is a cylindrical support member <b>33</b> coaxially arranged with the striker rod <b>19</b>. The cylindrical support member <b>33</b> has a first end <b>34</b> closed with an end wall <b>35</b> with a central opening <b>36</b> for the striker rod <b>19</b> which is slideably supported within the central opening <b>36</b>. The opposite second end <b>37</b> of the cylindrical support member <b>33</b> is gastight connected to the top flange <b>17</b> in the ring shaped area between the outer end <b>32</b> of the bellows <b>30</b> and the passage opening <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The bellows <b>30</b> defines a pressure chamber <b>38</b> in open connection to a sealing gas supply channel <b>39</b> which is operatively connected to a sealing gas supply <b>40</b>. The pressure chamber <b>38</b> encases a central section <b>41</b> of the striker rod <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Bus <b>12</b> and flange <b>13</b> preferably have a larger diameter than necessary to accommodate bellows <b>30</b>. Housing <b>11</b> is preferably assembled as follows. First, the axis of flange <b>13</b> relative to anvil plate <b>27</b> is measured. The hole in flange <b>14</b> is machined according to measurements to make sure that after assembly the axis of striker rod <b>19</b> is in the center of anvil plate <b>27</b>. Also, the distance from anvil plate <b>27</b> to flange <b>13</b> may vary depending upon manufacturing deviations of pressure vessel <b>4</b> and heat exchange surface <b>2</b> from one rapper device <b>1</b> to another. Therefore, the length of cylindrical bus <b>15</b> may not be constant from one rapper device to the other. However, it is advantageous to have a striker rod <b>19</b> of a constant length, because machining striker rods of differing lengths for multiple rapper devices is difficult and expensive. To solve this problem, the length of cylindrical bus <b>15</b> may be machined according to the measured distance from flange <b>13</b> to anvil plate <b>27</b>. Then, cylindrical bus <b>15</b> will be welded on flange <b>14</b> and the vertical, horizontal and radial orientation of rapper device <b>1</b> will be perfect.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, hot dust laden gas, e.g., syngas from a gasification reactor, passes through the space between the heat exchange surface <b>2</b> and the pressure vessel wall <b>4</b>. Fouling deposits are formed on the surface of the heat exchange wall <b>2</b>. To clean this wall <b>2</b>, the impact device <b>10</b> is actuated to knock with its knocker head <b>22</b> with a certain impact force onto the first section of the striker rod <b>19</b>. The striker rod <b>19</b> passes the impact via its enlarged head <b>26</b> and the anvil plate <b>27</b> to the heat exchange wall <b>2</b>. The shock load loosens the fouling which falls off of the wall <b>2</b>. Due to the impact forces, the striker rod <b>19</b> will become shorter after long time operation. The length of the striker rod <b>19</b> can be monitored via the openings <b>21</b>. If the striker rod <b>19</b> is not visible anymore via these openings <b>21</b>, the striker rod <b>19</b> needs to be replaced. Optionally, the opening <b>21</b> can be provided with a scale to monitor progress of the size reduction of striker rod <b>19</b> in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To prevent leakage of hot, inflammable and toxic syngas through the passage opening <b>18</b>, an inert sealing gas is blown into the pressure chamber <b>38</b> defined by the bellows <b>30</b>. The pressure within the pressure vessel <b>3</b> is substantial higher than atmospheric. As a result, a force is exerted on the striker rod <b>19</b> to push it out of the pressure vessel <b>3</b> via the passage opening <b>18</b>. Since the pressure within the pressure vessel can be as high as, for instance, 40 bar, the launching force on the striker rod can be very high. To overcome this force, the sealing gas is supplied to the pressure chamber under overpressure, to produce a counterforce on the striker rod <b>19</b> and the flange <b>28</b>. The overpressure can be such that the head <b>26</b> of the striker rod <b>19</b> is firmly pressed against the anvil plate <b>27</b> of the heat exchange wall <b>2</b>. The pressure in the pressure chamber <b>38</b> can, e.g., be about 6-7 bar higher than the pressure of about 40 bar in the pressure vessel <b>3</b>. The bellows <b>30</b> with its gastight connections to the flange <b>28</b> and the flange <b>17</b> prevents contamination of the syngas by the used sealing gas. Since the wall of the gastight chamber is defined by a bellows <b>30</b>, the striker rod <b>19</b> still has the required freedom of movement in its axial direction. When the pressure in the pressure chamber <b>38</b> drops, a spacer <b>42</b> maintains a distance between the flange <b>28</b> and the end wall <b>35</b> of the support member <b>30</b> to limit movement of the striker rod <b>19</b> in the direction towards the outside of the pressure vessel and to avoid damage of the bellows <b>30</b>.</p>
