<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of magnetic stripe cards and more particularly to an anti-skimming assembly and method for a magnetic stripe card reader device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The magnetic stripe of a magnetic stripe bankcard may read by a magnetic read head of a card reader, for example, of an automated teller machine (ATM) to enable the cardholder to perform an ATM transaction. The card reader captures the cardholder's account and related information recorded on the magnetic stripe, which may be sent to a host processor coupled to the ATM. The host processor may use such information to route the transaction to the cardholder's bank. An ATM keypad may let the cardholder enter a personal identification number (PIN) and information about the transaction which the cardholder wishes to perform.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, magnetic stripe card readers may be deployed to control access to areas, such as ATM lobbies or vestibules, that are provided with doors secured by electric locks. Such electric door locks may be unlocked, for example, by inserting or swiping a properly encoded magnetic stripe card at the card reader. Such deployments are referred to herein as &#x201c;access control card readers&#x201d; (ACCRs). If the proper credentials are encoded on the magnetic stripe, a signal may be sent to the electric door lock to unlock the door and admit the cardholder.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, huge economic losses have been incurred as a result of the theft and fraudulent use by criminals of cardholders' credentials recorded on the magnetic stripe of their bankcards. One way in which such theft occurs is a criminal practice referred to as &#x201c;skimming&#x201d; of bankcard information when a magnetic stripe bankcard is used by a cardholder, for example, in an otherwise legitimate transaction at an ATM or for access at an ACCR of an ATM vestibule or lobby.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A major problem of skimming involves criminals putting a device with a skimming read head, such as an overlay, over a card slot of an ATM or ACCR which reads the magnetic stripe as the cardholder unknowingly passes his or her bankcard through the card slot to be read by the internal read head of the ATM or ACCR. The skimming read head reads the same bankcard information that is read by the ATM or ACCR read head and records or sends the information to the criminals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Skimming overlays may also include a keypad overlay that matches up with buttons on the legitimate keypad beneath the overlay and records and sends the cardholders' PINs to the criminals. Regardless of the skimming technique used, it is important to criminal skimmers to make sure that the device at which their skimming activity occurs, such as an ATM or ACCR, continues to work normally so that cardholders are unaware that their bankcards are being illegally recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a present need for devices and methods that avoid exposing a cardholder's account information to potential theft by skimmers when the cardholder uses his or her magnetic stripe card at an ATM in a financial transaction or at an ACCR to access a locked premises, such as a bank branch or an ATM vestibule or lobby.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not as a limitation of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For example, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used in another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations that come within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a front perspective view of an example of a front panel <b>10</b> of an ACCR with anti-skimming displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> for embodiments of the invention mounted on the front panel <b>10</b>. It is to be understood that deployment of the anti-skimming displacement bar assembly for embodiments of the invention is not limited to ACCRs but may include deployment on any device that employs a magnetic stripe card reader device, such as an ATM.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be further understood that while two card entry openings <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be provided on the front plate <b>10</b> as a matter of convenience as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, embodiments of the invention are likewise not limited to deployment on a front panel of a device having any particular number of card entry openings but may include devices having only one card entry opening or any other number of card entry openings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, while the card entry openings <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a stacked, horizontal arrangement on the face plate <b>10</b>, it is to be understood that such arrangement is a matter of choice and that embodiments of the invention may be deployed on panels having card entry openings in a vertical arrangement or in any other arrangement on the front plate.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the anti-skimming displacement bar assembly for embodiments of the invention may employ one or more displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, each of which may be U-shaped and mountable on the front panel <b>10</b> of an ATM or ACCR. However, it is to be understood that the anti-skimming displacement bar for embodiments of the invention, such as displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, is not limited to having a U shape but may have any other suitable shape.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A consideration in determining a particular shape, such as the U shape, and a particular size, such as diameter of approximately three-sixteenths inch, of each anti-skimming displacement bar <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be that the particular size and shape that is selected is not remotely similar in appearance to any known skimming device which may by be likely to alarm customers and lead them to avoid ATMs or ACCRs on which the displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be deployed. Further, the U-shaped displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may not have an outward appearance to customers, for example, of containing any electronic components that might be capable of skimming.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A significant consideration in determining the particular shape and height of the displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> for embodiments of the invention may be that in order for a criminal to apply a skimmer head on the front plate <b>10</b> of the ATM or ACCR, it would be necessary for the criminal to design a skimmer overlay that somehow clears one or both of the displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. For example, if a criminal attempted to place a skimmer overlay on the front panel <b>10</b> of an ATM or ACCR with one or both of the displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> deployed, the presence of such a skimmer overlay would be obvious to a customer, since it would necessarily have a strange, out-of-place looking protrusion extending from the front plate <b>10</b> in the vicinity of each of card slots <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A key feature of embodiments of the invention is the particular location of the displacement bar <b>12</b> and/or <b>14</b> on the front panel <b>10</b> on an ATM or ACCR. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partially exploded perspective view of an example of the anti-skimming displacement bar assembly for embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partially exploded side elevational view of the anti-skimming displacement bar assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a displacement bar <b>12</b> may positioned on the front plate <b>10</b> with one of its two legs <b>22</b> directly aligned with a read head <b>23</b> of a card reader <b>20</b> inside a card entry opening <b>16</b> of the ATM or ACCR.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the displacement bar <b>12</b> may be mounted directly below and proximate an end <b>24</b> of the card entry opening <b>16</b> which is directly aligned with the read head <b>23</b> of the card reader <b>20</b> inside the card entry opening <b>16</b>. Thus, in order for a criminal to successfully mount an overlay skimming device on the front plate <b>10</b>, it would be necessary for the criminal to place the skimmer read head in the exact spot where the leg <b>22</b> of the displacement bar <b>12</b> is mounted. The particular location of the anti-skimming displacement bar <b>12</b> for embodiments of the invention on the front panel <b>10</b> makes that impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The alignment and placement of the displacement bar <b>12</b> with one of its legs <b>22</b> proximate the card entry opening <b>16</b> is critical in keeping that area free of anything, such as a skimming head, that might be placed on the front plate <b>10</b>. The reason such alignment and placement is critical is that when a cardholder inserts his or her magnetic stripe card into the card entry opening <b>16</b>, the magnetic stripe of the magnetic stripe card passes directly over that particular area on its way to the read head <b>23</b> of the ATM or ACCR card reader <b>20</b> inside the ATM or ACCR.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in embodiments of the invention the displacement bar <b>12</b> may be made of a physically strong, non-breakable (i.e., infrangible) material, such as metal (e.g., steel). Further, at least a portion of each leg <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> may define a cylinder, the inside walls of which are threaded to receive a correspondingly threaded shaft of a screw <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively. The leg <b>22</b> of the displacement bar <b>12</b> which is directly aligned with the read head <b>23</b> of the card reader <b>20</b> inside the card entry opening <b>16</b> of the front plate <b>10</b> of the ATM or ACCR may be attached to the front plate <b>10</b> by a screw <b>28</b> likewise made of a physically strong, non-breakable (i.e., infrangible) material, such as metal (e.g. steel), inserted through an opening in the front plate <b>10</b> and received in the internally threaded portion of the particular leg <b>22</b>. The other leg <b>26</b> of the displacement bar <b>12</b> may be attached to the front plate <b>10</b> by a screw <b>30</b> made of a frangible, non-conductive material, such as nylon, inserted through another opening in the front plate <b>10</b> and received in a correspondingly internally threaded portion of the other leg <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in addition, two leads <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> of an alarm cable circuit may be electrically connected to one another by passing the non-conducting screw <b>30</b> through the rings <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> of a ring terminal connector on the end of each of a pair of alarm cables <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> of the circuit. Further, a compression spring <b>44</b> may be provided between the two rings <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> of the ring terminal connectors of alarm cables <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> on the non-conducting screw <b>30</b>. In addition, a non-conducting spacer <b>39</b> of a material, such as plastic, may also be provided on the non-conducting screw between the ring <b>36</b> and the face plate <b>10</b>. As previously noted, for a criminal to successfully mount an overlay skimming device on the face plate <b>10</b> of the ATM or ACCR, it would be necessary to place the skimmer read head in the exact spot where the leg <b>22</b> of the displacement bar <b>12</b> that is fastened with the steel screw <b>28</b> is mounted. If order to do that, it would be necessary for the criminal to remove the displacement bar <b>12</b> by breaking or cutting both legs <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> of the displacement bar <b>12</b> and removing the displacement bar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the invention may utilize existing circuitry for monitoring the state of the displacement bar <b>12</b>. This may be done by tapping into an existing sensor circuit of the ATM or ACCR card reader, for example, that detects and reports a jammed or non-working condition of the ATM or ACCR to a remote terminal which may be monitored. Embodiments of the invention may add the alarm cable circuit which can be broken, for example, if non-conducting nylon screw <b>30</b> is broken and the two ring connectors <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and compression spring <b>44</b> on the non-conducting screw <b>30</b> become separated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If a criminal breaks or cuts the leg <b>22</b> of the displacement bar <b>12</b> that is fastened with the steel screw <b>28</b> to remove the displacement bar <b>12</b>, the nylon screw <b>30</b> will also consequently be snapped or broken. In order to assure that contact between the two ring connectors <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> is broken when the non-conducting nylon screw <b>30</b> is snapped or broken, the spring <b>44</b> is in a fully compressed state when the non-conducting screw <b>30</b> is received by and screwed tightly into the internally threaded opening in leg <b>22</b> of displacement bar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, a second displacement bar <b>14</b> proximate a second card entry opening <b>18</b> is illustrated in a mounting arrangement identical to the mounting arrangement of displacement bar <b>12</b> and with an identical compression spring <b>48</b>. However, the compression spring <b>48</b> is shown in the compressed state between two terminal connector rings <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> by a second non-conducting screw <b>54</b> likewise inserted through an opening in the front plate <b>10</b> and received in a correspondingly internally threaded portion of the a leg <b>56</b> of the second displacement bar <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, when the non-conducting screw <b>30</b> is broken, the compressed spring <b>44</b> forcefully urges the two ring connectors <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> apart from one another, and the force of the spring <b>44</b> may likewise urge at least one of the ring connectors <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> apart from the spring <b>44</b> itself to assure that the alarm circuit is broken. When the alarm circuit is broken, a circuit is opened which may cause the ATM or ACCR card reader to be reported as jammed or non-working to the remote terminal that is monitored by a technician.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Typically, in order for a criminal to apply an overlay skimming device it is necessary for the criminal to remove one or both of the displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Therefore, when an error signal is received regarding either or both card readers of an ACCR as being non-working, it may be assumed that a likely cause may be removal of either or both of the displacement bars <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> by a criminal skimmer. When that occurs, security personnel may be sent to the ATM or ACCR or alternatively, the particular ATM or ACCR may be shut down remotely from the backend.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an aspect of the invention, even if the terminal is not monitored remotely by a technician at the exact time that an error signal is received with regard to the ATM or ACCR, security personnel may determine from a time stamp the time at which the error signal was received within a certain period of time, such as a 12-hour period of time. Security personnel may then review video surveillance of the ATM or ACCR recorded within the 12-hour window to determine when the criminal skimmers were present at the ATM or ACCR site. Based on that determination, it may be possible to determine which bankcards were used while the criminal skimming was likely taking place and to take appropriate action with respect to those particular bankcards to prevent losses.</p>
