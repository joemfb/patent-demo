<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Definitions</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Trichome&#x201d; as used herein means an epidermal attachment of a varying shape, structure and/or function of a non-seed portion of a plant. In one example, a trichome is an outgrowth of the epidermis of a non-seed portion of a plant. The outgrowth may extend from an epidermal cell. In one embodiment, the outgrowth is a trichome fiber. The outgrowth may be a hairlike or bristlelike outgrowth from the epidermis of a plant.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Trichomes may protect the plant tissues present on a plant. Trichomes may for example protect leaves and stems from attack by other organisms, particularly insects or other foraging animals and/or they may regulate light and/or temperature and/or moisture. They may also produce glands in the forms of scales, different papills and, in roots, often they may function to absorb water and/or moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A trichome may be formed by one cell or many cells.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;individualized trichome&#x201d; as used herein means trichomes which have been artificially separated by a suitable method for individualizing trichomes from their host plant. In other words, individualized trichomes as used herein means that the trichomes become separated from a non-seed portion of a host plant by some non-naturally occurring action. In one example, individualized trichomes are artificially separated in a location that is sheltered from nature. Primarily, individualized trichomes will be fragments or entire trichomes with essentially no remnant of the host plant attached. However, individualized trichomes can also comprise a minor fraction of trichomes retaining a portion of the host plant still attached, as well as a minor fraction of trichomes in the form of a plurality of trichomes bound by their individual attachment to a common remnant of the host plant. Individualized trichomes may comprise a portion of a pulp or mass further comprising other materials. Other materials includes non-trichome-bearing fragments of the host plant.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one example of the present invention, the individualized trichomes may be classified to enrich the individualized trichomal content at the expense of mass not constituting individualized trichomes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Individualized trichomes may be converted into chemical derivatives including but not limited to cellulose derivatives, for example, regenerated cellulose such as rayon; cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and hydroxyethyl cellulose; cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate and cellulose butyrate; and nitrocellulose. Individualized trichomes may also be used in their physical form, usually fibrous, and herein referred to &#x201c;trichome fibers&#x201d;, as a component of fibrous structures.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Trichome fibers are different from seed hair fibers in that they are not attached to seed portions of a plant. For example, trichome fibers, unlike seed hair fibers, are not attached to a seed or a seed pod epidermis. Cotton, kapok, milkweed, and coconut coir are nonlimiting examples of seed hair fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, trichome fibers are different from nonwood bast and/or core fibers in that they are not attached to the bast, also known as phloem, or the core, also known as xylem portions of a nonwood dicotyledonous plant stem. Nonlimiting examples of plants which have been used to yield nonwood bast fibers and/or nonwood core fibers include kenaf, jute, flax, ramie and hemp.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further trichome fibers are different from monocotyledonous plant derived fibers such as those derived from cereal straws (wheat, rye, barley, oat, etc), stalks (corn, cotton, sorghum, <i>Hesperaloe funifera</i>, etc.), canes (bamboo, bagasse, etc.), grasses (esparto, lemon, sabai, switchgrass, etc), since such monocotyledonous plant derived fibers are not attached to an epidermis of a plant.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, trichome fibers are different from leaf fibers in that they do not originate from within the leaf structure. Sisal and abaca are sometimes liberated as leaf fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Finally, trichome fibers are different from wood pulp fibers since wood pulp fibers are not outgrowths from the epidermis of a plant; namely, a tree. Wood pulp fibers rather originate from the secondary xylem portion of the tree stem.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">&#x201c;Fiber&#x201d; as used herein means an elongate physical structure having an apparent length greatly exceeding its apparent diameter, i.e. a length to diameter ratio of at least about 10. Fibers having a non-circular cross-section and/or tubular shape are common; the &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; in this case may be considered to be the diameter of a circle having cross-sectional area equal to the cross-sectional area of the fiber. More specifically, as used herein, &#x201c;fiber&#x201d; refers to fibrous structure-making fibers. The present invention contemplates the use of a variety of fibrous structure-making fibers, such as, for example, natural fibers or synthetic fibers, or any other suitable fibers, and any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Natural fibrous structure-making fibers useful in the present invention include animal fibers, mineral fibers, other plant fibers (in addition to the trichomes of the present invention) and mixtures thereof. Animal fibers may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of: wool, silk and mixtures thereof. The other plant fibers may, for example, be derived from a plant selected from the group consisting of: wood, cotton, cotton linters, flax, sisal, abaca, hemp, hesperaloe, jute, bamboo, bagasse, kudzu, corn, sorghum, gourd, agave, loofah and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Wood fibers; often referred to as wood pulps include chemical pulps, such as kraft (sulfate) and sulfite pulps, as well as mechanical and semi-chemical pulps including, for example, groundwood, thermomechanical pulp, chemi-mechanical pulp (CMP), chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP), neutral semi-chemical sulfite pulp (NSCS). Chemical pulps, however, may be preferred since they impart a superior tactile sense of softness to tissue sheets made therefrom. Pulps derived from both deciduous trees (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;hardwood&#x201d;) and coniferous trees (hereinafter, also referred to as &#x201c;softwood&#x201d;) may be utilized. The hardwood and softwood fibers can be blended, or alternatively, can be deposited in layers to provide a stratified and/or layered web. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,300,981 and 3,994,771 are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of disclosing layering of hardwood and softwood fibers. Also applicable to the present invention are fibers derived from recycled paper, which may contain any or all of the above categories as well as other non-fibrous materials such as fillers and adhesives used to facilitate the original papermaking.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The wood pulp fibers may be short (typical of hardwood fibers) or long (typical of softwood fibers). Nonlimiting examples of short fibers include fibers derived from a fiber source selected from the group consisting of Acacia, Eucalyptus, Maple, Oak, Aspen, Birch, Cottonwood, Alder, Ash, Cherry, Elm, Hickory, Poplar, Gum, Walnut, Locust, Sycamore, Beech, Catalpa, Sassafras, Gmelina, Albizia, Anthocephalus, and Magnolia. Nonlimiting examples of long fibers include fibers derived from Pine, Spruce, Fir, Tamarack, Hemlock, Cypress, and Cedar. Softwood fibers derived from the kraft process and originating from more-northern climates may be preferred. These are often referred to as northern softwood kraft (NSK) pulps.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Synthetic fibers may be selected from the group consisting of: wet spun fibers, dry spun fibers, melt spun (including melt blown) fibers, synthetic pulp fibers and mixtures thereof. Synthetic fibers may, for example, be comprised of cellulose (often referred to as &#x201c;rayon&#x201d;); cellulose derivatives such as esters, ether, or nitrous derivatives; polyolefins (including polyethylene and polypropylene); polyesters (including polyethylene terephthalate); polyamides (often referred to as &#x201c;nylon&#x201d;); acrylics; non-cellulosic polymeric carbohydrates (such as starch, chitin and chitin derivatives such as chitosan); and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The web (fibrous structure) of the present invention may comprise fibers, films and/or foams that comprises a hydroxyl polymer and optionally a crosslinking system. Nonlimiting examples of suitable hydroxyl polymers include polyols, such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl alcohol derivatives, polyvinyl alcohol copolymers, starch, starch derivatives, chitosan, chitosan derivatives, cellulose derivatives such as cellulose ether and ester derivatives, gums, arabinans, galactans, proteins and various other polysaccharides and mixtures thereof. For example, a web of the present invention may comprise a continuous or substantially continuous fiber comprising a starch hydroxyl polymer and a polyvinyl alcohol hydroxyl polymer produced by dry spinning and/or solvent spinning (both unlike wet spinning into a coagulating bath) a composition comprising the starch hydroxyl polymer and the polyvinyl alcohol hydroxyl polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Fiber Length&#x201d;, &#x201c;Average Fiber Length&#x201d; and &#x201c;Weighted Average Fiber Length&#x201d;, are terms used interchangeably herein all intended to represent the &#x201c;Length Weighted Average Fiber Length&#x201d; as determined for example by means of a Kajaani FiberLab Fiber Analyzer commercially available from Metso Automation, Kajaani Finland. The instructions supplied with the unit detail the formula used to arrive at this average. The recommended method for measuring fiber length using this instrument is essentially the same as detailed by the manufacturer of the FiberLab in its operation manual. The recommended consistencies for charging to the FiberLab are somewhat lower than recommended by the manufacturer since this gives more reliable operation. Short fiber furnishes, as defined herein, should be diluted to 0.02-0.04% prior to charging to the instrument. Long fiber furnishes, as defined herein, should be diluted to 0.15%-0.30%. Alternatively, fiber length may be determined by sending the short fibers to a contract lab, such as Integrated Paper Services, Appleton, Wis.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Fibrous structures may be comprised of a combination of long fibers and short fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Nonlimiting examples of suitable long fibers for use in the present invention include fibers that exhibit an average fiber length of less than about 7 mm and/or less than about 5 mm and/or less than about 3 mm and/or less than about 2.5 mm and/or from about 1 mm to about 5 mm and/or from about 1.5 mm to about 3 mm and/or from about 1.8 mm to about 4 mm and/or from about 2 mm to about 3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Nonlimiting examples of suitable short fibers suitable for use in the present invention include fibers that exhibit an average fiber length of less than about 5 mm and/or less than about 3 mm and/or less than about 1.2 mm and/or less than about 1.0 mm and/or from about 0.4 mm to about 5 mm and/or from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm and/or from about 0.5 mm to about 1.2 min and/or from about 0.6 mm to about 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Trichomes used in the present invention may include trichome fibers. The trichome fibers may be characterized as either long fibers or short fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">&#x201c;Fibrous structure&#x201d; as used herein means a structure that comprises one or more fibers. Nonlimiting examples of processes for making fibrous structures include known wet-laid papermaking processes and air-laid papermaking processes. Such processes typically include steps of preparing a fiber composition in the form of a suspension in a medium, either wet, more specifically aqueous medium, or dry, more specifically gaseous, i.e. with air as medium. The aqueous medium used for wet-laid processes is oftentimes referred to as a fiber slurry. The fibrous suspension is then used to deposit a plurality of fibers onto a forming wire or belt such that an embryonic fibrous structure is formed, after which drying and/or bonding the fibers together results in a fibrous structure. Further processing the fibrous structure may be carried out such that a finished fibrous structure is formed. For example, in typical papermaking processes, the finished fibrous structure is the fibrous structure that is wound on the reel at the end of papermaking, and may subsequently be converted into a finished product, e.g. a sanitary tissue product.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">&#x201c;Sanitary tissue product&#x201d; comprises one or more finished fibrous structures, converted or not, that is useful as a wiping implement for post-urinary and post-bowel movement cleaning (toilet tissue), for otorhinolaryngological discharges (facial tissue), and multi-functional absorbent and cleaning uses (absorbent towels).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">&#x201c;Basis Weight&#x201d; as used herein is the weight per unit area of a sample reported in lbs/3000 ft<sup>2 </sup>or g/m<sup>2</sup>. Basis weight is measured by preparing one or more samples of a certain area (m<sup>2</sup>) and weighing the sample(s) of a fibrous structure according to the present invention and/or a sanitary tissue product comprising such fibrous structure on a top loading balance with a minimum resolution of 0.01 g. The balance is protected from air drafts and other disturbances using a draft shield. Weights are recorded when the readings on the balance become constant. The average weight (g) is calculated and the average area of the samples (m<sup>2</sup>) is measured. The basis weight (g/m<sup>2</sup>) is calculated by dividing the average weight (g) by the average area of the samples (m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">&#x201c;Dry Tensile Strength&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;Tensile Strength&#x201d; as used herein) of a fibrous structure of the present invention and/or a paper product comprising such fibrous structure is measured as follows. One (1) inch by five (5) inch (2.5 cm&#xd7;12.7 cm) strips of fibrous structure and/or paper product comprising such fibrous structure are provided. The strip is placed on an electronic tensile tester Model 1122 commercially available from Instron Corp., Canton, Mass. in a conditioned room at a temperature of 73&#xb0; F.&#xb1;4&#xb0; F. (about 28&#xb0; C.&#xb1;2.2&#xb0; C.) and a relative humidity of 50%&#xb1;10%. The crosshead speed of the tensile tester is 2.0 inches per minute (about 5.1 cm/minute) and the gauge length is 4.0 inches (about 10.2 cm). The Dry Tensile Strength can be measured in any direction by this method. The &#x201c;Total Dry Tensile Strength&#x201d; or &#x201c;TDT&#x201d; is the special case determined by the arithmetic total of MD and CD tensile strengths of the strips.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">&#x201c;Modulus&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tensile Modulus&#x201d; as used herein means the slope tangent to the load elongation curve taken at the point corresponding to 15 g/cm-width upon conducting a tensile measurement as specified in the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">&#x201c;Peak Load Stretch&#x201d; (or simply &#x201c;Stretch&#x201d;) as used herein is determined by the following formula:</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">&#x201c;Caliper&#x201d; as used herein means the macroscopic thickness of a sample. Caliper of a sample of fibrous structure according to the present invention is determined by cutting a sample of the fibrous structure such that it is larger in size than a load foot loading surface where the load foot loading surface has a circular surface area of about 3.14 in<sup>2 </sup>(20.3 cm<sup>2</sup>). The sample is confined between a horizontal flat surface and the load foot loading surface. The load foot loading surface applies a confining pressure to the sample of 15.5 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>(about 0.21 psi). The caliper is the resulting gap between the flat surface and the load foot loading surface. Such measurements can be obtained on a VIR Electronic Thickness Tester Model II available from Thwing-Albert Instrument Company, Philadelphia, Pa.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Processes for Individualizing Trichomes</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Trichomes may be obtained from suitable plant sources by any suitable method known in the art. Nonlimiting examples of suitable methods include the step of separating a trichome from an epidermis of a non-seed portion of a plant.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Non-limiting examples of the step of separating include mechanical and/or chemical process steps.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Nonlimiting examples of mechanical process steps include contacting an epidermis of a non-seed portion of a trichome-bearing plant with a device such that a trichome is separated from the epidermis. Nonlimiting examples of such devices for use in such a contacting step include a ball mill, a pin mill, a hammermill, a rotary knife cutter such as a &#x201c;Wiley Mill&#x201d; and/or a &#x201c;CoMil&#x201d; sold by Quadro Engineering of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one example, an epidermis of a non-seed portion of a trichome-bearing plant is subjected to a mill device that comprises a screen, in particular, a slotted screen, designed to better separate the trichome-bearing material from the plant epidermis. In one example, the slots will be about 3 mm wide and/or the slots will be wider than about 0.5 mm and/or wider than about 1 mm and/or wider than about 2 mm. In another example, the slots will be narrower than about 6 mm and/or narrower than about 5 mm and/or narrower than about 4 mm. The slots can be of indefinite length. In one example, the slots have a length at least about 5 mm long and/or at least about 10 mm long and/or at least about 15 mm long.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">After trichome-bearing material is subjected to the mechanical process to liberate them from the plant epidermis, it is preferred to enrich the pulp or fiber mass' content of individualized trichomes. This may be carried out by means of screening or air classifying equipment well known in the art. A suitable air classifier is the Hosokawa Alpine 50ATP, sold by Hosokawa Micron Powder Systems of Summit, N.J.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In one example, the pulp or fiber mass content of the individualized trichomes is subjected to one or more air classifying steps and then the pulp or fiber mass remaining after the air classifying step(s) is subjected to one or more screeners to further enrich the pulp or fiber mass' content of individualized trichomes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Trichome material, before or after dry liberation from the host plant, i.e. creation of individualized trichomes, may be further subjected to chemical treatment to improve hydrophilicity, e.g. it may be treated with a surfactant or a polymer with surface active agent properties such EO-PO polymers sold under the trade name &#x201c;PLURONIC&#x201d; by BASF of Florham Park, N.J., or an ethyloxated polyester such as &#x201c;Texcare 4060&#x201d; sold by Clariant Inc. (Americas Div) of Wilmington, Del. Water dispersions of trichomes may be further treated with antifoam compounds to reduce their tendency to retain air and thus float. An example compound is &#x201c;DC 2310&#x201d;, sold by Dow Corning of Midland, Mich. Additional treatments include extraction to remove certain hydrophobic components such as fatty acids. Such extraction may be done in aqueous, optionally hot aqueous, medium optionally containing surfactants to bind with and remove the hydrophobes. Non-aqueous or two phase systems may also be practiced, wherein the trichome hydrophobes are dissolved and/or dispersed in a non-water solvent and/or a non-water miscible solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Alternatively, the creation of individualized trichomes may employ wet processes practiced on the trichome bearing plant, optionally in combination with mechanical treatment. This includes processes analogous to the well known (in the wood pulp industry) groundwood, refiner-mechanical pulping, or thermo-mechanical pulping means, followed optionally by wet classification to enrich the individualized trichomes.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Wet processes also include chemical processes, nonlimiting examples of which include contacting an epidermis of a non-seed portion of a trichome-bearing plant with a chemical composition such that a trichome is separated from the epidermis. Suitable chemical process steps include the chemical process steps of the well-known (in the wood pulp industry) kraft, sulfite and/or soda processes, including chemi-mechanical variations.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one example, a trichome is separated from a trichome-bearing plant by a method comprising the steps of: a) drying the trichome-bearing plant; b) contacting the trichome-bearing plant with a device such that the trichome is separated from the trichome-bearing plant's non-seed epidermis; and c) classifying the trichome from the trichome-bearing plant's chaff; and d) optionally, combusting the trichome-bearing plant's chaff; and e) using energy obtained from the combusting step d) for drying additional trichome-bearing plants in step a).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In one example, the dried trichome-bearing plant resulting from step a) comprises less than about 10% by weight of moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Nonlimiting examples of suitable classifying equipment and/or processes include air classifiers and/or screen classifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Non-limiting examples of chemical processes for liberating trichomes from a trichome-bearing plant include the well-known kraft, or sulfite, or soda processes.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Fibrous Structures</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The fibrous structures of the present invention may comprise a trichome, especially a trichome fiber. In one example, a trichome fiber suitable for use in the fibrous structures of the present invention exhibit a fiber length of from about 100 &#x3bc;m to about 7000 &#x3bc;m and a width of from about 3 &#x3bc;m to about 30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In addition to a trichome, other fibers and/or other ingredients may also be present in the fibrous structures of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Fibrous structures according to this invention may contain from about 0.1% to about 100% and/or from about 0.5% to about 50% and/or from about 1% to about 40% and/or from about 2% to about 30% and/or from about 5% to about 25% trichomes.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Nonlimiting types of fibrous structures according to the present invention include conventionally felt-pressed fibrous structures; pattern densified fibrous structures; and high-bulk, uncompacted fibrous structures. The fibrous structures may be of a homogenous or multilayered (two or three or more layers) construction; and the sanitary tissue products made therefrom may be of a single-ply or multi-ply construction.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The fibrous structures and/or sanitary tissue products of the present invention may exhibit a basis weight of between about 10 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 120 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and/or from about 14 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 80 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and/or from about 20 g/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 60 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The structures and/or sanitary tissue products of the present invention may exhibit a total (i.e. sum of machine direction and cross machine direction) dry tensile strength of greater than about 59 g/cm (150 g/in) and/or from about 78 g/cm (200 g/in) to about 394 g/cm (1000 g/in) and/or from about 98 g/cm (250 g/in) to about 335 g/cm (850 g/in).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The fibrous structure and/or sanitary tissue products of the present invention may exhibit a density of less than about 0.60 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or less than about 0.30 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or less than about 0.20 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or less than about 0.10 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or less than about 0.07 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or less than about 0.05 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or from about 0.01 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 0.20 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>and/or from about 0.02 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 0.10 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The fibrous structures and/or sanitary tissue products of the present invention may exhibit a stretch at peak load (measured in direction of maximum stretch at peak load) of at least about 10% and/or at least about 15% and/or at least about 20% and/or from about 10% to about 70% and/or from about 10% to about 50% and/or from about 15% to about 40% and/or from about 20% to about 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one example, the fibrous structure of the present invention is a pattern densified fibrous structure characterized by having a relatively high-bulk region of relatively low fiber density and an array of densified regions of relatively high fiber density. The high-bulk field is characterized as a field of pillow regions. The densified zones are referred to as knuckle regions. The knuckle regions exhibit greater density than the pillow regions. The densified zones may be discretely spaced within the high-bulk field or may be interconnected, either fully or partially, within the high-bulk field. Typically, from about 8% to about 65% of the fibrous structure surface comprises densified knuckles, the knuckles may exhibit a relative density of at least 125% of the density of the high-bulk field. Processes for making pattern densified fibrous structures are well known in the art as exemplified in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,301,746, 3,974,025, 4,191,609 and 4,637,859.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The fibrous structures comprising a trichome in accordance with the present invention may be in the form of through-air-dried fibrous structures, differential density fibrous structures, differential basis weight fibrous structures, wet laid fibrous structures, air laid fibrous structures (examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,949,035 and 3,825,381), conventional dried fibrous structures, creped or uncreped fibrous structures, patterned-densified or non-patterned-densified fibrous structures, compacted or uncompacted fibrous structures, nonwoven fibrous structures comprising synthetic or multicomponent fibers, homogeneous or multilayered fibrous structures, double re-creped fibrous structures, foreshortened fibrous structures, co-form fibrous structures (examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,100,324) and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one example, the air laid fibrous structure is selected from the group consisting of thermal bonded air laid (TBAL) fibrous structures, latex bonded air laid (LBAL) fibrous structures and mixed bonded air laid (MBAL) fibrous structures.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The fibrous structures may exhibit a substantially uniform density or may exhibit differential density regions, in other words regions of high density compared to other regions within the patterned fibrous structure. Typically, when a fibrous structure is not pressed against a cylindrical dryer, such as a Yankee dryer, while the fibrous structure is still wet and supported by a through-air-drying fabric or by another fabric or when an air laid fibrous structure is not spot bonded, the fibrous structure typically exhibits a substantially uniform density.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition to a trichome, the fibrous structure may comprise other additives, such as wet strength additives, softening additives, solid additives (such as starch, clays), dry strength resins, wetting agents, lint resisting agents, absorbency-enhancing agents, immobilizing agents, especially in combination with emollient lotion compositions, antiviral agents including organic acids, antibacterial agents, polyol polyesters, antimigration agents, polyhydroxy plasticizers and mixtures thereof. Such other additives may be added to the fiber furnish, the embryonic fibrous web and/or the fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Such other additives may be present in the fibrous structure at any level based on the dry weight of the fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The other additives may be present in the fibrous structure at a level of from about 0.001 to about 50% and/or from about 0.001 to about 20% and/or from about 0.01 to about 5% and/or from about 0.03 to about 3% and/or from about 0.1 to about 1.0% by weight, on a dry fibrous structure basis.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The fibrous structures of the present invention may be subjected to any suitable post processing including, but not limited to, printing, embossing, calendaring, slitting, folding, combining with other fibrous structures, and the like.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Processes for Making Trichome-containing Fibrous Structures</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Any suitable process for making fibrous structures known in the art may be used to make trichome-containing fibrous structures of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In one example, the trichome-containing fibrous structures of the present invention are made by a wet laid fibrous structure making process.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In another example, the trichome-containing fibrous structures of the present invention are made by an air laid fibrous structure making process.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one example, a trichome-containing fibrous structure is made by the process comprising the steps of: a) preparing a fiber furnish (slurry) by mixing a trichome with water; b) depositing the fiber furnish on a foraminous forming surface to form an embryonic fibrous web; and c) drying the embryonic fibrous web.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one example, a fiber furnish comprising a trichome, such as a trichome fiber, is deposited onto a foraminuous forming surface via a headbox.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The following Example illustrates a nonlimiting example for the preparation of sanitary tissue product comprising a fibrous structure according to the present invention on a pilot-scale Fourdrinier fibrous structure making machine.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Individualized trichomes are first prepared from <i>Stachys byzantina </i>bloom stalks consisting of the dried stems, leaves, and pre-flowering buds, by passing dried <i>Stachys byzantina </i>plant matter through a knife cutter (Wiley mill, manufactured by the C. W. Brabender Co. located in South Hackensack, N.J.) equipped with an attrition screen having &#xbc;&#x2033; holes. Exiting the Wiley mill is a composite fluff constituting the individualized trichome fibers together with chunks of leaf and stem material. The individualized trichome fluff is then passed through an air classifier (Hosokawa Alpine 50ATP); the &#x201c;accepts&#x201d; or &#x201c;fine&#x201d; fraction from the classifier is greatly enriched in individualized trichomes while the &#x201c;rejects&#x201d; or &#x201c;coarse&#x201d; fraction is primarily chunks of stalks, and leaf elements with only a minor fraction of individualized trichomes. A squirrel cage speed of 9000 rpm, an air pressure resistance of 10-15 mbar, and a feed rate of about 10 g/min are used on the 50 ATP. The resulting individualized trichome material (fines) is mixed with a 10% aqueous dispersion of &#x201c;Texcare 4060&#x201d; to add about 10% by weight &#x201c;Texcare 4060&#x201d; by weight of the bone dry weight of the individualized trichomes followed by slurrying the &#x201c;Texcare&#x201d;-treated trichomes in water at 3% consistency using a conventional repulper. This slurry is passed through a stock pipe toward another stock pipe containing eucalyptus fiber slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The aqueous slurry of eucalyptus fibers is prepared at about 3% by weight using a conventional repulper. This slurry is also passed through a stock pipe toward the stock pipe containing the trichome fiber slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The 3% trichome slurry is combined with the 3% eucalyptus fiber slurry in a proportion which yields about 13.3% trichome fibers and 86.7% eucalyptus fibers. The stockpipe containing the combined trichome and eucalyptus fiber slurries is directed toward the headbox of a fourdrinier machine.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Separately, an aqueous slurry of NSK fibers of about 3% by weight is made up using a conventional repulper.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In order to impart temporary wet strength to the finished fibrous structure, a 1% dispersion of temporary wet strengthening additive (e.g., Parez&#xae; 750) is prepared and is added to the NSK fiber stock pipe at a rate sufficient to deliver 0.3% temporary wet strengthening additive based on the dry weight of the NSK fibers. The absorption of the temporary wet strengthening additive is enhanced by passing the treated slurry through an in-line mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The trichome and eucalyptus fiber slurry is diluted with white water at the inlet of a fan pump to a consistency of about 0.15% based on the total weight of the eucalyptus and trichome fiber slurry. The NSK fibers, likewise, are diluted with white water at the inlet of a fan pump to a consistency of about 0.15% based on the total weight of the NSK fiber slurry. The eucalyptus/trichome fiber slurry and the NSK fiber slurry are both directed to a layered headbox capable of maintaining the slurries as separate streams until they are deposited onto a forming fabric on the Fourdrinier.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">&#x201c;DC 2310&#x201d; antifoam is dripped into the wirepit to control foam to maintain whitewater levels of 10 ppm of antifoam.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The fibrous structure making machine has a layered headbox having a top chamber, a center chamber, and a bottom chamber. The eucalyptus/trichome combined fiber slurry is pumped through the top and bottom headbox chambers and, simultaneously, the NSK fiber slurry is pumped through the center headbox chamber and delivered in superposed relation onto the Fourdrinier wire to form thereon a three-layer embryonic web, of which about 70% is made up of the eucalyptus/trichome fibers and 30% is made up of the NSK fibers. Dewatering occurs through the Fourdrinier wire and is assisted by a deflector and vacuum boxes. The Fourdrinier wire is of a 5-shed, satin weave configuration having 87 machine-direction and 76 cross-machine-direction monofilaments per inch, respectively. The speed of the Fourdrinier wire is about 750 fpm (feet per minute).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The embryonic wet web is transferred from the Fourdrinier wire, at a fiber consistency of about 15% at the point of transfer, to a patterned drying fabric. The speed of the patterned drying fabric is the same as the speed of the Fourdrinier wire. The drying fabric is designed to yield a pattern densified tissue with discontinuous low-density deflected areas arranged within a continuous network of high density (knuckle) areas. This drying fabric is formed by casting an impervious resin surface onto a fiber mesh supporting fabric. The supporting fabric is a 45&#xd7;52 filament, dual layer mesh. The thickness of the resin cast is about 12 mils above the supporting fabric. A suitable process for making the patterned drying fabric is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,128,809.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Further de-watering is accomplished by vacuum assisted drainage until the web has a fiber consistency of about 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">While remaining in contact with the patterned drying fabric, the web is pre-dried by air blow-through pre-dryers to a fiber consistency of about 65% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">After the pre-dryers, the semi-dry web is transferred to the Yankee dryer and adhered to the surface of the Yankee dryer with a sprayed creping adhesive. The creping adhesive is an aqueous dispersion with the actives consisting of about 22% polyvinyl alcohol, about 11% CREPETROL A3025, and about 67% CREPETROL R6390. CREPETROL A3025 and CREPETROL R6390 are commercially available from Hercules Incorporated of Wilmington, Del. The creping adhesive is delivered to the Yankee surface at a rate of about 0.15% adhesive solids based on the dry weight of the web. The fiber consistency is increased to about 97% before the web is dry creped from the Yankee with a doctor blade.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The doctor blade has a bevel angle of about 25 degrees and is positioned with respect to the Yankee dryer to provide an impact angle of about 81 degrees. The Yankee dryer is operated at a temperature of about 350&#xb0; F. (177&#xb0; C.) and a speed of about 800 fpm. The fibrous structure is wound in a roll using a surface driven reel drum having a surface speed of about 656 feet per minute. The fibrous structure may be subsequently converted into a two-ply sanitary tissue product having a basis weight of about 50 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The sanitary tissue paper product is very soft and absorbent.</p>
