<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on and claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-172872 filed on Jul. 30, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a seat back device that is placed on a rear side of a vehicle cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Among seat back devices, there are seat back devices in which the angle of a cushion pad that supports the lumbar region of a passenger can be adjusted (e.g., see Japanese Examined Utility Model Application No. H4-50846). These seat back devices have the advantage that comfort is improved and passenger fatigue can be alleviated by adjusting the angle of the cushion pad.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, among seat back devices that are placed on a rear side of a vehicle cabin, there are seat back devices in which the vehicle cabin and a trunk room are made communicable by forwardly collapsing part of the seat back (a so-called trunk-through function). Seat back devices equipped with the trunk-through function have the advantage that luggage can be put into and taken out from between the vehicle cabin and the trunk room and long items of luggage can be accommodated in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Consequently, it is preferable for seat back devices that are placed on the rear side of the vehicle cabin to be equipped with both advantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In consideration of the above facts, it is an object of the present invention to provide a seat back device in which the angle of part of the seat back can be adjusted and in which the vehicle cabin and the trunk room can be communicated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first aspect of the present invention provides a seat back device including:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a seat back that is placed on a rear side of a vehicle cabin and has a movable portion that is movably disposed in correspondence to a lower back region of a seated passenger and a forwardly collapsible portion that is forwardly collapsibly disposed on a vehicle upper side of the movable portion;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a frame member that is disposed inside the seat back and in which is formed an open portion that has a size including the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion and that makes the vehicle cabin and a luggage compartment communicate;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">an angle adjusting mechanism which, as a result of being operated by the passenger, adjusts the movable portion about an axis along a vehicle width direction to a predetermined angle; and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a trunk-through mechanism which, as a result of being operated by the passenger, forwardly collapses the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion from the seat back and opens the open portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A second aspect of the present invention provides the seat back device according to the first aspect, wherein when the movable portion is accommodated in the seat back, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are made forwardly collapsible from the seat back, and when the movable portion is adjusted to the predetermined angle, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are made forwardly non-collapsible from the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A third aspect of the present invention provides the seat back device according to the first aspect or second aspect, wherein the trunk-through mechanism is equipped with</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">a base portion that is placed inside the open portion, is rotatably supported on the frame member, and to which the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are directly or indirectly secured and</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">a lock portion that is disposed on the base portion and which, by rotating, is made disengageable from a striker disposed on the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A fourth aspect of the present invention provides the seat back device according to the third aspect, wherein the angle adjusting mechanism is equipped with</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">a movable frame that is rotatably supported on the base portion and to which the movable portion is secured,</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">a rotating disc that is coupled to the movable frame, is rotated in conjunction with the rotation of the movable frame, and on whose outer peripheral portion is disposed a locking portion,</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">a ratchet that is disposed on the base portion and regulates the rotation of the rotating disc by meshing with the locking portion, and</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">a regulating portion that is coupled to the movable frame, makes the lock portion rotatable as a result of being placed outside a rotational trajectory of the lock portion when the movable frame is in an initial position, and makes the lock portion non-rotatable as a result of being placed on the rotational trajectory of the lock portion when the movable frame has been adjusted to a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the seat back device of the first aspect of the present invention, the seat back is placed on the rear side of the vehicle cabin, and the seat back has the movable portion that is movably disposed in correspondence to the lower back region of the seated passenger and the forwardly collapsible portion that is forwardly collapsibly disposed on the vehicle upper side of the movable portion. Further, the frame member is disposed inside the seat back, and the open portion that makes the vehicle cabin and the luggage compartment communicable is formed in the frame member. Further, the open portion has a size including the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion of the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Here, as a result of being operated by the passenger, the angle adjusting mechanism adjusts the movable portion of the seat back to a predetermined angle. Moreover, as a result of being operated by the passenger, the trunk-through mechanism forwardly collapses the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion of the seat back from the seat back, and the open portion in the frame member is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For this reason, in this seat back device, the angle of the movable portion of the seat back can be adjusted, and the vehicle cabin and the luggage compartment can be communicated. Because of this, passenger comfort can be ensured and long items of luggage can be accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the seat back device of the second aspect of the present invention, when the movable portion is accommodated in the seat back, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are made forwardly collapsible from the seat back, and when the movable portion has been adjusted to a predetermined angle, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are made forwardly non-collapsible from the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For this reason, when the movable portion is accommodated in the seat back, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion can be forwardly collapsed from the seta back. Because of this, when forwardly collapsing the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion, a situation where the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are not forwardly collapsed all the way as a result of the movable portion which has been adjusted to a predetermined angle becoming an obstacle can be prevented. Moreover, damage to the angle adjusting mechanism, when the seat back has been further forwardly collapsed in a state where the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are not forwardly collapsed all the way, can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the seat back device of the third aspect of the present invention, the base portion is placed in the open portion in the frame member and is rotatably supported on the frame member. Further, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion are directly or indirectly secured to the base portion. Moreover, the lock portion is disposed on the base portion, and the lock portion, by rotating, is made disengageable from the striker disposed on the seat back.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For this reason, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion of the seat back can be forwardly collapsed as a result of the lock portion rotating, the lock portion being disengaged from the striker, and the base portion being rotated. Because of this, parts that forwardly collapse the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion can be shared.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the seat back device of the fourth aspect of the present invention, the movable frame is rotatably supported on the base portion, and the movable portion is secured to the movable frame. Further, the rotating disc is coupled to the movable frame, and the rotating disc is rotated in conjunction with the rotation of the movable frame. Further, the locking portion is disposed on the outer peripheral portion of the rotating disc, and the ratchet engages with the locking portion, whereby the rotation of the rotating disc is regulated. Because of this, the rotation of the movable frame is regulated, and the angle of the movable portion of the seat back is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Here, the regulating portion is coupled to the movable frame, and the lock portion is made rotatable as a result of the regulating portion being placed outside the rotational trajectory of the lock portion when the movable frame is in the initial state. Further, the lock portion is made non-rotatable as a result of the regulating portion being placed on the rotational trajectory of the lock portion when the movable frame has been adjusted to a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For this reason, with a simple configuration that couples the regulating portion to the movable frame, when the movable portion is accommodated in the seat back, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion can be made forwardly collapsible from the seat back, and when the movable portion has been adjusted to a predetermined angle, the movable portion and the forwardly collapsible portion can be made forwardly non-collapsible from the seat back.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A plate-shape ratchet <b>136</b> that configures the angle adjusting mechanism <b>90</b> is placed on the lower side of the lock gear <b>120</b>. One end portion of the ratchet <b>136</b> is supported so as to be rotatable in the vehicle front-rear direction on the lower bracket <b>98</b>. A ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A is disposed on the other end portion of the ratchet <b>136</b>, and the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A is formed so as to be meshable with the first locking portion <b>124</b> and the second locking portion <b>126</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b>. Moreover, the ratchet <b>136</b> is biased by an unillustrated torsion spring in the direction in which the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A meshes with the first locking portion <b>124</b> and the second locking portion <b>126</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substantially cross-sectionally U-shaped upper bracket <b>138</b> that configures the angle adjusting mechanism <b>90</b> is placed on the front side of the movable frame <b>92</b>, and the upper bracket <b>138</b> opens toward the movable frame <b>92</b> and covers the movable frame <b>92</b>. The upper bracket <b>138</b> is coaxially supported along the vehicle width direction (vehicle left-right direction) on the support portion <b>56</b> and the support portion <b>58</b> and is made integrally rotatable with the movable frame <b>92</b> in the vehicle front-rear direction. For this reason, the movable pad <b>20</b> is secured to the movable frame <b>92</b> via the upper bracket <b>138</b> and is secured to the base portion <b>48</b> via the upper bracket <b>138</b> and the movable frame <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A long rod-like wire <b>140</b> serving as a regulating portion that configures the angle adjusting mechanism <b>90</b> is disposed on the upper portion of the upper bracket <b>138</b> on the front side of the upper bracket <b>138</b>, and the wire <b>140</b> is bent in a substantial U shape. Both lengthwise direction ends of the wire <b>140</b> are secured to the upper portion of the upper bracket <b>138</b>, and the wire <b>140</b> extends upward toward a middle portion <b>142</b> from both lengthwise direction ends of the wire <b>140</b>. Because of this, the wire <b>140</b> is coupled to the movable frame <b>92</b> via the upper bracket <b>138</b>. A bent portion <b>144</b> is disposed between one lengthwise direction end of the wire <b>140</b> and the middle portion <b>142</b>, and a bent portion <b>146</b> is disposed between the other lengthwise direction end of the wire <b>140</b> and the middle portion <b>142</b>. The bent portion <b>144</b> and the bent portion <b>146</b> are bent such that the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> is placed on the front side of the hook bracket <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Here, before the movable frame <b>92</b> is rotated, the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A is accommodated in the recessed portion <b>122</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b>. Further, the stopper pin <b>128</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b> is positioned in the one end of the long hole <b>132</b> in the cam <b>130</b> (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>; this state will be called an &#x201c;initial state&#x201d; below). Moreover, in this state, the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> is positioned on the upper side and the front side of the hook bracket <b>70</b> and is placed outside the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b> (the state indicated by the solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, when the movable frame <b>92</b> has been rotated toward the vehicle front side, the lock gear <b>120</b> is relatively rotated with respect to the cam <b>130</b> in the one direction about its axis (the direction of arrow G in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) via the link mechanism <b>106</b>, the link mechanism <b>112</b>, and the support shaft <b>102</b>. At this time, the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A meshes with the first locking portion <b>124</b>, and the rotation of the lock gear <b>120</b> is regulated.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When the movable frame <b>92</b> has been further rotated toward the vehicle front side, the lock gear <b>120</b> is relatively rotated with respect to the cam <b>130</b> in the one direction about its axis via the link mechanism <b>106</b>, the link mechanism <b>112</b>, and the support shaft <b>102</b>. At this time, the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A meshes with the second locking portion <b>126</b>, and the rotation of the lock gear <b>120</b> is regulated.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, when the movable frame <b>92</b> has been rotated to the first adjustment position and the second adjustment position, the upper bracket <b>138</b> is rotated in the vehicle front direction, whereby the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> secured to the upper bracket <b>138</b> is configured to be moved to the vehicle upper side of the hook bracket <b>70</b> and placed on the rotational trajectory of the upper bracket <b>70</b> (the state indicated by the double-dashed chain lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, the action of the present invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b> are accommodated in the back pad <b>18</b>, the movable frame <b>92</b> is placed in the initial state. In this state, the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> is positioned on the upper side and the front side of the hook bracket <b>70</b> and is placed outside the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b>. For this reason, the hook bracket <b>70</b> is made rotatable.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the case of using the trunk-through function, when the passenger pulls the strap <b>88</b> toward the vehicle upper side, the hook bracket <b>70</b> is rotated toward the disengaged position counter to the biasing force of the torsion spring <b>86</b> via the shaft <b>84</b>. When the hook bracket <b>70</b> is rotated toward the disengaged position, the recessed portion <b>76</b> and the recessed portion <b>78</b> of the hook bracket <b>70</b> become separated from the middle portion <b>42</b> of the striker <b>40</b>, and the hook bracket <b>70</b> becomes disengaged from the striker <b>40</b>. Because of this, the base portion <b>48</b> is made rotatable toward the vehicle front side.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In this state, when the strap <b>88</b> is pulled frontward, the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> is forwardly collapsed from the back pad <b>18</b> via the base portion <b>48</b>, and the movable pad <b>20</b> is forwardly collapsed from the back pad <b>18</b> via the base portion <b>48</b>, the movable frame <b>92</b>, and the upper bracket <b>138</b>. At this time, the movable pad <b>20</b> is in the initial state, so the front side surface of the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> becomes forwardly collapsible until it contacts the seat cushion <b>14</b> (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). Because of this, the communicating hole <b>34</b> in the frame <b>32</b> is opened, and the vehicle cabin and the trunk room are made communicable via the communicating hole <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">On the other hand, when the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are to be accommodated in the back pad <b>18</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b>, the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are stood up from their forwardly collapsed state. At this time, the base portion <b>48</b> is rotated toward the vehicle rear side, and the slanted portion <b>80</b> and the slanted portion <b>82</b> of the hook bracket <b>70</b> are brought into contact with the striker <b>40</b>. At this time, a rotational force in the direction counter to the biasing force of the torsion spring <b>86</b> acts on the slanted portion <b>80</b> and the slanted portion <b>82</b> from the striker <b>40</b>, and the hook bracket <b>70</b> is rotated toward the disengaged position. Moreover, the striker <b>40</b> slides on the slanted portion <b>80</b> and the slanted portion <b>82</b>, and when the striker <b>40</b> has reached the boundary portion between the slanted portion <b>80</b> and the recessed portion <b>76</b> and the boundary portion between the slanted portion <b>82</b> and the recessed portion <b>78</b>, the hook bracket <b>70</b> is rotated toward the engaged position by the biasing force of the torsion spring <b>86</b>, and the recessed portion <b>76</b> and the recessed portion <b>78</b> engage with the striker <b>40</b>. Because of this, the base portion <b>48</b> is secured to the frame <b>32</b> by the lock mechanism <b>60</b>, and the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are accommodated in the back pad <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, in the case of adjusting the angle of the movable pad <b>20</b> when the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are accommodated in the back pad <b>18</b>, the passenger pulls the straps <b>22</b> toward the vehicle front side. When the straps <b>22</b> are pulled toward the vehicle front side, the movable frame <b>92</b> is rotated toward the vehicle front side from the initial state via the movable pad <b>20</b> and the upper bracket <b>138</b>. When the movable frame <b>92</b> is rotated toward the vehicle front side, the support shaft <b>102</b> is rotated in the one direction about its axis (the direction of arrow H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) via the link mechanism <b>106</b> and the link mechanism <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At this time, the lock gear <b>120</b> is relatively rotated with respect to the cam <b>130</b> in the one direction about its axis, and the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A of the ratchet <b>136</b> meshes with the first locking portion <b>124</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b>. For this reason, the rotation of the lock gear <b>120</b> is regulated by the ratchet <b>136</b>, and the movable frame <b>92</b> is adjusted to the first adjustment position. Because of this, the movable pad <b>20</b> is adjusted to the first adjustment position (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the straps <b>22</b> are further pulled toward the vehicle front side, the movable frame <b>92</b> is rotated toward the vehicle front side, and the support shaft <b>102</b> is further rotated in the one direction about its axis (the direction of arrow H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) via the link mechanism <b>106</b> and the link mechanism <b>112</b>. At this time, the lock gear <b>120</b> is further relatively rotated with respect to the cam <b>130</b> in the one direction about its axis, and the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A of the ratchet <b>136</b> meshes with the second locking portion <b>126</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b>. For this reason, the rotation of the lock gear <b>120</b> is regulated by the ratchet <b>136</b>, and the movable frame <b>92</b> is adjusted to the second adjustment position. Because of this, the movable pad <b>20</b> is adjusted to the second adjustment position. In this state, the stopper pin <b>128</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b> is moved to the other end side of the long hole <b>132</b> in the cam <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">When the straps <b>22</b> are further pulled toward the vehicle front side after the movable pad <b>20</b> has been adjusted to the second adjustment position, the stopper pin <b>128</b> presses the other end of the long hole <b>132</b> because the stopper pin <b>128</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b> has been moved to the other end of the long hole <b>132</b> in the cam <b>130</b>, whereby the lock gear <b>120</b> and the cam <b>130</b> are integrally rotated in the one direction about their axes. At this time, the ratchet tooth <b>136</b>A slides on the cam-side slanted surface <b>134</b> and slides on the sliding surface <b>131</b> of the cam <b>130</b> (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). In this state, when the straps <b>22</b> are released, the lock gear <b>120</b> is relatively rotated in the other direction about its axis with respect to the cam <b>130</b> by the biasing force of the coil spring <b>118</b>, and the stopper pin <b>128</b> moves from the other end to the one end of the long hole <b>132</b>. For this reason, the cam-side locking surface <b>134</b> of the cam <b>130</b> becomes accommodated in the recessed portion <b>122</b> of the lock gear <b>120</b>. Because of this, the movable frame <b>92</b> is returned to the initial state.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Here, as a result of the passenger pullingly operating the straps <b>22</b>, the angle adjusting mechanism <b>90</b> adjusts the movable pad <b>20</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b> in the vehicle front direction to a predetermined angle. Moreover, as a result of the passenger pullingly operating the strap <b>88</b>, the trunk-through mechanism <b>30</b> forwardly collapses the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b> in the vehicle front direction from the rear seat back <b>16</b>, and the communicating hole <b>34</b> in the frame <b>32</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For this reason, in this seat back device, the angle of the movable pad <b>20</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b> can be adjusted, and the vehicle cabin and the trunk room can be communicated. Because of this, passenger comfort can be ensured and long items of luggage can be accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, when the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are accommodated in the rear seat back <b>16</b> (placed in the initial state), the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> is positioned on the upper side and the front side of the hook bracket <b>70</b> and is placed outside the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b>. For this reason, the hook bracket <b>70</b> is made rotatable, the hook bracket <b>70</b> becomes disengageable from the middle portion <b>42</b> of the striker <b>40</b>, and the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are made forwardly collapsible from the rear seat back <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">On the other hand, when the movable pad <b>20</b> has been adjusted to the first adjustment position and the second adjustment position, the upper bracket <b>138</b> is rotated in the vehicle front direction, whereby the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> secured to the upper bracket <b>138</b> is rotated toward the hook bracket <b>70</b>. At this time, the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> moves on the upper side of the upper bracket <b>70</b> and is placed on the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b>. In this state, when the strap <b>88</b> is pulled toward the vehicle front side, the hook bracket <b>70</b> interferes with the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> and the hook bracket <b>70</b> is not rotated because the middle portion <b>142</b> of the wire <b>140</b> is positioned on the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b>. Because of this, when the movable pad <b>20</b> has been adjusted to the first adjustment position and the second adjustment position, the hook bracket <b>70</b> becomes non-disengageable from the middle portion <b>42</b> of the striker <b>40</b>, and the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> cannot be forwardly collapsed from the rear seat back <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For this reason, the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> can be forwardly collapsed from the rear seat back <b>16</b> only when the movable pad <b>20</b> is accommodated in the rear seat back <b>16</b> (only when the movable frame <b>92</b> is in the initial state).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Consequently, when forwardly collapsing the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible <b>24</b>, the movable pad <b>20</b> is invariably accommodated in the back pad <b>18</b>. Because of this, a situation where the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are not forwardly collapsed all the way as a result of the movable pad <b>20</b> which has been adjusted to a predetermined angle becoming an obstacle to the forwardly collapsing operation of the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Moreover, if the rear seat back <b>16</b> were to be forwardly collapsed in a state where the movable pad <b>20</b> which has been adjusted to a predetermined angle becomes an obstacle and the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are not forwardly collapsed all the way, there is the potential for an excessive load to act on the angle adjusting mechanism <b>90</b> and for the angle adjusting mechanism <b>90</b> to be damaged. However, the movable pad <b>20</b> is accommodated in the back pad <b>18</b>, so a situation where an excessive load acts on the movable pad <b>20</b> can be suppressed, and damage to the movable pad <b>20</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, the movable pad <b>20</b> is secured to the base portion <b>48</b> via the upper bracket <b>138</b> and the movable frame <b>92</b>, and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> is secured to the base portion <b>48</b>. When using the trunk-through function, the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> are forwardly collapsed as a result of the base portion <b>48</b> rotating. Because of this, parts that forwardly collapse the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> can be shared.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Moreover, the wire <b>140</b> is coupled to the upper bracket <b>138</b>, and when the movable frame <b>92</b> is in the initial state, the wire <b>140</b> is placed outside the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b>, whereby the hook bracket <b>70</b> is made rotatable. Further, when the movable frame <b>92</b> has been adjusted to a predetermined angle, the wire <b>140</b> is placed on the rotational trajectory of the hook bracket <b>70</b>, whereby the hook bracket <b>70</b> is made non-rotatable. Because of this, with a simple configuration, when the movable pad <b>20</b> is accommodated in the rear seat back <b>16</b>, the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> can be made forwardly collapsible from the rear seat back <b>16</b>, and when the movable pad <b>20</b> has been adjusted to a predetermined angle, the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> can be made forwardly non-collapsible from the rear seat back <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the present embodiment, the seat back device <b>10</b> has been given a configuration where the movable pad <b>20</b> and the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b> are forwardly collapsed in the case of using the trunk-through function. Instead of this, the seat back device <b>10</b> may also be given a configuration where the back pad <b>18</b>, the forwardly collapsible pad <b>24</b>, and the movable pad <b>20</b> of the rear seat back <b>16</b> are forwardly collapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, in the present embodiment, the hook bracket <b>70</b> is made disengageable from the middle portion <b>42</b> of the striker <b>40</b> as a result of the hook bracket <b>70</b> being rotated. Instead of this, the seat back device <b>10</b> may also be given a configuration where the hook bracket <b>70</b> is made disengageable from the middle portion <b>42</b> of the striker <b>40</b> as a result of the hook bracket <b>70</b> being linearly moved.</p>
